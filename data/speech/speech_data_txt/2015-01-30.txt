MEASURES CONSIDERED BY THE SENATE  
Mr. M CCONNELL. Madam President, 
the Senate’s passage of the Keystone jobs bill is great news for the American people. The Senate will soon turn its attention to a few different matters. 
First, we will be voting on a bipar-
tisan measure that has been cham-pioned by the Chairs of the Veterans’ Affairs and Armed Services Commit-tees. 
We lose thousands of our heroes 
every year to suicide. It is a tragic sit-uation. Senators M
CCAINand I SAKSON  
are leading efforts to do something about it. Their legislation would pro-vide more of the mental health and sui-cide prevention support our Veterans deserve. The measure already passed unanimously through the House of Representatives. Now we hope for a bi-partisan outcome on the Senate floor. 
The same should also be said of a sec-
ond piece of legislation we will con-sider. It is a debate that will challenge our colleagues on the other side with a simple proposition. Do they think Presidents of either party should have the power to simply ignore laws they don’t like? Will our Democratic col-leagues work with us to defend key democratic ideals such as the separa-tion of powers and the rule of law or will they stand tall with the idea that partisan exercises of raw power are good things? 
The House-passed bill we will con-
sider would do two things. It would fund the Department of Homeland Se-curity and rein in Executive overreach.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S668 January 30, 2015 
That is it. It is simple, and there is no 
reason for Democrats to block it. 
Madam President, I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, we 
are told that next week we can expect the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill, which fully funds the Department of Homeland Security and includes the law enforcement pri-orities that were agreed to on a bipar-tisan basis in the House—and I think will be approved on a bipartisan basis in the Senate, hammered out in the Senate Appropriations Committee— will be coming to the Senate. 
The House of Representatives has 
therefore voted to fund Homeland Se-curity in essentially the way the Presi-dent has asked for and the Democrats and Republicans agreed on. It is not a perfect bill for everybody, but we have to do those things. We have to agree and fund all the departments and agen-cies of our government. 
Yet we now have a statement that 
our Democratic colleagues are going to block the bill. They apparently intend to say Republicans blocked the bill and that somehow Republicans didn’t fund Homeland Security. That is the mes-sage they are going to try to promote. 
They are going to say they want a 
clean bill. What does a clean bill mean? Is it a bill that funds the Immigration and Nationality Act as was passed by Congress, some 500 pages? It funds the officers and enforcement officials who carry out those duties every day. Does it fund those? Yes, it funds those. 
What is it that people are com-
plaining about then? What is this clean bill they want to see? 
I would suggest it is not a clean bill 
they want. In reality, they want legis-lation that will fund action by Presi-dent Obama that violates the Immigra-tion and Nationality Act, actions that he has taken through Executive am-nesty. That is the problem we are deal-ing with. 
Apparently they believe the Presi-
dent of the United States, who doesn’t agree with the way immigration law is written, the way it has been carried out for 30, 40 years—he is not happy with that. He asked the Congress to change it. 
Congress said: No. He said: I am going to do it anyway. 
Right across the river from Wash-ington—I am going to lease a building that houses 1,000 new workers—new workers—and those workers are going to process and give out legal status, work permits, Social Security partici-pation, Medicare participation to 5 million people. People who, according to the Immigration and Nationality Act, are unlawfully in the country and 
are not able to work. Businesses can-not hire somebody who is in the coun-try unlawfully. 
Is there any country in the world 
that says it is appropriate for a busi-ness to hire somebody who entered that country unlawfully? What kind of logic can support such reasoning? 
So the President is not an imperial 
master. He asked Congress and Con-gress said no, but he wants to go ahead and do it. 
Our Democratic colleagues are now 
telling us they are not going to support funding of Homeland Security because Congress—the House of Representa-tives bill and the bill I think will have a majority in the Senate—will not fund this building, the 1,000 people, and all the other activities that will be needed to execute this unlawful, unconstitu-tional Executive amnesty. 
It is through the looking glass. I 
mean, what world are we in? 
I was a Federal prosecutor for almost 
15 years. They enforce the law, they don’t enforce what some President said he would like to see done that is not lawful. Colleagues, this is so serious that the Immigration and Customs En-forcement officials, their association filed a lawsuit, and they challenged the actions of their supervisors telling them not to enforce plain immigration law. They went to Federal court. 
Has anybody ever heard of that be-
fore? This is the equivalent of the FBI for the immigration service. These are first-rate officers. Many of them have been there 20 or 30 years. 
They say: You are asking us to not 
enforce the law. 
They have challenged it in court. I 
have never heard of anything such as that before. The people in charge of en-forcing the law having to go to court to keep from being told not to enforce the law? It is amazing. 
This bill will not deny a penny of 
funding. It will not deny any funding for any program, activity or action that is authorized by law. It does not deny funding for any of those programs that are actually authorized by the laws of the United States. In fact, it says: Spend the money, Mr. President, on enforcing and following the law. You cannot spend money unconsti-tutionally to advocate and create a system of law Congress rejected—an unlawful activity. 
The Congress of the United States is 
not helpless when it confronts the President. Colleagues, we have to get out from under our desks. Are we afraid to say to the President of the United States we don’t agree with this, and we are not going to fund this? 
Is that the world we are in? Are we 
hiding under our desks, that the Presi-dent may go on television and attack us because we will not agree with his ideas? Surely not, surely not. 
The Congress has the power to appro-
priate money. It goes back to the his-toric development—before America be-came a nation—that the Parliament took over the power of money from the 
King. Parliament passed the laws, not the King. 
We adopted that and we created a 
constitutional order, instead of a King, to decide how we operate. The Par-liament, and the Congress of the United States, was empowered to han-dle the money. 
What obligation, colleagues, does 
this Congress of the United States have to give the President of the United States money to undermine the laws of the United States? What power does he have to compel us to do so? Zero. 
We should do the right thing. And 
the right thing is to say: Mr. President, we are willing to consider a form of im-migration law, but we didn’t approve of this bill. We didn’t support your bill last time and we are not going to pass your bill this time. We are going to continue to work to improve immigra-tion law and make it better and serve the national interest of the United States—not special interests, not ac-tivist groups and not big businesses, but the average working American’s interest. That is who we are going to serve in this process. 
So why are we afraid to push back on 
that? It is amazing to me. So I don’t think we will. In fact, it is sort of re-markable that this is a bipartisan posi-tion that the President has over-reached. I am not going to quote the names of Senators. I will be a little bit courteous at this point and just quote some of the statements from all sepa-rate Democratic Senators in the last few months when asked about this Ex-ecutive amnesty by the President. A lot of Senators have never been asked. They are probably thankful they weren’t asked. 
This is what one Senator said: 
. . . but the President shouldn’t make such 
a significant policy change on his own. 
Another Democratic Senator: 
. . . but executive orders aren’t the way to 
do it. 
Another Senator: 
I disagree with the President’s decision to 
use executive action to make changes to our immigration system. 
Another Democratic Senator: 
I’m disappointed the President decided to 
use executive action at this time on this issue, as it could poison any hope of com-promise or bipartisanship in the new Senate before it has even started. It’s Congress’ job to pass legislation and deal with issues of this magnitude. 
Absolutely correct. It is Congress’s 
duty to do this. 
What about another Democratic Sen-
ator: 
I worry that his taking unilateral action 
could in fact inflame public opinion, change the subject from immigration to the Presi-dent. I also have constitutional concerns about where prosecutorial discretion ends and unconstitutional authority begins. 
A wise quote, I think. 
Another Senator: 
I have concerns about executive action . . . 
This is a job for Congress, and it’s time for the House to act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S669 January 30, 2015 
Another Democratic Senator: 
. . . the best way to get a comprehensive 
solution is to take this through the legisla-tive process. 
So I would say, colleagues, why 
would any Senator, Democrat or Re-publican—when the very integrity of the constitutional powers given to Con-gress are eroded in a dramatic way by the President of the United States—not want to assert congressional author-ity? It is important for our constitu-tional structure, in my view. 
Well, there we are. We had hearings 
in the Senate on these issues and on the new nominee for Attorney General. The new nominee said she supports and will actively work for the policy the President established. The Attorney General is the chief law enforcement officer in the land. They take an oath to see that the laws of the United States are faithfully executed. 
I believe strongly in this. I don’t 
think it is a close question. It is not a close question, colleagues. The Presi-dent’s actions are unlawful. The Presi-dent’s executive actions impose a pol-icy that is detrimental to our ability to ever establish a lawful system of im-migration in America. They are against the wishes of the Congress, which rejected this proposal, and they are overwhelmingly in opposition to the views of the American people, as poll after poll has demonstrated. 
Do the American people have no role 
in their government? They can’t expect their Members of the Senate to vote for legislation that follows the law instead of breaking the law? Aren’t they frus-trated already that Congress is not fol-lowing the law, and they are frustrated with the President’s failure to follow the law? I think they are. 
Of course I would like to note that 
President Obama himself said 20 times he did not have the power to do this. He said, in May of 2008: 
Congress’s job is to pass legislation. The 
president can veto it or he can sign it . . . I believe in the Constitution and I will obey the Constitution of the United States. We’re not going to use signing statements . . . 
Another time he said: 
Ultimately, our nation, like all nations, 
has the right and obligation to control its borders and set laws for residency and citi-zenship. And no matter how decent they are, no matter their reasons, the 11 million peo-ple who broke these laws should be held ac-countable. 
October of 2010: 
I can’t simply ignore laws that are out 
there. 
On October 25 of 2010, he said: 
I am president, I am not king. I can’t do 
these things just by myself. We have a sys-tem of government that requires the Con-gress to work with the Executive Branch to make it happen. 
Well, even King George couldn’t act 
contrary to the laws passed by Par-liament. That statement goes on: 
. . . I just want to repeat, I’m president, 
I’m not king. If Congress has laws on the books that says that people who are here who are not documented have to be deported, then I can exercise some flexibility in terms 
of where we deploy our resources . . . but there’s a limit to the discretion that I can show because I’m obliged to execute the law. That’s what the Executive Branch means. I can’t just make the laws up by myself. 
Well, how true is that? That is abso-
lutely correct. It goes on. There are 20 of these. I could continue, but we will be talking about this as the weeks go on. 
Now, what do scholars say? Do the 
scholars say that this action is lawful and that Congress should fund it and we have an obligation to fund it or the President has the right to demand it? Jonathan Turley, who is a Shapiro Pro-fessor of Law at George Washington University, a nationally recognized constitutional scholar, testified before Congress many times, most often as a Democratic witness, has said he sup-ports President Obama and voted for him. But he said this: 
I believe the president has exceeded his 
brief. The president is required to faithfully execute the laws. He’s not required to en-force all laws equally or commit the same resources to them. But I believe the presi-dent has crossed the constitutional line . . . 
He said that again yesterday at the 
judiciary hearing on the Attorney Gen-eral. He continues: 
This goes to the very heart of what is the 
Madisonian system. If a president can unilat-erally change the meaning of laws in sub-stantial ways or refuse to enforce them, it takes offline that very thing that stabilizes our system. I believe the members will loathe the day that they allow that to hap-pen. This will not be the last president. There will be more presidents who will claim the same authority. 
Well, I think that is pretty signifi-
cant. Professor Turley is a supporter of President Obama personally, and some-one who has been a frequent Demo-cratic witness for Congress. 
Professor Nicholas Rosenkranz of 
Georgetown University Law Center, in his testimony yesterday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, said—and how simple and true is this. It is pretty insightful, frankly: 
Rather than declining to comply with a 
duly enacted statute— 
The INA. 
the President has decided to comply meticu-lously—with a bill that never became law. 
What a statement that is. And it is 
absolutely true. He went on to say: 
Congress has repeatedly considered a stat-
ute called the DREAM Act, which would ex-empt a broad category of aliens from the Im-migration and Nationality Act. The Presi-dent favored this DREAM Act, but Congress repeatedly declined to pass it. 
It is not in the code. It didn’t pass. 
He goes on to say: 
Once again, the President does have broad 
prosecutorial discretion and broad discretion to husband executive resources. But in this case, it is quite clear that the President is not merely trying to conserve resources. . . . To put the point another way, the President shall ‘‘take Care that the Laws’’—capital L— ‘‘be faithfully executed’’—not those bills which fail to become law. Here, in effect, the President is faithfully executing the DREAM Act, which is not law at all, rather than the Immigration and Nationality Act, which is 
supreme law of the land. The President can-not enact the DREAM Act unilaterally, and he cannot evade article 1, section 7, by pre-tending that it passed when it did not. 
How much clearer can you lay it out? 
This professor is simply telling the truth. There is no other way to look at this, in my opinion. Congress is being challenged at its very core by this ac-tion, and the result of this challenge will have constitutional ramifications and it will have ramifications as we consider the relative powers of the ex-ecutive, legislative, and judicial branches in the years to come. 
This is not a little matter, col-
leagues. It really is an affront to con-stitutional order. We have a duty no matter what we feel about this am-nesty that goes well beyond DREAM Act amnesty. We have a constitutional duty to defend the integrity of the Con-gress against an encroachment of mon-umental proportions by the President. That is the fundamental issue we will be dealing with when people complain about the funding bill for DHS. 
David Rivkin, who served two Presi-
dents in the Office of White House Counsel, and Elizabeth Price Foley, a constitutional law professor, wrote an article recently in the Wall Street Journal. It just hammers and dev-astates the arguments the President is making in favor of his executive am-nesty. They say this: 
By announcing a global policy of non-
enforcement against certain categories, Mr. Obama condones unlawful behavior, weak-ening the law’s deterrent impact, and allows lawbreakers to remain without fear of depor-tation . . . These individuals are no longer deportable although Congress has declared them so. 
They conclude with a statement we 
need to consider. I believe their con-cluding statement is accurate. I think it is pretty much indisputable. And if it is accurate, then Congress has a duty to stand firm. 
This is what they conclude: 
The President, after months, finally ex-
tracted from the Office of Legal Counsel of the U.S. Department of Justice a memo-randum that allows basically what he is try-ing to do. It has been heavily criticized. Legal scholars say it is a poor analysis in a whole lot of ways. In fact, it is unacceptable. 
This is what the authors of this re-
cent opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal said: 
The OLC’s memo endorses a view of presi-
dential power that has never been advanced by even the boldest presidential advocates. If this view holds, future presidents can unilat-erally gut tax, environmental, labor or secu-rities laws by enforcing only those portions with which they agree. This is a dangerous precedent that cannot be allowed to stand. 
So this is what is at stake. And now 
we learn that the Democrats intend to oppose even going forward to consider the House bill that funds the Depart-ment of Homeland Security—and they intend to block that through the fili-buster. 
This is what Senator B
ARBARA MI-
KULSKI is reported by Congressional 
Quarterly as saying last night:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S670 January 30, 2015 
Senator Mikulski tells CQ that Democrats 
will block the Senate from proceeding to de-bate the DHS spending bill over immigration riders. 
Have they made that decision? Sure-
ly not. Surely we should move to the bill. If they are unhappy with the lan-guage the House put in this, then offer an amendment to take it out. They will have the right to have full amend-ments, consistent with the rules of the Senate, on this legislation. They can offer amendments to strike the lan-guage in the House that simply says we are not going to fund unlawful Execu-tive amnesty. It is a pretty stunning thing that we are dealing with and that we will be confronting next week. I be-lieve it is a position that is untenable. It is untenable constitutionally, it is untenable lawfully, and it is untenable because it is contrary to the will of Re-publicans and Democrats in the House and Senate who oppose the President’s action. It is untenable politically be-cause overwhelmingly the American people reject it. 
I am flabbergasted that we are now 
hearing that Democrats might not even allow the bill to come up on the floor. What does that mean? 
I suppose they will say: Mr. Repub-
lican Congress, are you shutting down Homeland Security? 
Why? I would ask. Well, because you are putting in lan-
guage that says the President shouldn’t go off and create and endorse and support and fund changing of the law of the United States that Congress hasn’t changed, and we insist that you fund his activities and give him the money he needs to carry out this project. 
Then Congress says: No. We don’t 
want to do that. 
We oppose it and we won’t pass the 
bill that funds Homeland Security. 
That is a bad thing to do. The Amer-
ican people won’t like it that you don’t fund Homeland Security, the Repub-licans may say. 
And do you know what our Demo-
cratic colleagues will say? 
No. You shut Homeland Security 
down because you kept the President from doing his activity. We are going to accuse you of not funding Homeland Security, and we are going to say you placed the Nation at risk. The Presi-dent is going to accuse you of defunding Homeland Security, and he is going to accuse you of putting the country at risk. And the media? Why, they are on our side, and they are going to report it that way. When you turn on your television at night, they are going to say to the American peo-ple that Republicans didn’t fund Home-land Security, and you are going to lose. 
Look, we are not through the looking 
glass yet. Give me a break. That is not going to sell. The American people are not going to buy that and the press is not going to shill for this kind of story. It is going to be clear who is not fund-ing Homeland Security. It is going to be clear who wants to create a lawful 
system of immigration and to fund it in an effective way and serve the na-tional interests in this fashion. 
I feel strongly about it. Hopefully 
this won’t happen. Hopefully the report last night is not going to be the posi-tion of the Democratic Party. 
I just read of seven or eight of them 
who said they don’t approve of the President’s action. Why would they vote not to even go to a bill? And re-member, if the bill comes up and our colleagues don’t like this language in it, they can move to alter it or strike it. Let’s vote on it. 
Sometimes you win in this body; 
sometimes you lose. We lost many times—many on the Republican side— in supporting the Keystone Pipeline. Now we are told the President may veto the bill that has well over 60 votes and many Democrats voting for it. Well, is Congress going to say ‘‘We are going to ignore that’’ and ask the law enforcement officers or the other offi-cers to ignore the President’s veto and pretend the law passed when it didn’t pass? Of course not. And neither can the President. We are coequal branches, and the President does not have the authority and the right and the power to enforce a law that never passed to grant amnesty to people who are unlawfully here. 
It goes beyond prosecutorial discre-
tion. As I said, I was a prosecutor for a long time. It is not prosecutorial dis-cretion to give someone who is unlaw-fully in the country a work permit, a photo ID—as they intend to do—a So-cial Security number, the right to par-ticipate in Social Security, the right to work, to take any job in America. What job are they going to take? Who is offering any jobs of any numbers today in America? Not many. So these individuals who are here unlawfully will now be able to go to the trucking company and take a pretty good truck-ing job or maybe a forklift operator job or maybe they want to work for the county commission. 
I asked the Attorney General nomi-
nee 2 days ago at a hearing would the Department of Justice sue a business that said: Well, we have job openings, but we are going to hire those people who have green cards or who came here lawfully and have a lawful status, but we are not going to hire somebody with temporary Presidential amnesty? Are you going to sue them for some sort of violation of rights? 
She said she didn’t know. They 
might. She basically said they might sue them. So this is a real danger. 
The truth is, colleagues, we don’t 
have enough jobs in America today. We have the lowest percentage of Ameri-cans actually working, in the working ages, that we have had since the 1970s. It has dropped steadily year after year. There is no doubt that if you bring more people into our country than we have jobs for, it does make it harder. 
Also, an excess of labor pulls down 
wages, and things aren’t really getting better. Median family wages since 2007 
are down $4,000. That is a stunning amount. Wages in December—last month—in America dropped 5 cents an hour. 
This idea that the economy is on 
track, everything is wonderful—it is not so wonderful for average working Americans. Their wages went down, not up, as we have been told is hap-pening. This is not going to help. It is going to make that situation worse. 
Fundamentally, we need a lawful sys-
tem of immigration that we can be proud of, and somebody needs to be concerned first and foremost about the people we represent. We should be con-cerned about the people who have im-migrated here lawfully. Their wages are down also, in some cases even more so. In fact, they are often competing most directly against unlawful immi-grants. 
I would say this: This is not the right 
way to do it. We are going to continue to talk about this. I believe the Con-gress of the United States, once it is really understood what is happening, will listen to the constituents of Amer-ica. They will decide first and foremost that our duty is to create a lawful sys-tem of immigration that is fairly en-dorsed, that we can be proud of, and that serves the interest of the Amer-ican people—the national interest. That is what is being overlooked. 
People are coming from abroad. They 
want to come to America. We have al-ways had the most generous immigra-tion system in the world, and we be-lieve in immigration. But they should come lawfully and the Congress should help create a system that supports a lawful entry into America. 
The council that represents the Cus-
toms and Immigration Service Officers just January 22nd of this year issued a strong statement. They said: 
The dedicated immigration service officers 
and adjudicators at USCIS are in desperate need of help. The President’s executive am-nesty order for 5 million illegal immigrants places the mission of USCIS in grave peril. 
Has anybody been listening to them 
or do they just listen to big business? Do they just listen to activist groups? Do they just listen to lobbyists, politi-cians with their political schemes to win elections? Is that what they are listening to? They are not listening to the officers who are carrying out the duties. 
Last fall the same group who rep-
resents these government workers— Ken Palinkas, a very able leader, said this: 
Making matters more dangerous, the 
Obama administration’s executive amnesty, like S. 744 that he unsuccessfully lobbied for, would legalize visa overstays and cause mil-lions additionally to overstay—raising the threat level to America even higher. 
It goes on with many other points. 
I thank the Chair for the opportunity 
to speak. I am very worried that our Democratic colleagues are making a mistake. I think it is the right thing in this new Senate with Majority Leader

MCCONNELL who has allowed more 
votes in 1 day than the Republicans got from Senator R
EIDthe entire year last 
year. We probably doubled the number of votes this year than we had all of last year. 
The Democrats are saying, we are 
not even going to go to this bill that would fund Homeland Security. And if we don’t go to it, then Homeland Secu-rity is not funded. Are they going to block a bill that would fund Homeland Security? 
Senator M
CCONNELL is saying you 
can have your relevant amendment. If you don’t like the language the House put in that says the money can only go to fund lawful activities, then you can vote to take it out and offer an amend-ment to take it out; but if you don’t have the votes, you lose. That is the way the system should work. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The

MORNING BUSINESS 
EMPLOYER WELLNESS PROGRAMS: 
BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES AND LOWER COSTS 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my remarks at the Senate Health, Edu-cation, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing yesterday be printed in the R
ECORD . 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows: 
EMPLOYER WELLNESS PROGRAMS : BETTER  
HEALTH OUTCOMES AND LOWER COSTS 
This morning we are holding a hearing en-
titled ‘‘Employer Wellness Programs: Better Health Outcomes and Lower Costs.’’ 
Ranking Member Murray and I will each 
have an opening statement, then we will in-troduce our panel of witnesses. I ask that each of our witnesses limits their testimony to no more than five minutes. We will con-clude the hearing at noon. 
About half of Americans, or 149 million, 
have health insurance through an employer. One thing we agree upon is that it’s a good thing for employers to encourage employees to be healthier. There are a few ways that employers can do this. Offering employees free gym memberships, access to weight loss coaches, and on-site nurses, to name a few. Today, we’re going to hear from employers who offer lower cost insurance if their em-ployees lead a healthy lifestyle. 
Obamacare was not a bipartisan law, but it 
did include a bipartisan provision to strengthen workplace wellness programs. Former Senator Harkin and I worked to-gether on this during the HELP Committee markup of Obamacare. Before Obamacare, employers relied upon a 2006 regulation which empowered them to discount em-ployee premiums up to 20 percent. Today, employers have certainty of law 
that they can give their employees up to 30 percent off of their premiums if they make healthy lifestyle choices like maintaining a healthy weight or keeping their cholesterol levels in check. The law also gave the Secre-taries of Labor and Health the authority to extend this discount to 50 percent off through regulations. And the Secretaries did just that for tobacco cessation, so companies can also give employees who are smoke-free a 50 percent discount off their premiums. 
But these discount programs aren’t a 
blank check. By law, employers have to meet several conditions. First, they cannot dis-criminate. Employers must make these pro-grams available to everyone and must pro-vide a reasonable alternative if an employee cannot complete the standard requirement. Second, they have to be designed to promote health. So, your boss can’t offer a reward for a better job performance, but she can do so if you stop smoking. Third, everyone should have a chance to qualify at least once a year. 
To get started, employees might simply 
fill out a questionnaire about themselves and their family’s medical history, or undergo a basic health screening to take their weight, temperature, blood pressure, as well as a fin-ger prick test for cholesterol or diabetes. This information provides employees a base-line from which to work with a medical pro-fessional to improve. 
Today, we will seek to answer several ques-
tions. First, how well are these programs working? A 2014 study conducted for Inter-active Health found 85% of 15,550 people sur-veyed either improved or maintained their level of health risk and companies’ health care costs rose 6% more slowly. A September 2014 survey by the benefits consulting firm of Towers Watson & Co. found that 18% of em-ployers already use outcomes-based wellness incentives and 48% plan to add one by 2017. 
Next, we want to explore if any of these 
programs need to be changed. There are a number of laws and regulations on the books governing wellness programs, but do employ-ers have all the tools they need? 
And we want to hear how a disturbing turn 
of events may affect these programs. Specifi-cally, the action the Equal Employment Op-portunity Commission (EEOC) is taking against companies like Honeywell for en-couraging employees to lead a healthier life-style. I’m concerned the government is en-couraging workplace wellness on one hand, and discouraging it on the other. 
There is a great deal of evidence that tells 
us these programs can make employees healthier and happier at work, and for the investment employers make, they can see lower health care costs. 
Honeywell has a wellness program that is 
reportedly compliant with Obamacare, pro-vides for reasonable alternative accommoda-tions, and protects patient privacy. And, it’s working to improve employee health. 61 per-cent of Honeywell employees identified with more than one health risk factor eliminated at least one of those risk factors; and 46 per-cent eliminated all of their risk factors. 
What’s wrong with that? Well, the EEOC 
seemingly believes employers should not re-ward employees who make healthy lifestyle choices with lower premiums. And in Octo-ber last year, the general counsel sued to 
stop Honeywell from doing just that. 
Even the White House has expressed con-
cern regarding the EEOC’s actions. In De-cember, when asked about the president’s thoughts on the EEOC wellness lawsuits, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the administration is concerned EEOC’s actions are, or could be, ‘‘inconsistent with what we know about wellness programs and the fact that we know that wellness pro-grams are good for both employers and em-ployees.’’ Congress was clear in the health care law. 
The administration was clear in the regula-tions. And the White House has again reiter-ated its support for these programs. But ap-parently that is not clear enough for the EEOC. The EEOC is sending a confusing mes-sage to employers—reliance on Obamacare’s authorization of wellness programs does not mean you won’t be sued. 
So, I’m working on legislation to provide 
employers and employees even more clarity and certainty to continue to offer these vol-untary wellness programs and encourage healthy lifestyle choices. Innovation and healthy choices should be applauded, not punished. 
Workplace wellness programs give individ-
uals some control over rising health care costs. Instead of watching powerlessly as more money comes out of their paychecks each month to cover rising health insurance premiums—wellness programs give individ-uals the ability to regain some control over those costs. 
I admit that this represents a big shift in 
how we think about the workplace in rela-tion to our health. There has been a sea change in how we talk about health at work. I remember well the smoke in the hallways of the Nixon White House. That was true in most workplaces then. These days, about the only workplace you can smoke is the Speak-er’s office.

REMEMBERING CHIP KENNETT 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I 
wish to pay tribute to Bayard Winslow ‘‘Chip’’ Kennett II, a native of Conway, N.H., who passed away on January 17 at the age of 34. 
Growing up in the Mount Washington 
Valley, Chip was a fantastic student- athlete and natural leader. At A. Cros-by Kennett High School, one of two schools in Conway which bears his fam-ily name, Chip quarterbacked the Ken-nett High School football team and was honored with the Jack Burns Memorial Award for leadership, dedication and loyalty to his teammates on the Ken-nett High baseball team. His parents, Bayard and Theresa, instilled in Chip a love for the region and its people, and Chip spent his summers volunteering and working at Conway’s community recreation center. 
Chip would later go on to a career in 
public service that spanned close to a decade, rising from a college internship with then-New Hampshire Representa-tive John Sununu to a position in Sen-ator Judd Gregg’s office, after which he returned to work for John Sununu upon his election to the Senate. Before leaving Capitol Hill to join Raytheon’s government affairs practice, Chip most recently worked for Maine Senator S
USAN COLLINS as her military legisla-
tive assistant and director of appro-priations. During his time in Wash-ington, Chip was active in the New Hampshire State Society, helping to raise funds for New Hampshire stu-dents hoping to intern in the Nation’s capital as he had during college. All those who knew him in the Senate re-call his upbeat and caring nature, both qualities that buoyed him and his fam-ily through the difficulties of the past 2 years.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S672 January 30, 2015 
In October 2012, Chip’s wife Sheila 
was 35 weeks pregnant when he was di-agnosed with stage IV advanced lung cancer. As he learned more about his diagnosis, Chip, who was not a smoker, was struck by the lack of progress in improving the survival rate for this deadly cancer which, contrary to pop-ular perception, annually affects more non-smokers than smokers. During his own treatment, Chip became an advo-cate for lung cancer and worked excep-tionally hard to increase awareness of the disease and to end the negative stigma of a lung cancer diagnosis. He gave his time and legislative expertise to LUNGevity, a lung cancer-focused nonprofit, to help fight for much-need-ed lung cancer research, education and support. His efforts culminated in an invitation to testify on Capitol Hill re-garding the need to expedite trials for breakthrough drugs to treat life- threatening diseases like lung cancer. Throughout his own battle with the disease, Chip held out hope that one day we could all celebrate a cure for cancer. 
Chip truly embodied the spirit of 
public service, especially in his remain-ing days when he served as a voice for others. I know I speak for all in the Senate when I say thank you, Chip, for providing an example of what it means to be a great father, son, husband, friend and American. 
Chip is survived by his 5-year-old son 
Bayard ‘‘Joe’’ Kennett II, his 2-year-old daughter Crosby Reynolds and his wife Sheila whom he met while they were both serving as staff members in the Senate; his mother and father, Bayard and Theresa Kennett of Conway, N.H., as well as his brother and sister-in-law Tanner and Sarah Kennett of North Conway, N.H. 
On behalf of the people of New Hamp-
shire, I ask my colleagues and all Americans to join me in honoring the life and service of Chip Kennett. 
Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I 
wish to recognize the extraordinary life of my friend Chip Kennett, who passed away on January 17 after a courageous 2-year battle against cancer. 
Bayard Winslow ‘‘Chip’’ Kennett II 
was born and raised in Conway, and he was a proud New Hampshire native son. The Kennetts are pillars of the Conway community whose roots in the Mount Washington Valley go back genera-tions, and I have been fortunate to know Chip’s family and to witness their countless contributions to busi-ness and civic life in New Hampshire. 
Chip carried on his family’s tradition 
of public service when he first came to Capitol Hill to serve his home State of New Hampshire. He served as a con-gressional staffer for nearly 8 years— first as a legislative correspondent to my predecessor Senator Judd Gregg and later as a policy aide for former Senator John E. Sununu. More re-cently, he was a senior aide to my col-league from Maine, Senator S
USAN  
COLLINS . When I first came to the Sen-
ate in 2011 and did not yet have a full legislative staff in place, Chip gener-
ously offered his counsel on national security and defense issues, for which I was very grateful. 
While working for Senator Gregg, 
Chip met the love of his life, Sheila, who would become his wife. 
In October 2012, Chip—seemingly 
healthy and active at the age of 31— was diagnosed with Stage IV non-smoker’s lung cancer. There was no cure. In the face of an unimaginable prognosis, Chip understood better than most that life is a gift, and he inspired us all with his determination to live his life to the fullest—making the most of the time he had with his wife Sheila and their two young children, Joe and Crosby. Together, they found joy and meaning in simply being together dur-ing everyday, ordinary moments—re-solving to be ‘‘present and grateful.’’ From family dinners to rooting for his favorite football team on ‘‘Patriots Football Sunday’’, Chip savored the blessings of family and friendship. 
True to his compassionate nature, he 
turned his diagnosis into a cause for good—becoming a counselor to others battling cancer, raising public aware-ness of the disease and the need to re-duce the stigma associated with lung cancer. The blog that Chip and Sheila started provided a ‘‘Playbook for Liv-ing’’ that served as a source of inspira-tion and encouragement to others who were fighting similar battles with can-cer. Chip also put his Capitol Hill expe-rience to work as an advocate for lung cancer research, and his efforts are credited with helping spur changes in Medicare coverage for lung cancer treatments—a legacy that will con-tinue to touch many lives. 
Chip summed up his approach to liv-
ing with cancer at a hearing last May before the Senate Special Committee on Aging, where he testified that ‘‘thanks to medical breakthroughs, I have been able to experience many quality filled days. We have enjoyed spending holidays with friends and family. I have been able to continue working full time. As a family, we have sat down at the dinner table together, have attended innumerable swim les-sons, soccer and tee ball practices for my son on Saturday mornings, and have sat in a church pew together on Sunday mornings. In other words, we have stayed busy—busy LIVING with cancer.’’ 
Chip’s strong network of family and 
close friends was extremely important to him. He was always happiest being around the people he loved. After his diagnosis, his family, friends, cowork-ers, and former Hill colleagues—affec-tionately known as Team Kennett— mobilized to not only support Chip and his family but also to support their ef-forts to aid others fighting cancer. 
The courage and strength with which 
Chip and his family faced his illness is an inspiration to us all. Perhaps Chip’s greatest legacy is the valuable lesson he taught us all about how to live fully in each moment. Chip was a wonderful, smart, and 
fun-loving man, and he had a big heart. It was a joy to know him and to call him a friend, and his loss is simply heartbreaking. 
My heart and thoughts are with all of 
Team Kennett, including Sheila, Joe, and Crosby; as well as Chip’s parents Bayard and Theresa Kennett of Conway; and his brother and sister-in- law Tanner and Sarah Kennett of North Conway.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING BILLY’S BOUDIN & 
CRACKLIN 
∑Mr. VITTER. Madam President, 
many of our Nation’s small businesses are well-regarded for their ability to truly showcase the local culture, food, and heritage. Small businesses have a unique perspective and opportunity to take advantage of local recipes, ingre-dients, and flavor profiles that allow them to provide regional favorites for residents and tourists. Without a doubt, one of the most remarkable as-pects of Louisiana is our delicious, ex-traordinary cuisine. This week, I would like to recognize this truly special piece of Louisiana culture by honoring Billy’s Boudin & Cracklin of Krotz Springs, LA, as the Small Business of the Week. 
South Louisiana has created its own 
genre of Louisiana cooking. With tradi-tions and recipes handed down through the generations, the charm and flavor of Acadiana is undeniable. Billy’s Boudin & Cracklin was originally founded in 1995 as a convenience store. It was not long, however, before Billy Frey and his father-in-law decided they needed to incorporate something in their store to set them apart from the competition. The brilliant addition of a family boudin recipe bolstered the suc-cess of their store to what we know today. Two short years later, Billy ex-panded their thriving business to the nearby city of Opelousas and purchased a popular local grocery store, Ray’s, to establish Billy and Ray’s Boudin. Maintaining the local charm, the Frey’s purchased Ray’s secret boudin recipe and added it right onto the new store’s menu. 
Recently, the business expanded once 
again to the ‘‘Boudin Capitol of the World’’ in Scott, LA. What started out as a small convenient store has turned into a regional favorite, with over 3,000 pounds of boudin made daily between the three stores. In addition to the original boudin links, Billy’s offers boudin in the form of balls, pistollettes, rollups, and sandwiches. They also have shipping options so nonlocals can enjoy authentic Cajun boudin and cracklins from across the country. The Boudin Balls have become a signature of the business, with around 1.7 million of the regular and pepperjack-filled balls sold yearly. The famous boudin recipe is so coveted that

only a select few people are in the 
know. In fact, this is taken so seriously that each member of the staff must sign confidentiality agreements before learning the family secret. 
After 20 years of thriving business in 
the area, it is no surprise that the La-fayette Daily Advertiser awarded Billy’s Boudin & Cracklin as one of the ‘‘Best Boudin’’ places in their annual ‘‘Best of Acadiana’’ contest last year. It is great to see small businesses like this share our State’s rich traditions with both Louisianians and nonlocals. Congratulations again to Billy’s Boudin & Cracklin for being honored as this week’s Small Business of the Week. I look forward to trying their delicious boudin soon. ∑

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 59—RAISING 
AWARENESS AND ENCOURAGING PREVENTION OF STALKING BY DESIGNATING JANUARY 2015 AS ‘‘NATIONAL STALKING AWARE-NESS MONTH’’ 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR (for herself and Mr. 
P
ERDUE ) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was considered and agreed to: 
S. R ES. 59 
Whereas 1 in 6, or 19,200,000, women in the 
United States have at some point during their lifetime experienced stalking victim-ization, during which they felt very fearful or believed that they or someone close to them would be harmed or killed; 
Whereas, during a 1-year period, an esti-
mated 3,400,000 persons in the United States reported that they had been victims of stalk-ing, and 75 percent of those victims reported that they had been stalked by someone they knew; 
Whereas 11 percent of victims reported 
having been stalked for more than 5 years, and 23 percent of victims reported having been stalked almost every day; 
Whereas 1 in 4 victims reported that stalk-
ers had used email, instant messaging, blogs, bulletin boards, Internet sites, chat rooms, or other forms of electronic monitoring against them, and 1 in 13 victims reported that stalkers had used electronic devices to monitor them; 
Whereas stalking victims are forced to 
take drastic measures to protect themselves, including changing identity, relocating, changing jobs, and obtaining protection or-ders; 
Whereas 1 in 7 victims reported having re-
located in an effort to escape a stalker; 
Whereas approximately 1 in 8 employed 
victims of stalking missed work because they feared for their safety or were taking steps to protect themselves, such as by seek-ing a restraining order; 
Whereas less than 50 percent of victims re-
ported stalking to police, and only 7 percent of victims contacted a victim service pro-
vider, shelter, or hotline; 
Whereas stalking is a crime under Federal 
law and under the laws of all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the territories of the United States; 
Whereas stalking affects victims of every 
race, age, culture, gender, sexual orienta-tion, physical and mental ability, and eco-nomic status; 
Whereas national organizations, local vic-
tim service organizations, campuses, pros-ecutor’s offices, and police departments stand ready to assist stalking victims and are working diligently to develop effective and innovative responses to stalking; 
Whereas there is a need to improve the re-
sponse of the criminal justice system to stalking through more aggressive investiga-tion and prosecution; 
Whereas there is a need for increased avail-
ability of victim services across the United States, and such services must include pro-grams tailored to meet the needs of stalking victims; 
Whereas persons aged 18 to 24 experience 
the highest rates of stalking victimization, and rates of stalking among college students exceed the prevalence rates found in the gen-eral population; 
Whereas as many as 75 percent of women in 
college who experience stalking-related be-havior experience other forms of victimiza-tion, including sexual or physical victimiza-tion, or both; 
Whereas there is a need for effective re-
sponses to stalking on campuses; and 
Whereas the Senate finds that ‘‘National 
Stalking Awareness Month’’ provides an op-portunity to educate the people of the United States about stalking: Now, there-fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates January 2015 as ‘‘National 
Stalking Awareness Month’’; 
(2) applauds the efforts of the many stalk-
ing victim service providers, police, prosecu-tors, national and community organizations, campuses, and private sector supporters to promote awareness of stalking; 
(3) encourages policymakers, criminal jus-
tice officials, victim service and human serv-ice agencies, college campuses and univer-sities, and nonprofit organizations to in-crease awareness of stalking and the avail-ability of services for stalking victims; and 
(4) urges national and community organi-
zations, businesses in the private sector, and the media to promote awareness of the crime of stalking through ‘‘National Stalking Awareness Month’’.

having abolished the Transatlantic Slave 
Trade in 1808 and having abolished chattel slavery and prohibited involuntary servitude in 1865; 
Whereas because the people of the United 
States remain committed to protecting indi-vidual freedom, there is a national impera-tive to eliminate human trafficking, which is the recruitment, harboring, transpor-tation, provision, or obtaining of persons for labor or services through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjec-tion to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery, and the inducement of a commercial sex act by force, fraud, or coer-cion, or in which the person induced to per-form such act has not attained 18 years of age; 
Whereas to combat human trafficking in 
the United States and globally, the people of the United States, the Federal Government, and State and local governments must be aware of the realities of human trafficking and must be dedicated to stopping this con-temporary manifestation of slavery; 
Whereas human trafficking is estimated to 
be a $32,000,000,000 criminal enterprise, mak-ing it the second largest criminal enterprise in the world, behind the drug trade; 
Whereas the United Nations estimates that 
nearly 21,000,000 people around the world are victims of forced labor, including 4,500,000 people who are victims of forced sexual ex-ploitation; 
Whereas the Department of Justice esti-
mates that up to 83 percent of sex trafficking victims in the United States are citizens of the United States; 
Whereas beyond all differences of race, 
creed, or political persuasion, the people of the United States face national threats to-gether and refuse to let modern slavery exist in the United States and around the world; 
Whereas the United States should actively 
oppose all individuals, groups, organizations, and nations that support, advance, or com-mit acts of human trafficking; 
Whereas through education, the United 
States must also work to end slavery in all of its forms around the world; 
Whereas victims of modern slavery need 
support in order to escape and recover from the physical, mental, emotional, and spir-itual trauma associated with their victim-ization; 
Whereas human traffickers use many phys-
ical and psychological techniques to control their victims, including the use of violence or threats of violence against the victim or the victim’s family, isolation from the pub-lic, isolation from the victim’s family and 
religious or ethnic communities, language and cultural barriers, shame, control of the victim’s possessions, confiscation of pass-ports and other identification documents, and threats of arrest, deportation, or impris-onment if the victim attempts to reach out for assistance or to leave; 
Whereas although laws to prosecute per-
petrators of modern slavery and to assist and protect victims of human trafficking, such as the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.) and title XII of the Violence Against Women Reauthoriza-tion Act of 2013 (Public Law 113–4; 127 Stat. 54), have been enacted in the United States, awareness of the issues surrounding slavery and trafficking by those people most likely to come into contact with victims is essen-tial for effective enforcement because the techniques that traffickers use to keep their victims enslaved severely limit self-report-ing; 
Whereas January 1 is the anniversary of 
the effective date of the Emancipation Proc-lamation; 
Whereas February 1 is the anniversary of 
the date on which President Abraham Lin-coln signed the joint resolution sending the 
13th Amendment to the States for ratifica-tion, to forever declare that ‘‘Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude . . . shall exist within the United States, or any place sub-ject to their jurisdiction’’ and is a date which has long been celebrated as National Freedom Day, as described in section 124 of title 36, United States Code; 
Whereas under its authority to enforce the 
13th Amendment ‘‘by appropriate legisla-tion’’, Congress in the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 updated the post-Civil War involuntary servitude and slavery stat-utes and adopted an approach known as the ‘‘3P’’ approach of victim protection, vigorous prosecution, and prevention of human traf-ficking; and 
Whereas the effort by individuals, busi-
nesses, organizations, and governing bodies to commemorate January 11 as Human Traf-ficking Awareness Day represents one of the many positive examples of the commitment in the United States to raise awareness of, and to actively oppose, modern slavery: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate supports— 
(1) the goals and ideals of observing the 
National Slavery and Trafficking Prevention Month from January 1 through February 1, 2015, to recognize the vital role that the peo-ple of the United States have in ending mod-ern slavery; 
(2) marking this observance with appro-
priate programs and activities culminating in the observance on February 1 of National Freedom Day, as described in section 124 of title 36, United States Code; and 
(3) all other efforts to raise awareness of, 
and opposition to, human trafficking.

COMMEMORATING THE 70TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE LIBERATION OF THE AUSCHWITZ EXTERMI-NATION CAMP 
Mr. M
CCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the Sen-ate proceed to the immediate consider-ation of Calendar No. 8, S. Res. 35. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will report the resolution by title. 
The assistant legislative clerk read 
as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 35) commemorating 
the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz extermination camp in Nazi-occu-pied Poland. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution, which had been reported from the Com-mittee on Foreign Relations, with an amendment to strike out all after the resolving clause and insert the part printed in italic. 
S. R ES. 35 
Whereas, on January 27, 1945, the Ausch-
witz extermination camp in Nazi-occupied Poland was liberated by Allied Forces during World War II after almost 5 years of murder, rape, and torture at the camp; 
Whereas 1,100,000 innocent civilians were 
murdered at the Auschwitz extermination camp; 
Whereas nearly 1,300,000 innocent civilians 
were deported to Auschwitz from their homes across Eastern and Western Europe, particularly from Hungary, Poland, and France; 
Whereas 1,000,000 of the civilians who per-
ished at the camp were Jews, along with 100,000 non-Jewish Poles, Roma and Sinti in-dividuals, Soviet prisoners of war, Jehovah’s Witnesses, gay men and women, and other 
ethnic minorities; 
Whereas these civilians included farmers, 
tailors, seamstresses, factory hands, ac-countants, doctors, teachers, small-business owners, clergy, intellectuals, government of-ficials, and political activists; 
Whereas these civilians were subjected to 
torture, forced labor, starvation, rape, med-ical experiments, and being separated from loved ones; 
Whereas the names of many of these civil-
ians who perished have been lost forever; 
Whereas the Auschwitz extermination 
camp symbolizes the extraordinary brutality of the Holocaust; 
Whereas the people of the United States 
must never forget the terrible crimes against humanity committed at the Auschwitz ex-termination camp; 
Whereas the people of the United States 
must educate future generations to promote understanding of the dangers of intolerance in order to prevent similar injustices from happening again; and 
Whereas commemoration of the liberation 
of the Auschwitz extermination camp will instill in all people of the United States a greater awareness of the Holocaust: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— (1) commemorates January 27, 2015, as the 
70th anniversary of the liberation of the Ausch-witz extermination camp by Allied Forces during World War II; 
(2) calls on all people of the United States to 
remember the 1,100,000 innocent victims mur-dered at the Auschwitz extermination camp as part of the Holocaust; 
(3) honors the legacy of the survivors of the 
Holocaust and of the Auschwitz extermination camp; and 
(4) calls on the people of the United States to 
continue to work toward tolerance, peace, and justice and to continue to work to end all geno-cide and persecution.

SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND 
IDEALS OF OBSERVING THE NA-TIONAL SLAVERY AND TRAF-FICKING PREVENTION MONTH 
Mr. M
CCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the Sen-ate proceed to the immediate consider-ation of S. Res. 60, submitted earlier today. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will report the resolution by title. 
The assistant legislative clerk read 
as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 60) supporting the 
goals and ideals of observing the National Slavery and Trafficking Prevention Month from January 1 through February 1, 2015, to raise awareness of, and opposition to, mod-ern slavery. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, 
today I have submitted a resolution with Senator K
IRKrecognizing January 
as National Slavery and Trafficking Prevention Month. We are pleased to 
be joined by Senators L
EAHY , TOOMEY , 
KLOBUCHAR , C OONS , R UBIO, M URRAY , 
WYDEN , BROWN , SHAHEEN , GILLIBRAND , 
KAINE, HEITKAMP , KING, and M ARKEY in 
sponsoring this resolution. 
January 1 is the anniversary of the 
effective date of the Emancipation Proclamation, and February 1 is the anniversary of the date that President Abraham Lincoln signed the joint reso-lution sending the Thirteenth Amend-ment—which abolished slavery—to the States for ratification. 
In 2009, the Senate unanimously ap-
proved a resolution I introduced to es-tablish January as Human Trafficking Awareness Month. That resolution was made to raise awareness of, and opposi-tion to, the human trafficking. It is important that we continue to bring attention to and raise awareness of this horrific practice. 
Human trafficking is a crime in 
which persons are forced to work against their will in sweatshops, pros-titution rings, farms, private homes, and other enterprises. The traffickers use force, threats of force, and coercion to ensure that their victims believe they have no other choice but to work for their captors. Frequently, human trafficking goes undetected because the victims are not only afraid of their traffickers, but they have been taught by their traffickers to fear law enforce-ment. Human trafficking is estimated to be 
a $32 billion criminal enterprise, mak-ing it the second largest criminal in-dustry in the world, behind the drug trade. A 2014 Urban Institute study found that pimps in Atlanta can make nearly $33,000 in just one week, which amounts to over $1.7 million a year. The overwhelming majority of sex traf-ficking victims in the United States are American citizens—83 percent by one estimate from the Department of Justice. 
Unfortunately, children are often vic-
tims of this horrendous crime. The Na-tional Center for Missing and Exploited 
Children has reported that one in seven endangered runaways are victims of sex trafficking. 
Many of these children continue to 
be exploited into adulthood. A study of women and girls involved in street prostitution in my hometown of San Francisco found that 82 percent had been physically assaulted, 83 percent were threatened with a weapon, and 68 percent were raped. 
Unfortunately, such abuse is common 
around the world. According to the United Nations, there are nearly 21 million people currently serving in some form of involuntary servitude. The United Nations also reported that in 16 percent of the 138 countries stud-ied, there was not one trafficking-re-lated conviction between 2007 and 2010. 
Over the past decade, Congress has 
taken action to enhance the tools available to prosecute perpetrators of human trafficking and to assist and protect trafficking victims. We passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 and, 8 years later, passed the William Wilberforce Trafficking Vic-tims Protection Reauthorization Act. These laws strengthened Federal ef-forts to combat international and do-mestic human trafficking by expanding administrative subpoena authority, in-creasing penalties for traffickers, and authorizing the Justice Department to seek preventive detention of those charged with trafficking offenses. 
Despite these important laws, further 
action is needed. Earlier this year, Sen-ator P
ORTMAN and I introduced the 
Combat Human Trafficking Act of 2015. This bill would reduce the demand for human trafficking, particularly the commercial sexual exploitation of chil-dren, by holding buyers accountable and making it easier for law enforce-ment to investigate and prosecute all persons who participate in sex traf-ficking. 
In addition, I am pleased to join Sen-
ator K
IRKin introducing the Stop Ad-
vertising Victims of Exploitation Act or the SAVE Act. This bill would strike at child sex trafficking where it is increasingly occurring—the Inter-net—by prohibiting Internet companies from profiting from allowing their websites to be used to traffic children. 
We must act with urgency to end the 
practice of human trafficking. For every day we wait, more lives are dam-
aged by this horrible practice. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
observing National Slavery and Traf-ficking Prevention Month to draw at-tention to human trafficking and to renew our collective efforts to elimi-nate this practice in the United States and around the world. 
Mr. M
CCONNELL. I ask unanimous 
consent that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.

I further ask that the Senate then proceed to consideration of H.R. 203, the Clay Hunt SAV Act, under the previous order.

IN HONOR OF PENNY GAGE 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, January 30, 2015 
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Ms. Penny Gage for her dedication and commitment to the Dental Industry. Ms. Gage has served as a Tri-County Dental Soci-ety executive director for over 30 years. Dur-ing this time membership expanded from 700 to 2000 members. She was a strong promoter in building a relationship between the society and the dental students within the two dental schools in the program’s area. Ms. Gage has been active in participating with the American Association of Dental Editors and Journalist organization in providing ideas and proof-read-ing the AADEJ’s newsletters. She has also served with the American Dental Association. 
During her time with the Tri-County Dental 
Society she developed the ‘‘Give Kids a Smile’’ program as well as encouraged mem-bers to help provide free dental clinics. That program has led to another exceptional pro-gram, ‘‘Give Adults a Smile’’, which she also supports. Ms. Gage has developed a network of relationships throughout dentistry and has been essential to its promotion and progress in these areas. Actions such as hers have helped to make more smiles possible. 
Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I 
recognize Ms. Penny Gage for her long time service to the Tri-County Dental Society and oral health promotion as a whole. Her achievements in expanding membership and programming helped to improve the lives of many and help everyone to smile more.

HONORING THE LEGACY OF 
LAURA W. MURPHY 
HON. JOHN CONYERS, JR. 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, January 30, 2015 
Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor one of the most prominent and impor-tant civil liberties and civil rights advocates of our time—my friend, Laura W. Murphy. Laura is the longest serving director of the Wash-ington Legislative Office of the American Civil Liberties Union, and will be stepping down at the end of the month. It is my pleasure to honor her public service and to wish her well in her next chapter. Most recently, Laura was instrumental in advising Attorney General Eric Holder and the United States Sentencing Commission on ways to reduce overcrowding among federal prison populations. She worked closely with Attorney General Holder and lead-ers of the House and Senate in passing the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, a law that re-duced the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine, which ignited a move-ment to finally begin to end racial disparities in our criminal justice system. Among Laura’s 
other profound legislative accomplishments was working closely with Congress and the White House to build support for essential and federally funded reproductive health services for servicemembers and their dependents in cases of rape and incest. This was among the few abortion rights victories of the last 40 years. 
Laura has been a leading voice in Wash-
ington, D.C. and throughout the country for freedom of speech, including her office’s tire-less efforts to preserve the First Amendment in the face of calls for a constitutional amend-ment that would lead to laws against so-called flag desecration, that would restrict internet free speech, and that would censor lyrics in rap and other music genres. She has been a tenacious advocate for checks and balances to prevent abuses by Intelligence agencies and finally rolling back the significant over-reach of the USA Patriot Act. Her work on LGBT rights, mass incarceration and racial profiling, comprehensive immigration reform, privacy, reproductive rights, and voting rights has been peerless. 
Laura is a familiar face in Congress, and 
among the few people who can call both Rep-resentative M
AXINE WATERS and Senator 
MITCH MCCONNELL friends, an advocate who 
has shown the nation how to achieve bipar-tisan success in these hyper-partisan times. She has testified more than a dozen times be-fore the House and Senate and is a frequent contributor to national dialogue on critical leg-islative issues. One of the ACLU’s most promi-nent spokespersons, Laura is also an author, including book chapters on homeland security and the African American community’s re-sponse to the 9/11 attacks. Repeatedly named among the most influential advocates in Washington, D.C. and frequently cited by the Washington Post, Laura has been an impor-tant voice for more than four decades, advis-ing U.S. Presidents from Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama. 
We in Congress are losing not only a tire-
less advocate for civil liberties and civil rights, we are losing a dear friend, respected and ad-mired by all who know her. I am hopeful that she will remain close at hand and active in the fight for basic American values. Those closest to her know that fighting for justice is in Lau-ra’s DNA—she is a direct descendent of one of the signers of the Declaration of Independ-ence, Philip Livingston. 
I urge you to join me in wishing Laura Mur-
phy all the best, to congratulate her as she faces new adventures, and to thank her for her many years of service. HONORING ST. JOSEPH’S MEDICAL 
CENTER FAMILY MEDICINE RESI-DENCY PROGRAM 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, January 30, 2015 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, great healthcare 
organizations are a tremendous asset to any community. St. Joseph’s Medical Center’s Family Residency Program has undoubtedly been one of those fantastic assets in West-chester, helping train and ready the family physicians of tomorrow now for over 4 dec-
ades. 
Established in 1974, the medical center was 
the first Residency Program of its kind in the entire Westchester County. Beginning with one resident in the mid-1970’s, the program has grown over the years to now have 30 resi-dents, with an annual graduating class of 10. 
The program’s residents learn to treat the 
whole patient, become aware of family dynam-ics, and emphasize prevention and education in the practice of medicine. Although the resi-dency program started at a time when primary care had been outpaced by specialization, it has become increasingly more important as our nation’s healthcare system and the public recognize the value of prevention and patient centered care. 
All told, the Family Medicine Residency pro-
gram has graduated 312 family physicians over the course of its 40 year existence. Many of those graduating physicians have chosen to stay in Westchester, and have developed into some of the finest physicians in the entire country. Others have gone on to complete fel-lowships and teach at major medical centers and university hospitals. 
The St. Joseph’s community is proud to 
have such a distinguished residency program that has produced so many outstanding family physicians. As the elected representative of St. Joseph’s in Congress, I am equally proud to say that I have one of the premiere resi-dency programs in the world housed within my district. 
In recognition of the program’s many con-
tributions to Saint Joseph’s, the Medical Cen-ter presented the Family Medicine Residency Program with the 2014 Outstanding Service Award. It was a well deserved honor and I want to congratulate all of the talented and dedicated men and women who have made the program such a tremendous success.

Atlanta is now widely considered a hub in the complex web of illegal human trafficking in our nation. Hundreds of young women and chil-dren are ensnared in this criminal enterprise and are funneled through metro Atlanta on a daily basis. One of the most egregious as-pects of human trafficking is that it takes place in the shadows, and we can only estimate the number of young women and children this af-fects. Congress must do all we can to combat and eliminate this terrible practice that threat-ens the foundation of our country. 
I am pleased that the Strengthening Child 
Welfare Response to Trafficking Act is being debated on the floor today, Mr. Speaker. This legislation, along with other measures passed through the U.S. House of Representatives this week, will make a significant contribution in the fight to end human trafficking. 
Specifically, H.R. 469 creates and expands 
stringent reporting requirements for state child welfare institutions so that we can more easily track illicit activity. With this information, we will be more equipped to address the needs of children who are trafficking victims. Mr. Speak-er, I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 469.

HONORING BARBARA P. SMITH 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, January 30, 2015 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, those who dedi-
cate themselves to improving their neighbor-hood become cornerstones of the community. Barbara P. Smith is one of those cornerstones in Yonkers, who for 32 years has been an ed-ucator, civic leader and crusader. 
Barbara began bettering the Yonkers com-
munity in 1982 as a teacher at the Orchard School at Andrus Children’s Home on North Broadway. She taught a range of subjects from math and science to social studies and home economics. Eventually Barbara was ele-vated to Assistant Principal and in 1994 she and the school were recognized for their ef-forts and achievements with an invitation to the White House to meet then President Clin-ton. Barbara subsequently returned to the classroom where she could take a more hands on approach to teaching. 
Outside of the classroom, Barbara has en-
gaged in a number of civic groups aimed at serving the community. For the past 36 years she has served as board member and Presi-dent of the Hudson River Community Associa-tion (HRCA) of Northwest Yonkers, a once dormant organization she helped resurrect. 
Barbara has also generously given her time 
to organizations like the Yonkers Committee for Smart Development, which she served as an advisor to in 2008, and the advisory board for the First District of Council Woman Pat McDow in 2007. When time permits, she also likes to partake in a wide array of volunteer work aimed at community improvement. Bar-
bara shares the same goals as the organiza-tions she works with: to stabilize, improve, support and promote the wonderful city of Yonkers. I believe she has achieved those goals admirably. 
Last year, the Luther V. Garrison Masonic 
Foundation Inc. Scholarship Committee hon-ored Barbara as their Woman of the Year for 2014. It was a supremely appropriate honor for one of Yonkers’ most dedicated citizens. Congratulations to her on receiving such well- deserved recognition.

FREEDOM OF SPEECH IN TURKEY 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, January 30, 2015 
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ex-
press my concerns about the current efforts to punish and stifle freedom of expression in Tur-key and to share my worry that Turkey is drift-ing away from the tolerant secular nation founded by Kemal Ataturk almost 100 years ago and towards religious extremism and authoritarianism. 
The current Government in Turkey has ar-
rested members of Turkish media deemed non-supportive of the government. For dec-ades, Turkey has had a free press and the freedom to disagree and vigorous political de-bate. It is a disturbing negative trend for the current government to reverse decades of transparency and to seek to impose authoritarianism. 
I am informed that Mr. Ekrem Dumanli, edi-
tor-in-chief of Zaman, a daily newspaper in Turkey, and Hidayet Karaca, General Manager of Samanyolu Media Group, were arrested on December 14, 2014. To the shame of the cur-rent leadership, Hidayet Karaca is still in de-tention awaiting trial. They were not arrested for actual crimes, but on transparently political charges, thus bringing the total number of de-tained press and media personalities to 29. These members of the media have ties to the Islamic scholar Fethullah Gulen, a scholar who preaches tolerance and peace and who is a known critic of the Erdogan Administration. 
In December 2013, allegations of corruption 
were levied against the Erdogan Administra-tion based on legal investigations. Afterwards, about some 400 people (including 150 stated Gulen supporters) were monitored on Twitter and ultimately the Turkish people’s access to Twitter was blocked. These arrests, and the effort to stifle opposition, have a chilling effect on freedom, democracy, and economic pros-perity for all of Turkey. Turkey’s bid for acces-sion to the European Union continues to lan-guish under these policies—before negotia-tions on the matter develop, Turkey must rec-ognize basic press freedoms and the right to political dissent. 
Turkey plays a critical role as an ally to the 
United States in the Middle East. To allow it to go down the road of sectarian extremism and authoritarianism without meaningful dis-cussion and diplomacy is disconcerting. Tur-key is a key leader in the region and a cul-tural, historic, and political bulwark between the Middle East, Europe, and Asia. Turkey is an important member of NATO, and I believe all rational people want to see the Turkish Government abandon intimidation and em-
brace a free press and tolerance of dissenting voices. The Turkey founded by Ataturk de-serves our support. International remonstration is needed to bring it back to the ranks of na-tions that do not fear its own people, do not fear opposition, and do not fear universal free-doms.

HONORING JERRY GALELLA 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, January 30, 2015 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, those who 
choose the path of civic engagement can ac-complish wonderful things for their commu-nities. In Yonkers there are few who can claim they have done more to support the local neighborhoods than Jerry Galella. 
Born seven minutes before his twin brother, 
Jerry grew up in the Bronx and is the oldest of three children. After graduating from Dewitt Clinton High School, Jerry served in the United States Army from 1971 to 1973 and after his discharge became a grocery store manager for the next 40 years. 
In 2007, Jerry became a full-fledged mem-
ber of the Yonkers community when he joined the ShopRite of Greenway Plaza as Store Di-rector. Remarkably, in the seven years Jerry has been with ShopRite he has become affili-ated with over 25 different churches and nu-merous other community organizations throughout Yonkers. His volunteer work has included helping out with three college schol-arship funds, including the Yonkers African American Cultural Club, the Dominican Cul-tural Club of Yonkers, and the Hispanic Pro-fessional Scholarship fund. As a result of his efforts, Jerry has been honored various acco-lades and awards from a wide array of schools, churches, and veterans’ associations, just to name a few. 
As devoted to helping out the community as 
Jerry is, his real passion is for his family. He met his wife, Linda, at age 13 in 8th grade, and was immediately smitten. The teenage sweethearts would later become married and for the past 32 years have lived together in Carmel, NY. Over the course of their 40 year marriage Jerry and Linda have raised three wonderful children and have six amazing grand children, all who live within 15 miles of each other. Jerry also generously gives his time to many different organizations in the Carmel community, ranging from little league to organizations assisting veterans of the Viet-nam War. 
In 2014, the Luther V. Garrison SR. Ma-
sonic Foundation Inc. Scholarship Committee named Jerry Galella their 2014 Man of the Year. He was incredibly deserving of the honor, and I wish to congratulate him on re-ceiving the well-deserved recognition.

the Consumer Electronics Hall of Fame for his 
contribution and significant achievements to the industry. 
As a local growing up in Scopus, Missouri, 
he graduated from Woodland High School and moved to Illinois to work in the steel and wood industries. In 1971 he founded Ivey Elec-tronics to produce bookshelf speakers en-cased in a burn and spill-proof walnut laminate for the student market of Northwestern Univer-sity. 
Loyd joined the Consumer Electronics Asso-
ciation in 1974 and presented his first product there before merging with American Case Company to create American Acoustic Labs. 
American Acoustic Labs became MiTek 
Corporation in 1979, which went on to become one of the United States’ largest manufactur-ers of car and home speakers. MiTek has grown into a global enterprise with offices around the world. 
Loyd has been married to his wife Debi 
since 1968 and is the father of two sons. He also serves as a sheriffs deputy and depart-ment pilot in Bollinger Country. It is my privi-lege to recognize his achievements and last-ing contributions before the House of Rep-resentatives.

HONORING LUBA GLASSER 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, January 30, 2015 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, religion often has 
the power to inspire and motivate a person in truly remarkable ways that can shape entire communities. That has certainly been the case with Luba Glasser, a constituent of mine who has volunteered her time and energy for nu-merous Jewish organizations. 
Luba was born in Moscow and immigrated 
to the United States with her family at the age of four. She was enrolled in a Jewish Day School so that she would receive a Jewish education, something she could not have at-tained in the former Soviet Union, and began to gain a love and appreciation for Judaism. 
Luba’s faith became the impetus for her vol-
unteerism, which began in 2005 with the Rus-sian American Jewish Experience (RAJE). Luba spent all of her free evenings and week-ends helping the RAJE with the organization of their Shabbat and holiday programs, social events, and student trips to Israel, all while successfully maintaining a day job as a Real Estate Tax Consultant for New York Water Management. 
In 2006, Luba joined RAJE as their full-time 
Fellowship Coordinator, where she was re-sponsible for the student and young adult Jewish identity and community development programming. Over the next three years Luba staffed over 15 trips to Israel. 
Luba’s devotion to the Jewish community 
led her to return to school, where she received her LMSW from Yeshiva University in 2011. She then began working with Holocaust sur-vivors at the Jewish Community Council of Greater Coney Island and joined the Northeast Jewish Center (NEJC) community, which be-came her permanent home. 
Luba married Craig Glasser in 2012 and 
shortly thereafter became the proud mother of Aaron Dov. In spite of everything on her plate, Luba continues to open her home to the com-
munity for Shabbos dinners, cook for syna-gogue events, maintain the NEJC website, and teach classes. She is a beacon of light for the NEJC community and was incredibly de-serving of being the organization’s honoree in 2014.

HONORING MARGARET O. GRIFFIN 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, January 30, 2015 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, a life filled with 
civic engagement enriches the soul and has the ability to raise entire communities. Such has been the case with Margaret O. Griffin, better known to her friends and family as Ollie, whose dedication to the St. Joseph’s Medical Center and beyond has had a profound and lasting impact in Yonkers and the surrounding areas. 
Ollie was born in Yonkers and attended St. 
Denis Grammar School, then Sacred Heart High School. She received her Bachelor of Science degree from Marquette University and upon graduation began working as a research aide at Sloan-Kettering Institute in Rye. After working for the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research, Ollie returned to school for a Master of Science degree followed by a Ph.D. in Biology from Fordham University. 
In 1994, Ollie retired from research and 
teaching which allowed her to increase her in-volvement in community affairs. She served on the boards of Fox House and the Ireland Fund and was a trustee of the Woman’s Insti-tute for many years. Ollie was also a long-time member of the Saint Joseph’s Seminary Fes-tival Chorale, which she was privileged to sing with at the Pallium ceremony in Rome. 
Ollie continues to be an active member in 
several other community clubs, including the Morsemere Garden Club, the Bonita Quilters, the Pelican Patchers and the Pelican Landing Singers. The highlight of Ollie’s community service though has been her work at St. Jo-seph’s, which began in 1993 as a trustee. She has served as an active and enthusiastic member until September of 2014 and made many great contributions to the center’s devel-opment and success. 
Ollie’s other great passion has been her 
three children, Colleen, Daniel, and Katherine, who she raised with her beloved husband, William, to whom she was married for 52 years. She also takes great pride in her six grandchildren, Shannon, William, Jack, Mi-chael, Sean, and Brian. 
St. Joseph’s Medical Center honored Ollie 
with the 2014 Outstanding Service Award, and a more fitting honoree they could not have 
found. Congratulations to Ollie on receiving this wonderful honor.

LNG PERMITTING CERTAINTY AND 
TRANSPARENCY ACT 
SPEECH OF  
HON. JODY B. HICE 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Wednesday, January 28, 2015 
Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in strong support of H.R. 351—the LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act. 
H.R. 351 eliminates the ability for Wash-
ington bureaucrats to needlessly block the construction of liquefied natural gas (LNG) ex-port facilities. Once the Department of Energy receives an application and environmental re-views have been completed, this legislation will place a thirty day deadline on the DOE in order to expedite permitting. One month is plenty of time for a determination to be made once all studies have been completed. 
Mr. Speaker, for the past five years this 
process has been painfully slow. Since 2010, the DOE has only fully processed five of the 37 applications received for LNG export to countries where a Free Trade Agreement is not in place. These delays have inhibited our ability to reach our potential as a global en-ergy producer, and the bill we have before us will remove some of the burdensome regula-tions that currently exist. 
Additionally, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 351 will help 
put hardworking Americans back to work. A NERA Economic Consulting report informs us that making the needed investment to con-struct LNG export facilities will put 45,000 of our nation’s unemployed back to work. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation also has the 
ability to be used as a strong economic for-eign policy tool. Less than a year ago, Vladi-mir Putin attempted to increase his power through force with the acquisition of Crimea and the prolonged stand-off in Eastern Ukraine. As a result, a number of our allies in Europe were placed in a tough spot because Russia is such a significant natural gas pro-ducer across the continent. 
Despite the current economic woes that 
plague the Russian Federation, in order for us to prevent future aggressive posturing by Putin, we must undercut his ability to hold the region hostage because of energy. H.R. 351 will allow us to build our domestic infrastruc-ture, which will give our European allies a place to turn in the event of future Russian ag-gression. 
Mr. Speaker, for our own economic benefit, 
as well as the economic diplomacy that ex-panded LNG exports will provide, I ask all of my colleagues to support H.R. 351.

HONORING NADEM J. SAYEGH 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, January 30, 2015 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, there are few pro-
fessions that serve the public good like healthcare. Committing one’s life to providing people with excellent medical care is a noble calling, a calling Nadem Sayegh has an-swered with distinction. 
A lifelong resident of Yonkers, Nadem de-
cided to pursue a career in medicine, and be-came a specialist in the field of Endocrinology. 
Following medical school, Nadem opened a 
private practice in 1994 and later became Manager of Southern Westchester Diabetes, with offices in both the Bronx and Yonkers. In addition, he also operates Broadway Medical Services, a clinic in Yonkers serving a diverse population of residents. The clinic was sched-uled to close in 2009, but through Nadem’s in-credible efforts the clinic is not only open, but thriving, and now treats more than 15,000 pa-tients every year, an incredible feat. 
Nadem has been recognized by many orga-
nizations over the years for his commitment to healthcare excellence. He was honored by the Jessie Banks Foundation for his contributions to those affected with diabetes, and in 2013 received the Father of the Year Award by the American Diabetes Association, an organiza-tion of which he was later named New York Chapter President. 
Nadem’s community involvement also ex-
tends beyond the field of medicine. He has served the Virgin Mary Church since its incep-tion in 1966 and has done public speaking and counseling work for numerous organiza-tions. 
But for Nadem, his greatest blessing has al-
ways been his family; his beautiful wife Diana, and their three sons, all currently enrolled in college. Their love and support has been in-strumental to Nadem’s success and the growth of his work. 
A true pillar of the healthcare community, 
Nadem served on the medical board of St. Jo-seph’s Medical Center and became its Presi-dent in 2006–2007. The center decided to honor Nadem with the 2014 Outstanding Serv-ice Award, and its safe to say they found a particularly deserving honoree. Congratula-tions to Nadem on the honor. CONGRATULATING DR. JOHN 
‘‘ROB’’ MARSH ON BEING NAMED THE 2014 COUNTRY DOCTOR OF THE YEAR 
HON. BOB GOODLATTE 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, January 30, 2015 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, the char-
acter of a community is often defined by the individuals who call it home and the actions of those individuals in service to others. Dr. John ‘‘Rob’’ Marsh of Middlebrook, Virginia, who practices medicine in the heart of the Shen-andoah Valley, exemplifies this type of service that is truly for the betterment of his commu-nity. 
It is my honor to congratulate Dr. Marsh on 
being named the 2014 Country Doctor of the Year by StaffCare. The Country Doctor of the Year Award recognizes ‘‘the spirit, skill, and dedication of America’s rural medical practi-tioners.’’ This is indeed a well-deserved rec-ognition. 
In times of great change, especially in the 
field of health care, it is encouraging to know that someone like Dr. Marsh is still engaged in the practice of medicine. He is dedicated to serving those in his community and not always in conventional settings. He drops by for reg-ular house calls, makes rounds at the hospital, and presides over a long-term care facility. Dr. Marsh also serves others who are just passing through at his clinic located alongside a truck stop by the interstate in Raphine, Virginia. 
Dr. Marsh’s service in the United States 
Army as a military physician is well known. He cared for the wounded members of Delta Force in war zones and nearly lost his own life in a mortar attack in Somalia; despite his own wounds, Dr. Marsh continued to tend to others who had been injured. Dr. Marsh is a deco-rated military physician, having received the Legion of Merit, two Bronze Stars, a Purple Heart, the Department of Defense Meritorious Service Medal, and the Army Meritorious Service Medal. 
With his wife, Barbara, and their children, 
Dr. Marsh has deep roots in Virginia, and for that I am grateful. It has been an honor to know Dr. Marsh over the years as well as his father, former Virginia U.S. Representative and Secretary of the Army, John Marsh. 
For many in the Shenandoah Valley, Dr. 
Marsh is much more than a doctor. He is a friend, a fellow farmer, and a pillar of the com-munity. Dr. Marsh’s contributions are immeas-urable, and this award is only the smallest token of gratitude he is owed. I wish him and his family the best.

HONORING FRANK RITI 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, January 30, 2015 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, civic minded com-
munity groups are only as strong and effective as the members who lead them. That is why the Bronx-Westchester South Division of Kiwanis, under the leadership of Lieutenant Governor Frank Riti, has been so successful. 
As Lieutenant Governor, Frank has over-
seen 12 Kiwanis Clubs in his division, includ-ing those in Bronx Shore, Hartsdale, Mount 
Vernon, North East Bronx, Riverdale and Yon-kers. He has made 3 official visits to each club and during his tenure has made a point of hosting events that bring all divisions together to create a communal spirit in the Kiwanis or-ganization. 
Working to fulfill the goals set forth by New 
York State Kiwanis Governor Joseph Aiello, Frank encouraged all of his clubs to partici-pate in the Governor’s Project which centered on autism awareness. With Frank’s hard work the South Division was able to raise critical funds for autism causes and hold programs dedicated to raising awareness. Frank was also instrumental in the ‘‘Treats for Troops’’ Kiwanis program which sent gift packages to our young men and women serving overseas. Both the Governor’s Project and ‘‘Treats for the Troops’’ were highly successful. 
Frank was also a big supporter of the 
Kiwanis International project ‘‘Eliminate’’ which deals with maternal neo-natal tetanus issues plaguing families on a global scale. Frank’s ability to bring his 12 clubs together to support these causes was what made them success-ful, and led to their collective contributions being recognized by both the New York State District and International Kiwanis respectively. 
Prior to his wonderful work with Kiwanis, 
Frank worked in the health care field, serving as head of occupational therapy in nursing homes in both Westchester and the Bronx. Frank was beloved by both his staff and pa-tients and gave many years of service to the field. 
The Yonkers Kiwanis Club honored Frank at 
a dinner which celebrated their 85 years of service to the Yonkers community in 2014. I believe there was no more fitting honoree than Frank Riti, and wish to offer him my sincerest congratulations on that wonderful recognition.

HONORING LT. COL. ED SAYLOR 
HON. DAVID G. REICHERT 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, January 30, 2015 
Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of the late Lt. Col. Ed Saylor. Lt. Col. Saylor was part of the infamous Doolittle Raiders who risked their lives during World War II. These men were responsible for rais-ing the morale of an entire nation after the devastating attack on Pearl Harbor. 
Lt. Col. Saylor passed away Wednesday, 
but he is not gone from our hearts. His heroic actions will tell his story long after we are gone. Without him, the USS Hornet’ s plane 
number 15, also known as ‘‘TNT’’ and a crit-ical part of the Doolittle Raid, would never have flown in 1941. Sgt. Saylor, as he was then, was able to remove and repair the en-gine of ‘‘TNT’’—the first time this had ever been done at sea. He was also responsible for writing the words ‘‘Democracy’s Ace in the Hole’’ on the side of the plane just before take-off. This message and symbolism would resonate for the duration of the war, helping to remind our troops that our side was fighting the right battle. 
Mr. Speaker, Lt. Col. Saylor went above and 
beyond the call of duty. He served our country in the military for 28 years; he helped America rise to greatness from the brink of despair,

HONORING BEATRICE CASTIGLIA- 
CATULLO 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, January 30, 2015 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, sometimes a sim-
ple civic organization intended to help and im-prove a small community can turn into a pillar of hope for an entire city. That has undoubt-edly been the case with Regional Aid for In-terim Needs, or RAIN, thanks in large part to its founder, Beatrice Castiglia-Catullo. 
Bea has given her life to her community and 
always advocates on behalf of those marginalized. RAIN was founded in 1964 to serve those in need as a multi-social service agency. It provides an array of invaluable services to the senior community of the Bronx, many of whom are handicapped, home bound, or otherwise incapable of providing them-selves with certain necessities. 
RAIN has full-service neighborhood senior 
centers, home-delivered meals, transportation services, assistance with benefits and entitle-ments, case management and elder abuse services, in addition to community-based mo-bile meals for homeless and hungry persons. Their commitment to helping the elderly popu-lation has also led to the sponsorship of two residential housing projects for low-income seniors and an affiliated home attendant pro-gram that provides in-home attendant and care services. 
Building off their incredible success in the 
Bronx, RAIN has recently expanded its serv-ices to Manhattan and has licensed to provide Home Health Care in all five New York City boroughs as well as Westchester County. 
This type of wonderful advocacy has all 
been made possible by Bea, whose passion and drive is still to this day the heartbeat of the RAIN operation. Her legacy of procuring funding for 1600 meals on wheels, 325 daily meals to the hungry and homeless, and 11 senior centers is truly remarkable, and her life has been a tremendous inspiration to me as I serve the public in Congress. 
RAIN celebrated Bea’s 98th birthday at their 
50th Anniversary celebration on October 30th, 2014. I want to personally thank Bea for all she has done and all she continues to do for the constituents in my district and well beyond. She has created something truly phenomenal and should be incredibly proud of the achieve-ment.

HONORING THE LIFE OF EDWARD 
CABELL BRAND 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, January 30, 2015 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of 
myself and Representative B OBGOODLATTE , I 
submit these remarks in honor of the remark-able life of (Edward) Cabell Brand and his dedicated service to our nation and our com-
munity. Among other things, Mr. Brand was a philanthropist, public servant, and an activist, widely recognized for his efforts to improve the lives of others. Though we may not have agreed with all of his political views, we can say without a doubt that Mr. Brand made an indelible difference in the Roanoke Valley. 
Born and raised in Salem, Virginia, Mr. 
Brand graduated in 1940 from Andrew Lewis High School. He attended Virginia Military In-stitute (VMI), and while there, was called to serve his country in World War II in the 70th Infantry Division. He returned to VMI to com-plete his education, and graduated in its class of 1944 as valedictorian. 
Mr. Brand continued his studies at the Har-
vard Business School and at the University of Virginia. He became an economic analyst in the Intelligence Office of Berlin’s Military Gov-ernment and with the United States Foreign Service in Europe. By the end of his military service, Mr. Brand held the rank of Captain, and also received the Bronze Star. 
Mr. Brand returned to Salem, and worked at 
The Ortho Vent Shoe Company, which his grandfather had started a half-century earlier. He worked his way up to President of Ortho Vent, and took it public as the Stuart McGuire Company in 1970 before selling it in 1986 to the Home Shopping Network. 
In 1965, Mr. Brand founded Total Action 
Against Poverty (now called Total Action for Progress), which he believed to be his great-est achievement. This program provides more than 30 programs to the Roanoke Valley, in-cluding the Head Start Program, the Virginia Water Project, and more.

HONORING LOUIS NAVARRO 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, January 30, 2015 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, those who self-
lessly give of themselves to serve their coun-try and community are a special breed. Such is the case with Louis Navarro, who currently serves as Director of the City of Yonkers Of-fice of Veterans’ Affairs. 
Louis was appointed to that position in 2013 
under current Mayor Mike Spano. The ap-pointment was an easy one for the mayor, based on Louis’ impressive career in the armed forces. He served his country with dis-tinction in the United States Army for over three decades as both an active duty and re-serve soldier. 
Louis received numerous medals for his 
time in the armed forces, including the Viet-nam Campaign Medals, the Good Conduct 
Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, the Bronze Star Medal and the Combat Infantry Badge. 
Louis is also a member of several important 
veteran related organizations, including the Vietnam Veterans of America, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the American Legion. 
On a more local level, Louis has taken an 
active role in many Yonkers events and com-mittees. He served as Chairman of the Puerto Rican Day Parade Committee and was the 1st Vice Commander of the Yonkers Central Com-mittee of Veterans Organizations, where he also doubled as the Chairman of the Yonkers Memorial Day Parade in 2013. 
Despite a lifetime of great accomplishments 
serving his country and community, Louis re-mains most proud of the love and support he receives from his family, including his wife, Donna, and their children, Kaylan and James. 
In 2014 the Salvation Army added to Louis’ 
list of accomplishments by honoring him at their annual dinner. I want to echo their senti-ments of congratulations to Louis Navarro for all he has done to protect and better the lives of Americans and the brave men and women who have served in our armed forces for many years. This honor is extremely well-de-served.

EXPAND THE DEFINITION OF 
HOMELESS FOR VETERANS 
HON. JANICE HAHN 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, January 30, 2015 
Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, across the coun-
try, too many victims of domestic violence feel that there is nowhere for them to turn. Lacking resources, help and a safe place to go, some victims stay with their abusers. 
Tragically, too often women veterans are 
among those who find themselves in this hor-rible situation. According to the VA, 39% of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E140 January 30, 2015 
our women veterans report experiencing do-
mestic violence, well above the national aver-age. 
In order to qualify for benefits available to 
homeless veterans through the VA, an indi-vidual must meet the definition of ‘‘homeless’’ codified as part of the McKinney-Vento Home-less Assistance Act. In 2009, the HEARTH Act expanded the definition of homeless to reflect our present reality and include individuals in transitional housing, persons living in motels and persons who would imminently lose their housing. A change was also made to the McKinney-Vento Act to expand the definition of homeless to include individuals fleeing a sit-uation of domestic violence or some other life- threatening condition. This change, however, is not currently reflected in the definition of ‘‘homeless veteran.’’ 
These women are part of a growing number 
of homeless veterans. That is why I am re-introducing this legislation, which will correct and expand the definition of ‘‘homeless vet-eran’’ to include veterans who are fleeing situ-ations of domestic violence. This small change 
will allow those veterans who find the courage and the means to leave their abusers the chance to access the benefits that should be available to all homeless veterans. 
By passing this bill, we will ensure that this 
especially vulnerable population of veterans has the chance to access benefits the Depart-ment of Veterans Affairs already provides. This bill is one small step to ensuring every homeless veteran can access the benefits they deserve.

HONORING MARY HOAR 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, January 30, 2015 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, a lifetime of serv-
ice to one’s community is a truly astonishing feat, which is why I want to take a moment to 
recognize the contributions of Mary Hoar to Yonkers. 
Mary’s story is one of continued service to 
better her community, both as a professional and in her personal life. Following her gradua-tion from Cornell University, Mary began her career as a school teacher in Yonkers. Com-puter technology was always a big part of Mary’s interests as an educator, and became a primary component of her teaching. She went on to teach computer technology to adults later in life. 
While Mary was cultivating her professional 
career she was simultaneously beginning her foray into community service. She started by giving her time to Yonkers Jay-N-Cee, serving as Secretary, Treasurer and President. In 1977, Mary received one of the state division’s highest honors, the Distinguished Service Award, and was later bestowed the Key to the City of Yonkers for her work with the organiza-tion. 
Mary soon began branching out after her 
success with Jay-N-Cee, first by giving her time to the Yonkers Red Cross, serving as Branch Chairman and Vice Chairman as well as Chair of their Centennial, Youth Services and Competition Committees. 
Mary then became involved with the West-
chester March of Dimes, working on the very 
first Yonkers Walkathon Coordinating Com-mittee. She then served on the Executive Board of the Northern Metro Chapter of the March of Dimes for 17 years, and was instru-mental in the organizations Reading Olympics, Golden Gala and Tennis Tournament. 
Mary’s list of volunteer services has also in-
cluded stints on the mayor’s Community Rela-tions Committee, the board of Family Services Society in Yonkers and, currently, she serves as president of the Yonkers Historical Society. 
The Salvation Army honored Mary for all 
she has done for Yonkers at their 2014 annual dinner. The honor was incredibly well de-served. Congratulations to Mary Hoar on this recognition. HONORING DR. TERRY BREWER 
HON. JASON SMITH 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, January 30, 2015 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Dr. Terry Brewer, the founder 
and president of Brewer Science, who recently received the 2014 SEMI award for North America as a result of his impact on the man-ufacturing of integrated circuits in the semicon-ductor industry. The SEMI Award recognizes outstanding technical achievement, and is the highest honor conferred by SEMI. As a global industry association that is composed of 1,900 member companies that are the engine of the future, SEMI creates smarter, faster, and more economical products that improve our lives. 
Dr. Brewer has distinguished himself not 
only as a leader, but as an innovator in the field of technology. Brewer Science is a global technology leader in developing and manufac-turing innovative materials, processes, and equipment used in electronics such as tablet computers, smartphones, digital cameras, tele-visions, and LED lighting. On May 5, 2014, Brewer Science unveiled its new high-volume manufacturing facility at the Rolla National Air-port. This expansion accommodates product demand growth and exemplifies the com-pany’s commitment to continuous improve-ment. From its headquarters in Rolla, Mis-souri, Brewer Science supports its worldwide customers through a service and distribution network in North America, Europe, and Asia. 
It is my pleasure to commend Dr. Brewer for 
his achievements, and I am confident that his business will continue to stay on the forefront of technological advancement.
