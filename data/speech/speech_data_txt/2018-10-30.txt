OMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET , Washington, DC, October 30, 2018. Hon. P
AULRYAN, Speaker, Office of the Speaker, House of Rep-resentatives, Washington, DC. D
EAR MR. SPEAKER : To facilitate applica-tion of sections 302 and 311 of the Congres-sional Budget Act, I am transmitting an up-dated status report on the current levels of on-budget spending and revenues for fiscal year 2018, fiscal year 2019, and for the period of fiscal years 2019 through 2028. This status report is current through October 24, 2018. The term ‘‘current level’’ refers to the amounts of spending and revenues estimated for each fiscal year based on laws enacted or awaiting the President’s signature. Table 1 in the report compares the current levels of total budget authority, outlays, and revenues to the overall limits, as adjusted, contained in H. Con. Res. 71, as agreed to on October 26, 2017, for fiscal year 2018. Table 2 compares the current levels of total budget authority, outlays, and revenues to the over-all limits filed in the Congressional Record on May 10, 2018, for fiscal year 2019 and for the 10-year period of fiscal years 2019 through 2028. These comparisons are needed to implement section 311(a) of the Congres-sional Budget Act, which establishes a rule enforceable with a point of order against measures that would breach the budget reso-lution’s aggregate levels. The table does not show budget authority and outlays for years after fiscal year 2019 because appropriations for those years have not yet been completed. Table 3 compares the current levels of budget authority and outlays for legislative action completed by each authorizing com-mittee with the limits contained in the Statement of Committee Allocations of the Fiscal Year 2018 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget, published in the Congressional Record on November 2, 2017, for fiscal year 2018. For fiscal year 2018, ‘‘legislative action’’ refers to legislation enacted after the adop-tion of the levels set forth in H. Con. Res. 71 and the Statement of Committee Allocations referenced above. Table 4 compares the cur-rent levels of budget authority and outlays for legislative action completed by each au-thorizing committee with the limits filed in the Congressional Record on May 10, 2018, for fiscal year 2019 and for the 10-year period of fiscal years 2019 through 2028. These com-parisons are needed to enforce the point of order under section 302(f) of the Congres-sional Budget Act, which prohibits the con-sideration of measures that would breach the section 302(a) allocation of new budget au-thority for the committee that reported the measure. It is also needed to implement sec-tion 311(b), which exempts committees that comply with their allocations from the point of order under section 311(a). Tables 5 and 6 compare the current status of discretionary appropriations for fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019, respectively, with the ‘‘section 302(b)’’ suballocations of discretionary budget authority and outlays among Appropriations subcommittees. The comparison is needed to enforce section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act be-cause the point of order under that section equally applies to measures that would

breach the applicable section 302(b) sub-allocation. The table also provides supple-mentary information on spending in excess of the base discretionary spending limits al-lowed under section 251(b) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act. Table 7 compares the levels of changes in mandatory programs (CHIMPs) contained in appropriations acts with the permissible lim-its on CHIMPs as specified in section 5103 of H. Con. Res. 71. Table 8 compares the levels of CHIMPs contained in appropriations acts with the permissible limits on CHIMPs as deemed in force pursuant to section 30104(f) of Public Law 115–123, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. These comparisons are needed to enforce a rule against fiscal year 2018 and fis-cal year 2019 appropriations measures con-taining CHIMPs that would breach the per-missible limits for fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019, respectively. Table 9 displays the current level of ad-vance appropriations for fiscal year 2019 of accounts identified for advance appropria-tions pursuant to the statement of the Chairman published in the Congressional Record on November 2, 2017. These tables are needed to enforce a rule against appropria-tions bills containing advance appropria-tions that are: (i) not identified in the state-ment of the Chairman published in the Con-gressional Record on November 2, 2017 and (ii) would cause the aggregate amount of such appropriations to exceed the level spec-ified in section 5104 of H. Con. Res. 71. In addition, a letter from the Congres-sional Budget Office is attached that sum-marizes and compares the budget impact of legislation enacted after the adoption of the budget resolution against the budget resolu-tion aggregates in force. If you have any questions, please contact Brad Watson. Sincerely, S
TEVE WOMACK , Chairman, Committee on the Budget.

Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017 (P.L. 115–48); a joint resolution granting the con- sent and approval of Congress for the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of Maryland, and the District of Columbia to enter in to a compact relating to the establishment of the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission (P.L. 115–54); the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 and Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2017 (P.L. 115–56); t he Emergency Aid to American Survivors of Hurricanes Irma and Jose Overseas Act (P.L. 115–57); the Depart- ment of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act of 2017 (P.L. 115–62); the Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extensi on Act of 2017 (P.L. 115–63); the Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria Education Relief Act of 2017 (P.L. 115– 64); and the Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2017 (P.L. 115–72). 
bIn the House of Representatives, and pursuant to section 314(d) of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974  (Congressional Budget Act), amounts designated as an emergency requirement shall not count for purposes of Title III and Title IV of the Congressional Budget Act, and are excluded from current level totals. In addition, em ergency funding designated that was not designated pursuant to the Deficit Control Act does not count for certain budgetary enforcement purposes. Those amounts, which are not included in the current level totals, are as follows: Budget authority Outlays Revenues

cSections 1001–1004 of the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114–255) require that certain funding provided for 2017 through 2026 to the Department of Health and Human Services—in particular the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health—be excluded from estimates for the purposes of the Deficit Control Act or the Congressional B udget Act. Therefore, the amounts shown in this report do not include $866 million in budget authority and $706 million in estimated outlays from such amounts. 
dThe Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115–123) contains seven divisions: Division A, Subdivision 2 of Division B, and Divisio ns C–F contain authorizing legislation, of which the budgetary effects of Subdivision 2 of Division B were designated as being for emergency requirements. Subdivisions 1 and 3 of Division B contain appropriations legislation: Subdivis ion 1 provided supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2018 for disaster relief and designated those amounts as being for emergency requirements; Subdivision 3 provided continuing appropriations until March 23, 2018, while Secti on 158 provided authority, for the duration of fiscal year 2018, for the Secretary of Energy to draw down and sell crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Division G of P.L. 115–123 provided for the budgetary treatment of Div isions A–F. 
eIn the House of Representatives, and pursuant to section 5111 of H.Con.Res. 71, the budgetary effects related to the Federal Re serve’s surplus funds are excluded from current level totals. As a result, the amounts shown do not in- clude estimated increases in revenues of $2,450 million in fiscal year 2018, $2,180 million over the 2018–2022 period, and $1,7 50 million over the 2018–2027 period. 
fSections 540–543 of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2017 (Division F of P.L. 115–31), extended several immigration programs through the end of fiscal year 2017. Several continuing resolutions continued those authorities through March 23, 2018, and sections 202–205 of title II of Division M of P.L. 115–141 further extended those  programs through 2018. Consistent with the budgetary treatment of Divisions K–V of P.L. 115–141, the budgetary effects of extending the immigration programs through March 23, 2018, are charged to the Appropriations Committee; wh ile the remainder is charged to the relevant authorizing committees. 
gFor purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the House, the resolution, as approved by the House of  Representatives, does not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a result, current level does not include those items. 
hPeriodically, the House Committee on the Budget revises the budgetary levels in H. Con. Res. 71, pursuant to various provisions  of the resolution. Budget authority Outlays Revenues

aSections 1001–1004 of the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114–255) require that certain funding provided for 2017 through 2026 to the Department of Health and Human Services—in particular the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health—be excluded from estimates for the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emer- gency Deficit Co ntrol Act of 1985 (Deficit Control Act) or the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (Congressional Budget Act). Therefore, the amounts shown in this report do not include $771 million in budget authority, and $7 67 million in estimated outlays. 
bFor purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the House, the resolution, as approved by the House of  Representatives, does not include budg- et authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a result, current level does not include those items. 
cIn the House of Representatives during the 115th Congress, pursuant to section 5111 of H.Con.Res. 71, the budgetary effects rel ated to the Federal Reserve’s surplus funds are excluded from current level totals. As a result, the amounts shown do not include estimated increases in revenues of $655 million in fiscal year 2019, $570 million over the 2019–20 23 period, and $455 million over the 2019–2028 period. 
dDivision I of P.L. 115–254 provided $1.68 billion in supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2019, and designated those amo unts as being for emergency requirements pursuant to section 251 of the Deficit Control Act. In general, the budgetary effects of authorizing legislation are recorded as direct spending or revenue. However, consistent with the langu age in Division I, and at the direction of the House Committee on the Budget, those budgetary effects are clas- sified as discretionary spending. 
eIn the House of Representatives, and pursuant to section 314(d) of the Congressional Budget Act, amounts designated as an emerg ency requirement shall not count for purposes of Title III and Title IV of the Congressional Budget Act, and are excluded from current level totals. In addition, emergency funding designated that was not designated pursuant to the D eficit Control Act does not count for certain budgetary enforcement purposes. Those amounts, which are not included in the current level totals, are as follows: Budget authority Outlays Revenues

fSection 30104 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 required—in the absence of a concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2019—that the Chair of the House Committee on the Budget publish the aggregate spending and revenue levels for fiscal year 2019; those aggregate levels were first published in the Congressional Record on May 10, 2018. T he Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 also allows the Chair of the House Committee on the Budget to revise the budgetary aggregates: Budget authority Outlays Revenues

This memorable occasion will be held at the United States Courthouse and Federal Building in Hammond, Indiana. America is a country founded by immi-grants. From its beginning, settlers have come from countries around the world to the United States in search of better lives for their fami-lies. Oath ceremonies are a shining example of what is so great about the United States of America—that people from all over the world can come together and unite as members of a free, democratic nation. These individuals realize that nowhere else in the world offers a better opportunity for success than here in America. On November 2, 2018, the following people, representing many nations throughout the world, will take their oaths of citizenship in Hammond, Indiana: Tantawy Antar Ahmed Tantawy, Caroline Frederika Martin, Jose Mario Carrera Nava, Guadalupe Castellanos de Cordero, Gurneet Singh Bajwa, Lucy Cha-vez Reyes, Geertrui Deroos, Aldo Estrada, Emmanuel Ntita, Gonzalo Torres, Yunae Chung, Kaynaff Zafar Sheikh, Dianne Amanda Torres, Steve Guga Magwegwe Nkosi, Fer-nando Diaz, Kristina Krstanovski, Elba Suarez, Jenny Thompson, Ornella Ntamikevyo, Noreljaleel Mohamad Elshobaly, Lorena Amaya, Dulce Maria Nolasco, Alice Jiang, Niren R. Shah, and Sandip R. Patel. Although each individual has sought to be-come a citizen of the United States for his or her own reasons, be it for education, occupa-tion, or to offer their loved ones better lives, each is inspired by the fact that the United States of America is, as Abraham Lincoln de-scribed it, a country ‘‘. . . of the people, by the people, and for the people.’’ They realize that the United States is truly a free nation. By seeking American citizenship, they have made the decision that they want to live in a place where, as guaranteed by the First Amendment of the Constitution, they can practice religion as they choose, speak their minds without fear of punishment, and assemble in peaceful pro-test should they choose to do so. Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating these individuals who will be-come citizens of the United States of America on November 2, 2018. They, too, are Amer-ican citizens, guaranteed the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We, as a free and democratic nation, con-gratulate them and welcome them. TRIBUTE TO ST. JOHN’S UNITED CHURCH OF CHRIST HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 30, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate a special Iowa church congregation from Creston, Iowa. St. John’s United Church of Christ celebrated their 140th anniversary on October 6, 2018. When the church was established in 1878, sermons were given completely in German and church members didn’t sing but simply chanted their sermons. The church has changed names from St. John’s German Evangelical Lutheran Church to St. John’s Evangelical and Reformed Church in 1935 to St. John’s United Church of Christ in 1961. Members have changed and embraced sing-ing and technology. Sermons are now in English, but the church has continued to be a mainstay in Creston. Mr. Speaker, I applaud and congratulate the members of St. John’s for their many years of faithful attendance and service to God. I am proud to represent them in the United States Congress. I know that my colleagues will join me in congratulating St. John’s and wishing them, their pastor, Rick Titus, and the commu-nity of Creston nothing but joy in the years ahead.

HONORING THE ACHIEVEMENT OF WHITEY’S ICE CREAM 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 30, 2018 Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Whitey’s Ice Cream from the Quad Cities for placing first with their ice cream sandwiches at the National Dairy Expo. Whitey’s Ice Cream has been serving Illinois since 1933, and has a large following in our Congressional district. Whitey’s Ice Cream was founded and owned by Chester ‘‘Whitey’’ Lindgren until 1953, when he sold it to Bob and Norma Tunberg. Their sons, Jon and Jeff Tunberg, serve as its current owners, but leave the President position open for Bob, who has passed on. Whitey’s expanded in 1977 from just Moline to East Moline and Rock Island. In 1984, they expanded to Bettendorf, Iowa and other locations. Since 1988, their ice cream has been able to be purchased in grocery stores across the Midwest. Their ice cream sandwiches, or ‘‘Chippers’’ as they call them, have now placed first at the National Dairy Expo. It is because of businesses such as Whitey’s Ice Cream that I am especially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional District. Mr. Speaker, I would like to again formally congratulate Whitey’s Ice Cream for placing first at the National Dairy Expo for their ‘‘Chip-pers.’’ f 
GARRETT HALL EARNS RANK OF EAGLE SCOUT 
HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 30, 2018 Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Garrett Hall of Sugar Land, TX for earning the rank of Eagle Scout. Eagle Scout is the highest honor a Boy Scout can earn. Only a small percentage of Boy Scouts reach the rank of Eagle Scout. This honor re-quires years of effort to develop the necessary leadership, service and outdoor skills. To earn it, Garrett developed and provided leadership to others in a service project. For his project, Garrett redesigned and built a 2.5 mile com-petition-level orienteering course at Brazos Bend State Park in Needville, TX, which suf-fered damage from Hurricane Harvey. This in-cluded remapping the course with new instruc-tions, and creating and installing 15 posts that could withstand future storms. His dedication to our community has prepared him to be a leader in his future career. The leadership skills he has learned through Boy Scouts are already benefiting our community. On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-sional District of Texas, congratulations again to Garrett for becoming an Eagle Scout. We are proud of his continued success and thank him for his dedication to making our commu-nity a better place.

HONORING STEPHEN PATRICIO FOR HIS SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBU-TIONS TO AGRICULTURE 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 30, 2018 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the achievements of Stephen Patricio as the recipient of the 2018 Western Growers Award of Honor. Throughout his 45- year career, Mr. Patricio has made exceptional contributions to agriculture, including signifi-cant advancements in food safety and public health. Shortly after earning his degree in account-ing from Santa Clara University in 1974, Mr. Patricio began his career in agribusiness. Working as the chief financial advisor and general manager of the melon operation at Jess Telles’ large-scale farm, he gained first- hand experience and developed a funda-mental understanding of the agriculture busi-ness that would drive his life’s work. In 1993, Mr. Patricio and Mr. Telles launched Westside Produce in the Central

San Joaquin Valley of California, which skill-fully connected farmers to the marketplace. Having experienced many challenges, such as the melon food safety crisis and E. coli out-break, he identified a need for scientifically- based information about food safety for both workers and consumers. Mr. Patricio raised millions of dollars to fund research aimed at preventing food-home ill-nesses and worked with University of Cali-fornia, Davis to assess the food safety risks associated with melons. This led to the first mandatory food safety compliance program for the cantaloupe industry in the state. He also played a significant role in the Leafy Greens Marketing Agreements, which have become the model for produce safety in California and Arizona. In addition to Mr. Patricio’s dedication to food safety, he has also become deeply pas-sionate about water rights. He has led the charge in advocating for a sustainable water supply for California farmers and established the first orientation program for agribusinesses that focused solely on water rights. Throughout his long and distinguished ca-reer, Stephen Patricio has received continuous support from his wife Nikki, his children, Blake, Garrett, and Ashley, and more recently from his grandchildren, Yale, Taylor, Peyton, Brook-lyn, Carter, Paxton, Kennedy, and Bryce. They will be by his side at the Award of Honor Din-ner Gala in celebration of this momentous achievement. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in recognition of Stephen Patricio for his remarkable contributions to California agri-culture. His sustained efforts have left a last-ing impact on the health of the nation and continue to shape public policy in California and the Congressional District I have the honor of representing.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 30, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Marian and Brad Tate of Bayard, Iowa on the very special occasion of their 55th wedding anni-versary. They celebrated their anniversary on October 26, 2018. Marian and Brad’s lifelong commitment to each other truly embodies our Iowa values.

COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF BISHOP JAMES WALKER HOOD ON THE ONE HUNDREDTH ANNI-VERSARY OF HIS PASSING HON. G.K. BUTTERFIELD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 30, 2018 Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the legendary Bishop James Walker Hood on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of his passing. Bishop Hood is credited with establishing the North Carolina African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church Con-ference, the Prince Hall Masons of North Carolina, and Livingstone College, all in my home state of North Carolina. On May 30, 1831, James Walker Hood was born to Levi and Harriet Walker Hood on the farm of Ephraim Jackson in Chester County, Pennsylvania, nine miles from Wilmington, Delaware. Hood’s parents instilled their love of the church and a spirit to help fellow African Americans improve their lives in their twelve children. Hood’s father was a Methodist min-ister and his work moved the family around the country as he served various churches. Together, Hood’s parents became involved in the AME Zion church, established as the Methodist church for Blacks. Upon coming of age, James Walker Hood’s moral and religious convictions led him into ministry. In 1856, Hood secured his license to preach from the New York Conference of the AME Zion Church. In the following years, Hood moved to Connecticut and Nova Scotia to preach and work as a missionary. In early 1864, following the path of the Union Army, Hood was appointed to missionary work in North Carolina, recognizing that legal slavery would soon end. He would then stay in North Carolina for the remainder of his life. Although Hood was met with strong opposi-tion in establishing the North Carolina Con-ference of AME Zion Church for African Amer-icans, he persuaded the Black Southern Meth-odist congregations in New Bern and Beaufort, North Carolina to affiliate with the AME Zion Church. Among the more than 300 churches he successfully established in North Carolina are St. Peter’s AME Zion Church (New Bern), Evans Metropolitan AME Zion Church (Fay-etteville), and St. John AME Zion Church (Wil-son). After becoming a Presiding Bishop in 1872, Bishop James Walker Hood resided in Fay-etteville until his death on October 30, 1918. He is interred in Cross Creek Cemetery in Fayetteville. Hood helped establish Zion Wes-ley Institute, now Livingstone College, in Salis-bury, North Carolina to train African American students for the ministry and to become pro-ductive citizens in North Carolina. He presided over the school’s board of trustees for over thirty years. Bishop Hood was politically active on behalf of his people. In 1865, he presided over the first statewide political convention for African Americans. In 1868, he participated in the state constitutional convention which abolished slavery, provided universal male suffrage, and established free public education for all chil-dren. He also held several governmental posi-tions, including magistrate and assistant su-perintendent of the North Carolina Freedman’s Bureau. Bishop Hood was a man of courage, convic-tion, and persistence. He was unwavering in his commitment to the cause of Christianity and the establishment of the AME Zion Church in North Carolina. It is remarkable that Bishop Hood, who had little formal education, would publish five books, including The Negro in the Christian Pulpit (1884) and Sketch of the Early History of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church (1914). Mr. Speaker, Bishop James Walker Hood’s legacy continues through the work of AME Zion’s Board of Bishops: Bishop George Ed-ward Battle, Jr. (Piedmont Episcopal District), Bishop Kenneth Monroe (Eastern North Caro-lina Episcopal District), Bishop Darryl B. Starnes, Sr. (Mid-West Episcopal District), Bishop Dennis V. Proctor (North Eastern Epis-copal District), Bishop Mildred B. Hines (South Atlantic Episcopal District), Bishop W. Darin Moore (Mid-Atlantic Episcopal District), Bishop Seth O. Lartey (Alabama-Florida Episcopal District), Bishop Michael A. Frencher, Sr. (Southwestern Delta Episcopal District), Bishop Staccato Powell (Western Episcopal District), Bishop George D. Crenshaw (Central Southern Africa Episcopal District), Bishop Hilliard Dogbe (Western West Africa Episcopal District), and Bishop Uduak Effiong (Eastern West Africa Episcopal District). By the grace of God, Bishop James Walker Hood left an indelible mark on North Carolina and the country that is still recognized one hundred years after his passing. On behalf of the people of the First Con-gressional District of North Carolina, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Bishop James Walker Hood’s life, work, and legacy on this significant occasion.

RECOGNIZING MR. WILFRED R. D
EFOUR, SR. 
HON. ADRIANO ESPAILLAT 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 30, 2018 Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a constituent from New York’s 13th Congressional District, Mr. Wilfred R. DeFour, Sr. and celebrate him on his 100th Birthday and highlight his service in defense of our na-tion. Mr. DeFour was raised in Harlem where he attended Dewitt Clinton High School, City Col-lege of New York, and the New York Univer-sity School of Commerce. Mr. DeFour served in the 366th Air Service Squadron of the U.S. Army Air Corps and later the 332nd Fighter Group; military aviators and personnel known as a Tuskegee Airmen dur-ing World War II. Mr. DeFour was an aircraft technician work-ing on many of the planes flown by the Tuskegee Airmen. In fact, Mr. DeFour painted the tails of aircraft red by hand that lent the airmen their signature moniker of ‘‘Red Tails’’. Mr. DeFour is a lifelong New Yorker and re-turned to New York City after his military serv-ice to work for the U.S. Postal Service for 33 years where he demonstrated extraordinary pride in his work for the people of Harlem as evidenced by his ascendance to Super-intendent of Special Delivery and Parcel.

TRIBUTE TO FRED MAHER 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 30, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Fred Maher of Council Bluffs, Iowa, for his selection by the Children’s Square U.S.A. Board of Di-rectors to receive a 2018 Jason Award. The Jason Award is given to individuals who ex-emplify the mission of Children’s Square through their life skills and values in their per-sonal lives, work, and community contribu-tions. Fred is a lifelong educator who has touched the lives of generations of students, teachers, and families throughout Council Bluffs. Fred retired from the Council Bluffs Community School District in 2012, after serving for 51 years in the district and 56 years in education. Fred is very active in his church and his com-munity. He is admired by many for his kind-ness, compassion, and willingness to help oth-ers. He never said ‘‘no’’ to a student who needed him. As a teacher and school adminis-trator, Fred said, ‘‘I try to provide guidance and hope. I’ll try to show a kid who thinks he’s hopelessly behind that he can still make it. It’s not hopeless, (and) he’s not helpless, so don’t give up.’’ Mr. Speaker, it is a profound honor to rep-resent leaders like Fred Maher in the United States Congress. It is with great pride that I recognize and applaud him for his selection for the Jason Award given by Children’s Square, U.S.A., and for his commitment to his community, students, and school. I invite my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in congratulating Fred on receiving this award, and I wish him continued success in all his endeavors. f 
HONORING THE 200TH ANNIVER-SARY OF MADISON COUNTY, MIS-SOURI 
HON. JASON SMITH 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 30, 2018 Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the bicentennial birthday of Madison County, Missouri. Named for Presi-dent James Madison, the county was officially organized on December 14, 1818. The Osage and Kickapoo Indians formed trade routes through its rolling farmland and heavily for-ested hills in the early 17th Century. The French prospected for lead here. Indeed, Madison County is on record as having the oldest lead mine west of the Mississippi River. It has also been home to the mining of cobalt, copper, silver and red marble. Early settlers brought the names: DeGuire, LaChance, Viriat, Nicholl, Trudeau, Pratte, Valle, Beauvais, DeClue and Chevalier to the area. Its two major towns are Marquand and the county seat of Fredericktown. Today, Madison County is home to more than 12,000 people and welcomes visitors each year to the Missouri Whitewater Cham-pionships, Marquand Pioneer Days, Madison County Fair and the Azalea Festival. It is my honor to acknowledge this historic birthday be-fore the United States House of Representa-tives and to honor the people of Madison County, Missouri as they celebrate all year long.

HONORING AND REMEMBERING THE SERVICE OF THE TUSKEGEE AIRMEN 
HON. TOM REED 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 30, 2018 Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service of the Tuskegee Airmen. As Veteran’s Day approaches and America remembers the sacrifices of our military men and women, it is important that we recognize the trailblazers that paved the way for our armed forces as we know them today. By the beginning of World War II, air com-bat had become an essential strategic asset in modern warfare. In a segregated military, Afri-can-Americans had been rejected from train-ing as military aviators until Congress passed Appropriations Bill Public Law 18, providing funding for the training of African-American pi-lots. The brave men who answered their coun-try’s call to service would form the first all- black flying unit, commonly called the Tuskegee Airmen. The Tuskegee Airmen served in the 99th Pursuit Squadron of the United States Air Force, their unit consisting of forty-seven offi-cers and four hundred twenty-nine enlisted men. Later they were joined by more combat- ready graduates, the all-black 332nd Fighter Group. These pioneers led the way to deseg-regation in the military and their exemplary combat record helped lead America to victory in Europe. We honor and celebrate these men for their invaluable service to their country, not only in the military, but also in our communities. Given the above, I ask that this Legislative Body pause in its deliberations and join me in remembering the heroic Tuskegee Airmen that served our country. f

CONGRATULATING THE UPPER PE-NINSULA LAND CONSERVANCY FOR RECEIVING LAND TRUST ACCREDITATION 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 30, 2018 Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, it’s my honor to recognize the Upper Peninsula Land Con-servancy for receiving Land Trust Accredita-tion. Through its dedication to wildlife habitat, outdoor recreation, and its local community, the U.P. Land Conservancy has become an indispensable part of Michigan’s First District. Locally focused land conservation under-taken by community-based land trusts has be-come increasingly important across the coun-try. Accreditation by the independent Land Trust Accreditation Commission is given to those organizations that have proven to be trusted, strong, and effective in their land con-servation efforts. Through its tremendous work in Michigan, the Upper Peninsula Land Con-servancy has shown that it is more than de-serving of this seal. First started in 1999, the organization currently protects more than 6,600 acres of forest and wetlands across the Upper Peninsula. Its work to protect wildlife habitats, water quality, working farms and ranches, and healthy communities has been invaluable for the people of Michigan’s First District. Our region is home to some of the most pristine natural landscapes in the coun-try, and I’m grateful for the U.P. Land Conser-vancy’s efforts to ensure that future genera-tions can enjoy the same natural beauty we so deeply treasure. Mr. Speaker, it’s my honor to congratulate the Upper Peninsula Land Conservancy for re-ceiving Land Trust Accreditation. Michiganders can take immense pride in knowing that the First District is home to such a trusted organi-zation working to promote land conservation. On behalf of my constituents, I wish the U.P. Land Conservancy all the best in its future en-deavors.

VIOLENT ATTACK ON JEWISH COMMUNITY IN PENNSYLVANIA 
HON. TED POE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 30, 2018 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on Satur-day, October 27, as worshippers gathered to celebrate the naming of a new baby at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood, a gunman burst into the temple wielding three handguns and an AR– 15 assault rifle shouting ‘‘All Jews Must Die.’’ He murdered three women and eight men be-fore he was subdued by the police in what au-thorities are calling the worst attack on the Jewish community in American history. The eleven congregants killed and the six others who were wounded in this act of pure evil were targeted because of one reason only: they were Jews. Peaceful law abiding Americans were killed in a holy place on the Jewish Sabbath simply for being Jews. That this would happen in 2018 is appalling and is a tragic reminder that anti-Semitism is unfortu-nately alive and well. The Jewish American community dates back to before the founding of our country, as this often persecuted reli-gious community sought shelter in the hope of the American promise. In his 1790 letter to the Touro Synagogue in Newport, Rhode Island, George Washington famously wrote, ‘‘The government of the United States . . . gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assist-ance. May the children of the stock of Abra-ham who dwell in this land continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other inhabitats—while every one shall sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree and there shall be none to make him afraid.’’ Mr. Speaker, what happened on Saturday was an assault on the very foundations of America. It was an assault on freedom of reli-gion guaranteed by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. I always say that the First Amendment is first because it is the most important—it is the very basis of what histori-cally has made this country different than all others. It is because of that amendment that Jews and people of all other faiths have made this country their home. This deranged killer sought not only to kill Jews on the Sabbath, he sought to kill Amer-ica as we know it. His violent and murderous actions should be treated as a hate crime, and he should be brought to justice swiftly. If he is indeed convicted, this man should be meted out the most severe punishment under the law. Just days following this heinous attack, the Rabbi of the Tree of Life Synagogue summed up the significance of what occurred well. ‘‘Many just see this as an attack on the Jewish community. It’s not. When American citizens cannot freely and safely worship in their house of worship and celebrate the Sabbath, it con-cerned me because it challenges the safety and security of all Americans in any house of worship. It was an attack on America.’’ And that’s just the way it is. f 
RECOGNIZING EDUCATOR OF THE YEAR CHRIS LAVAGNINO 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 30, 2018 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the career achievements of Mr. Chris Lavagnino, a fourth-grade teacher at Ronald Reagan Elementary School in Chowchilla, California. Chris is being honored by the Madera County Farm Bureau with the 2018 Educator of the Year Award. This award is given to an educator who has guided and supplied their students and has devoted their time to teach about farming and agriculture. It is both fitting and appropriate that we honor Chris today for his years of service to our Val-ley. Chris, a native of San Leonardo, moved to the Central Valley at age 8. He attended local schools in Fresno and Clovis, where his fourth-grade teacher at Viking Elementary School, Mr. Sepetjian, inspired him to become a teacher himself. Chris attended California State University, Fresno, where he received a bachelor’s de-gree in Liberal Studies. He went on to obtain his teaching credential at National University. Chris returned to Fresno State and received his master’s degree in Education. After com-pleting his education, Chris began to live his dream of teaching and taught at several schools throughout Fresno Unified School Dis-trict from 2000 to 2005. In 2005, Chris was hired as a fourth-grade teacher at Ronald Reagan Elementary in Chowchilla. Since then, he has made every school year a ‘‘unique learning experience’’ for his students. In the past three years, Chris began teaching his students about the impor-tance of farming and agriculture. He strongly believes that agriculture is of vital importance to our region, therefore insists in teaching his students about farming and agriculture. This school year, Chris and his students have conducted experiments and planted plants at their school’s onsite greenhouse, where they plot and track the growth of their plants. Also, last year, his students trans-planted a variety of succulents, which were entered into the Chowchilla Fair and received a first-place ribbon. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me today in recognizing Mr. Chris Lavagnino for receiving the Educator of the Year Award. Chris has been an inspiration, not only to his students, but also through his community lead-ership. I ask that you join me in wishing Chris and his wife Jennifer continued success and happiness. f

HON. G.K. BUTTERFIELD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 30, 2018 Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Middle Eastern District of the Original Free Will Baptist Church, which is headquartered in my congressional district in Wilson, North Carolina.

a beacon of light in its community and has positively impacted generations of families in eastern North Carolina for a century and a half. The Middle Eastern District of the Original Free Will Baptist Church is one steeped in family, fellowship, and faith. Founded in 1868, two years after the U.S. Congress passed the 13th Amendment to abolish slavery, Brothers Daniel Davis, R.C. Jackson, T.H. Harrison, J.M. Barfield, and Reverend C.C. Forbes led the verification of the founding principles upon which the Middle Eastern District was rooted. In the early years, the Middle Eastern Con-ference was small, but that did not deter its leaders’ devotion to spreading the word of God. The oldest components of the Middle Eastern Conference are the Bible Church School, the Women Home Mission, the Sun-shine Band, and the Usher’s Convention. Mr. Speaker, much of the Middle Eastern District’s growth over the years can be attrib-uted to the dedication and vision of its leader-ship. In the early 1950’s, Reverend D.W. Dupree became Moderator, with Rev. G.W. Little serving as Vice Moderator. In 1957, Rev-erend K.L. Smith, who succeeded Reverend G.W. Little as Vice Moderator and would later become Moderator, organized the Young Peo-ple Christian League (YPCL) Convention. Brother L.N. Forbes (now Bishop L.N. Forbes) was elected President of the YPCL Conven-tion. In 1968, my personal friend, Elder L.N. Forbes, became Moderator and Elder Bernard Newsome served as Vice Moderator. The title ‘‘Moderator’’ was then changed to ‘‘Bishop.’’ Under Bishop L.N. Forbes’ leadership, the Middle Eastern District of the Original Free Will Baptist Church continued to prosper and serve its community. In order to accommodate the rapidly growing attendance, the Con-ference meetings were moved to the Audito-rium of Charles H. Darden Middle School in Wilson, North Carolina. As the Presiding Bishop, Bishop Forbes spearheaded the con-struction of the L.N. Forbes Tabernacle in Wil-son, North Carolina, which was dedicated in 1975. The Choir Convention was organized in 1983, recommended by Sister Sallie Dupree. In 1984, Brother Haywood Waters became the Editor of the quarterly Original Free Will Bap-tist news publication. In 1985, Bishop Forbes established the L.P. Manning Scholarship, which supported the educational pursuits of countless young people through the years. Bishop Forbes was the longest serving leader of the Middle Eastern District. Mr. Speaker, by the grace of God, the Mid-dle Eastern District of the Original Free Will Baptist Church has been standing strong for 150 long years. Her outstanding leadership and devoted members have created significant growth in its membership and ministry, as well as, its continued outreach in the Wilson com-munity and beyond. The Middle Eastern Dis-trict’s faithfulness and good deeds will ensure that it continues to experience God’s blessings for years to come. On behalf of the United States House of Representatives and the people of the First Congressional District of North Carolina, I commemorate the 150th anniversary of Middle Eastern District of the Original Free Will Bap-tist Church and extend my best wishes to its leadership and members (many of whom are dear friends) on this auspicious occasion. ALEX GALOR EARNS RANK OF EAGLE SCOUT 
HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 30, 2018 Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Alex Galor of Sugar Land, TX for earning the rank of Eagle Scout. Eagle Scout is the highest honor a Boy Scout can earn. Only a small percentage of Boy Scouts reach the rank of Eagle Scout. This honor re-quires years of effort to develop the necessary leadership, service and outdoor skills. To earn it, Alex developed and provided leadership to others in a service project. For his project, Alex worked with his synagogue to design, plan and build a genizah, which is a place to hold outdated and unused prayer books and other sacred texts. He also raised funds and organized volunteers to build the project and plant a garden surrounding it. His dedication to our community has prepared him to be a leader in his future career. The leadership skills he has learned through Boy Scouts are already benefiting our community. On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-sional District of Texas, congratulations again to Alex for becoming an Eagle Scout. We are proud of his continued success and thank him for his dedication to making our community a better place.

RECOGNIZING SGT. PHILLIP WAYNE BELL 
HON. JOHN J. DUNCAN, JR. 
OF TENNESSEE  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 30, 2018 Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ran into my longtime friend Wayne Bell at Barnes Barber Shop in Knoxville recently and decided that I wanted my colleagues and oth-ers to learn of his great service to our City, State, and Nation. Sgt. Phillip Wayne Bell is a veteran of the United States Marine Corp. While the impor-tance of his military service cannot be downplayed, he is especially known for his 53 1/2 years of service to the Knoxville Police Department. In fact, he is the longest serving officer in the City of Knoxville and the State of Tennessee. Wayne began as a patrol officer and moved to supervising the parking ticket division be-fore moving to the court under the honorable Judge Rosson. He also supervised all of the crossing guards for the city of Knoxville for decades. The average person can go through life not knowing many police officers, but in Knoxville over the past several decades, the one police officer, who was probably the most known to the general public, other than maybe the Chief of Police, was Sgt. Wayne Bell in his role as the original ‘‘Eye in the Sky.’’ The Eye in the Sky program in which Sgt. Bell delivered traffic reports from a helicopter was an innovative joint effort between the Knoxville Police Department and radio stations WNOX and WIVK. This type of collaboration between a private business and government was a novelty when it started and remains a rarity today. Sgt. Bell earned numerous proclamations and awards for his traffic reports but he is also credited with unraveling traffic snarls, catching criminals and assisting in the betterment of our community. In one especially notable in-stance, he even landed the copter in the mid-dle of the interstate to stop a chase and saved countless lives in the process. Knoxville is located at the junction of two of the longest Interstates in the Nation, I–75/I– 40. Unfortunately, the original I–75/I–40 inter-change at one time was also the biggest traffic bottleneck in the region. It was Sgt. Wayne Bell in his traffic reports who bestowed the nickname ‘‘Malfunction Junction’’ on this inter-change. The interchange and the traffic jams it cre-ated are so legendary that there was even a song called ‘‘Malfunction Junction’’ that fre-quently played on local radio in the 1980s. Even though this interchange has since been reconstructed and improved in recent dec-ades, most people in the Knoxville area still refer to it as ‘‘Malfunction Junction.’’ Sgt. Bell entertained radio listeners for years and he was especially good at cutting up with then-WIVK morning OJ ‘‘Claude the Cat’’ and his cast of characters. Although the radio sta-tion eventually changed from a helicopter to a plane, Sgt. Bell continued for a total of over 20 years with the station. Sgt. Bell’s service to the community extends well beyond his professional life. He is a life member and past master of Burlington Ma-sonic Lodge. He is a member of the Eastern Star as well as a life member and past Mon-arch of Zelmar Grotto and the past president of Southeastern Grotto Association. He is a member of the York Rite and Scottish Rite. He is a life member of Shriners Hospitals for Chil-dren and Kerbela Shriners where he served as Treasurer, Recorder and Potentate. He is a member of the Order of the ‘‘Q’’ and past di-rector of the Royal Order of Jesters. As a Shriner and a Mason for over 50 years, Sgt. Bell literally helped hundreds of children and families get the medical and burn assistance they needed through the Shriners Hospital and Burns Institutes. If he received a call in the middle of the night of a burned child three states away, by the time the phone was hung up that child was on a plane on the way to wherever they needed to be for their care. When he first began as a Mason and Shriner he entertained children for years as was ‘‘Danny the Clown.’’ While Potentate of Kerbela Temple during the annual Shrine Cir-cus, Sgt. Bell entered the ring every show riding an elephant. Wayne is especially remembered for the pa-triotic programs that he has performed for over 60 years with his wife Mary. The two enter-tained and educated children and adults with a program to help understand and appreciate our Flag and Country. During the 1970’s, Sgt. Bell performed this patriotic program during the dedication of the bells at the International Peace Garden on the border of North Dakota and Manitoba, with representatives from both Canada and the United States in attendance. I have personally worked with Sgt. Bell for over 20 years when he has represented KPD as an escort and chaperone for the annual AAA Safety Patrol trip to Washington, D.C. The Safety Patrol trip is a tradition that goes back over 60 years in which middle school students come to our Nation’s Capital for a

whirlwind weekend tour to learn about our his-tory and government. At its highpoint, this an-nual trip consisted of over 40 busses of stu-dents, chaperones and guides. East Tennessee is one of the few regions in the Nation that still participates in this tradition. My own first personal visit to Washington, D.C. occurred on this trip when I was in sixth grade, long before my father was elected to Congress. The high point of the trip is a visit to the Capitol Building in which I give a tour and talk in the House Chamber and complete it with a group picture on the front steps. Most everyone in local law enforcement today in Knox County and Knoxville City in-cluding UT Police know Sgt. Bell because he was just a guy who reached out and helped anyone and everyone he could. He is the true definition of a humanitarian and community leader. Even when he was in charge of secu-rity for two major companies while a police-man, and as a Shriner, he included others by giving them the opportunity for extra work, community service. Whatever was needed to make Knoxville a better community, he did it. Wayne is the father of two boys, Mark and Dan. He also has three grandchildren, Kristopher, Jonathan and Brandon along with a deceased grandchild Peyton. His wife of 54 years, Mary, is retired from KUB and has put up with Wayne all this time despite him never ever slowing down. The Nation is a better place today because of the life Wayne Bell has led. He has touched thousands in good and positive ways, and I wanted to honor him by this recognition.

TRIBUTE TO DORIS SCHUELKE 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 30, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Doris Schuelke of Bedford, Iowa for being honored as the Lioness of the Year by the Bedford Iowa Lioness Club. Doris has led an active life for the past 90 years. She has sung with the Community Singers, was a 4–H leader with her five chil-dren, volunteered with Greater Community Hospital Auxiliary, and works with her church. In addition to being a member of the Bedford Lioness group, she was also in the Clearfield Lions group, and the Red Hatters. Mr. Speaker, the example set by Doris dem-onstrates the rewards of harnessing one’s tal-ents and sharing them with her community. Her efforts embody the Iowa spirit and I am honored to represent her and Iowans like her, in the United States Congress. I know that all my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives will join me in congratulating Doris Schuelke for her award and wish her nothing but continued success. HONORING TEJPAL ‘‘JAY’’ MAHIL FOR HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE MADERA COUNTY FARM BUREAU HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 30, 2018 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the achievements of Mr. Tejpal ‘‘Jay’’ Mahil, outgoing President of the Madera County Farm Bureau. It is both fitting and ap-propriate that we honor Jay for his hard work and dedication to Madera County agriculture throughout his career and his term as Presi-dent. Jay, a native of Madera County, attended California State University, Fresno, obtaining a Bachelor of Science degree in Agricultural Business in 1999. He was the first in his fam-ily to attend college and earn a degree. Jay is a fourth-generation farmer who grows almonds, pistachios and wine grapes through-out the Central Valley. Throughout his career, he has been associated with Creekside Farms, Creekside Land Company and the Madera Well Drilling Company. In 2007 Jay joined the Madera County Farm Bureau Board of Directors. In 2015, he was appointed President of the Board, where he advocated for and promoted the agricultural communities throughout the county. In addition to Jay’s dedication to promoting the importance of agriculture, he has also be-come deeply involved in the community. In 2015, Jay was appointed to the University Ad-visory Board at California State University, Fresno, consulting on matters involving univer-sity development and improvement. He is also a member of the San Joaquin Valley Winegrower Association and a member of the Madera Sunrise Rotary. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives join me in rec-ognizing Tejpal ‘‘Jay’’ Mahil for his contribu-tions to the agricultural community during his tenure as President of the Madera County Farm Bureau. I ask that you join me in wishing Jay and his family continued success and prosperity.

CONSTITUENT COMMENTS ON SOBER LIVING HOME PROBLEMS 
HON. DANA ROHRABACHER 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 30, 2018 Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise again regarding the hearing held by the Judici-ary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice on September 28, 2018 on the issue of sober living homes. At that hearing, I had the privilege of testifying in support of my bill, H.R. 5724, to restore local oversight over sober living homes. As part of my testimony, I submitted to the Subcommittee letters from many of my constituents about problems with sober living homes caused by current federal law preventing appropriate local oversight. For the benefit of my colleagues and the American people, I include in the R
ECORD the seventh group of these constituent letters below: 
I am a proud Southern California native, educated in our fine public elementary schools, and hold degrees from the Univer-sity of Southern California. After living in and working in most of the nation’s major metropolitan cities, I was fortunate to find my slice of paradise in Huntington Beach 30 years ago. Living in the downtown area has been a wonderful place full of life, activity, and best of all a close-knit neighborhood family. In downtown, our homes, due to the very close proximity to the Pacific Ocean, are extremely close—it is akin to living in a sliver of land separated giant condominium complex. My house, the oldest in my neigh-borhood is unique for many reasons, one rea-son that has only recently become an un-bearable issue is that all of our rooms are di-rectly within 6–8′ from the rooms of the SLH next door. Therefore, my teenage daughter’s bedroom is within 6 to 8′ of the SLH kitchen, eating area and side outdoor patio. In es-sence, we hear everything—conversations, fights, fits, paramedics speaking to the hos-pital when there is an overdose, slamming doors at all hours of the day and night, sex-ual positions and experiences of the ‘‘cli-ents,’’ each and every way known to smoke, snort, inject, drink, any and all substances and the last time used (usually within that day). I could sum up the last 25 years of liv-ing in my neighborhood in one sentence—a wonderful place to live. Unfortunately, with the disaster that has been forced upon us by greed and inaction, I can no longer sum it up as wonderful, but quite the opposite. I will try to keep this as succinct as possible, but the only real way to keep it succinct is for all of you to come and live in my house for a day—it’s as far away from wonderful now as I can reasonably imagine. So, I write this as a fed-up homeowner, parent who can no longer feel safe for my daughter, active community member who has no answers because our city leadership is hog-tied by bureaucracy, and as an elected school board trustee for the Huntington Beach City School District who sees the im-pact to our district. So, I see this issue from many different perspectives. In summary: Homeowner/resident/parent/human: My house has been relegated nearly worth-less. I tried to sell and only received very low offers because no person in their right mind wants to live in my situation. No one needs to disclose next door is a SLH, there are throngs of men and women loitering both front, back, across the street, all over the street smoking, using foul language, and usually at least monthly there is an over-dose, so we often wake up to sirens and the conversations regarding the entire incident. This has become so bad that my daughter now is living primarily out of the house be-cause she is afraid to walk in the front door, won’t be home alone, cannot sleep or study from the smoke and noise, she’s been cat- called walking home from school, had un-imaginable things said to her right in front of me and when I have confronted these peo-ple, I was told to ‘‘be careful bitch, we’ll burn your house down with you in it.’’ So now my daughter is too afraid to sleep here at night because she has nightmares of being burned in the house alive. I’ve paid hundreds of dollars in vet bills because they toss their cigarette butts into my side yard, and if I can’t get to them fast enough my dog has eaten them and become toxic to her (dog is only 9 lbs). My trash bins are filled and spilled over with the most disgusting trash— we now have rats. Our sidewalks are littered with hundreds of cigarettes and trash and when I have asked these people or their visi-tors to please put the trash in a trash can not the street, my car was keyed. I’ve had both the front and back of my car destroyed from these folks driving out of state cars DUI and crashing into my parked car. When

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1479 October 30, 2018 
I called the owner of the house to complain (note: none of the owners of these houses live anywhere in Huntington Beach), he told me that he would be working on buying the house on the other side of me to make sure to ‘‘squeeze me out’’ and ‘‘shut me up,’’ Ap-parently, it appears he’s going to win. We have these houses in multitudes in my neigh-borhood, all of them have multiple issues and now seeing an OD HBPD/HBFD call is nearly a daily occurrence. I’ve had so much angst and anxiety over just living here and what are we going to have to deal with and live through today it’s taken a toll on my health, and certainly my daughter’s. Why do they have more rights than my child does? As a school board member, we are always working to ensure our children and commu-nity safe, clean schools, and an excellent education. We also look forward at our de-mographics and enrollment to properly pre-pare. We have planned for some declining en-rollment, but families in our district schools, primarily in our largest elementary and middle school, which serve the down-town neighborhood are losing enrollment at an alarming rate due to families moving completely out of Huntington Beach because of this SLH issue. There are at least 4 SLH homes that are directly in the walking path to both the elementary and middle school that hundreds of small children walk through that now on a daily basis are forced to walk through groups of SLH ‘‘clients’’ smoking, spitting, urinating, shooting drugs on the sidewalk, using unimaginable lan-guage, cat-calling young girls, loud foul lan-guage music. I’ve had parents crying and children scared to go to school—not of school but getting to and from school. So, our planned attrition in those schools has more than doubled our research and it is primarily because these families no longer feel safe and that our city has any interest in their well- being. So, in most cases, they take a large loss on their home value and leave. The van-dalism and theft of our schools has increased as well. I want to make it very clear that I am an advocate that anyone that needs help should be able to get the help they need. However, these SLH homes are not helping these peo-ple who desperately need it, they are not-so- well-hidden drug dens that are destroying our neighborhoods. They need quality, medi-cally-supervised help and counseling—not a frat-house for drugs with absolutely no over-sight, no counseling, no supervision. The current SLH next door to me is now both male and female and has at least 12 but up to 15 people. If I am being forced to pay through taxes and increased insurance premiums to cover this care, then please get them the help they desperately need—and what has been going on here is certainly not help—it’s a greed grab to the detriment of both the neighborhoods and the people who are seek-ing help. There is a reason all other states have curbed this process—for as impossible as it is to do business in California, it is in-conceivable that this industry remains with-out any regulations, still allow un-checked body brokering, curbing, cross-state human commerce. I will end with this—I am tired of hearing that we are just complaining because of NIMBY. This is NOT a NIMBY issue. This madness and crisis is NOT in my backyard. It is in my backyard, my front yard, my side yard, inside my house. So, I would like to ask that if our elected officials from Wash-ington to the California Legislature continue to refuse to do anything and continue to deny allowing our elected City officials to govern Huntington Beach as local governing bodies were intended for, then please, I beg of you . . . buy my house because no one else will but another SLH. If I can be of any help to you, please do not hesitate to contact me. I think I speak for all of us—we want help for those that need help, but appropriate help in the appropriate locations—because what is going on is a lose-lose for everyone BUT the unscrupulous operators and landlords. But the biggest losers are our neighborhood chil-dren. B
RIDGET KAUB, Huntington Beach, California. 
We have had up to 3 sober living facilities move into our quiet single-family neighbor-hood. It has been a nightmare. Our children walk past these residences and live next door to many of them. They have parties, horrible language, hookers show up, police visits, etc. I have found syringes in my yard, weed on my front and cigarettes everywhere. They speed through the neighborhoods and we have a constant rotation of individuals. Plus, we now have tons of new cars parking on the streets. Tattooing in the garages. There are often more than 6 people. Vans roll up daily and they all hang out waiting to load up. Smoking looking like they rolled in from Compton. My daughter has a daily glimpse of their underwear as their pants barely cover anything. Cars drive up dropping off suit-cases and dogs almost weekly. We have only seen them drug testing once. I grew up in this neighborhood but worry daily about our safety and my daughter when she needs to take the bus. I believe that this has also brought in the rash of individuals now park-ing in the neighborhood sleeping nightly in their cars. Something needs to be done quickly. You have homes well over a million dollars paying taxes and waking up daily to these situations. A

We want our neighborhood back. In the last couple years, it seem the city of Hun-tington Beach has opened the doors to the sleazy businesses with little to no regulation required. Most aren’t even licensed. There are no less than 8 within two blocks of my house. I live in the south east neighborhood of downtown Huntington Beach. We have had at least two overdoses/deaths in the nearby homes. We constantly see shady behaviors, loitering on our sidewalks, trash, drugs, drug paraphernalia, needles not to mention smok-ing outdoors so we all can inhale. The traffic from their transportation vehicles is exces-sive not to mention the countless Uber/Lyft rides coming and going at all hours of the day/night. My 13-year-old daughter and friends are intimidated by the shady char-acters as they walk by being verbally har-assed and googled by them. These people don’t come from our neighborhood and most aren’t even from this area or state. They im-port them from out of area to come ‘‘vaca-tion’’ in our city. Once money runs out or the insurance stops paying for this scam they are left on the streets and join the ever- increasing population of homeless. This is a HUGE problem and our government needs to impose strict regulations on the SLH’s. It’s a scam for insurance companies and it’s a scam that these so-called businessmen take these desperate people’s money for nothing. In turn these business men have become rich and are expanding operations exponentially. Please do something! These are neighbor-hoods not the place to conduct business or run a so-called detox hospital from a multi-million dollar house. D
OUGDANIELS , Huntington Beach, California. 
Today I’m writing this letter not only for me and my family but for all the family’s in Huntington Beach whose lives have been yanked out from under them. I’ve always lived in Huntington Beach and I can’t believe how fast our lovely beach town has gone down the drain. We moved about 7 years ago to a bigger house that’s close to where the neighbors all BBQ to-gether, look out for each other and just enjoy the quietness, the smell of the ocean, the perfect place to raise our kids. This may sound silly, but Huntington Beach used to feel like we were all one big happy family. We moved out of our old house because of a guy that was hooked on Crystal Meth. Our kids were terrified of him. My daughter was having nightmares that this person was try-ing to murder me. So, my husband got 2 large dogs and when we found this house and this neighborhood we fell in love with it and moved. Three years ago, the house next door went up for sale and these ‘‘nice guys’’ lied of course because that’s what addicts do and said their daughters or sons were moving in. My husband owns a roofing company and ended up doing the roof for the new owner. Come to find out he has several homes here in H.B. He lives in Atascadero. He’s an inves-tor. He doesn’t care about our neighbor-hoods. He doesn’t have to live here. So, he’s making a ton of money leasing these houses out to so-called sober living homes. The resi-dents of Huntington Beach are paying our hard-earned money, paying high property taxes so these leaches prey on parents who would do anything to get their child well. So, these SLH’s are getting money from the federal government, state government and insurance companies. Greedy people that couldn’t care less about these kids. They do ‘‘curb’’ them when the money runs out. We’ve seen it happen many times. Now they have nowhere to go but to the streets. Now our cars are being stolen or broken into. Our kids bikes—well I everyone’s bikes are being stolen. The crime here and homelessness is over whelming! And the police can do noth-ing about it because their hands are tied but they will turn around and arrest a home-owner for having a loud party. Come on. Where is the justice? Our police and our City Council should be protecting us and our chil-dren. Yes us . . . the tax payers. It seems that we have no one around here looking out for us and it’s honestly hard to wrap our heads around. We can’t leave our windows open because of the cigarette smoke, mari-juana smell, loud fights, cussing like you would not believe. Cigarette butts and trash and; hypodermic needles on our property and all over our poor community. We can’t enjoy our rooftop deck anymore for the above rea-sons. The overdoses and ambulances that my 3 kids have witnessed is beyond horrible. We, our community, are prisoners in our own homes. Some of the residents next-door told my neighbor that they were going to burn her house down with her in it! Come on. This has got to stop! Don’t we have any rights? How about our children? Would you want to have drug deals and drug houses with people you really have no idea what their story is. These places move out in the middle of the night and you guessed it. A new SLH moves in. We don’t see them going to meetings or anything. No medical staff on sight. Body brokering kids for MONEY. Then kick the kids to the curb while they drive their Tesla’s and Bentley’s. Our kids try and go to sleep at night because they have school in the morning and it’s impossible most nights due to the screaming and cussing. I do be-lieve that people need help and the ones that really want it, deserve the right help. But not right smack in the middle of our residen-tial neighborhoods. We live across the street from a bar and a liquor store! Who in their right mind would seriously think that a great place for a SLH? And I’m not exag-gerating when I tell you there are at least 4

or 5 on almost all the streets in the num-bered blocks. And nothing can be done be-cause ‘‘they’’ are protected. Please let it be our turn to be protected again. Let the peo-ple that need help go to a real Detox and re-covery home. I’ve heard the Betty Ford Cen-ter and Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach have wonderful dependency programs and they CARE about the people that are there to get help. Many places are available for people to get real help. And I doubt that would be across from a bar and liquor store. Or around a lot of innocent children and families. We are trying to teach our kids not to steal and to care about others, not to be afraid of all the strangers. We are just trying to keep our children away from drugs and al-cohol and needles. There is a place for recov-ery it’s just not in our residential neighbor-hoods. This is really a plea for help and I hope we get some help soon because it’s just getting worse every day. B

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and commemorate Mr. Alphonso Deal on the 30th anniversary of his passing, which was earlier this year, on July 7th. From his lifetime commitment to the Harlem community, Mr. Deal will be remembered for his significant efforts to increase access and participation for diverse communities. This in-cluded organizing a house crawl on Saturday afternoons to encourage people to live in Har-lem all while showcasing the beauty in Har-lem’s history and architecture. He was a staunch believer in expanding opportunities for the wider community. To expand access for Latinos, Asians, and African Americans to take the New York State Court Officer’s examina-tion, Mr. Deal also asked the Tribune Society to hold a free test preparation course. Mr. Deal was a dedicated public servant who served as a New York State court officer for decades until he was tragically murdered on July 7, 1988—heroically pursuing a ruth-less criminal who robbed one man at gun point and shot two others. Aside from his work for the New York State Supreme Court, Mr. Deal was a lifelong mem-ber of the NAACP, an active member of the Tribune Society, and a founding member of the New York State Commission on Minorities. ‘‘E Pluribus Unum’’ is our motto in the United States. The Latin term which translates to ‘‘Out of many, one’’ is center to the values we hold dear as a nation. Mr. Deal understood that diversity is this country’s strength and fought to bring about impactful change in his field. We all come from different backgrounds but come together as one beautiful American people—regardless of our race or ethnicity. It is my pleasure and distinct honor to cele-brate the life of Mr. Alphonso Barclay Deal, whose tremendous work left a lasting impact on his community. f 
HONORING H. CLAY DAULTON, III 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 30, 2018 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor H. Clay Daulton, a longtime farmer of the San Joaquin Valley, who has been recog-nized as the 2018 Agriculturist of the Year by the Madera County Farm Bureau. Born in Madera, California to a cattle ranch-ing family in 1943, Mr. Daulton graduated from Madera High School, where he raised steers part of the 4–H Club. After earning his degree in Farm Management from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, he began his extensive career in agri-culture and ranching. In 1975, Mr. Daulton joined the California Agricultural Leadership Program, where he studied the agricultural, political, and economic systems in the United States and South Amer-ica. At that same time, Mr. Daulton was a member and vice chairman of the Madera County Republican Central Committee. Mr. Daulton later brought together his un-derstanding of politics and knowledge of agri-culture to serve as an advocate for farmers and ranchers. Mr. Daulton served on the board of both the California and National Cattlemen’s Associations, advocating for poli-cies that favor the dairy and cattle industries at the state, national, and global levels. In 1987, Mr. Daulton was appointed by the U.S. Trade Representative and Agriculture Sec-retary to serve on the Agricultural Technical Advisory Committee, where he advocated for the U.S. cattle industry during the NAFTA and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ne-gotiations. Mr. Daulton is part of the fifth-generation of his family that has owned the same Madera ranch since 1853. He currently owns and op-erates Daulton Ranch with his wife of 29 years, Nancy. In addition to his advocacy at the national and global level, he has been and remains active in the community. He has served as president of the Madera Rotary Club, Madera County Farm Bureau, and cur-rently is on the board of the Fresno State Agri-cultural Foundation. In addition to his roles as a skilled farmer, rancher, and advocate, Mr. Daulton holds a private pilot’s license and as the owner of Daulton Ranch, keeps himself busy managing the family operation. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring the exceptional life of H. Clay Daulton. I ask that you join me in wishing Mr. and Mrs. Daulton and their family continued success and prosperity. f 
HONORING THE FIRST PRES-BYTERIAN CHURCH OF M
CALLEN 
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 30, 2018 Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the First Presbyterian Church of McAllen. For 110 years, First Pres-byterian has brought members of the commu-nity together in song, faith and service. The First Presbyterian Church of McAllen had humble beginnings, starting with just 13 people in a lumber field in 1908. As time went on, the church grew, overcoming every obsta-cle that came its way. Today, the church has a congregation of over 300 people. Among its achievements is the establish-ment of Su Casa De Esperanza—a nonprofit which helps families both before and after childbirth to ensure the health and happiness of the child and parents. First Presbyterian also launched a Presbyterian Disaster Assist-ance hosting site for newly arrived asylum seekers, providing them with food, clothing, and a warm welcome to the United States. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to represent the hard-working individuals of the First Pres-byterian Church of McAllen. Church leadership and its congregants are a shining example of what the 15th District of Texas has to offer.

CONGRATULATING JIM ALLISON ON HIS NOBEL PRIZE 
HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 30, 2018 Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Jim Allison of Houston, Texas, for receiving the distinguished 2018 Nobel Prize in Medicine. Mr. Allison earned the 2018 Nobel Prize in Medicine for his pioneering research that led to a new type of cancer treatment that frees the immune system to attack cancer and can-cer-related tumors. Allison, MD Anderson Can-cer Center’s chairman of immunology, con-ducted research that led to a class of drugs that better equips the immune system to fight cancer. Allison began his career at MD Ander-son in 1977, where he was one of the first employees of a new basic science research center. In 2015, Allison won the Lasker Award, often called the American Nobel. His Nobel Prize is only the fifth ever recognizing cancer research. On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-sional District of Texas, congratulations again

WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING IS FUELING TOURISM 
HON. TED POE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 30, 2018 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, there are only two Northern White Rhinos left in the world. These two remarkable creatures live under constant armed security because poachers and terrorists are determined to kill them for their horns. Guarding these rhinos is like protecting the Mona Lisa or some other priceless piece of art in a war zone. Along with the sale of elephant tusks, black market wildlife traffickers have hunted many of Afri-ca’s great animals to extinction. This must end now before it is too late and these animals are lost forever. Today, Rhino horns go for $65,000 per kilo-gram on the black market. At such a high price the illegal poaching of these rare animals contributes a sizeable portion of the estimated $19 billion a year wildlife trafficking industry. Terrorists and other extremist groups have no-ticed this lucrative business as a source of funding for their own evil deeds. Terrorist or-ganizations such as al-Shabaab and the Lord’s Resistance Army desperate for money use the illegal rhino horn and ivory trade to raise millions of dollars for their violent causes. We may often look at wildlife traf-ficking as a conservation issue, but it is also a major national security concern that is not being taken as seriously as other terrorist fi-nancing schemes. Unfortunately, wildlife trafficking and the ille-gal ivory trade exists in large part because corrupt governments like China and Vietnam permit a market for these illicit goods. These governments have pledged to support anti- trafficking measures but have failed to enforce existing laws or target consumers. Even North Korea has gotten in on the illegal trade with its diplomats caught multiple times shipping horns and tusks in diplomatic pouches to East Asia. Without action by these governments to stop the rhino horn and elephant tusk markets in their countries, it will be nearly impossible to prevent poaching in Africa. China, Vietnam, and other governments around the world must understand that allow-ing wildlife trafficking in their borders is con-tributing to the financing of terrorism and insta-bility in Africa. Overall, more must be done to stop the poachers, traffickers, terrorists, and corrupt foreign authorities that allow this illegal business to thrive. With dozens of rhinos and elephants killed each day for their horns and tusks, time is running out. And that’s just the way it is. f 
CELEBRATING THE 125TH ANNI-VERSARY OF THE YWCA GREAT-ER LOS ANGELES 
HON. LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 30, 2018 Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the YWCA Greater Los An-geles (YWCA GLA) as it celebrates its 125th anniversary. In September 1894, the YWCA GLA opened its doors to serve the needs of women and their families. The organization’s mission was to create pathways for growth, for eliminating racism, and for empowering women. Its edu-cational offerings included classes in cooking, languages, stenography, and elocution. From those modest beginnings, the YWCA GLA has grown into a local colossus, and has provided an astonishing array of services to generations of Southern Californians. From Downtown L.A. to Watts, from Boyle Heights to the San Fernando Valley, the YWCA GLA has given help and hope to local residents. It has been an active force for racial justice, HIV/AIDS education, infant learning, and the prevention of sexual assault and sex trafficking. Young people have been able to access affordable housing thanks to YWCA GLA residence buildings. Even amid the heart-breaking relocation of Japanese Americans by the U.S. government in World War II, the YWCA GLA was offering help to those in need, assisting Japanese American women and girls at ten relocation sites. Today, the YWCA GLA continues to inspire us with its determination to better our commu-nities. It impacts more than 100,000 individ-uals each year through services including af-fordable child care, after-school youth pro-grams, economic empowerment, job training and housing, senior engagement, and sexual assault crisis services. In addition, the YWCA GLA engages in advocacy, working with com-munity members to communicate loud, clear, effective messages on important legislation. One of its largest programs, YWCA GLA Job Corps Services, provides a second chance in life to young students who are at risk, are previously homeless, or are emanci-pated foster children. Job Corps Services has been an amazing resource for helping these youth become self-sufficient and gainfully em-ployed members of our society. The program, which has been co-ed since 1977, assists them with housing, medical costs, meals, life skills, and educational services including job training and online degrees. The YWCA GLA’s activities span many lo-cations across the Los Angeles area, including its seven-story Urban Campus in Downtown L.A., which was funded in part by an $82 mil-lion grant from the U.S. Department of Labor. I was privileged to sign a beam of the building at its topping-off ceremony. Dedicated just six years ago, this campus features a state-of-the- art library, residential units, modernized health facilities, indoor lounges, classrooms, an am-phitheater, and more. With locations like this Urban Campus, the YWCA GLA will stay at the forefront of the fight to make sure L.A. residents are safe, smart, and well-prepared for the wonders and challenges that the 21st century will continue to bring. As the YWCA GLA celebrates its 125th an-niversary, its accomplishments are far too nu-merous to list here. Its long list of successes is due, in no small part, to the fearless and stalwart leadership of CEO Faye Washington and the YWCA GLA staff. Faye and her team provide their clients with the best training and counseling possible, and constantly raise the bar to ensure their clients’ success. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking the YWCA-Greater Los Angeles for all it does for women, children and youth. Let us congratulate it on 125 years of fighting to better our communities and promote peace, justice, freedom, and dignity for all.

HONORING THE LAO VETERANS OF AMERICA 
HON. SEAN P. DUFFY 
OF WISCONSIN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 30, 2018 Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I proudly rise today to honor the Wisconsin Lao Veterans of America, Inc. (WLVA), an organization found-ed in 1991 to serve the Lao Veteran commu-nity in Wisconsin by advancing the opportuni-ties and recognition for those who fought in the CIA’s secret war in Laos. This organization has been instrumental in helping the Hmong-Lao veterans to adjust to life in the United States, and has shaped their experience here in Wisconsin through assist-ance in assimilation, recognition, and societal advancement. WLVA was founded in 1991 by General Yang Pao, who was the commander of the ‘‘Secret Army’’ which was conscripted by the CIA to fight against the People’s Army of Viet-nam. He was the only ethnic Hmong to be ele-vated to the position of General in the Royal Lao Army. Currently, Captain Nao Shoua Xiong of Wausau, WI leads the WLVA as their presi-dent, and has been at the forefront of assist-ing the Hmong community in all aspects of life in Wisconsin. On behalf of the residents of Wisconsin’s 7th Congressional District, I would like to thank the Wisconsin Lao Veterans of America for their service to our country and our com-munity. f 
HONORING TREVINO’S AUTO MART 
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 30, 2018 Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Trevino’s Auto Mart, a family owned business in McAllen that, for thir-ty years, has been a model small business. Throughout its tenure, Trevino’s Auto Mart has survived periods of economic instability and fierce competition. In 1988, Trevino’s Auto Mart had just two cars on its lot. Now, after years of hard work and providing quality service, Trevino’s Auto Mart has nearly eighty cars and has earned the respect of many in the Rio Grande Valley and across the state of Texas. As a member of the National Independent Automobile Dealers Association, Trevino’s Auto Mart has demonstrated its commitment to upholding an unparalleled standard of eth-ics. Finally, as the only independent dealer with a partnership with BBVA Compass, Trevino’s Auto Mart has shown that it too can compete for more business and clients. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to represent the hardworking individuals at Trevino’s Auto Mart and recognize this second-generation family owned business for its three decades of suc-cess in the 15th District of Texas.

During the fall and spring semesters, several hundred students and members of the Golden community from different countries and walks of life, come together to enjoy a homemade meal and great hospitality. To date, more than 26,000 meals have been served to students, thanks to the ongoing contributions of about 20 hardworking volunteers in the community. I congratulate the Lunch and Life Program for receiving this well-deserved honor by Mayor Marjorie Sloan. I thank them for their contributions to our community. RECOGNIZING THE OUTSTANDING SERVICE OF MR. CHARLES SHAW HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS

Mr. Speaker, it is my great honor to rise today and recognize the achieve-ments of Mr. Charles ‘‘Chuck’’ Shaw, an edu-cator, public servant, community leader, and distinguished resident of Palm Beach County, Florida.

Mr. Shaw is originally from Martinsburg, West Virginia, but moved to Florida with his family when he was five years old. He grad-uated from Forest Hill High School in 1966 and later earned both a bachelor’s and mas-ter’s degree in Education from Florida Atlantic University. In 1970, Mr. Shaw began his career in edu-cation as a teacher at Berkshire Elementary School, where he served for six years before becoming Assistant Principal at North Grade Elementary and then Principal of Westward El-ementary. He also served as Principal of Northboro Elementary, Okeeheelee Middle School, and the new Greenacres—Liberty Park Elementary school, where he was the first person ever to serve as Principal. Mr. Shaw was later appointed at the district level as Area Superintendent, Department Head, and Director of Governmental Relations. Dur-ing his tenure in these important positions, he lobbied at the state and federal levels for adult and community education. Mr. Shaw’s dedication to youth development extended beyond school administration. He served for 25 years as the President of the Palm Beach County Youth Football League, the Palm Springs Athletic Association, and the Lake Worth Bronco and Pony League. For his contributions, he was nominated and inducted into the Palm Beach County Sports Hall of Fame. In 1988, Mr. Shaw was elected to the City Council for the Town of Greenacres, Flor-ida.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1483 October 30, 2018 
of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. Despite four years of patience and asking nicely, the Kremlin doubled-down on its aggressive development of dangerous new nuclear delivery systems. Just in March, Putin unveiled several new nuclear weapons featuring simulated displays of strikes on the United States homeland. These provocative acts and renewed Russian aggression dem-onstrate we are in a new Cold War where we cannot be handicapped by agreements Putin does not honor. That is why I support the President’s deci-sion to terminate the INF Treaty. Why should we continue to play by the rules when Putin is cheating? We must be prepared to counter and outmatch Russia’s missile build-up. The Treaty as it stands only limits America’s ability to compete. It is more destabilizing when only one-party complies because there is no longer a transparent balance of forces. Let’s set aside that the Chinese have abso-lutely no such limitations on intermediated range nuclear forces, given that there is no U.S.-Chinese version of this treaty. Indeed, China has free rein on intermediate range nu-clear missile development, while the U.S. is limited by the INF treaty. Consistently Putin has violated treaty after treaty and undermined whatever goodwill was created by the conclusion of the Cold War. Putin aspires to rebuild the might of the Soviet and Tsarist Empires. He is working to re-di-vide the world between East and West. Much like Hitler’s attempt to rearm and undo the hu-miliation that Germany had suffered in the First World War, Putin today is rearming the Red Army and attempting to undo the humilia-tion Russia experienced with the collapse of the Soviet Union. American political, eco-nomic, and military strength—along with the persistent rise of democracy among the former Soviet republics—have always stood in the way of Putin’s grand ambitions. As have the treaties that his predecessors signed with the United States, which Putin sees as a major source of the Soviet demise. Due to our failure to confront the Kremlin, the Russian military has a four-year head-start in the development and fielding of inter-mediate-range missiles. However, now that we are free from the self-imposed constraints of the dead INF Treaty, American innovation can be unleashed. The re-energized Arsenal of Democracy, which has deterred many great conflicts in the modern era, can remind the Kremlin why it was in their interests to sign the INF Treaty in the first place. This will also pro-vide new urgency to renewing the New START Treaty that is set to expire in 2021. Putin must learn the lessons of his prede-cessors: that competing with America on an industrial and technological playing field is a fool’s errand. Allowing Russia to violate the INF Treaty with impunity was a dangerous mistake. But now that we can compete, Rus-sia will find more incentive to return to the ne-gotiating table and seek a new treaty. Peace through strength is not just a catchy saying, but a well-practiced strategy to maintain peace and order in the world. After all, it was this strategy implemented by President Reagan that prompted Moscow to sign the INF Treaty in 1987 in the first place. We must do this again. In this dangerous new era of great power rivalry, we cannot rely on Russian goodwill, but rather American strength. And that’s just the way it is.
