PRAYER Pastor Zack Randles, Waterfront Church, Washington, DC, offered the following prayer: Lord, as I stand here today, a great many of our officials are taking meet-ings and seeking to better understand the people they represent while proc-essing how to make the most of their coming year. Lord, we ask You to open their ears to hear what You hear, open their eyes to see what You see. We ask that You give them the wisdom to navigate the complexities of our world and that You would give them the words to bring clarity and insight. Remind them that their place in this sacred Hall has not been hastily won by their effort or their charisma, but that they have been divinely placed by the creator of the universe for such a time as this. Grant them favor where they need favor. Grant them peace where they need peace. Multiply their time and encourage them today. We ask these things in the mighty name of Jesus. Amen.

TRIBUTE TO JANICE AND PHIL HARDEE 
HON. DAVID YOUNG

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 23, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Janice and Phil Hardee of Clarinda, Iowa on the very special occasion of their 60th wedding anniversary. They celebrated their anniversary on Sep-tember 26, 2018. Janice and Phil’s lifelong commitment to each other and their family truly embodies Iowa values. As they reflect on their 60th anni-versary, I hope it is filled with happy memo-ries. May their commitment grow even strong-er, as they continue to love, cherish, and honor one another for many years to come.

HONORING MARILYN SHULT WITH CALIFORNIA’S THIRD DISTRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 23, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Marilyn Shult as a woman of the year. She has consistently proven herself a valuable and tireless presence in service to the Glenn County senior community. Having served over 25 years at the Passages Adult Resource Center, she has been an asset to the seniors and caretakers she has worked with. Ms. Shult has also given her time work-ing with the Glenn County Hospice Program to ensure those living with life-limiting illnesses receive compassionate care to improve their quality of life. Additionally, she has worked ex-tensively with the Salvation Army in admin-istering the REACH Program which assists families in need with paying their utility bills. Her impact on her community can be seen in numerous organizations where she was al-ways willing to lend a hand. Ms. Shult also raised three sons, always dedicating time to chaperoning field trips and school dances, baking for school bake sales, and generally being present for her children every step of the way. It is this compassion and desire to help others thrive that sets Ms. Shult apart as a devoted community servant. CONGRATULATING MR. JAMES BORREGO HON. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM 
OF NEW MEXICO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 23, 2018 Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratu-late Mr. James Borrego on becoming Head Coach of the NBA’s Charlotte Hornets. Mr. Borrego is the first head coach of Hispanic heritage in the history of the league. A native of Albuquerque, Mr. Borrego at-tended Albuquerque Academy and led the basketball team to two state championships. He went on to attend the University of San Diego, where he walked on to the team and later served as a graduate assistant coach. He earned a bachelor’s degree in English as well as a master’s degree in Leadership Studies. After leaving the University of San Diego in 2003, Mr. Borrego joined the San Antonio Spurs organization, where he began as an as-sistant video coordinator and eventually was promoted to assistant coach. During his tenure with the Spurs, he was a part of two NBA Championship winning teams. In 2010, Mr. Borrego moved to the New Or-leans Hornets and served as an assistant coach for two seasons. He then became an assistant coach for the Orlando Magic, which included a stint as interim head coach in 2015. In 2015, Mr. Borrego returned to his original NBA team as an assistant coach for the Spurs. Mr. Borrego has noted that his upbringing in Albuquerque taught him to value the Hispanic culture he grew up surrounded by while also appreciating the opportunity to live in such a diverse community. The people of Albu-querque are so proud that one of their own has had such an accomplished career and reached the top of the NBA’s coaching ladder. Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Mr. James Borrego for making history by becom-ing the NBA’ s first Hispanic head coach. I wish him, his wife, Megan, and his children, Grace, Zachary, and Nicholas the best of luck in this new chapter of their lives.

IN HONOR OF LATINO HEALTH ACCESS 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 23, 2018 Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the work of Latino Health Access, a community organization that has been devoted to helping underserved communities in Santa Ana for the past 25 years. Over this time, Latino Health Access has become an impor-tant pillar of the community by working to fulfill their mission of providing culturally appropriate health programming and civic engagement re-sources. This work has been invaluable to the city of Santa Ana as many of the individuals served by their programs may otherwise not have had the ability to get the care they need-ed. Latino Health Access’ ‘‘Promotores Pro-gram’’ is a shining example of the level of community engagement for which they have become known. Santa Ana residents have built lasting meaningful relationships with staff and volunteers from Latino Health Access through this program. By making themselves available in supermarkets, churches, and other community areas, the Promotores have made the mission of creating healthier communities a reality. This allows Santa Ana residents to receive comprehensive health care ranging from senior care to weight management, and everything in between. Futhermore, Latino Health Access has worked diligently to provide Santa Ana resi-dents with the tools and training to become more active participants in their communities and local governments. They have given these underserved individuals a chance to advocate for the needs of their communities and ensure that their voices are heard. This work has led to tangible results as Latino Health Access has played a critical role in bringing the only park and community center to the 92701 ZIP Code; thereby highlighting the importance open spaces play in the overall health and mental well-being of a community. As they approach their 25th Anniversary, I congratulate them on reaching this milestone and wish them the best of luck on the next 25 years and beyond. f 
HONORING LAUREN RUNOW WITH CALIFORNIA’S THIRD DISTRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 23, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDIA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Lauren Runow as a woman of the year. She is passionately committed to im-proving her community both through her ca-reer and volunteerism. From an early age, the spirit of community service and making a posi-tive difference was instilled in her as she joined her parents volunteering for many Vacaville Rotary and Chamber of Commerce events. As a graduate of the San Francisco Academy of Arts, Lauren returned to her hometown and developed her career while working at multiple television and print media outlets. Lauren was in the inaugural class of Vacaville’s Leadership Today program; and she is the founder and co-owner of Vacaville Magazine which highlights local businesses, upcoming community events, and celebrates Vacaville residents. Lauren is a successful published author and has been featured on USA Today’s Indie Best Sellers List. Most re-cently, her passion has been the creation of

IN RECOGNITION OF UC DAVIS MIND INSTITUTE 20TH ANNIVER-SARY 
HON. DORIS O. MATSUI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 23, 2018 Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 20th Anniversary of the UC Davis MIND Institute. As faculty members and families gather here today, I ask my col-leagues to join me in honoring the MIND Insti-tute for their clinical expertise and collabo-rative efforts to better understand neurodevelopmental disorders. Since its founding by an influential parent group in 1998, the UC Davis MIND Institute has grown a multidisciplinary team of experts, achieving international recognition as an inno-vative leader in research and approaches to treating a broad range of disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, fragile X syndrome, ADHD22q11.2 deletion syndrome and Down syndrome. With more than 50 faculty from five UC Davis schools and colleges, the MIND In-stitute studies everything from environmental factors and cellular processes to community programs, all with the goal of improving the lives of people with neurodevelopmental dis-orders and their families. Over the past 20 years, faculty members at the MIND Institute have made significant re-search discoveries advancing the scientific knowledge and etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders. They have found biomarkers and identified genetic and environmental factors that increase the risk of autism and other disorders. They have also developed interventions and technologies to improve outcomes for children. Through the collaboration of families, educators, research-ers, and the community, the MIND Institute has become a research powerhouse that has generated exceptional results with inter-national implications. Mr. Speaker, as faculty members and fami-lies of the UC Davis MIND Institute celebrate their twenty years of milestones, I ask all my colleagues to join me in honoring their dedica-tion to the awareness, support, and research for neurodevelopmental disorders.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF GERALD SCHUSTER 
HON. NANCY PELOSI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 23, 2018 Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the beautiful life and legacy of my dear friend, Gerald Schuster, who died on October 17 in his home in his beloved city of Boston. Jerry was a leader of great vision and gen-erosity, driven always by the deep responsi-bility he possessed to build better futures for families in Boston and across the country. To-gether with his beloved wife of 66 years, Elaine, Jerry dedicated his life to philanthropy and progressive activism. Jerry’s vast generosity of spirit blessed countless Americans. His support for Boston hospitals, including the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, have brought healing and hope to so many lives, and have helped strengthen families and the community. His vision in establishing the Schuster Family Transplantation Research Center at the Brigham will leave a powerful legacy for gen-erations to come. Jerry also understood the deep toll that poor health can take on families’ well-being and economic security, and trans-formed lives by helping establish Hospitality Homes, a nonprofit organization providing free housing for more than 15,000 families and friends of patients receiving care in the Boston area. As a self-made business leader, Jerry be-lieved firmly in the importance of empowering young leaders, and cared deeply about men-toring others so that they can succeed. As part of this mission, he and Elaine established Operation PEACE (Partnerships in Education and Community Enrichment), which provides mentoring, tutoring and life skill training for children in urban communities in Atlanta and Boston. Recognizing that there is no greater investment we can make than in our children’s education, they also started a fund at Tufts University to support faculty development and civic engagement. Jerry believed profoundly in the importance of a free press. He and Elaine created the Schuster Institute for Investigative Journalism at Brandeis University, which has made an ex-traordinary contribution in strengthening Amer-ica’s public interest and investigative jour-nalism. Since its founding, the Center has em-powered scores of graduates to seek truth through journalism and public service. Jerry also was a tireless champion for pro-gressive causes, and for the need to encour-age a robust, healthy debate over policy. For decades, he and Elaine opened their home to civic and political leaders of all levels, fos-tering important conversations about how to create progress for all Americans. Our country has been strengthened by Jer-ry’s leadership and generosity. We will all deeply miss his warmth, his brilliant spirit and his deep empathy. Most of all, we will remem-ber his extraordinary love for his family. The great love he had for Elaine, his beloved and inseparable partner in all aspects of life; for Mark and Audrey, Scott and Heidi, Jodi, and Todd and Laurie; and for his nine wonderful grandchildren, continues to bless us all. May it bring some measure of comfort to Jerry’s many friends and loved ones that so many grieve with them and pray for them dur-ing this sad time. f 
HONORING LINA HERNANDEZ WITH CALIFORNIA THIRD DISTRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 23, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Lina Hernandez as a woman of the year. She is diligently committed to serving her community. As the program director for the Knights Landing Family Resource Center; Ms. Hernandez facilitates the operation of a vast network of resources, opening the center daily to help individuals and families navigate complicated federal, state, and local programs. Sponsored by Empower Yolo, the Knights Landing Family Resource Center is an essen-tial community asset that seeks to improve the social, educational, and economic outcomes of Yolo County residents. When she isn’t focused on her duties at the center, Ms. Hernandez can be found volunteering her time with the Friends of the Library, the local school, or the Knights Landing Environmental Health Project. Additionally, her dedicated advocacy as a con-cerned parent resulted in the creation of the UC Davis Knights Landing One Health Center. Ms. Hernandez was the driving force in as-sembling a team of knowledgeable community builders to serve as advisors to the One Health Center, pushing for accessible, holistic health services for the entire community. Her presence in our community is an asset that has enriched the lives of countless residents from all walks of life. Ms. Hernandez is a role- model for community leaders everywhere. f 
RECOGNIZING BEVERLY FIELDS 
HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 23, 2018 Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my constituent, Ms. Beverly Fields, who celebrated her 100th birthday on October 21. The daughter of a Romanian father and Russian mother, Beverly has truly lived the American Dream. She was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York with her three siblings. Beverly attended P.S. 156 and was elected class president because, in her words, ‘‘she went to school every day.’’ After graduating, she went straight to work for a manufacturing company, and over the course of 20 years, she rose to the position of Manager. Despite the hard work she put in, she always made sure to find time for trav-eling and dancing. She was a regular patron of the Roseland Ballroom, and has visited Israel, Spain, St. Thomas, and St. Martin. Since retiring, Beverly’s civic commitment has come full circle, as she is currently the President of the Resident Council at Park Summit senior living community. Like many of us, Beverly loves music, especially Jazz and concert symphonies. Her favorite artist is Frank Sinatra and her favorite song is Autumn Leaves. Beverly’s most admirable trait, however, is her ability to always find ways to keep herself active and engaged. From playing cards and bingo, to reading adventure books and writing poems, to watching the travelogue and hang-ing out with her friends, Beverly’s endless joy and companionship are attributes we should all strive to emulate. Mr. Speaker, today I call on my colleagues to join me in celebrating Ms. Beverly Fields and her contribution to our community. Happy birthday, Beverly.

PRESERVING HISTORY: THE GREAT WORLD WAR 
HON. TED POE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 23, 2018 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the day was October 8, 1918, a century ago, when the events of the Meuse-Argonne offensive would be etched into history eternal. The largest op-eration of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEFs) was taking place with over one million American doughboys deployed. Soldiers were tasked with a dangerous mis-sion, penetrating the Argonne Forest, which was a force in itself to be reckoned with. Thick vegetation, jagged hills, and the entrenchment of German forces made this the single dead-liest battle in American history. 125,000 Amer-ican casualties were sustained, with over 26,000 deaths. What was to be the final Allied push against German forces on the Western Front, October 8th proved to be a day that would always be remembered by all the nations that partici-pated in the War. United States Corporal Alvin C. York was in small squadron of about 20 fellow Americans, just boys really, a world away from home. Their task was to take German-held positions. The geography made this objective a difficult one, but York along with his men knew what had to be done. Following orders, the group advanced, but was fired upon from a nest at the top of a nearby hill. The German gunners cut down nine men, including a superior officer, leaving York in charge of the squad. Now in charge, and with little to no time to regroup, he fought to avenge the lives of the fellow soldiers that lost their lives. After it was all said and done, York successfully took the position while taking down 20 German sol-diers, as well as taking 132 German prisoners. His honorable service in this battle earned him the Congressional Medal of Honor. York described the events in his diary: ‘‘Those machine guns were spitting fire and cutting down the undergrowth all around me something awful. . . . I didn’t have time to dodge behind a tree or dive into the brush, I didn’t even have time to kneel or lie down. ...  As soon as the machine guns opened fire on me, I began to exchange shots with them. In order to sight me or to swing their machine guns on me, the Germans had to show their heads above the trench, and every time I saw a head I just touched it off. All the time I kept yelling at them to come down. I didn’t want to kill any more than I had to. But it was they or I. And I was giving them the best I had.’’ The ‘‘best he had’’ was more than enough. The German commander, thinking he was grossly outnumbered, surrendered his garrison of nearly 90 men. Like many men of his time, York never made much of his accomplish-ments of that day, but his heroic actions did not go unnoticed. Promoted to the rank of ser-geant, he remained on the front lines until No-vember 1, ten days before the armistice. The New York Times called York ‘‘the war’s biggest hero.’’ General John J. Pershing, com-mander of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF), called him ‘‘the greatest civilian soldier’’ of World War I. The American doughboy born in a log cabin near the Tennessee-Kentucky border became an American hero and his ac-tions became the basis for the iconic movie, Sergeant York, starring Gary Cooper. Upon York’s death in 1964, President Lyndon John-son called him ‘‘a symbol of American courage and sacrifice’’ who epitomized ‘‘the gallantry of American fighting men and their sacrifices on behalf of freedom.’’ As we honor the 100-year anniversary for the Great World War, let us not forget the more than two million Americans that crossed the Atlantic to fight for freedom in Europe, and the 116,000 of them that never came home. One such soldier that answered the call was my friend, Frank Buckles. Frank died in 2011; he was the last living link to the story of the American Doughboy. I introduced the Frank Buckles WWI Memo-rial Act, to restore the local DC memorial and to recognize the service and sacrifice of all the men and women that served in the Great World War. Finally, after 100 years a memorial will finally be built in the nation’s capital for all of those who fought in the Great War. I was honored to work with my colleague, Rep. E
MANUEL CLEAVER of Missouri in a bipartisan way to make sure that Congress did its part in authorizing the construction of the World War I Memorial on our National Mall. I often talk about those of our Greatest Gen-eration, but without the fathers from the Great World War, the Doughboys, the Frank Buck-les—the rest wouldn’t be possible. America goes to war to free, to liberate, to protect, and to bring justice to bear. We owe it to them and our future generations to honor our veterans in our nation’s capital. Because, the greatest tragedy of war is to be forgotten. And that’s just the way it is.

HONORING ELLENVILLE REGIONAL HOSPITAL 
HON. JOHN J. FASO 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 23, 2018 Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-ognize Ellenville Regional Hospital in their ef-forts to develop a comprehensive, collabo-rative, community-based and region-wide ini-tiative to help combat the opioid epidemic in Upstate New York. In 2017 alone, this epidemic claimed more than 72,000 lives across the country. Ellenville Regional Hospital is working with local care providers including, the Columbia Memorial Health and Albany Medical Center and the Greene County Rural Health Network, to de-velop a model of dynamic care to better treat individuals who are shouldering the tremen-dous burden of opioid addiction. Ellenville’s plan focuses on providing pa-tients who have overdosed an entry path to treatment that combines medical efforts to counter withdrawal and immediately con-necting them with primary health care serv-ices, mental health, and addiction services as well as other basic services such as housing, transportation, and nutrition. The opioid epidemic knows no bounds— spanning across all socioeconomic standings, in every state, in every district, and in every community throughout the country. I extend my sincerest thanks and appreciation to Ellenville Regional Hospital for their dedicated efforts to spearhead this initiative, share their knowledge, and reverse the dangerous trend of opioid abuse and addiction. Aside from trailblazing this pathway to more impactful care and treatment for the many struggling with addiction in our Upstate com-munities, Ellenville Regional Hospital is a lead-er of rural care in the greater Ulster County re-gion, always innovating and finding ways to improve, and most importantly ensuring our friends and neighbors have access to quality care in the community. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing Ellenville Regional Hospital for their dedicated efforts in addressing the opioid epidemic as well as their legacy of in-novative and quality care. f

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1438 October 23, 2018 
historic and most influential civil rights organi-zations in the United States, the National As-sociation for the Advancement of Colored People, known to all simply as the ‘‘NAACP.’’ Founded in 1918, the Houston Branch of the NAACP has played a pivotal role in some of the most pivotal moments and landmark voting and civil rights cases, including Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649 (1944), which over-turned a Texas statute that authorized the Democratic Party to set its internal rules, in-cluding the use of white primaries; and Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629 (1950), which suc-cessfully challenged the doctrine of ‘‘separate but equal’’ in higher education and helped pave the way for the Supreme Court’s land-mark decision in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), four years later. The NAACP-Houston Branch’s tradition of service continues today under the dynamic leadership of its president, Dr. James Doug-las, and Executive Director, Yolanda Smith. First organized in 1905, the group was known as the Niagara Movement when mem-bers began meeting at a hotel situated on the Canadian side of the Niagara Falls. Members of the group had to meet in Can-ada because American hotels in Niagara Falls were segregated. Under the leadership of the Harvard-edu-cated scholar, the great W.E.B. DuBois, the group would later be known as the National Negro Committee before finally adopting the name by which it has been known for the last 108 years—the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, or NAACP— at its second conference in 1910. The first official meeting was held on Feb-ruary 12, 1909, the centennial of the birth of President Abraham Lincoln. The mission of the NAACP was clearly de-lineated in its charter: 
To promote equality of rights and to eradi-cate caste or race prejudice among the citi-zens of the United States; To advance the interest of colored citizens; to secure for them impartial suffrage; and To increase their opportunities for secur-ing justice in the courts, education for the children, employment according to their ability, and complete equality before law. 
Mr. Speaker, for more than a century, the NAACP has stayed true to its charter and championed the cause of justice and equality in America. It has fought valiantly and tirelessly on be-half of African-Americans and others to secure their civil rights and liberties and the full meas-ure of justice and equality for all. At a time when African-Americans were treated as second-class citizens and the scourge of slavery was still rampant, the NAACP emerged to ensure that the rights, in-terests and voices of African-Americans did not go unheard. During World War I, the NAACP success-fully campaigned for African-Americans to be commissioned as officers in the army, result-ing in President Woodrow Wilson commis-sioning 600 African-American officers. During World War II, the NAACP persuaded the administration of President Franklin Roo-sevelt to issue an executive order banning ra-cial discrimination in war-related industries and federal employment. In 1948, President Harry Truman became the first president to formally address the NAACP and he worked with the NAACP in ap-pointing a commission to study and offer ideas to improve civil rights and equality of oppor-tunity for all persons in the United States. The NAACP’s close relationship with Presi-dent Truman helped to influence him to issue Executive Order 9981, which desegregated the United States Armed Services by an-nouncing the new ‘‘policy of the President that there shall be equality of treatment and oppor-tunity for all persons in the armed services without regard to race, color, religion or na-tional origin,’’ and that this policy be put into effect as rapidly as possible. Mr. Speaker, the NAACP was perhaps the leading member of the ‘‘Big Six’’—the coalition of religious, labor and civil rights organizations that organized and staged on August 28, 1963 the historic March on Washington, the most famous act of peaceful protest in our nation’s history. Other members of the Big Six were the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC); the National Urban League; Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC); the International Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters; and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). The March on Washington was a seminal event in our nation’s history and awakened Americans of goodwill to the urgent need to rededicate ourselves to the great unfinished task of making real the promise of America for all Americans, especially African-Americans. Mr. Speaker, the current president of the NAACP is Derrick Johnson and the Board Chairman is Leon W. Russell; through the years, the NAACP has been led by some bold, visionary, and effective leaders, includ-ing: Walter White; Roy Wilkins; Benjamin Hooks; Benjamin Chavis; Merlie Evers-Williams, widow of Medgar Evers; Kweisi Mfume; Bruce S. Gordon; Benjamin Todd Jealous; and Cor-nell William Brooks. Mr. Speaker, America would be a very dif-ferent place were it not for the brilliance of the NAACP’s Clarence M. Mitchell, Jr., the leg-endary Director of the Washington Bureau from 1950 to 1978. So effective was Clarence Mitchell in the campaigns to win passage of civil rights laws, including the 1957 Civil Rights Act, the 1960 Civil Rights Act, the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the 1965 Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968, that his sobriquet was the ‘‘101st Senator.’’ The NAACP is perhaps best known for the practice pioneered by the legendary Charles Hamilton Houston and Thurgood Marshall of ‘‘impact litigation,’’ the strategy of bringing carefully selected cases to court to establish legal precedents of beneficially affecting thou-sands, and frequently millions, of persons be-yond the immediate parties to the case. Among the historic victories won by NAACP lawyers are: 
1. 1940—Chambers v. Florida, which estab-lished that confessions obtained as the result of police coercion are inadmissible at trial; 2. 1944—Smith v. Allwright, which out-lawed the South’s ‘‘white primary’’; 3. 1948—Shelley v. Kraemer, which ruled racially restrictive covenants and unconsti-tutional and legally unenforceable; 4. 1950—Sweatt v. Painter and McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, which held that separate law and graduate school are inher-ently unequal and thus constitutional; 5. 1954—Brown v. Board of Education of To-peka, landmark case overruling separate but equal doctrine of Plessy v. Ferguson; and 6. 1956—Browder v. Gayle, which outlawed the practice of racial segregation on buses and led to the end of the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Mr. Speaker, as Chair for the Congressional Children’s Caucus, I am especially concerned with fair access to quality education for today’s youth and am personally grateful to the NAACP for its leadership in winning the great-est legal victory for civil rights in American his-tory, the 1954 landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), in which the Supreme Court struck down de jure segregation in elementary schools. NAACP General Counsel Thurgood Mar-shall, who would later become the first Afri-can-American Solicitor General and Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, forcefully ar-gued and persuaded the Court to rule unani-mously that in the field of public education, ‘‘separate but equal’’ was inherently unequal. That decision gave hope to millions of Americans that their children might enjoy the full promise of America that had been denied their forebears for more than three centuries. Mr. Speaker, the NAACP remains com-mitted to achieving its goals through non-violence, the legal process, and moral and po-litical suasion, and through direct actions such as marches, demonstrations, and boycotts to give voice to the hopes and aspirations of Afri-can-Americans and others who lack the power to make their voices heard. There is still a need for justice and equal treatment for African-Americans and other vul-nerable populations in our country, and thank-fully, we still have a vibrant NAACP to advo-cate their cause and fight for their interests. I am grateful for the many battles for equal-ity that the NAACP organization has fought and won, and thankful that the NAACP will be there in the future to wage the fight for justice wherever and whenever justice needs a cham-pion. So on this day I am so proud to salute the 100th anniversary of the remarkable Houston Branch of the NAACP, and express the appre-ciation of the nation for all it has done to make our country better.

Throughout Upstate, I am thankful for the driven and compassionate individuals like Blossom who have committed themselves to strengthening our communities and building a better future. Ellenville shines a little brighter thanks to Blossom’s tireless volunteerism and participation in civil society. I am grateful for Blossom’s many years of dedicated service to the 19th District and to New York state. Her many contributions will be felt for generations to come.

REMEMBERING MR. CAMERON MARTINEZ 
HON. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM 
OF NEW MEXICO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 23, 2018 Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Cameron Martinez, who tragically lost his life earlier this month. Cameron is remembered by all who knew him for his kindness, generosity, and enormous personality. He was a remark-able young man and a loving brother, son, and friend. I am proud to have personally known him and honor him and his memory. Cameron was a rising star in our commu-nity. A native of Alcalde, New Mexico, he graduated this year from Espan˜ola Valley High School, where he was a top student and ath-lete. He was especially well known for his love of basketball, and his passion for the game earned him the nickname ‘‘Space Jam Cam.’’ His teammates and coaches had great admi-ration for his work ethic and selflessness on and off the court. Cameron was also a gifted student who was committed to advancing his education and ca-reer. After graduating from high school, he served his country working in the Information Technology Department at Los Alamos, one of our premier National Laboratories. In this role, he collaborated with a team of professionals working on some of our most pressing na-tional security matters, including evolving cy-bersecurity threats. The sky was the limit for Cameron, and our nation lost a highly capable and driven future leader. Cameron was also an aspiring entrepreneur who was working on a clothing line. I had the pleasure of getting to know Cam-eron in recent months and can personally at-test to his warmth, work ethic, and determina-tion to bring positive change to the State of New Mexico. With a simple gesture like a hug, Cameron could make you feel like you were the most important person in his life. I was one of the people lucky enough to receive such a hug. Mr. Speaker, I want to express my deepest condolences to Cameron’s parents, Valerie and Urban, as well as the rest of his loved ones and the entire Espan˜ola community. Cameron was taken from us far too young, but we will always remember him as a bright, young star in New Mexico who positively af-fected so many people’s lives. He will be dear-ly missed. f

HONORING BETTY RUTH HELMS 
HON. VICKY HARTZLER 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 23, 2018 Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Ms. Betty Ruth Helms of Nevada, Missouri. Betty is 96 years old, a part of what many have called ‘‘the greatest generation,’’ those Americans who bravely served their na-tion and the cause of liberty during World War II. In response to the overwhelming need for sailors to serve in the war, Congress author-ized the Navy’s WAVES program in 1942, which permitted women to serve in the Naval Reserve as commissioned officers and en-listed sailors. Betty answered the call, and vol-unteered to be a part of the very first class of women to complete training at the University of Wisconsin. After qualifying as a radioman, she served steadfastly in Jacksonville, Florida for over three years. After her service, she used the G.I. Bill and earned a bachelor’s de-gree in business administration, graduating from my own alma mater, the University of Missouri, in February of 1950. She used that education to start Helms Permit Agency in Ne-vada, which remains open for business to this day. Our nation owes a debt of gratitude to this remarkable woman and the tens of thou-sands of women like her who responded to our nation’s need in such a dire hour, and continued to lead in our communities after the war’s end. I am personally thankful for her service and the honor of representing her here in the House.

SAM HOUSTON: PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF TEXAS 
HON. TED POE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 23, 2018 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, my home-town of Houston, Texas, bears the name of Sam Houston, perhaps one of the most impor-tant figures in Texas history. Without his steady, stoic leadership, Texas would not be the great state that it is today. Indeed, it might have never even existed. Let me tell you more. In the summer of 1836, Texas had successfully won its inde-pendence from Mexico. Under the leadership of General Sam Houston, the Texan forces overran Santa Anna’s army at the Battle of San Jacinto. Houston himself was wounded during the battle, having caught a musket ball in the leg. But he did not let the pain from his wound cloud his judgement. When by chance the Texans discovered the disgraced Mexican dictator Santa Anna dis-guised as a private, he was brought to Hous-ton. Many in the Texas Army wanted Santa Anna executed, but Houston, knowing that he could negotiate favorable terms of surrender directly with el Presidente, refused to give the order. Rather, he brokered the treaty with the leader which gave Texas its independence from Mexico. Texas remained a sovereign Re-public for nine years. With independence secured, the Texans turned to its government. David G. Burnet, who had been serving as the president of Texas since the March 2 declaration (what we celebrate today as Texas Independence Day), called for a general election. The new nation already faced debt prob-lems and issues with army pensions. But with each new concern that surfaced, the choice to lead Texas became more obvious: the hero of San Jacinto. This was not Houston’s first rodeo in gov-ernment. He served in U.S. Congress rep-resenting Tennessee and then as governor of Tennessee. Public service brought him to Texas in 1832, where he was sent by Presi-dent Andrew Jackson to negotiate treaties with Native Americans. On top of his previous ex-perience, his courageous actions at San Jacinto made him the clear choice in the minds of most Texans to lead the country. On September 5, Houston won in a land-slide election, earning 5,119 votes out of a possible 6,640. So strong was the din from the Texas Congress for Houston to take office as soon as possible that President Burnet moved his inauguration date forward two months. When they first convened after the election, the Texas legislature’s first vote was to swear Sam Houston into office that very same day. After taking the oath and delivering a brief, im-promptu speech, Houston calmly unhooked his sword and handed it to the Speaker of the House, thus casting off an ‘‘emblem of his past office’’ and following George Washing-ton’s example of the primacy of civilian rule. Not a man inside was unmoved by this small but significant act. Mr. Speaker, Sam Houston was a great Texan and a great American. He is an icon whose memory deserves our utmost respect and admiration. Today, we are all proud Houstonians. And that is just the way it is. f

IN HONOR OF THE 150TH ANNIVER-SARY OF OAK GROVE BAPTIST CHURCH 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 23, 2018 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and congratulate the Oak Grove Baptist Church of Sterling, Virginia, on the celebration of its 150th anniversary. In 1868, Reverend Robert Woodson, Pastor of Zion Baptist Church in Alexandria, Virginia, moved to the town of Herndon in Northern Virginia. Finding that there were no Baptist churches that were welcoming to African-Americans, Reverend Woodson interested Mrs. Ellen Thompson, a fellow Baptist living nearby, to help him establish what was initially called the Colored Church, on October 10, 1868, in the community of Oak Grove, located in the town of Sterling. Oak Grove was one of five com-munities in Eastern Loudoun County that were founded by former slaves after the Civil War ended in 1865. The name of Oak Grove was adopted, in part, because of the stately oak trees surrounding the church grounds. Over the period of a century and a half, 13 pastors have served at Oak Grove Baptist Church. In addition to the important leadership exercised by these men, the church has been blessed with dedicated and faithful women leaders who greatly contributed to its success, including Ellen Thompson, ‘‘First Mother’’ and founder of the church, and Sister Ada Lee, who labored for 90 years, as the ‘‘Second Mother’’ of the church, before passing on in 1998, at the age of 107. There were many other unsung heroes during the long history of the church, including those whose financial generosity allowed the Oak Grove property to grow from ‘‘a little ole’ spot beside the railroad track’’ to a six-acre property next to the cur-rent WO&D bicycle trail. Since 2011, the con-gregation has been led by a gifted yet humble pastor, Gregory L. Spurlock, a native of Pe-tersburg, Virginia. He is married to the former Lottie Cassandra Mickens, also of Petersburg, who is a school principal in Loudoun County. Pastor Spurlock and First Lady Lottie are the proud parents of three children, Ivana, Bran-don and Gregory, Jr. The key to understanding how this church has thrived over its long and illustrious history is its clear and simple mission. Simply put, ‘‘The Oak’’ exists to fulfill the Great Commis-sion of Jesus Christ. Beginning with the inspir-ing leadership of Pastor Spurlock and First Lady Lottie, coupled with the guidance of the elders of the church and the dedicated support of the Deacons and Deaconesses, each mem-ber of Oak Grove Baptist Church has pledged his or her life to Christ and has covenanted with each other to demonstrate His Spirit through worship, witnessing and ministering to the needs of others. Whether the church is en-gaged in ministering to the physical, spiritual and emotional needs of each church member and family or is taking a leadership role in the annual One Loudoun Revival, or putting on its Car Show and Community Day, or hosting a Women’s Conference or a voter registration drive, ‘‘the Oak’’ has always been hallowed ground, where, through acts of faith and love, its members are tirelessly engaged in the blessed work of transfonning lives, one person at a time. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and our col-leagues join me in celebrating the extraor-dinary history of Oak Grove Baptist Church. Thanks to the loving service of hundreds of disciples over the past 150 years, I am con-fident that the indelible mission, values and traditions of Oak Grove Baptist Church will guide the congregation’s vitality and success over the next 150 years.

TEXAS WARRIOR PETTY OFFICER THIRD CLASS ZARIAN A. WOOD 
HON. TED POE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 23, 2018 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Navy Hos-pital Corpsman Petty Officer Third Class Zarian A. Wood, known as ‘‘Z’’ to his friends, died at Bagram Air Field, Afghanistan, on May 16, 2010 of wounds sustained from an impro-vised explosive device blast that occurred in Helmand Province, while on patrol two days prior. Zarian, a 29-year-old hospital corpsman from Houston, Texas, was assigned to 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Di-vision, 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, Camp Pendleton, California. He was very well known as ‘‘Doc’’ in Afghanistan, serving on the front lines alongside Marine infantrymen. Zarian graduated in 1999 from South Hous-ton High School, where he competed on the wrestling team. He worked as a youth pastor and tutor for troubled kids on Houston’s north-east side and a merchandiser for Coca-Cola before enlisting in 2006. He dreamed of going back to school, studying radiology, and maybe even becoming a dentist. But always putting others before himself, he put his dreams on hold to fight for his country. And fight he did—Zarian was a decorated soldier. His personal service awards include the Purple Heart, Combat Action Ribbon, Na-tional Defense Service Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal, Glob-al War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, and the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon. A month before he was deployed on his second combat duty, he had some quality time with his family. Between video games and steak dinners, they bonded for what would be the last time. His father Daniel Wood, a Viet-nam veteran, commented on his son’s honesty and integrity: ‘‘He’d tell you in a flat minute if you were wrong . . . then again; he’d stand up for you in a flat minute if you were right’’. The liberty we cherish in this Nation has come at a great cost. At times we can all be guilty of taking the simple things in life for granted. We thank men like Officer Wood for these simple liberties. We thank them that we can wake up in the morning and are not afraid, and that we can go to bed at night knowing we are safe. Your selfless heroism has not been forgotten, Zarian. ‘‘Some people live their entire lifetime and wonder if they ever made a difference to the world, Marines don’t have that problem.’’—Ronald Reagan. And that’s just the way it is.

HONORING KATHERINE CAMPBELL WITH CALIFORNIA’S THIRD DIS-TRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 23, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Katherine Campbell as a woman of the year. She embodies all the qualities of a community leader and generously dedicates her time to bettering her community. As one of the founders in the effort to bring a community pool to the greater Capay Valley area, Ms. Campbell was able to successfully secure a $2.9 million dollar grant from the California Department of Parks and Recreation. Due to her continuous determination and firm commit-ment, the new Esparto Community Park and Aquatic Center is set to be completed before the summer of 2019. She currently serves as the treasurer of Capay Valley Vision, where she is actively engaged in developing and prioritizing critical projects that are aimed at community development.

CONSTITUENT COMMENTS ON SOBER LIVING HOME PROBLEMS 
HON. DANA ROHRABACHER 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 23, 2018 Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise again regarding the hearing held by the Judici-ary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice on September 28, 2018 on the issue of sober living homes. At that hearing, I had the privilege of testifying in support of my bill, H.R. 5724, to restore local oversight over sober living homes. As part of my testimony, I submitted to the Subcommittee letters from many of my constituents about problems with sober living homes caused by current federal law preventing appropriate local oversight. For the benefit of my colleagues and the American people, I include in the RECORD the sixth group of these constituent letters below: 
Good Afternoon, I am a Registered Nurse. I am also in recovery 30 years. I have also worked with the homeless and indigent popu-lation. I have family members who suffer from addiction. I believe the sober living houses should be licensed so that they can care for addicts in the appropriate manner. I believe the houses should be regulated in that way: however, as far as zoning, I would have to review your whole bill to make sure it isn’t a NIMBY type of plan as is with the homeless population in our county. I will be more focused on the housing issues of our ill population and the homeless crisis in the State of California as being a disservice to the people who are here. Mental health and homelessness should be the priority in this state. Thank you. C
ATHERINE ORLANDO , Huntington Beach, California. 
I understand the possible issues sur-rounding these sober living homes, however I haven’t heard anything about what would re-place them if they are moved from residen-tial neighborhoods. Rather than sticking our noses into these ‘‘businesses’’, why don’t we work on actual crime? It sounds like you are proposing an easy way out method. If these owners are bad, do good old-fashioned police work and arrest them. We have plenty of laws on the books impeding business owners and home owners, how about spending less money on government and more money on drug programs and good police officers. J
AMES ETHEREDGE , Westminster, California. 
We had a sober living home behind our back fence in our single-family home. It was really a nightmare for the houses on both sides of them. They woke up at six 6:30 in the morning and went out in the backyard to smoke cigarettes. They were loud, obnoxious and used tons of foul language. Both families on either side of the home had small chil-dren. There were also numerous police calls and constant noise and shouting during the day and at night. After numerous warnings they tried to contain the house and have more control over it but still continued to fail. Even neighbors had arguments with cli-ents who were outside acting up and talking loud using foul language. Eventually the problems became so great that the owner of the property was contacted that it was no longer acceptable to be renting out for Sober Living homes. Shortly after that, the sober living home was disbanded, and the house was put up for sale. It is now being used as a single-family home and the neighbors are all very happy including ourselves. Sober liv-ing homes need to be in buildings away from normal residential living. People do not have to put up with that kind of obnoxious noise and action 24 hours a day to feel like they’re helping people get sober. Put these homes somewhere in an industrial area near an air-port or commercial buildings where they cannot disturb the other tenants or neigh-bors. We owe nothing to these people and they should not be distracting from our lives. D

units and the grounds around them. We are often out in the front where we care for about 20 trees and grass that borders both [ADDRESS]. The trees are planted on a four foot high berm, set back from the grass and sidewalk. There are sections of this berm where plants are thick, and people can hide between these plants and the fence that runs around the top of the berm. We find trash, liquor bottles, condoms, dis-carded (stolen) contents of someone’s glove box, clothes, etc. scattered in spots on this berm every week. This has gotten worse in the last few years. About a year ago, my wife and I went out to the front corner in the early morning and found a lost, dazed and haggard woman in her bathrobe and slippers, asking for help to find her rehab facility. From what I could tell, she was 6–8 blocks north and west so must have been walking for some time. Another time when my wife went out to water, a homeless man who had spent the night in our berm was startled by her. He spent a few minutes trying to tie a small cart with his belongings to a junk bike that he had concealed for the night. She did not feel safe, so I came out until he peddled away. This must stop! Our city has become a cesspool because of these rehab centers. I don’t care how well they are managed, the people that are collected from around the country and dumped into these centers, are not productive members of our commu-nity but predators who see the people of this community and their property as targets for exploiting their toxic lifestyles. Please help us put some controls in place. Better yet, an end to it all. Thank you. Best regards, P

I have spoken directly to the city council about this terrible matter! I even asked if anyone on the council owned one! There are over 350 of these not supervised homes here! A friend was robbed on [ADDRESS] two years ago from one of these homes! Check your records [NAME]! Do something now to rid us of this menace! J
ANMCALLISTER , Costa Mesa, California. 
Dana, I support you in this. I know my neighborhood was so scared that one was going in. We met and signed petitions for it not to go in. It is so frustrating when a law is passed that it does not take into account neighborhoods that are open and have chil-dren playing in the yards. The smoke, noise and smell from these places is terrible. The unscrupulous people as well. The entire en-ergy changes in a community to be closed in-stead of being a place to rest the body after a hard week of earning money to afford a place to offer a peaceful place to raise a fam-ily. I feel for the residents who go to City Council and have to plead their case to keep them out. I know you feel the same way. Keep up the good work. R
OBERTA LEWIS, Costa Mesa, California. 
Huntington Beach Council Member Erik Peterson will be speaking on my behalf in re-gard to Sober Living Homes in Huntington Beach, CA cc: Congressman Dana Rohr-abacher I am really distraught with this leg-islation that allows greedy landlords to turn residents homes into Drug Detox Homes or as most call them Sober Living Homes with 6 residents living in these homes as drug ad-dicts try to sober up. I would never buy a home that is located next to one of these Sober Living Homes but the legislation that makes it legal to do this Code Enforcement allows this to happen putting our city in harm’s way with lots of crime. Attached is Video proving that this drug addict tres-passed onto my property and walked into my bedroom at 1:30 am and I showed Huntington Beach Police Department the full video and they said it was most likely a drunk from Main Street. My home is [ADDRESS] next door is [ADDRESS] where this guy came from. Huntington Beach Police Department gave the benefit of doubt to the drug addict protecting their rights over mine saying it was perfectly legal to have 6 residents in one home. The legislation that makes this legal is a crime and Drug Detox Homes should be illegal where residents live. Code Enforce-ment should protect the citizens’ rights first before drug addicts’ rights to live anywhere they have a Sober Living Home. It is wrong and creates crime wherever they are located putting kids and senior citizens in harm’s way. Driving into my home now is like en-tering a combat zone because you have no clue who is going to be trespassing on your property while they live next door. Not to mention Code Enforcement allows this to happen when they say safety is our first con-cern for our citizens then back stab us by al-lowing Sober Living Homes in our city bring-ing crime up because these homes are hardly supervised and always have more people en-tering the homes than what’s legally al-lowed. My security cameras catch all the curfew violators and strange visitors coming and going and we always have noise issues with tons of cigarette smoke polluting our air as they party late into the evening changing our neighborhoods for the worst with no regards to HB Citizens Rights. If Code Enforcement was doing their job they would have never allowed a Sober Living Home at [ADDRESS] because not only am I 70 years old now I am also 100% service-con-nected disabled from the Vietnam War and I rent part of my home out to another disabled Veteran who also is 100% service-connected from his injuries while serving in the Viet-nam War. At best, Sober Living Homes are a violation as elder abuse and Huntington Beach Code Enforcement should say this lo-cation is wrong because elders and disabled veterans live next door to [ADDRESS]. Code Enforcement should have protected our rights before drug addicts’ rights to live next door to my house and destroy my tranquility at [ADDRESS] Huntington Beach California. I am shocked and appalled that this Sober Living Home Legislation is allowed in the State of California and I want it abolished. Being forced to live next to Sober Living Homes is a crime in itself because it only benefits greedy landlords and insurance com-panies that are on the take while very few are getting sober. Thank you for allowing me to tell my ex-perience with this issue of Sober Living Homes and how it has affected my tran-quility in my retirement years. ROBIN RUSTAN , Huntington Beach, California. 
I have seen the clientele from these sober living homes in my neighborhood. I’ve been a registered nurse over 25 years with experi-ence with individuals with substance abuse and mental health issues. The individuals I see often are not sober and often have a pri-mary mental health issue they are trying to self-medicate with. Theft has gone way up since these homes have grown substantially. Theft by breaking into homes and cars. I have been spat on for not giving money and observed IV drug use. These homes seem to accept the money and within 30–60 days these individuals are on the streets with no sup-port committing crime for the drug habit that was not treated appropriately. Over-sight is a must, not likely but I would rec-ommend department of public health nurse/ surveyors. DONNA SEGEBERG , Huntington Beach, California. 
My son is presently living in a Sober Liv-ing House in Huntington Beach, CA. I couldn’t be more grateful for this experience. This awful drug infestation is touching way too many of our young men and women and our families! We are very fortunate to have found an excellent Christian Recovery Cen-ter and Sober Living House. We need so many more in decent neighborhoods! Please help us help our loved ones recover from this horrible situation and becoming good com-munity citizens! T
ONISTEIN, Seal Beach, California. 
I am a longtime resident of Huntington Beach, CA. I recently was notified by the neighborhood watch that there is a sober liv-ing home on the same street that I reside on as of April 2018. I also found out that the residents have had several run-ins with the local police for criminal activity including public drug usage, trespassing, indecent ex-posure to children amongst other parole vio-lations. There is an elementary school that is less than 100 yards away from this SLH and my daughter attends that school. She walks to school every week day. I have seri-ous concerns about her safety because she must walk by this house twice a day. The neighbors no longer let their children play on the street because of all the recent police activity. My main concern is the safety of the children, but my other concern is the lack of regulation and supervision at this SLH. Why are they not zoned? Regulated? Licensed? All they need is an LLC. I request that there be some type of regulation and background checks for these SLH owners. They are making huge profits at our chil-dren’s expense. G
INAO’BRIEN, Huntington Beach, California. 
I have lived in this beautiful city for 20 years. One of the reasons why I choose to raise my family here is because it was family friendly and safe. Unfortunately, in the last year city of Huntington Beach has erected several if not over 100 sober living homes. One such sober living home has opened up on my street. This home has caused many prob-lems, safety, legal altercations on a regular basis. On top of all those issues it is located two houses down from our middle school, that my daughter goes to. Over 100 children walk past or are dropped off in front of this house every single day. I am extremely con-cerned for these children’s safety. And access to drugs. It is beyond believe that the State of California would allow such homes to be near a school. People are not trying to detox or become sober in this home. I believe this house and many other houses are just drug dens. Please crack down on this problem and make sober living homes illegal in family neighborhoods and especially adjacent to a public or private school. G
INAWALTERS , Huntington Beach, California. 
PLEASE support this bill. Even better, come visit Costa Mesa and see how our amaz-ing town has deteriorated because of these ‘‘treatment’’ centers and ridiculous sober living homes. Brokering ‘‘human trafficking’’ and out of control homeless and crime/real estate agents in bed with these treatment centers and then threatening the public if anyone speaks out.

I was born at Hoag Hospital in 1968. I have lived in Newport Beach and Costa Mesa for 50 years. My husband was extremely mentally ill and was an addict. I well understand the situation. The only true help my husband re-ceived for his addictions, was from old school 12 step programs. There are wonderful AA groups and housing in Costa Mesa that are run by committees which are rotated every few months. Check out [REDACTED]. They do amazing work and do it quietly by dona-tions, not scamming insurance companies or families. This model should be supported, not the business for profit one. Again, please support Dana’s bill.

CELEBRATING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF WRWH RADIO 
HON. DOUG COLLINS 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 23, 2018 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 60th Anniversary of WRWH Radio, in Cleveland, Georgia. WRWH Radio began operating as an AM radio station in 1958 and its call letters were derived from White, Rabun, and Habersham counties, which it serves. Over thirty years ago the station was purchased by Dean and Bonnie Dwyer. Since then, WRWH has evolved from operating out of an old Quonset hut on the southern edge of Cleveland, to a state of the art studio on Hood Street. Today, WRWH broadcasts news talk on 93.9 FM. The station also provides learning opportunities for college and high school stu-dents. In its 60 years, WRWH has become a lead-er in covering White County’s local news and was one of WDUN’s original news partners when AccessWDUN.com launched. That part-nership continues today. I join WRWH as they celebrate their 60th anniversary and commend this North Georgia business that continues to thrive.

RAISING AWARENESS OF NA-TIONAL DISABILITY EMPLOY-MENT AWARENESS MONTH 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 23, 2018 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize October as National Dis-ability Employment Awareness Month. This month is an opportunity to raise aware-ness about disability employment issues, edu-cate the public about the value of a workforce inclusive of their skills and talents, and cele-brate the contributions of workers with disabil-ities. National Disability Employment Awareness Month dates to 1945, when Congress enacted a law declaring the first week in October each year ‘‘National Employ the Physically Handi-capped Week.’’ In 1988, Congress expanded the week to a month and changed the name to ‘‘National Disability Employment Awareness Month.’’ As of September 2018, 21.4 percent of the U.S. labor force 16 years old and above have a disability. My home state of Texas has the second largest number of individuals with disabilities in the United States. In 2014, Texas had almost 820,564 individ-uals (6.2 percent) of the total civilian labor force 16 and older in Texas (13,220,312 indi-viduals) had a disability. Although not every person living with dis-abilities can work, it is imperative that we cre-ate opportunities for those who are able and desire to work. For Kayla McKoen, her job is more than just a hobby. As the first registered lobbyist with down syndrome in history, Kayla McKoen shares her passion for advocacy by representing the dif-ferently abled community on Capitol Hill and lobbying for equal rights for those who are dif-ferently abled. Kayla says that ‘‘It feels so important to ad-vocate for others because they might not have that voice themselves, and the more we advo-cate our message, the louder we are. I hope I am helping to change things for future gen-erations of the Differently Abled community.’’ Individuals with disabilities can strengthen the current and future economy and are a val-uable resource for employers. The workforce system must ensure that em-ployers have access to every potential skilled worker. Workplaces welcoming of the talents of all people, including those who are differently abled, are a critical part of our efforts to build an inclusive community and a strong econ-omy. Smart employers know that including dif-ferent perspectives in problem-solving situa-tions leads to better solutions. Hiring employees with diverse abilities strengthens their business, increases competi-tion and drives innovation. Individuals with disabilities enhance work-force diversity and offer employers the skills, knowledge, and experience that Texas busi-nesses need to thrive. Private and public-sector workplaces that support integrated employment opportunities, as well as greater use of assistive tech-nologies in the workplace, can provide individ-uals with disabilities the opportunity to gain and maintain employment. We must commit to providing support for those living with disabilities by further edu-cating ourselves and our communities on dis-ability employment to foster a more inclusive workforce. As we observe National Disability Employ-ment Awareness Month, let us pay tribute to all who fought for better laws, demanded bet-ter treatment, and overcame ignorance and in-difference to make our Nation more perfect. In their honor, and for the betterment of generations of Americans to come, let us con-tinue the work of removing obstacles to em-ployment so every American has the chance to develop their skills and make their unique mark on the world we share. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognition of National Disability Employ-ment Awareness Month and ask all Americans to take time this month to find out what you can do to encourage the employment of those with disabilities and empower all of America’s workforce.

MARINE CORPS SERGEANT ERIC MORANTE 
HON. TED POE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 23, 2018 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 1 in 10 Americans join the military and I am proud to say that the state of Texas consistently meets their quarterly quotas. Texans are raised with a sense of patriotism and civic duty, which is reflected by the number of enlisted members in the military. As of September 2017, Texas had 164,234 members on active duty or re-serves, placing Texas as the 2nd state with the largest population serving in the armed forces. From an early age Texans are taught south-ern hospitality, religion, and love for their country. This is especially true for Marine Corps Sergeant Eric Morante, who recalls wanting to be a US Marine since he was 8 years old. In 2003, weeks after graduating from high school, Eric stepped foot in San Diego, California to complete the Marine Corp boot camp. As an 0311-Infantryman, he was given orders to the 2nd battalion, 7th Marines in Twenty-nine Palms, California. Weeks after reporting for duty, his unit deployed to Iraq. Eric would be assigned to a fire-team that cleared houses in Fallujah. On his first deploy-ment, Eric was conducting raids, patrolling and identifying high value targets, all at the age of 18. Eric completed his first 7-month tour and returned safely to American soil for 6 months before being re-deployed to Iraq on July 4, 2005. Eric’s second deployment was a little dif-ferent than the first. Days before their sched-uled return, the 2nd battalion, 7th Marines, lost 10 men and had 11 injuries from a single ex-plosion caused by a pressure plate IED on the west side of Fallujah. After two ‘‘desert’’ de-ployments and the loss of several comrades, Eric Morante honorably completed his first en-listment. But this proud Texan was not done serving his country or his beloved US Marine Corps. In 2006, he raised his right hand, and for a second time, he swore to defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. As he pre-pared for his new drill-instructor role, he learned that the 2/7 was being re-deployed for another tour. Eric deferred his new orders as a drill-instructor to accompany the men that had become his family, to the Middle-East. The loss of his friends weighed heavy on his heart and he was not prepared to lose more. On April 20th of 2007, four months into this third Iraq deployment, Eric stood watch with 6 Marines and a Navy Corps man, over bridge 286 that overlooks 6 lanes over a major high-way that runs through Iraq. On that day, their lives were forever changed. A dump truck car-rying 3,000 lbs. of explosives detonated just 15 feet away from the bridge. Waking up cov-ered in large remnants of concrete, Eric re-calls sitting up and spitting up blood. His left arm twisted and dislocated and his right leg in an un-natural L-shape. Despite the complete state of shock, the constant ringing in the ears, and the faint voices, Eric managed to account for his men. Miraculously, no men were killed in the explo-sion, and the 6 of the 8 men that were seri-ously injured were medevacked. Unable to save Eric’s severely injured right leg, the doctors of Bethesda Naval Hospital amputated above the knee. Pins were used to repair his left hand, surgery to reconstruct his face was conducted and once again, Eric would have to learn how to walk. Recuperating at the Brooks Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, he found him-self going through a period of depression and began to isolate himself from his loved ones. At one point, was taking 16 prescribed medi-cations to help cope with his PTSD. In 2009, Eric welcomed his first and only son, which gave him purpose and a new per-spective in life. His new role as a father al-lowed him to once again be the Eric he once was; a leader with grit, respect, and desire to help others. Since the explosion, Eric has completed triathlons, 5Ks, and sprints. He also became the first Marine amputee to be sanc-tioned for boxing in the United States and re-mained undefeated for 5 full years. He boxes at fundraising matches that benefit veteran or-ganizations, and has created a name for him-self in the veteran community. He continuously advocates and helps others that struggle with PTSD and visits military hospitals in an effort to guide amputees through the prosthetics process. Mr. Speaker, President Ronald Reagan once said ‘‘some people spend an entire life-time wondering if they made a difference. But the Marines don’t have that problem’’. The great state of Texas commends Eric for his service, courage and resiliency. Semper Fi Marine. And that’s just the way it is.

IN HONOR OF MR. GUY BEATTY 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 23, 2018 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask that my colleagues join me in recog-nizing the achievements and life of Mr. Guy Beatty from McLean, Virginia, a leading phi-lanthropist, entrepreneur, and cherished mem-ber of our community. Mr. Beatty was an astute businessman who became tremendously successful in his busi-ness ventures while maintaining humility and his faith. After he began working in real estate in 1962, with $2000 in his pocket, he achieved vast amounts of success and was able to grow his business as he established partner-ships with those who could help him realize his goals. Mr. Beatty was not only known as a busi-nessman, but a benevolent man who devoted a great deal of his life to philanthropy. He was passionate about helping others and was

known to have a few favorite sayings which embody his altruistic nature: 
Take some, leave some This is God’s money, not mine . . . I’ve been put in the position to help others and give them an opportunity they may not have otherwise had. 
Mr. Beatty always believed that his success was made possible to allow him to serve God. To this point, his philanthropic endeavors have impacted thousands of people directly and countless more indirectly. Schools, churches, hospitals, clinics, students, research programs, and universities have all been improved be-cause of Mr. Beatty’s vision, leadership, and generosity. Notably, Mr. Beatty helped create, fund, and served as the Chairman of the Spi-nal Research Foundation, a national non-profit organization based in Reston, Virginia, to achieve his desire to end spinal suffering. Neck and back pain are the leading cause of disability in the United States, and Guy Beatty didn’t want others to suffer as he had through-out his life. He supported the Foundation to champion research and education focused on eliminating needless suffering and thus enable people to regain their lives. He was a true Spi-nal Champion and his contributions to spinal research and innovation continues to give people hope that proper treatment works. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring the many achievements and life of Mr. Guy Beatty who has given hope and impacted the lives of so many in our commu-nity and around the nation.

CELEBRATING THE ESTABLISH-MENT OF THE WOMEN IN SCIENCE SCHOLARSHIP FUND 
HON. DOUG COLLINS 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 23, 2018 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the establishment of the Women in Science Scholarship at Truett McConnell University. The Office of Advancement and the Pilgram Marpeck School of Science, Technology, Engi-neering, and Mathematics have raised close to $3,000 to fund the scholarship for females ma-joring in biology or exercise science. This scholarship has already helped students at-tend the Integrative Physiology of Exercise Conference through the American College of Sports Medicine in San Diego, California. Because of their efforts in departmental fund raising and garnering private donations, the women selected for this scholarship will be able to present scientific research, enrich their presentation skills, and enhance their profes-sional network for future careers. I celebrate this new opportunity for women in Northeast Georgia and wish the recipients success along their academic journey.

COMMEMORATING KENTUCKY HIGHLANDS INVESTMENT COR-PORATION’S 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 23, 2018 Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 50th Anniver-sary of the Kentucky Highlands Investment Corporation and to celebrate the thousands of jobs that have been created and retained in Southern and Eastern Kentucky as a direct re-sult of their work. Kentucky Highlands is recognized as one of the premier business development organiza-tions in the United States. It has been des-ignated the Lead Entity of one of three Rural Empowerment Zones, one of eight Rural Tax Credit Community Development Corporations, a partner Community Development Corpora-tion of Rural Local Initiative Support Corpora-tion, a Community Development Financial In-stitution (CDFI) and a Community Develop-ment Entity by the U.S. Department of Treas-ury and has received allocations of New Mar-kets Tax Credits. Kentucky Highlands became the nation’s first nonbank lender under the U.S. Depart-ment of Agriculture’s Business and Industry Loan Guaranty program and the first Small Business Administration guaranteed lender under the Community Advantage Program. Kentucky Highlands sponsors entrepreneur development programs and has developed the Kentucky Highlands Business Innovation and Growth Center. When you survey Southern and Eastern Kentucky, the footprint of Kentucky Highlands is abundantly clear. Countless businesses have been established in our rural, moun-tainous region that otherwise would not be here without the direct investments and sup-port of Kentucky Highlands. This organization has coordinated, implemented and promoted business growth across its 22-county service area. The first venture capital investment that Kentucky Highlands made was in 1972 for Outdoor Venture Corporation (OVC) in McCreary County. Today, OVC is a thriving manufacturing company in Stearns, Kentucky that has won repeated successful bids for mili-tary contract work, employing over 200 people in our region. Our people take great pride in producing products for our U.S. warfighters, and we can celebrate their ongoing work as a result of the visionary seed funding that Ken-tucky Highlands made 46 years ago. In addition to its pioneering efforts in busi-ness development, Kentucky Highlands has also utilized its success to impact social devel-opment and improve the quality of low-income housing in Southern and Eastern Kentucky. The Highlands Housing Corporation has helped over 150 families achieve the dream of homeownership, while other programs have been implemented to transform energy-effi-cient housing options where it’s needed the most. Finally, I want to applaud the visionary lead-ership of Jerry Rickett, who was named Presi-dent and CEO of Kentucky Highlands in 1989. He is a native of Southern Kentucky who was determined to make a dynamic change in his home region through economic development and improvements in housing. Rather than seeing challenges, he sees opportunities, and it’s that same drive and determination that has guided this flagship organization to great suc-cess, benefitting families and businesses across our region. I’m incredibly grateful for the commitment that Kentucky Highlands Investment Corpora-tion has made in Southern and Eastern Ken-tucky, and it is with great enthusiasm that I wish them many more years of success on their 50th Anniversary.

country, Firman joined the 34th division of the U.S. Naval Reserves in Green Bay in 1940 at the age of 17. He entered the Navy a few months later and was assigned to the USS Maryland in April of 1941. When the USS Maryland left for Pearl Harbor in July of 1941, Firman was aboard the vessel as a gunner’s mate first-class at the time of the attacks. The morning of December 7, 1941, Firman was preparing for Mass aboard the USS Okla- homa when he saw the first Japanese bomb-ers flying overhead. The USS Oklahoma was next to the USS Maryland in the harbor when it suffered major damage and capsized. Firman bravely ran into the face of danger and took up arms as he defended the base with anti-aircraft guns. He later helped pull his de-ceased brothers in arms from the sunken ship. On that tragic day, 460 men perished on the USS Oklahoma and the USS Maryland lost five brave souls. The 4 days following the at-tacks, Firman and his fellow soldiers rescued 32 men from the hull of the USS Oklahoma. Firman continued his brave service to the country for three years on the USS Maryland participating in Guadalcanal, the Battle of Tarawa, and the Battle of Kwajalein Atoll. After the war, Firman was assigned to the USS Bayfield APA 33 and was sent to the Marshall Islands for atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll. On February 7, 1947 he was discharged from the Navy after six years and seven days on active duty. Firman was one of more than 16 million or-dinary people that did extraordinary things dur-ing World War II. His willingness to share his story in 2003 at the age of 80 allowed many across Wisconsin, including students through-out Northeast Wisconsin, to hear his account of that day. It was in 2003 that he first visited the Punch Bowl Cemetery in Hawaii and real-ized he wanted to be a voice to tell part of the story of those 2,335 servicemen and women who perished on that day of infamy. With each retelling of his story, Firman shared an impor-tant message: ‘‘Truly, man has got to learn to get along with each other.’’ Firman’s wise words still ring true today. Mr. Balza was 95 when he passed away on Wednesday, October 10, 2018. He was born September 25, 1923, to Theophile and Mary Balza, the youngest of 11 sons. On April 23, 1949, he married Nathalie M. Larscheid. He was a true lover of the outdoors, he enjoyed camping with his family and hunting and fish-ing with his brother-in-law, Carlton Larscheid. He was very proud of becoming a licensed pilot at the age of 63. Words cannot justly thank Mr. Balza for his many years of service to our country. A treas-ure for a community and nation, Mr. Balza cannot be replaced. May his service, dedica-tion, and sacrifice be remembered by all.

REMEMBERING MR. DIEGO ZAMORA 
HON. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM 
OF NEW MEXICO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 23, 2018 Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Diego Zamora, who lost his life after a long battle with cancer at the age of 60. Over the past three decades, Diego built a highly suc-cessful law practice in Santa Fe and was a significant figure in New Mexico’s legal com-munity. Diego was born in New Mexico to a family with a history of success in the legal field. His father, Matias, served as a district court judge in San Miguel, Mora, and Guadalupe counties. His sister, Monica, also served as a district court judge in Albuquerque and now serves on the state Court of Appeals. His brother, Geno, serves as a Santa Fe city attorney and was previously a general counsel for Governor Bill Richardson. Following in his father’s footsteps, Diego re-ceived his law degree from Georgetown Uni-versity in 1984. For decades, he had a suc-cessful law practice with a focus on personal injury, wrongful death, employment, and civil rights cases. Fighting for the little guy was his passion, and he successfully took on powerful interests time and again in order to achieve justice for his clients. In addition to his intellect and passion, he was also known for his warm personality that allowed him to connect with juries. Diego also devoted a great deal of time to the New Mexico Lawyers and Judges Assist-ance Program, an organization that helps members of the legal community dealing with substance abuse issues. He took countless lawyers under his wing during difficult times and was known as a compassionate mentor for many. He was a true fighter and each chal-lenge he overcame made him stronger. His compassion and strength defined him, espe-cially in the face of adversity. Mr. Speaker, I want to express my sincere condolences to all of Diego’s family and loved ones. I hope they are comforted by cherished memories of Diego, and by the fact that so many in our community mourn his loss and celebrate his life with them. f

CONGRATULATING THE PEKIN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ON 125 YEARS OF SERVICE 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 23, 2018 Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Pekin Chamber of Commerce on its 125th Anniversary. The Chamber has joyfully served the Pekin community since 1893. In October of 1893, what is now the Pekin Chamber of Commerce was formed by five businessmen who originally named their new organization the Citizen’s Improvement Asso-ciation of Pekin. The organization set out with the goal of ‘‘advancing the business interest and promoting the commercial growth of the City of Pekin.’’ Although the organization went through several name changes, before settling on the Pekin Area Chamber of Commerce, their mission remained the same. Today, the Pekin Chamber of Commerce continues to serve businesses and consumers in the region as they work to grow and strengthen the local economy. I commend them on their 125th An-niversary for all of the work they have done for the residents of Pekin and look forward to seeing their continued efforts. It is because of groups such as the Pekin Chamber of Commerce that I am especially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional Dis-trict. Mr. Speaker, I would like to again for-mally congratulate the Pekin Chamber of Commerce on its 125th Anniversary and thank them for their service to the community. In October the Pekin Area Chamber of Commerce will be finishing 125 years of lead-ing Pekin businesses.

CONGRATULATING MIKE MILLER ON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 23, 2018 Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my friend, Mike Mil-ler, on his retirement as Executive Director of the Kentucky River Area Development District (KRADD) and for his long-time public service in Eastern Kentucky. Under his direction, KRADD has been a dedicated service organization for local com-munities in the Kentucky River area, which serves Breathitt, Knott, Lee, Leslie, Letcher, Owsley, Perry and Wolfe Counties. KRADD celebrated its 50th Anniversary earlier this year. I can’t overstate the value of the partner-ships and regional planning that have been cultivated by Mike and his leadership of this organization. The infrastructural footprint of KRADD includes 13 million linear feet of water lines and 1.5 million linear feet of sewer lines extended in its service area, as well as nine new water plants and eleven wastewater treat-ment plants. Those fundamental services have been critical for families and businesses alike. As the former Mayor of the City of Jackson, Kentucky, where he dedicated eleven years of service, Mike understands first-hand the eco-nomic challenges of local elected officials in our rural region. His experience as a chief city administrator undoubtedly drove his passion to help city and county leaders access grant op-portunities and to work collectively as a re-gional hub for economic development. Aside from his career in public service, Mike owned and operated a local insurance com-pany for 35 years. Mike’s work ethic and suc-cess have garnered the utmost respect of his colleagues and multiple organizations across the Commonwealth of Kentucky. He served as President of the Kentucky League of Cities for one year and as a board member and officer of the Kentucky Council of Area Development Districts. He has also volunteered his experi-ence and time to help countless local boards, including the Jackson Independent School System, the Kentucky River Authority, Ken-tucky River Community Care and many oth-ers. Outside of boardrooms and office buildings, Mike has dedicated several years on the baseball diamond, coaching local Little League teams and spending time outdoors as Scout Master for Boy Scout Troop 91 for 12 years. Mike understands the importance of mentoring and investing in the lives of our future leaders. I have enjoyed working with Mike over the years to improve our infrastructure and eco-nomic opportunities in Eastern Kentucky. I wish Mike and his wife, Paula, many peaceful and fun-filled years of retirement together with their family. MEMORIAL PARK: 600 ACRES OF HISTORY HON. TED POE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 23, 2018 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, what’s in a name? Shakespeare would have us believe that we should not assign so much meaning to a name. A rose by any other name would smell just as sweet, would it not? Well, for us southerners, a name is something we hold near and dear to our hearts—and our herit-age. We name our children after mother’s maiden names, double ‘‘first names’’ often in-clude their daddy’s or granddaddy’s names. Heck, even our dogs’ names have personal and historical significance. I say this, because I want to talk about a particular place that is near and dear to me and many Houstonians, but its namesake has lost its rightful place in our history. Each day, over 10,000 people use Memorial Park. The park is Houston’s largest public space; almost double the size of New York’s Central Park and larger than Chicago’s Lincoln Park, and London’s Hyde Park. It is Texas, so naturally it’s bigger. The park’s 600-acre urban wilder-ness is one of the largest centrally located urban forests in the country. But long before it was packed with Lululemon clad joggers, it was Camp Logan, one of sixteen military training camps during World War I. The 7,600 acres of forested land on Buffalo Bayou housed and trained nearly 30,000 soldiers. Its massive size equaled over half the size of Manhattan with over 1,300 buildings. Nearly 1,000 Camp Logan soldiers lost their lives during the war and over 6,200 were wounded. The Camp’s place in history is also marked by the Houston Riots of 1917, which broke out after a series of troubling events between Houston police and African-American soldiers, leaving 20 dead. It was the site of one of only two African-American training camps. Of those soldiers trained at Camp Logan, over 75 were awarded France’s Croix de Guerre. As early as the 1820’s, the ‘‘pinery’’ of Me-morial Park appeared in our history books, when Jane Long, the ‘‘Mother of Texas’’ re-counts camping there after fleeing Fort Las Casas on her way to San Antonio after her husband, Capt. James Long’s death in his quest to conquer Spanish Texas. In 1912, Mayor Horace Rice Baldwin, another signifi-cant ‘‘name’’ in Houston’s history, pursued the idea of acquiring a large park along Buffalo Bayou ‘‘that will for all time be of sufficient magnitude for our people.’’ When the United States entered the War to End All Wars, the War Department leased 7,600 acres of land on Buffalo Bayou to estab-lish a training base named Camp Logan. In 1923, when the camp is deserted, local resi-dent, Catherine Mary Emmott wrote to the Houston Chronicle suggesting that ‘‘the city buy some of the land and turn it into a park in memory of the boys.’’ Enter another notable ‘‘name’’ in Houston history, the Hogg Family. In 1924, Will and Mike Hogg, with minority owner Henry Stude, bought two tracts of former Camp Logan land and sold the acre-age to the city at cost. In May of that year, the City of Houston officially established Memorial Park in memory of the soldiers who trained there. The Hogg’s sister, Miss Ima Hogg, assumed the role of guardian of the Park, safeguarding it from numerous encroachments over the years. Under her guidance, landscape archi-tects were hired to develop a long-term vision plan for the park which included an 18–hole golf course, scenic drives, trails for hikers and ‘‘nature students,’’ bridle paths, and an amphi-theater. Over the next 30 years, the park became home to architect John Bredemus’ ‘‘greatest golf course ever,’’ added a popular archery range and set the stage for the arrival in the 1950’s of the trail riders on the Salt Grass Trail as they make their way into the Houston Livestock and Rodeo—still a favorite tradition to this day. In the 1970’s, Houstonian Seymour Leiberman, dubbed the ‘‘Father of Jogging,’’ started coaching runners for area high-school cross country meets, spearheading the popu-larity of jogging in the park. When I was judge in Houston, I took to these same trails every day, as later did my kids. I can’t tell you how many miles I’ve run in Memorial Park. Run-ning was so much a part of my life, Runner’s World magazine even featured me in the 1980’s. The park has seen its fair share of chal-lenges, including the devastating drought in 2011 that claimed nearly 80 percent of its trees. But just like Miss Ima Hogg’s good stewardship of the past, another benefactor stepped forward to ensure future generations of Houstonians can enjoy Memorial Park and preserve the namesake of those that served in the Great World War. Houston’s Kinder Foundation granted $70 million to underscore the need to fast-track Memorial Park’s Master Plan to create the best urban park in America. As a result, this energized the park’s public and private part-ners to invest up to $205 million more. These efforts will take the Master Plan from proposal to reality in just 10 years and en-hance and protect Memorial Park for countless years to come. These efforts have set new standards in green space planning and public- private funding partnerships. Kinder Founda-tion’s inspiring public-private partnerships have changed Houston’s color palette from gray to green. I hope that as you run the three-mile loop or drive down Memorial Drive from downtown to the Galleria, that you take a minute to appre-ciate not just the beauty and the short escape from the city, but really appreciate the history of Memorial Park, those that gave their lives for our freedom, and those who have made it a priority to preserve it. And that’s just the way it is.

she has used her extensive legal experience to defend the rights of immigrants. Professor Cooper is nationally recognized as an expert on immigration detention issues and the immi-gration consequences of criminal convictions. Her work defending the rights of immigrants demonstrates her fearless commitment to pre-serving justice in the face of overwhelming op-position. Prior to serving as the co-director of the Immigration Law Clinic at UC Davis, she worked as the Senior Staff Attorney for the Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. While there, she initiated the Detained Immi-grant Children’s Rights Project, provided rep-resentation and pro se assistance for adult de-tainees, and mentored pro bono attorneys. In addition to legal activism for the rights of immi-grants Professor Cooper also serves as an in-structor, legal scholar, mentor, and inspiration for our next generation of legal activists. From Professor Cooper’s work advocating for the rights of detained immigrants to her work on human rights issues in Haiti, her career and volunteerism demonstrate a strong commit-ment to human rights which is worthy of com-mendation.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF GREGORY CALHOUN 
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL 
OF ALABAMA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 23, 2018 Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life and legacy of Mr. Gregory Calhoun, who passed away on Thursday, October 11, 2018, at the age of 66. Calhoun was a pioneering busi-nessman and the first black supermarket owner in the South. Through his entrepre-neurial success and his contributions to Mont-gomery and communities across Alabama, Calhoun inspired those around him. His enter-prising spirit and giving nature will not be for-gotten. Calhoun was born on September 10, 1952, in Detroit, Michigan. At an early age, his family moved to Montgomery, Alabama. There, Cal-houn learned about the fundamentals of run-ning a business from his father, Thomas Cal-houn Sr., who was a business owner, and his mother, who was head of housekeeping at a local hotel. From his parents, Calhoun also learned about the value of standing up for what you believe. In 1965, when Dr. King marched from Selma to Montgomery to highlight the injustice of voter suppression in the South, Calhoun’s family joined the march. Calhoun was just 12, but he ran to the front of the march, where he met Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. It was this his-toric march which helped to expose the bru-tality of Jim Crow laws in the South and which built public support for the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Calhoun began work in the grocery busi-ness at a young age, starting as a bag boy at the local Southwest Super Foods. He was only 14 years old at the time, but he dreamed of someday owning the supermarket himself. Climbing the ladder of success was a slow process, but over the course of a decade Cal-houn rose from stock boy to supermarket manager to an executive position with his su-permarket’s parent firm, Hudson-Thompson Co. When Calhoun found out that Hudson- Thompson Co. was selling Southwest Super Foods, he jumped at the chance to buy the supermarket where he had gotten his start. Finding a loan to buy the store was not easy. Calhoun approached several Montgomery bankers, all of whom turned him down. Even-tually, Calhoun found a willing financier in New York, but in order to secure funding, he had to put up his house and his life’s savings as col-lateral for the loan. With everything on line, Calhoun got to work managing his grocery business. He imme-diately began making improvements to the store, assuring store employees they would receive raises, buying new equipment and opening a deli, bakery and seafood shop, among other improvements. It was hard work, but he was not alone. Calhoun pointed to his faith in God and his family’s support as keys to his success. As he was starting his super-market business, Calhoun was able to work the long hours required to grow his stores be-cause his wife, Verlyn, and his children were by his side. Over the course of his career, Calhoun built his supermarket business up to include 15 locations. Calhoun Foods would operate in west Montgomery for more than 20 years. As a successful leader in the food industry, Calhoun became the first African American elected to the Food Marketing Institute (FMI) Board of Directors. At FMI, Calhoun served three consecutive terms on the organization’s Executive Committee and launched the pop-ular FMI African American Share Group. Cal-houn credited his family’s help running the su-permarket business for giving him the time necessary to dedicate to his board position at FMI. After his success in the supermarket indus-try, Calhoun diversified his business ventures. In 1993, Calhoun and Associates was formed to assist Fortune 500 Companies with Minority and Diversity Affairs. Calhoun also founded other business ventures including Calhoun Communication and Superior Brokerage, both of which built on Calhoun’s success as an en-trepreneur. In addition to running businesses and sitting on the board of FMI, Calhoun committed him-self to uplifting his community and opening doors of opportunity for others. Through the establishment of the Greg Calhoun Founda-tion, Calhoun supported charities and commu-nity organizations that make a difference in the lives of young people, the elderly, the homeless, displaced Veterans and the medi-cally inflicted. Calhoun also served on the boards of many charitable organizations in-cluding the United Way, Sickle Cell Anemia Foundation, and the Montgomery Area Food Bank. The Calhoun Celebrity Golf Tournament was Calhoun’s major fundraiser to support do-nations to The Sickle Cell Foundation of Greater Montgomery, Macon and Dallas Counties, The Calhoun P.A.R.I.S Parenting Scholardome Program, and R.E.S.T.O.R. Shelter for the Homeless and Displaced Vet-erans. Icons including Smokey Robinson and Steve Harvey joined the golf tournament regu-larly and helped to make it a philanthropic success. Today we remember Calhoun as an advo-cate, not as a voice for the left or for the right, but as a voice for all people. During his life, Calhoun fought for jobs, he fought for our rights, and he fought to give underserved communities a shot at success. He would work with Republicans or Democrats if he thought they could make a positive difference. Calhoun worked side-by-side with freedom fighters like Rev. Jesse Jackson as a Rainbow PUSH board member. He also supported now- Congresswoman Martha Roby, a Republican, when she first ran for City Council. Calhoun did not see party affiliation, he saw opportuni-ties to make a difference, and he seized on them. For his business success and commu-nity leadership, Calhoun was recognized with an award for the National Minority Retail Firm of the Year in 1990 by the United States De-partment of Commerce. Calhoun was also chosen to tour with President Clinton during the 1999 Economic Development Tour, and he was appointed to serve on the board of First Lady Michelle Obama’s Healthy Food Initiative in 2011. Calhoun leaves behind his loving and faith-ful wife Verlyn, his sons Malcolm and Gregory Renard, and one of his biggest cheerleaders, his daughter ShaKenya, and his grandchildren whom he adored, Jacquenya, Mackinzie, Kaylin, Morgan, Yorel, Kelsie, London, and Ari. For future generations, Calhoun had a few words of advice. ‘‘Nothing worthwhile is free,’’ he said. Calhoun’s mantra of working hard, studying, and knowing what you do took him from bag boy to business leader, and for as-piring young leaders in our community today, his words are worth remembering. Calhoun taught us that success is not some series of shortcuts or lucky draws, what drives success is dedication, it is your expertise and your de-liberate focus on your work. This was a mes-sage that Calhoun shared with students, en-trepreneurs, and employees. As a new gen-eration sets out to blaze their own trail, I be-lieve that the advice Calhoun gave and the guidance he provided will have a lasting im-pact. On a personal note, Greg Calhoun has al-ways been an inspiration to me through my. work in the public and private sectors. I re-member Calhoun as an optimist who saw the opportunity in every challenge he faced. His

achievements as an entrepreneur were a con-stant reminder that there is no secret ingre-dient to success—just our own hard work and dedication. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the 7th Congres-sional District and the State of Alabama, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the life and contributions of Greg Calhoun. He was a community leader and a Montgomery treasure whose work to open doors for others has changed countless lives.

COMMENDING THE ALEXANDRIA HARMONIZERS’ 70TH ANNIVER-SARY 
HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR. 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 23, 2018 Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend the Alexandria Harmonizers, one of the premiere men’s a cappella choruses in the nation, as they celebrate their 70th anniver-sary this year. The Alexandria Harmonizers have been based in Alexandria since their founding in 1948. The nonprofit organization specializes in four-part harmony, one of a cappella’s most challenging forms, and regularly performs with 80 to 100 men on stage. The Alexandria Har-monizers have won four International Cham-pionship gold medals and numerous other awards while performing at notable venues such as the White House, United States Su-preme Court, United States Capitol, Kennedy Center, and Carnegie Hall. The Alexandria Harmonizers regularly con-tribute to local Alexandria and Northern Vir-ginia communities through a variety of activi-ties, such as free public concerts, community music events, free singing valentines, and per-formances at senior centers and retirement homes. A prime testament to this involvement is the Alexandria Harmonizers’ youth harmony festival, which introduces local high school students to the joys of a cappella singing. On a global scale, the Alexandria Harmoni-zers have served as international ambas-sadors through varying performances across Europe and Asia. For example, to mark the 70th anniversary of the D-Day invasion, the Alexandria Harmonizers travelled to Nor-mandy, France and sang at a series of com-memorative events. The group’s poise while representing the United States abroad truly demonstrates their patriotism and dedication to the American people. Through their commitment to artistic quality, the Alexandria Harmonizers continue to fulfill their mission of ‘‘entertaining, educating, and enriching lives through excellence in a cap-pella harmony’’. I commend the Alexandria Harmonizers for their devout service to Vir-ginia, the United States, and the world. IN RECOGNITION OF THE AMER-ICAN HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL HON. BRENDA L. LAWRENCE 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 23, 2018 Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the American Human Rights Council for their exemplary efforts in pro-moting justice and equality for all Americans. Since the organization’s founding in 2014, the American Human Rights Council (AHRC) has made its mission to protect, promote, and defend human rights, as defined by the United States Constitution and outlined in the United Nations’ 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The AHRC was formed to protect these rights and advocate for anyone whose rights were being violated or denied. Initially focused on the rights of prisoners, the AHRC has expanded their efforts to re-store human rights wherever they are threat-ened or denied. Since then, AHRC has held public educational awareness campaigns and forums pertaining to its mission while also ad-vancing its outreach and partnerships with or-ganizations across the metro Detroit area. I commend their efforts to report on human rights violations, engage in public outreach, and encourage governments and societies to respect international human rights laws. Given their tremendous work and efforts to-wards ensuring equality and dignity for all, the AHRC was awarded United Nations-Economic and Social, or ECOSOC, Consultative Status this year. ECOSOC serves as the central forum for discussing international economic and social issues and formulating policy rec-ommendations to member nations. I congratu-late the AHRC team members for their tre-mendous work in achieving this status, which will allow the organization to advance their goals by actively engaging with the ECOSOC and its subsidiary bodies. Mr. Speaker, 2018 marks the 70th Anniver-sary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I commend the American Human Rights Council for working to reaffirm the im-portance of its enduring human rights prin-ciples and standards worldwide. I am proud to have the American Human Rights Council as an integral part of our community.

HON. JOHN GARAMENDI

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 23, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, she serves generously and selflessly as a Deputy District Attorney for Solano County. She is a dedi-cated prosecutor committed to upholding the law in her community.

REMEMBERING GREGORY P. FROHN 
HON. BRAD R. WENSTRUP 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, October 23, 2018 Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I rise in re-membrance of Gregory P. Frohn, a beloved husband and father. He passed on at the age of 54, on September 26, 2018. Greg was a champion diver and swimmer in his youth. He later pursued a career as an orthotic and prosthetic technician and made it possible for thousands of people to walk and enjoy life, pain free. Greg is survived by his wife Karen, his daughter Erin M. Frohn Rizzo, two grand-children, eleven-year-old Dylan Rizzo and four-year-old Alayna Rizzo, his brother J. Pat-rick Jr. and nephew J. Patrick Frohn III, and his mother and father, G. Elain Frohn, and J. Patrick Frohn, Sr. By all accounts he was a good man, a lov-ing husband, and a devoted father. He was greatly loved himself and will be missed by all who knew him.
