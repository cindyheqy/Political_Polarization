PRAYER Reverend Timothy P.

We look out at Your creation, budding new with life from every window, reminding us that as You have raised Your Son to new life, You will continue to raise up all who turn to You. You can turn fear into promise, de-spair into hope, defeat into victory, and remind us that new life still flows in spite of everything. This is the joy of Easter. This is Your gift to us this day. May we live and proclaim this new life in all that we say and do. We pray, amen.

THANKING ELENI ROUMEL FOR HER DEDICATED SERVICE TO THE HOUSE 
HON. PAUL D. RYAN 
OF WISCONSIN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 5, 2018 Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize Eleni M. Roumel, who is leaving the House to become the Deputy Counsel to the Vice Presi-dent of the United States. Ms. Roumel has served in the House’s Office of General Coun-sel for more than five years as an Assistant General Counsel. During her tenure, Ms. Roumel played a crucial role in safeguarding the legal and institutional interests of the House of Representatives, particularly in con-nection with federal court litigation involving issues of great institutional importance. Spe-cifically, Ms. Roumel was instrumental in the formation and presentation of the House’s powerful legal arguments in United States House of Representatives v. Burwell, the groundbreaking litigation protecting the House’s constitutional prerogative to appro-priate federal funds. In addition, Ms. Roumel provided invaluable legal advice and represen-tation to Committees of the House, including in connection with Committee on Oversight and Government Reform v. Holder, which in-volves civil enforcement of the House’s con-stitutionally-based oversight authority against the Attorney General of the United States. Ms. Roumel’s work on behalf of the House has been of the highest caliber and I have no doubt that the Vice President will benefit from her exceptional legal counsel. On behalf of the entire House community, I thank Ms. Roumel for her dedicated service, and wish for her the very best in all of her future endeavors.

TRIBUTE TO WARD UMBAUGH 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 5, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Ward Umbaugh, of Adair, Iowa for earning the American FFA Degree. Ward was recently awarded this degree at the National FFA Con-vention in Indianapolis. Ward was the first member of the AC/GC FFA Chapter to receive the award. He is the son of Gretchen and Bill Umbaugh. The American FFA Degree is awarded to members who have demonstrated the highest level of commitment to FFA and made signifi-cant accomplishments in their supervised agri-cultural experience. Ward had to meet certain requirements, such as studying agriculture for three years in high school, earning money in an agriculture field and investing that money into their business, participation in community service and having a record of outstanding leadership ability and community involvement. The work toward this degree involved many years of hard work and dedication in agricul-tural pursuits. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to represent leaders like Ward in the United States Con-gress and it is with great pride that I recognize and applaud him for utilizing his talents to reach his goals. I invite my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives to join me in congratulating him on receiving this esteemed designation, and wishing him the best of luck in all his future endeavors. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF IAN DONAHUE ON HIS OFFER OF APPOINTMENT TO ATTEND THE UNITED STATES NAVAL ACADEMY 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 5, 2018 Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to pay special tribute to an out-standing student from Ohio’s Fifth Congres-sional District. I am pleased to announce that Ian Donahue of Sylvania, Ohio has been of-fered an appointment to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. Ian’s offer of appointment permits him to at-tend the United States Naval Academy this fall with the incoming Class of 2022. Attending one of our nation’s military academies not only offers the opportunity to serve our country, but also guarantees a world-class education while undertaking one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of a lifetime. Ian brings a tremendous amount of leader-ship, service, and dedication to the incoming Class of 2022. While attending Northview High School in Sylvania, Ohio, Ian served as Presi-dent of the National Honors Society, and par-ticipated in student government, World Lan-guage Club, and Spanish Honors Society. Throughout high school, Ian participated in football and was captain for the lacrosse team, earning varsity letters in both sports. Ian was also involved in student council and Interact. I am confident that Ian will carry the lessons of his student and athletic leadership to the Naval Academy. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Ian Donahue on his offer of appointment to the United States Naval Acad-emy. Our service academies offer the finest military training and education available. I am positive that Ian will excel during his career at the Naval Academy, and I ask my colleagues to join me in extending their best wishes to him as he begins his service to our Nation. COACH THOMAS NAMED 2018 COACH OF THE YEAR HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 5, 2018 Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Albert Thomas for being named Coach of the Year by the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC). Coach Thomas led the Missouri City Elkins High School Knights to their sixth district championship in his 13 years as coach. The Knights have qualified for the playoffs 11 times and have won eight area championships under Thomas. He has also taught mathe-matics for 30 years. Thomas was presented with the award on April 1st at the annual NABC Guardians of the Game Awards Show in San Antonio. He has also been named dis-trict coach of the year four times. On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-sional District of Texas, congratulations again to Coach Albert Thomas for being named the 2018 Coach of the Year. I thank him for his dedication to our education system and for sharing his passion for basketball with our stu-dents.

THE OCCASION OF THE 50TH ANNI-VERSARY OF THE ASSASSINA-TION OF THE REV. DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 5, 2018 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, April 4, 2018 marks the 50th anniversary of one of the darkest and most sorrowful days in American history, the assassination in Memphis, Ten-nessee of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The mortal life of one of the towering figures of the 20th century may have been cut short on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel a half century ago, but the spirit that animated that life and inspired a nation lives on and reminds us that nothing is impossible when we are guided by the better angels of our nature. In remembering the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., we commemorate a man of action, who put his life on the line for freedom and justice every day. We honor the courage of a man who en-dured harassment, threats beatings, and even bombings. We celebrate the man who went to jail 29 times to achieve freedom for others, and who knew he would pay the ultimate price for his leadership, but kept on marching and pro-testing and organizing anyway. Dr. King once said that we all have to de-cide whether we ‘‘will walk in the light of cre-ative altruism or the darkness of destructive selfishness.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE392 April 5, 2018 
‘‘Life’s most persistent and nagging ques-tion,’’ he said, is ‘‘what are you doing for oth-ers?’’ And when Dr. King talked about the end of his mortal life in one of his last sermons, on February 4, 1968 in the pulpit of Ebenezer Baptist Church, even then he lifted up the value of service as the hallmark of a full life: ‘‘I’d like somebody to mention on that day Martin Luther King, Jr. tried to give his life serving others,’’ he said. ‘‘I want you to say on that day, that I did try in my life . . . to love and serve humanity.’’ We should also remember that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was, above all, a per-son who was always willing to speak truth to power. There is perhaps no better example of Dr. King’s moral integrity and consistency than his criticism of the Vietnam War being waged by the Johnson Administration, an administration that was otherwise a friend and champion of civil and human rights. Martin Luther King, Jr. was born in Atlanta, Georgia on January 15, 1929. Martin’s youth was spent in our country’s Deep South, then run by Jim Crow and the Ku Klux Klan. For young African-Americans, it was an en-vironment even more dangerous than the one they face today. A young Martin managed to find a dream, one that he pieced together from his read-ings—in the Bible, and literature, and just about any other book he could get his hands on. Not only did those books help him educate himself, but they also allowed him to work through the destructive and traumatic experi-ences of blatant discrimination, and the dis-criminatory abuse inflicted on himself, his fam-ily, and his people. As a youngster, Dr. King learned to use his imagination and his dreams to see right through those ‘‘White Only’’ signs—to see the reality that all men, and women, regardless of their place of origin, their gender, or their creed, are created equal. Dr. King was a dreamer and through dreams he was able to lift his mind beyond the reality of his segregated society to a be-loved place where it was possible that white and black, red and brown, and all others live, work, and prosper together in harmony. But the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was not an idle daydreamer. He shared his visions through speeches that motivated others to join in his nonviolent effort to lift themselves from poverty and isolation by creating a new America where equal justice and institutions were facts of life. In the Declaration of Independence in 1776, Thomas Jefferson wrote, ‘‘We hold these truths to be self evident, that all Men are Cre-ated Equal.’’ At that time and for centuries to come, Afri-can-Americans were historically, culturally, and legally excluded from inclusion in that declara-tion. Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King’s ‘‘I Have a Dream’’ Speech, delivered 54 years ago, on August 28, 1963, was a clarion call to each citizen of this great nation that we still hear today. His request was simply and eloquently con-veyed—he asked America to allow of its citi-zens to live out the words written in its Dec-laration of Independence and to have a place in this nation’s Bill of Rights. The 1960s were a time of great crisis and conflict. It was the decade of the Cuban Missile Cri-sis, the Vietnam War, and the assassinations of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Mal-colm X, Presidential Candidate Robert Ken-nedy, and the man we honor here today. The dream expressed and shared by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. helped win major victories in the battle for civil rights. It started when Dr. King led the Montgomery Bus Boycott, with Rosa Parks and others, which lasted for 381 days, and ended when the United States Supreme Court outlawed ra-cial segregation on all public transportation. But the dream did not die there. It continued with a peaceful march for suf-frage that started in Selma, Alabama on March 7, 1965, a day that was immediately known and will always be remembered as ‘‘Bloody Sunday,’’ when a peaceful march for voting rights ended in bloodshed and violence at the hands of law enforcement officers as the marchers crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge. When the life of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was stolen from us, he was a very young 39 years old. People remember that Dr. King died in Memphis, but few can remember why he was there. On that fateful day in 1968 Dr. King came to Memphis to support a strike by the city’s sanitation workers. The garbage men there had recently formed a chapter of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees to demand better wages and working conditions. But the city refused to recognize their union, and when the 1,300 employees walked off their jobs the police broke up the rally with mace and Billy clubs. It was then that union leaders invited Dr. King to Memphis. Despite the danger he might face entering such a volatile situation, it was an invitation he could not refuse. Not because he longed for danger, but be-cause the labor movement was intertwined with the civil rights movement for which he had given up so many years of his life. The death of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., will never overshadow his life. That is his legacy as a dreamer and a man of action. It is a legacy of hope, tempered with peace. It is a legacy not quite yet fulfilled. I hope that Dr. King’s vision of equality under the law is never lost to us, because without that vision—without that dream—we can never continue to improve on the human condition. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. under-stood that a life well lived, and all of the no-blest virtues—courage, wisdom, grace, love— were rooted in service to others. And he memorably expressed this idea in his last sermon, the one given at Mason Tem-ple in Memphis on April 3, 1968, the evening before he was felled by an assassin: ‘‘But then the Good Samaritan came by. And he reversed the question: ’If I do not stop to help this man, what will happen to him?’ ‘‘That’s the question before you tonight. Not, ‘‘If I stop to help the sanitation workers, what will happen to my job. Not, ’If I stop to help the sanitation workers what will happen to all of the hours that I usually spend in my office every day and every week as a pastor?’ The question is not, ’If I stop to help this man in need, what will happen to me?’ The question is, ’If I do not stop to help the sanitation work-ers, what will happen to them?’ That’s the question. ‘‘Let us rise up tonight with a greater readi-ness. Let us stand with a greater determina-tion. And let us move on in these powerful days, these days of challenge to make Amer-ica what it ought to be. We have an oppor-tunity to make America a better nation. And I want to thank God, once more, for allowing me to be here with you.’’ So in these difficult days of challenge, let us remember and take inspiration from the re-markable, extraordinary, and consequential life of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and move forward together, with greater readiness and determination, to make America a place where all of her people enjoy the blessings of justice, equality, and human dignity. Let us, the living, continue that struggle today and forever, in the incandescent spirit of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. I ask the House to observe a moment of si-lence in memory of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

IN RECOGNITION OF CHARISE M
CHUGH 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 5, 2018 Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Charise McHugh, an outstanding community leader and entrepreneur who has led the Half Moon Bay Chamber of Commerce and Visi-tors’ Bureau for the last 22 years. Charise will retire from that role in the fall but she will leave behind a legacy that will continue to shape the fabric of the Coastside for decades to come. I have been privileged to work with Charise for all these years and to call her a friend. She has always amazed me with her energy and can-do philosophy. Half Moon Bay has about 12,000 residents and the unincorporated county areas nearby has again that many residents. During her time with the Chamber in this charming coast-al region, Charise has achieved a remarkable and diverse list of accomplishments. She founded the Hotel BID and the only broad- based ecotourism program in the state. She started the Coastside Emergency Action Pro-gram, a disaster preparedness plan for San Mateo County and she was instrumental m bringing STEM Robotics to local schools. Charise also deserves credit for producing the Silver Medal Award Business Directory. Half Moon Bay residents and visitors can thank her for starting bus service on the coast, for plant-ing Highway 1 medians and for getting the at-tractive directional signs on Main Street in-stalled. Charise loves her home town and the coast with a passion that is infectious. Her inex-haustible creativity and hard work have re-sulted in a Chamber membership that has soared from 330 businesses to 720 busi-nesses during her tenure. Chamber mixers are highly popular. Charise will tell you that she enjoys her job so much because it is so di-verse, but in truth she is the one who is mak-ing it diverse. She works with businesses,

non-profits and government and is a masterful networker. She has her hands in publishing, website design, video production, event plan-ning, business development, beautification, hospitality, you name it. There is no task Charise won’t tackle. A San Mateo County native, Charise earned her BA from Notre Dame de Namur University and the University of California, Davis. She has been married to her beloved husband Jack for 35 years and they have three chil-dren, Byron, Tamara and Josh, and six grand-children, Annabelle, Sadie, Jacob, Chloe, Jaden and Asha. Charise announced that she will retire this year, but she won’t leave her post until she can help one more time with the Pumpkin Festival, one of Half Moon Bay’s signature events that draws hundreds of thousands of people to the coast. After that, she will do some consulting work. That is Charise, never idle and always engaged. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Represent-atives to rise with me to honor Charise McHugh for her exceptional service to her community. She has transformed the Chamber of Commerce into a powerhouse that has helped make Half Moon Bay into a destina-tion. Residents and visitors alike benefit from her contributions every day and will continue to do so for years to come.

RECOGNIZING THE CAREER OF MR. SETH ADAMS 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 5, 2018 Mr. D
ESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the many accomplishments of Seth Adams as Save Mount Diablo’s (SMD) Land Conservation Director. During his twenty- five years of work at Save Mount Diablo, Mr. Adams has played a large role in shaping the conservation movement in the East Bay. Dur-ing his tenure, SMD has assisted in the pres-ervation of more than 100,000 acres of open space in eastern Alameda and Contra Costa counties, successfully reintroduced the per-egrine falcons at Mt. Diablo, and aided in the development of hundreds of millions of dollars of conservation funding. Mr. Adams began his career of conservation service in the East Bay after moving to Berke-ley in 1981 and volunteering for the campaign against the Peripheral Canal in the Delta. He then joined SMD as its first hired staff mem-ber. Under his guidance, SMD has cham-pioned efforts of restoration and stewardship, aiming to preserve, defend, and restore the re-maining 70,000 acres on Mount Diablo and its foothills. Mr. Adams’s commitment to promoting the success and well-being of Contra Costa’s na-ture and wildlife is deeply appreciated by the community he serves, and he should be proud of SMD’s many notable accomplishments dur-ing his tenure. I thank Mr. Adams for his service and con-gratulate him on his 30th work anniversary. KISD BRINGS HOME 3 GOLD MED-ALS IN STATE WRESTLING CHAMPIONSHIPS HON. PETE OLSON

Cinco Ranch High School’s Kayla De Leon finished her senior season with an individual gold medal and a 35–2 record. Gabi Holloway, a junior at Seven Lakes High School, finished off an undefeated 9–0 season with a gold medal. Daniel Manibog, a repeated state champion from Katy High School, also re-ceived a gold medal and pinned his final match in 45 seconds. Each of these students has made Katy and all of Texas proud!

OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 5, 2018 Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, today I recog-nize Dr. Joy Gates Black, President of Dela-ware County Community College (DCCC)— the first female, as well as the first African- American, President to lead the institution in its 50 year history. Dr. Gates Black has worked tirelessly to promote students’ success, ensuring they have a clear path to graduation and are equipped with the skills a modern workforce demands. Her efforts have made her an ex-ceptionally well respected higher education administrator. In addition to her experience leading col-leges across the country, Dr. Gates Black served our nation honorably in the U.S. Air Force where she developed leadership abili-ties that now help her lead institutions like DCCC. Dr. Gates Black is being presented with the Woman of Achievement Award from the Dela-ware County Women’s Commission, an honor she much deserves.

MOUNTAINS COMMUNITY, SNOW VALLEY AWARDED BUSINESS OF THE YEAR 
HON. PAUL COOK 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 5, 2018 Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-ognize Snow Valley Mountain Resort, which has been named the Lake Arrowhead Com-munities Chamber of Commerce Business of the Year. Snow Valley is the oldest continually operating ski resort in Southern California, having begun operations in 1924. Celebrating their 80th year anniversary this 2017–2018 ski season, Snow Valley employs nearly 400 people during their high season. They have consistently contributed and stimu-lated the local tourist economy of the area. Snow Valley instructors have taught thou-sands how to ski and snow board at their Learning Center, which includes an Adaptive Learning Facility. Additionally, Snow Valley has been active in the local community by supporting projects including the Active Trans-portation Project grant program and the Run-ning Springs to Big Bear trail system. The Re-sort was also one of the driving forces behind the construction of the first hospital in Lake Ar-rowhead. On behalf of the U.S. House of Representa-tives, I would like to thank Snow Valley for their contributions to the local economy in Lake Arrowhead, as well as being an impor-tant part of the culture, history, and heritage of our local mountain communities.

offered an appointment to the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York. Daniel’s offer of appointment permits him to attend the United States Military Academy this fall with the incoming Class of 2022. Attending one of our nation’s military academies not only offers the opportunity to serve our country, but also guarantees a world-class education while undertaking one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of a lifetime. Daniel brings a tremendous amount of lead-ership, service, and dedication to the incoming Class of 2022. While attending Perrysburg High School in Perrysburg, Ohio, Daniel was a Summa Cum Laude scholar, Senior Class President, Student Council Representative, and a school tutor. Throughout high school, Daniel served as a team captain for football, wrestling, and rugby, earning multiple varsity letters. Daniel was also Vice President of DECA, volunteered at the Vision Soup Kitchen and Toledo YES Project, and participated in Buckeye Boys State. I am confident that Daniel will carry the lessons of his student and athletic leadership to the Military Academy. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Daniel Walton on his offer of appointment to the United States Military Academy. Our service academies offer the fin-est military training and education available. I am positive that Daniel will excel during his career at West Point, and I ask my colleagues to join me in extending their best wishes to him as he begins his service to our Nation.

WORLD CIVILITY DAY ON APRIL 12, 2018 
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 5, 2018 Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor and respect that I recognize the Community Civility Counts Initiative as the or-ganization celebrates its third annual World Ci-vility Day on April 12, 2018, along with the Gary Chamber of Commerce, the entire com-munity of Northwest Indiana, and beyond. World Civility Day is a day in which we are asked to become aware of our behavior to-wards others and to become mindful of our thoughts, words, and actions. It is a day to re-member that we can be better people in every area of life, and to remember that our actions serve as an example for generations to come. In observance of this special event, a day of civility-themed activities will be held at the In-diana Welcome Center in Hammond, and an awards banquet will follow in the evening at the Avalon Manor in Merrillville. In 2015, Chuck Hughes, Executive Director of the Gary Chamber of Commerce, and Dr. Gordon E. Bradshaw, Chairman of the Public Policy Committee, worked together through the Gary Chamber to create the Civility Counts Initiative. The organization’s mission is to build public awareness of civility and to help transform communities through positive pro-grams and relationships. The Initiative works to raise the consciousness level of individuals and groups of people, as so many of us face incidents of disrespect, intolerance, bullying, or violence. For striving to make a difference in our communities, the organization and its sup-porters are worthy of the highest praise. The Initiative has been overwhelmingly suc-cessful and recognized throughout many com-munities. Civility Resolutions have been ap-proved by many local municipal councils in-cluding those in Gary, Hammond, Valparaiso, La Porte, and Lake County. In addition, Civility Resolutions have also been approved by the Indiana House of Representatives and the In-diana Senate. Support for the Initiative has grown tremendously with numerous organiza-tions and individuals dedicating their time and resources to this great cause year after year. Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other col-leagues to join me in honoring and congratu-lating the Community Civility Counts Initiative and in celebrating World Civility Day. The sig-nificance of this movement will have a positive impact on generation after generation. For their influence, passion, and dedication to the community of Northwest Indiana and beyond, the leaders and supporters of the Community Civility Counts Initiative are to be commended. f 
HONORING ANTHONY A. SCARPINO, JR. 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 5, 2018 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a true community servant and friend, District Attorney Anthony Scarpino. This year, Anthony is being honored with the Man of the Year award by MPAC at their Third Annual Gala and I too would like to honor him on the occasion. Tony, as he is better known, was born and raised in the City of Mount Vernon where he attended public school. After graduating, he attended the University of Connecticut and then Syracuse University College of Law where he earned his Juris Doctor Degree. After law school, Tony returned to his home where he began his career as an Assistant Corporation Counsel for the City of Mount Vernon. In 1977, he left local government and joined the FBI as a Special Agent. In 1984, at the age of thirty-two, Tony was appointed Act-ing Mount Vernon City Court Judge earning him the distinction of being the youngest judge in the city’s history. Then in 1988, Tony was elected Westchester County Court Judge. In 1993, Tony was elected to the New York State Supreme Court for the Ninth Judicial District before being elected Westchester County Surrogate in 2000, a post to which he was re-elected to in 2010. In 2015, Tony stepped down to join the private law firm DelBello, Donnellan, Weingarten, Wise & Wiederkehr LLP, leaving the bench for the first time in thirty years. He was then elected Westchester County District Attorney in 2016, where he has since served with great distinc-tion. Tony has dedicated his career to protecting our community through the fair and ethical pursuit of justice. He has been an inspiration, a dedicated public servant, and I want to con-gratulate him on receiving this wonderful honor. f 
THE UPCOMING 20TH ANNIVER-SARY OF THE GOOD FRIDAY AGREEMENT—MANY ACHIEVE-MENTS, YET IMPORTANT PROVI-SIONS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED 
HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 5, 2018 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, on March 22 I chaired a hearing at the Helsinki Commission on the achievements, with a spe-cial focus on the unfinished business, of the April 10, 1998 Good Friday Agreement. As Members know so well, the signing of the Good Friday Agreement 20 years ago was truly historic, extraordinarily difficult to achieve, a remarkable framework for peace, and the hope for beginning of reconciliation. In its most important provisions, the agree-ment launched a series of challenging proto-cols, by which the leaders of the nationalist and unionist communities in Northern Ireland agreed to a better governance, and peaceful resolution of differences. Prisoner releases, new government structures, British demili-tarization of the North, the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons and systemic police re-form were achieved to varying degrees over the last 20 years. In the 30 years between 1969 and 1998, approximately 3,500 people were killed in political violence, while in the 20 years since the Good Friday Agreement fewer than 100 have lost their lives. I have personally chaired 16 congressional hearings and markups of legislation on human rights issues in Northern Ireland, most of them with a special focus on police reform and the need to establish a public, independent judicial inquiry into state-sponsored collusion in the murder of human rights attorney Patrick Finucane and others who were gunned down or, in the case of Rosemary Nelson, killed by a bomb. I also offered legislation that was adopted by the House of Representatives that put the House on record condemning violence and promoting peace and justice in Northern Ireland and police reform. And I just recently introduced H. Res. 777 which calls for a re-committal of the United States, the British, and all parties, including the Republic of Ireland, to the peace process.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE395 April 5, 2018 
The most contentious of my amendments over the years, one of which became law, re-sulted in suspending all U.S. support for and exchanges with the British police force in Northern Ireland, the Royal Ulster Constabu-lary, or RUC, until standards were met to vet RUC officers who engaged in human rights abuses. Those new standards were set and eventually then-President Bush was able to certify, in accordance with my law, that human rights principles were part of police training going forward, both in the RUC and in its re-formed successor, the Police Service of North-ern Ireland, or PSNI. With the improvements, the police exchanges were resumed. That is the good news. But as the 20th an-niversary of the Good Friday Agreement mile-stone approaches, serious attention and effort to be paid to achieving the dream. First and foremost, the government in Northern Ireland seems unable to consistently function or even constitute itself. Also, after 20 years, despite many obvious successes and benefits of the Good Friday Agreement, and although no one wants to scrap it, no one would want to return to the killing, the reconciliation to some extent has stalled. One of the reasons is that long- standing cases have not been resolved. Geraldine Finucane, widow of murdered human rights lawyer Patrick Finucane, sub-mitted testimony for my March 22nd hearing. And she points out, and I quote in part, ‘‘My family has campaigned for a public inquiry into Pat’s murder, but the British government has repeatedly failed to establish one. Instead, they have instigated one confined investigation after another, claiming to want to examine the facts or get to the truth, but always in a proc-ess conducted away from public view. One cannot but wonder at the pointlessness of conducting investigation after investigation that are doomed to fail, no matter how forceful the conclusions, because they lack the trans-parency required to attain public confidence.’’ As Geraldine points out further in her testi-mony, ‘‘the 1998 agreement represent a new beginning that would mark a point from which the new future for everyone in Ireland, north and south, could be launched. What was not appreciated or acknowledged, however, was the fact that moving forward also meant deal-ing with the past.’’ And of course, that is something that this Commission and my Sub-committee on Human Rights has tried to do for the last 20-plus years. I would like to just point out too, testimony that’s been provided to us by the Committee on the Administration of Justice, again, a very important quote from them, ‘‘In a highly dis-turbing development, and notwithstanding the reality that only a small number of legacy cases relate to British soldiers, a recent report of the Commons Defense Select Committee called for the enactment of a statute of limita-tions covering all troubles related to incidents involving members of the armed forces. This concept effectively means a selective amnesty for crimes committed by British soldiers.’’ The Commons Defense Select Committee also suggested that it be extended to the RUC and other security force members. This position is, of course, completely contrary to human rights standards and, if were enacted, would prob-ably be found unlawful by the courts. Never-theless, the U.K. government has said that it will include the proposed in a forthcoming con-sultation on the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement. That is a dan-gerous backtracking on the part of the British government. Hopefully it will cease and desist in moving in that direction.

CELEBRATING THE BICENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY OF THE TOWN OF MILAN 
HON. JOHN J. FASO 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 5, 2018 Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-ognize and celebrate the bicentennial anniver-sary of the founding of Milan, New York. For-merly part of the Little Nine Partners Patent, the Town of Milan was incorporated on March 31, 1818. For two hundred years, Milan has taken part in the great American experiment, weaving to-gether a diverse community and cultivating a strong civil society. This small bucolic town sit-uated on the northern border of Dutchess County has celebrated many great triumphs of our nation and witnessed the nascent years of America’s existence, but has also persevered through times of hardship. The strength and independence that continues to define this town are a result of principles instilled at its founding two centuries ago. While the area has experienced many changes over the past two hundred years, the town of Milan is always eager to look to the future, but never forgets its past. Milan was built on a foundation of determination and re-siliency with a strong community focus and a deep appreciation for a rural lifestyle. These core beliefs continue to guide and distinguish the community today. This bicentennial anniversary marks a great milestone in Milan’s history, and serves as an important time for reflection. On behalf of the 19th Congressional District and the U.S. House of Representatives, I would like to ex-tend my deepest appreciation and congratula-tions to the town of Milan. As the residents celebrate its 200th birthday, I would like to commend them on the success of their small, thriving community and wish Milan continued prosperity in its next 200 years.

IN REMEMBRANCE OF LINDA BROWN, CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER, PILLAR OF COMMUNITY, AND LEAD PLAINTIFF IN LANDMARK BROWN V. BOARD OF EDUCATION CASE THAT CHANGED AMERICA 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 5, 2018 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in remembrance of a civil rights icon, Linda Brown, a schoolchild who transformed the country. Linda Brown was born on February 20, 1942, in Topeka, Kansas, to Leola and Oliver Brown. As a schoolgirl Linda Brown, was at the center of the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case that rejected racial segregation in Amer-ican schools. Linda Brown was 9 years old in 1951 when her father, Oliver Brown, tried to enroll her at Sumner Elementary School, then an all-white school near her Topeka home. When the school blocked her enrollment, Oliver Brown partnered with the NAACP and a dozen other plaintiffs to file a lawsuit against the Topeka Board of Education becoming the landmark Supreme Court case, of Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954). By the time of the ruling, Linda Brown was in junior high, a grade level that had been in-tegrated before the 1954 court ruling. Linda Brown went on to attend Washburn and Kansas State universities. Linda Brown was always conscious of the importance of standing up for one’s Constitu-tional rights. Linda Brown realized that with rights, come responsibilities that is why Linda Brown toured the country telling her story and advocating for increased educational opportunity for all Amer-icans. Faith was also important to Linda Brown be-cause as she knew as the gospel hymn goes, ‘‘we’ve come this far by faith.’’ While Linda Brown’s faith and devotion could be found on display at St. Mark’s African Methodist Episcopal Church, where she played piano and taught children how to play. While Linda Brown’s name will forever be a part of American civil rights history, her con-tributions to the community after the case should be remembered as part of her legacy. Linda Brown continued to speak out against racial segregation and reopened the Topeka case with the American Civil Liberties Union in 1979, arguing that the district’s schools still were not desegregated. Linda Brown will be missed greatly, but her contributions to America will live on forever. I ask the House to observe a moment of si-lence in memory of Linda Brown. RECOGNIZING LINDA HOULDIN HON. PATRICK MEEHAN 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 5, 2018 Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, today I post-humously recognize Linda Houldin of New-town Square, Pennsylvania. Linda was a long-time resident of Delaware County and a pillar of her community. She served as the Executive Director of the Delaware County Historical Society and co- founded the Delaware County Veterans Me-morial. Linda’s countless hours spent helping others left a profound and undeniable impact on everyone around her and the community she loved. She was a strong, passionate, and dedicated woman who touched many lives— particularly veterans, children, and society’s most vulnerable. Linda is to be inducted into the Delaware County Women’s Commission Hall of Fame, and rightfully so. She showed us how an indi-vidual with energy and commitment to commu-nity can enrich the lives of friends and strang-ers alike. Her absence will be felt by those who knew her and the many she helped through her generosity and service.

FOREIGN POLICY 
HON. LAMAR SMITH 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 5, 2018 Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the United States and its allies are aware that the Russian government is engaging in ongoing information warfare against democracies around the world. Beyond its targeting of the U.S. election systems and critical infrastruc-ture, Russian influence efforts have been re-ported in the United Kingdom, France, Ger-many, Italy, the Netherlands, Serbia, Latvia, Ukraine, Spain, and Mexico, among others. Most recently, the United Kingdom has been attacked physically by Russia through its use of nerve toxins against perceived enemies of Russian President Vladimir Putin on British soil. The Kremlin needs to hear clearly that we will not tolerate its continuing bad acts. The Department of Treasury’s newest sanc-tions against the businesses, entities, and people included in special counsel Robert Mueller’s February 16th indictment is an im-portant step in holding Russia accountable for its interference in the American election proc-ess. My colleagues and I passed the Coun-tering America’s Adversaries Through Sanc-tions Act last summer with this purpose in mind. The Kremlin Report list published by the Treasury Department currently names busi-nessmen like Yuri Shefler, who has been pro-tecting his company, SPI Group, against Rus-sian attacks for almost twenty years. I urge the administration to develop a broad-er policy response to Russian interference in American politics. A strong first step to accom-plish this goal is publishing a report on busi-nessmen who are actually close to the Krem-lin. f

Austin brings a tremendous amount of lead-ership, service, and dedication to the incoming Class of 2022. While attending Whitmer High School in Toledo, Ohio, Austin participated in the National Honors Society, earned the T.R.A.C. All Academic Award, and earned the Top 15 Award. Throughout high school, Austin served as a captain of varsity baseball and participated in the 5 Minutes for Life and Ping Pong clubs.

TRIBUTE TO WARD W. M
CCARRAGHER 
HON. PETER A. DeFAZIO 
OF OREGON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 5, 2018 Mr. D
EFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ward W. McCarragher, who has served in many capacities with the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for the last quarter century, including the last 20 years as the Chief Democratic Counsel to the Committee. As a Member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, I have had the privilege of working with Ward for the last 25 years, and most closely since 2015 when I took over as Ranking Member of the Com-mittee. As Ranking Member, I have come to rely on his expertise in both transportation pol-icy and Congressional process in advancing important policy measures to improve the lives of American families. Hailing from Kenosha, Wisconsin, and a proud Wisconsin Badgers and Green Bay Packers fan, Ward started his Congressional service back in 1989 as a foreign policy ana-lyst for the Congressional Research Service. After subsequently attending law school and serving as a legal intern to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Cali-fornia, Ward returned to Washington, D.C. in 1993 as an intern for Chairman Norman Y. Mi-neta (D–CA) and the Committee on Public Works and Transportation. That same year, he was appointed by Chairman Mineta as Asso-ciate Counsel of the Committee’s Economic Development Subcommittee and, in 1995, he

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE398 April 5, 2018 
was appointed Counsel to the Public Buildings and Economic Development Subcommittee and the Surface Transportation Subcommittee. In 1998, Ranking Member James L. Oberstar (D–MN) appointed Ward to be the Chief Democratic Counsel to the Committe, where he has served with distinction ever since, in-cluding under Chairman Oberstar and Ranking Member Nick J. Rahall (D–WV) prior to me. Ward has helped guide virtually every trans-portation law enacted over the last two dec-ades through the legislative process and the last four major reauthorizations of surface transportation programs, including the Trans-portation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA–21) in 1998, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA–LU) in 2005, and the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act) in 2015. He also worked tire-lessly over the last two decades to combat ef-forts to eliminate funding for, and privatize, Amtrak, our Nation’s passenger railroad. Ward was also integral in negotiating Fed-eral policy following the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington, D.C., including the en-actment of the Aviation and Transportation Se-curity Act of 2001, which created the Trans-portation Security Administration (TSA) and enhanced aviation security overall, the Home-land Security Act of 2002, and the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002. Ward is the consummate public servant who possesses the rare combination of vision and grit. He has spent his career working vigor-ously to ensure that government works for the greater benefit of hard-working American fami-lies, while still attending to the minor, but cer-tainly necessary, details. He has been a tire-less internal advocate for Congressional over-sight of Federal agencies, under both Demo-cratic and Republican administrations, ensur-ing that Federal resources are utilized con-sistent with Congressional intent and for the betterment of the Nation. He is also a rare master on the internal workings of the Com-mittee structure and the Congress, meticu-lously ensuring that established processes are followed, and that the views of elected offi-cials, whether in the majority or minority, are respected. And he does this all while ensuring that no Committee document is missing a comma. As the longest currently serving staffer on the Transportation and Infrastructure Com-mittee, Ward’s dedication to the Committee, his institutional memory and his constant pro-fessionalism will be greatly missed by Mem-bers on both sides of the aisle. While Ward is leaving the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, he will remain a strong advo-cate for smart, effective public transportation policy through his positon with the American Public Transportation Association. His exper-tise and counsel will be missed by all who fol-low transportation policy on Capitol Hill, but will greatly benefit all those who rely on public transportation. I want to thank Ward for his years of service and his dedication to public service. I wish him, his wife, Marie, and his children, Ryan, Colin, and Megan all the best in the years to come. RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVER-SARY OF LAS TRAMPAS SCHOOL, INC. 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 5, 2018 Mr. D
ESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 60th anniversary of the founding of Las Trampas School. This school, located in my district in Lafayette, California, has served families with severe or profound dis-abilities during its long and successful run. Since its founding in 1971 by parents, fami-lies, and community members, Las Trampas has adapted to serve the needs of the com-munity. Originally founded as a non-profit resi-dential school serving children with develop-mental disabilities, the school grew with its students as they entered adulthood. Las Trampas now focuses on supporting adults with developmental disabilities to embrace their strengths and to lead full lives in their home, at work, and in the community. Las Trampas School’s mission statement exemplifies who they are as an organization and the good they do for the Bay Area: ‘‘all persons with developmental disabilities are en-titled to develop their optimum state of social, physical, and mental well-being, and share an integrated lifestyle similar to what non-disabled persons enjoy.’’ As a lifelong advocate for the disabilities community, I have seen the good Las Trampas has done in our community. Con-gratulations to the Las Trampas School family on a successful 60 years of service.

MOUNTAINS COMMUNITY CITIZEN, DAVID CAINE IS AWARDED CIT-IZEN OF THE YEAR AWARD BY LAKE ARROWHEAD CHAMBER OF COMMERCE 
HON. PAUL COOK 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 5, 2018 Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-ognize David Caine who will be honored as the Lake Arrowhead Chamber of Commerce’s Citizen of the Year. David is the founder of Quiet Skies—Lake Arrowhead, a group dedi-cated to preserving Lake Arrowhead residents’ quality of life in the face of flight pattern changes by the FAA. David epitomizes what it means to be a concerned citizen. When flight patterns changed over Lake Arrowhead last year, David was the first person to contact my office to notify me what a massive complication this was for my constituents. Not only did he quickly bring this issue to light, he has been diligent in researching this issue and orga-nizing the local community. Due to his hard work, dedication, and perseverance, FAA rep-resentatives came to Lake Arrowhead to present a partial solution while they continue to work on a permanent fix. This meeting was the first time in history that the FAA has volun-tarily made changes to accommodate a com-munity. On behalf of the U.S. House of Representa-tives, I would like to thank David Caine for the incredible work he has done organizing and informing the community about the serious-ness of this issue, and for his tireless efforts to advocate on behalf of Lake Arrowhead resi-dents. His determination, diligence, and pas-sion make him truly deserving of the title, Cit-izen of the Year. f 
RECOGNIZING CHERYL COLLELUORI 
HON. PATRICK MEEHAN 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 5, 2018 Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, today I recog-nize Mrs. Cheryl Colleluori of Delaware Coun-ty, Pennsylvania. Cheryl is the President of HEADstrong Foundation, which provides serv-ices and resources for cancer patients and their families nationwide. HEADstrong was founded by Cheryl’s son, Nick, after he was diagnosed with a blood cancer. Nick realized that cancer patients and their families were struggling with a lack of re-sources. From his hospital bed, Nick started to raise money and awareness for cancer pa-tients by empowering young athletes to sup-port his mission. His final wish was for others to benefit from his life and efforts and Cheryl promised to see her son’s mission through. Thanks to Cheryl’s leadership and Nick’s spir-it, HEADstrong has helped nearly 15,000 pa-tients and raised more than $11 million to sup-port their fight against cancer. HEADstrong will continue to change count-less lives for years to come with its message of kindness, support, and compassion. None of this would be possible without Cheryl’s em-bodiment of her son’s spirit. She is an excep-tional choice for the Woman of Achievement Award, and I thank her for all her tremendous work.

In the past, proceeds from the gala have gone to such noble causes as cancer research, educational scholarships, the American Red Cross, tsunami and hurricane relief funds, the Carmelite Home for Girls, Arc Bridges of Ho-bart, Campagna Academy, and many more. For their significant contributions to the com-munity of Northwest Indiana and beyond, the members and leaders of the NWIHRC are worthy of the highest praise.

THE KILLING OF STEPHON CLARK OF SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 5, 2018 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-ior member of the House Committees on Homeland Security and the Judiciary, and Ranking Member of the Judiciary Sub-committee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Se-curity, and Investigations, I rise in remem-brance of Stephon Alonzo Clark, who died on March 18, 2018 after being shot 20 times by a Sacramento Police Department officer. I also rise to call upon the Department of Justice to investigate the use of force that took the life of Stephon Clark. Once again I am disheartened by the shoot-ing of yet another unarmed young man of color at the hands of law enforcement. Stephon Clark was a proud graduate of Sacramento High School. Stephon Clark was affectionately known as ‘‘Big Papa’’ and ‘‘Zoe’’ to his friends and fam-ily. Stephon Clark loved to watch football and Netflix shows with his fiancee Salena Manni and their two young sons. Stephon Clark enjoyed waking up in the morning to make oatmeal for his children be-fore they would go to school. Stephon Clark was only 22 years old when he was tragically shot and killed in his grand-mother’s backyard. Stephon Clark laid for six minutes, bleeding to death. As Stephon Clark drew his last breath, offi-cers handcuffed his dying body. Officers claim that Stephon Clark had a gun, but no weapon was found at the scene. Stephon Clark only had a cell phone. I have long been a strong supporter of law enforcement, and know first-hand the great work performed by officers all across the country. But this incident raises troubling questions about the practices and policies of the Sac-ramento Police Department. I am concerned that the audio on the police officers’ body cameras was intentionally turned off. This act defeats the purpose of police body cameras, erodes trust within the community and adds greater concern to an already re-grettable and preventable tragedy. Stephon Clark and the family that survives him deserve justice. Unfortunately, this incident fits a troubling pattern. While the names of the young men killed and the cities in which they die change, re-grettably the critical facts seldom do. Mr. Speaker, I demand that this Administra-tion conduct a comprehensive review of this matter by all appropriate law enforcement agencies, and I call upon the United States Department of Justice to determine whether local police violated the federal civil rights of Stephon Clark. Far too often, the demand for justice for those like Stephon Clark go unheard. This cannot go on. It is time to LISTEN and ACT. That is why we in the Judiciary Committee formed the House Bipartisan Policing Strate-gies Working Group, of which, I am a Mem-ber. I have introduced and supported legislation to help reform how youth and juveniles are treated to reduce contact and recidivism within the juvenile and criminal justice system; to help protect them from a system that turns them into life-long offenders. These efforts include: H.R. 3158, ‘‘The RAISE Act,’’ which pro-vides judges new and different options when a young offender comes before them, ensures that young offenders receive specialized pro-grams and separate housing tailored to their needs, and advances efforts to rehabilitate them. H.R. 3155, ‘‘Kalief’s Law,’’ establishes more humane rules for young offenders and juve-niles when detained or confined, particularly in the areas of pretrial detention, bail, use of force and segregation or solitary confinement. H.R. 3156, ‘‘Fair Chance for Youth Act,’’ which creates effective opportunities for juve-niles and young offenders to seal and ex-punge their records. Just as we need to minimize the over-charging, wrongful conviction, and excessive incarceration of innocent people, we must ad-dress the unnecessary loss of life like that of Stephon Clark this past week in Sacramento. We must curtail the escalation of violence that can result from police and civilian inter-actions. Effective law enforcement requires the con-fidence of the community that the law will be enforced impartially and equally. There is no higher priority than improving the peacefulness of these interactions and re-building the trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve and protect. To address many of the current flaws, I plan to reintroduce the ‘‘BUILD Trust Act’’ which is designed to increase public confidence in local law enforcement by decreasing excessive reli-ance on traffic fines and court costs to fund local government. I ask my colleagues to join me in support of these measures so that in addition to our thoughts and prayers, we take decisive action to prevent tragedies like the death of Stephon Clark from happening in the first place.

INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA JUROR PAY PAR-ITY ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 5, 2018 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I intro-duce the District of Columbia Juror Pay Parity Act of 2018 to require that D.C. Superior Court jurors receive pay for jury service equal to that received by federal jurors. Currently, D.C. Superior Court jurors are paid $30 per day, and, under the D.C. Home Rule Act, only the D.C. courts and Congress have the authority to increase Superior Court juror pay. My bill would require that Superior Court jurors receive pay equal to that received by federal jurors. In the fiscal year 2018 omnibus appropria-tions bill, Congress included a pay increase from $40 to $50 per day for federal jurors, the first increase to federal juror pay in 28 years. My bill would give Superior Court jurors the same pay. Under the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997 (Pub. L. 105–33), Congress took respon-sibility for paying for the D.C. courts and most other state-like functions. The D.C. courts, however, have always been under the control of Congress, even when they were funded by the District. The Home Rule Act prohibits the District government from enacting any law re-garding Title 11 of the D.C. Code. Title 11 pro-vides that the Board of Judges of the Superior Court sets juror pay, but that the pay may not exceed the pay of federal jurors. Therefore, this bill, or action by D.C. courts, is necessary to increase Superior Court juror pay. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. f

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 5, 2018 Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Eleni Marie Roumel for her dedicated service to the House of Representa-tives and specifically to the Committee on Ways and Means. Eleni has been with the House Office of General Counsel since October 2012, during which time she has provided invaluable coun-sel to House Members, Officers, and staff on a variety of legal issues. She has vigorously defended the institutional prerogatives of the House, and greatly assisted the Committees in fulfilling their important constitutional oversight roles. Of special importance to the Committee on Ways and Means, our staff came to rely on her expertise and guidance in connection with many of the Committee’s investigative and oversight activities, as well as in connection with the Committee’s interactions with the Ex-ecutive Branch. Eleni was a trusted advisor on many aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and worked tirelessly to ensure the Committee’s investigative efforts in overseeing the enforce-ment of the law were successful. Eleni has been instrumental in the Committee’s efforts to combat Executive Branch overreach and vindi-cate the House’s Appropriations Clause au-thority. In addition, Eleni has exemplified the role of counselor to Committee staff as some-one who was eminently reliable, knowledge-able, creative, and genuinely a pleasure to work with. She will be greatly missed. This month, Eleni will continue her distin-guished career of public service by com-mencing her new role as Deputy Counsel to the Vice President of the United States. Eleni served the House with great distinction, and we know she will serve the Vice President with that same level of distinction. On behalf of the many Members of the Committee on Ways and Means, and the Committee staff, who benefitted from her insightful counsel, I say thank you. We extend to her our very best wishes for her continued success.

SPECIAL RECOGNITION OF SHANTHI VISWANATHAN 
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 5, 2018 Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, like so many Americans, I was deeply moved by the school shooting in Parkland, Florida. The tragic loss of 17 lives to a gunman was an-other devastating reminder of the danger of too many guns being readily available in our culture. In the face of the Parkland shooting, I would like to pay special recognition to Mrs. Shanthi Viswanathan, an Algebra teacher at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Known as ‘‘Mrs. V’’ to her students, Mrs. Viswanathan’s quick thinking and firm and res-olute actions very likely helped save the lives of her students. As the Miami Herald reported, Mrs. Viswanathan knew something wasn’t right when she heard the second fire alarm of the day sounding shortly before classes were to end on February 14th. Mrs. Viswanathan immediately put paper over the window so no one could see inside. She then told her students to take cover and get on the floor in the corner of the room. When the SWAT team came to the outside of Mrs. Viswanathan’s classroom and told her to open the door, she opted not to take any chance that it could have been a trick by the gunman. ‘‘Knock it down or open it with a key. I’m not opening the door,’’ Mrs. Viswanathan said. It was indeed the SWAT team, and they knocked down the door and ushered the stu-dents to safety. When Mrs. Viswanathan knew there was danger, she exemplified the truest form of the Hindu concept of dharma, or duty, in pro-tecting those she was responsible for. These actions were brought to my attention by the Hindu American Foundation which continues to support the victims as part of its broader commitment to Ahimsa, the Hindu concept of nonviolence. I recently visited Broward County where I had the honor to speak at the Hindu American Foundation’s annual gala. The Hindu Amer-ican Foundation, or HAF, has stood up during the ongoing public debate over guns in our so-ciety and has supported legislation to, among other things, repeal the ban on allowing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from conducting research into gun violence in the United States. In taking its policy positions, HAF is guided by both public policy concerns and ethics, along with Hindu scripture. It is my sincere hope that the days and weeks ahead, Congress shows the same commitment to dealing with gun violence that Mrs. Viswanathan and the Hindu American Foundation already have. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF THOMAS HILT ON HIS OFFER OF APPOINTMENT TO ATTEND THE UNITED STATES MILITARY ACADEMY 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 5, 2018 Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to pay special tribute to an out-standing student from Ohio’s Fifth Congres-sional District. I am pleased to announce that Thomas Hilt of Whitehouse, Ohio has been of-fered an appointment to the United States Mili-tary Academy in West Point, New York. Thomas’ offer of appointment permits him to attend the United States Military Academy this fall with the incoming Class of 2022. Attending one of our nation’s military academies not only offers the opportunity to serve our country, but also guarantees a world-class education while undertaking one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of a lifetime. Thomas brings a tremendous amount of leadership, service, and dedication to the in-coming Class of 2022. While attending An-thony Wayne High School in Whitehouse, Ohio, Thomas was a member of the National Honor Society, received the school’s academic award, and participated in DECA and German Club. Throughout high school, Thomas partici-pated in rowing, where he served as team captain and received his varsity letter and coaches award. I am confident that Thomas will carry the lessons of his student and ath-letic leadership to the Military Academy. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Thomas Hilt on his offer of appointment to the United States Military Academy. Our service academies offer the fin-est military training and education available. I am positive that Thomas will excel during his career at West Point, and I ask my colleagues to join me in extending their best wishes to him as he begins his service to our Nation.

OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 5, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Sheila Kunze of Lewis, Iowa on her retirement as the Cass County Clerk of Court. Sheila began her duties in the Clerk’s office in 1979, and has served the citizens of Cass County for almost 39 years.

Today, almost every-thing is electronically filed, but the office still handles some paper forms. Sheila said the greatest part of her job was ‘‘working with all the people, I’ve met a lot of people over the years, and made a lot of friends.’’ Mr. Speaker, Sheila has made a difference in her community by helping and serving oth-ers. I am honored to recognize her today and I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in applaud-ing her accomplishments and in wishing her nothing but the best in her retirement.

IN REMEMBRANCE OF GEORGE WILSON, DEAN OF THE CAPITOL HILL BLACK PRESS, AND INTER-NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT AND EYEWITNESS TO HISTORY 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 5, 2018 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in remembrance of a pioneer and trailblazer, George Wilson, the Dean of the Black press on Capitol Hill. George Wilson, a veteran journalist and broadcaster whose reports were heard on radio outlets across the country for decades will be remembered as a powerful voice with a witty intellect. George Wilson was born in New Orleans on October 10, 1947, to George II and Rose Wil-son and raised in Washington, D.C. After graduating from Calvin Coolidge High School, George Wilson attended Howard Uni-versity before graduating from North Carolina A&T. As a Capitol Hill correspondent for over three decades and host of Sirus XM’s ‘‘GW on the Hill,’’ George Wilson’s velvet voice was unmistakable over the airwaves. During his time on air, George Wilson served as ‘‘Black America’s voice on the Hill.’’ George Wilson’s character and reputation paved the way for other African American jour-nalists in Congress. George Wilson’s passion for journalism led him to stories around the world and particu-larly cultivated sources in the international and diplomatic community. Wilson covered the fall of apartheid in South Africa, the reinstatement of former Haitian President Jean Bertrand Aristide, and chron-icled the many revolutions in African countries. George Wilson’s work made him more than a local reporter, he was an international jour-nalist. George Wilson will be missed greatly, not just in the hallowed halls of Congress but throughout the world. George Wilson is survived by his wife Iris, his mother Rose, six children, seven grand-children, one great-grandchild, aunts, cousins and a host of other relatives and friends. I ask the House to observe a moment of si-lence in memory of George Wilson. RECOGNIZING MARES STELLFOX HON. PATRICK MEEHAN 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 5, 2018 Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, today I recog-nize Mares Stellfox, a Springfield High School graduate who relentlessly pursued her dreams to become a professional Open-Wheel race car driver. From an early age Mares dreamed of prov-ing herself in the male-dominated world of race car driving. It was no easy path to get there. She experienced barriers and setbacks. But Mares pushed forward, helping change auto-racing culture and becoming a model for other aspiring women. When Mares first entered open-wheel auto racing, she set ambitious goals—to finish in the top ten in points her first year and the top five her second. She accomplished both and returned a third year to capture first place. She would go on to join The Outlaws racing club as the only woman among nearly 100 members, earning herself the nickname the ‘‘Lady Outlaw.’’ She continued to break stereo-types as she earned numerous honors and awards during her tenure, even landing on the cover of Open Wheel Magazine, a first for a woman. I applaud Mares for her successful career and everything she has done to be a trail-blazer for women. She has well-earned the Woman of Achievement Award.

IN RECOGNITION OF JENNA KILL ON HER OFFER OF APPOINT-MENT TO ATTEND THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE ACADEMY 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 5, 2018 Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to pay special tribute to an out-standing student from Ohio’s Fifth Congres-sional District. I am pleased to announce that Jenna Kill of Sylvania, Ohio has been offered an appointment to the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Jenna’s offer of appointment permits her to attend the United States Air Force Academy this fall with the incoming Class of 2022. At-tending one of our nation’s military academies not only offers the opportunity to serve our country, but also guarantees a world-class education while undertaking one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of a lifetime. Jenna brings a tremendous amount of lead-ership, service, and dedication to the incoming Class of 2022. While attending Northview High School in Sylvania, Ohio, Jenna was a mem-ber of the National Honor Society and was ranked in the top five percent of her class. Throughout high school, Jenna participated in soccer, and was captain for both the cross country and track and field teams, earning var-sity letters in all three sports. Jenna also served as a co-leader for the NASA Student Launch Team, was involved in leadership academy, and participated in competitions such as Team America Rocketry Contest, and S4 Satellite Rocketry Team. I am confident that Jenna will carry the lessons of her student and athletic leadership to the Air Force Acad-emy. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Jenna Kill on her offer of ap-pointment to the United States Air Force Academy. Our service academies offer the fin-est military training and education available. I am positive that Jenna will excel during her career at the Air Force Academy, and I ask my colleagues to join me in extending their best wishes to her as she begins her service to our Nation. f 
TRIBUTE TO SHAWN THOMPSON 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 5, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Shawn Thompson of Sidney, Iowa for receiving the 2017 Iowa Football Coaches Association John Taft Memorial Junior High Award. Shawn is the junior high football coach at Sidney High School in Sidney, Iowa. Shawn was nominated by Sidney High School Head Coach Donnie Sears. Coach Sears said, ‘‘Shawn had four undefeated sea-sons and four additional seasons with just one loss. But, his impact goes far beyond the field.’’ Shawn goes above and beyond to help his struggling students; he arrives very early in the morning at school to tutor them and help them set up appointments with other teachers to help with their studies. Shawn said, ‘‘I was shocked when I found out and wondered, why me? My biggest thought was and still is, why am I being rewarded for doing something I love to do. Coaching is very rewarding to me.’’ Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize Shawn for receiving this outstanding award. He is a shining example of how hard work and dedication can affect the future of our youth. I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in congratu-lating Shawn and in wishing him nothing but continued success in all his future endeavors.

Through the work of countless volun-teers and community members, the Mountain History Museum has provided a window into the history of our beautiful mountain commu-nities.

CADE DEROCHE EARNS EAGLE SCOUT RANK 
HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 5, 2018 Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Cade Deroche of Sugar Land, TX for earning the rank of Eagle Scout. Eagle Scout is the highest honor a Boy Scout can earn. Only a small percentage of Boy Scouts reach the rank of Eagle Scout, which requires years of effort to develop the necessary lead-ership, service and outdoor skills. To earn this honor, Cade earned 21 merit badges, and de-veloped and provided leadership to others in a service project. For his project, Cade repaired and completed a memorial garden at Fort Bend Family Promise an organization that supports families who have lost their homes and need emergency housing. Cade and his troop also completed over 500 hours of serv-ice following Hurricane Harvey. His hours of service were above and beyond what was re-quired for scouting. He simply wanted to help his community. Cade also designed the patch earned by Scouts who participated in the relief efforts. Cade’s dedication to our community has prepared him to be a leader in his future career. The leadership skills he has learned through Boy Scouts are already benefiting our community. On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-sional District of Texas, congratulations again to Cade for becoming an Eagle Scout. I am proud and confident of his continued success. I thank him for his dedication to making our community a better place. RECOGNIZING THE GENOA HIGH SCHOOL WRESTLING TEAM FOR WINNING THE INDIVIDUAL TOUR-NAMENT TEAM STATE CHAM-PIONSHIP HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, April 5, 2018 Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Genoa High School Wrestling Team for winning the Ohio School Athletic Association Division III Individual Tournament Team State Championship. The title completes the double as Genoa won the Dual Team Championship this season as well. The Comets posted a scored of 113.5 led by Junior Dylan D’Emilio who won an indi-vidual state title and finished the season 52– 0. Wrestling tests the mettle of its competitors, and it takes grit, determination, and toughness to compete at a high level. These competitors deserve our recognition. The Genoa commu-nity should be proud of the team’s accomplish-ments. Once again, congratulations to Coach Bob Bergman and the Comets on the state cham-pionship. Great job Genoa wrestling.
