HONORING APPOINTEES TO THE GEORGIA MILITARY VETERANS HALL OF FAME 
HON. DOUG COLLINS 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 10, 2017 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor two veterans with ties to my home of Gainesville: Lt. Alexander Ramsey Nininger Jr., and Lt. Col. Rembert Gary Rollison. On November 4, these two vet-erans will be inducted into the Georgia Military Veterans Hall of Fame, joining a distinguished group of 66 fellow Georgia veterans. In order to receive this honor, veterans must exhibit valor for heroic action in combat, dem-onstrate outstanding achievement while in service, or have made significant contributions to their community after leaving active duty. Lt. Nininger and Lt. Col. Rollison clearly met these criteria. Lt. Nininger graduated from West Point and was dispatched to the Philippines during World War II. When a military unit, separate from his own, faced superior firepower, he made the brave choice to assist his fellow sol-diers and gave his life while giving them aid. Lt. Col. Rollison was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1966. He was eventually dispatched to Vietnam, where his courage in-spired others during Operation Junction City. Other notable veterans in the Georgia Vet-erans Hall of Fame include former Governor Zell Miller and former Senator Sam Nunn. Soon, photos of Lt. Nininger and Lt. Col. Rollison will flank those of these public serv-ants on the Heroes’ Wall in the Floyd Vet-erans Memorial Building, honoring their legacy and commitment to our nation’s security. With Veterans Day around the corner, let’s fulfill the duty that we have to our veterans by showing them our admiration and gratitude. Heroes like Lt. Nininger and Lt. Col. Rollison have defended our nation and preserved our freedoms. We are indebted to them. I thank these two veterans, and many oth-ers, for their service.

HONORING THE MULAS FAMILY 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 10, 2017 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Mulas Family for being recognized by the Golden Gate Salmon Association for their achievements in sustain-ability. The Mulas Family has been using reclaimed water for their pastures, crops and dairy since the 1960’s and in their vineyards since the 1980’s. Excessive water diversions are a major threat to salmon in California’s rivers. Recycling water allows families to meet their needs without threatening the salmon. The Mulas Dairy is a leader in water recycling, which is one of California’s major potential sources of new water. Vickie, Ray and Mike Mulas run the daily operations of the Dairy and Vineyards with their mother, Nilda. Their father, Mitch, was a very active member of our community before his passing in 2011. In addition to running their dairy and vine-yard, the Mulas Family members are con-sistent leaders on community fire issues, re-source management and agricultural issues. Vickie is the Director of the Sonoma County Wine Grape Commission, a member of the Sonoma Resource Conservation District Board, and has coached cheerleading at Sonoma Valley High for the past 26 years. Ray is the Chief of the Schell Vista Fire De-partment, and Mike is the Assistant Chief. Ray is a member of the Sonoma County Fire Chiefs Association, the Elks Club and the past president and current board member of the Sonoma County Farm Bureau. Mike is the Di-rector of the North Bay Water District, past President of North Bay Dairy Herd Information Association, and has coached the Sonoma Valley High School Dragons for the past 35 years. Mr. Speaker, the Mulas family works hard on their dairy and in their vineyard. They are leaders in sustainable farming and contribute honorably to our community. I am proud to have such a hardworking family living in our District. It is fitting and proper that we honor them here today. f 
WISHING COACH HERMAN ‘‘BIG MAN’’ PITTMAN A HAPPY 90TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 10, 2017 Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my sincerest birthday wishes to Coach Herman ‘‘Big Man’’ Pittman, who will be cele-brating his 90th on Sunday, November 19, 2017. As a young man, Herman was a gifted ath-lete. He displayed great ability to play the game of basketball, and throughout his high school career at Tampa Middleton High School, he played as the team’s point guard. Because of his success, he would go on to earn an athletic scholarship to attend Florida Agriculture & Mechanical University (FAMU), where he lettered on the football team, as well as played starting guard on the FAMU Rattler Basketball Team. During his time at FAMU, Herman led his team to two Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SIAC) Championships. He would go on to make First Team All-SIAC Con-ference and All-SIAC Tournament Team for two years. After graduating from FAMU with his Bachelor of Science in Physical Education, Herman joined the U.S. Army, where he was co-captain of the Fort Meade Generals in Maryland. Herman would go on to earn a Master’s of Science in Health and Physical Education from Indiana University. Herman began his career as a teacher and coach for the Dillard High School Panthers in 1955. He taught physical education and driv-er’s education, and also coached basketball, football, and track during his tenure of 37 years. He also coached at Deerfield Beach High School, making a total of 18 years of coaching. His career as a basketball coach, record of conference participation shows seven Conference Championships, as well as being voted Outstanding Coach of the Con-ference five times. His teams won six District Championships and were runners-up two times. His teams also qualified for the state tournament seven times, having won four state titles, they qualified for participation in the National High School Tournament held at Tennessee State University in 1959, 1963, 1965, and 1967. His coaching records and contributions earned him the title of ‘‘One of the Winningest and Most Outstanding Coach-es in the Nation.’’ For Herman’s outstanding contributions and commitment to youth and other service in-volvements in Broward County, he has been awarded numerous honors. The Community and School Board have likewise renamed the Dillard High School Gymnasium as the ‘‘Her-man Pittman Gymnasium.’’ As an educator, Herman once stated, ‘‘I feel I’m out here trying to educate a child for life. I try to teach them to be able to make adjust-ments in a changing society. I do the same thing in the classroom that I do on the basket-ball court—you have to teach young people how to live.’’ This is something that Herman has been committed to his entire life. Outside of teaching and coaching, Herman has continued to dedicate his time to serving in a wide array of organizations that include: Kappa Alpha Psi, Inc. Fraternity, First Baptist Piney Grove Church, ‘‘Meals on Wheels,’’ The Kiwanis Club of Central Broward, FAMU Alum-ni Association, F Club, and the Dillard Task Force. On Friday, November 3rd, Herman was honored at the 23rd Annual Mount Olive De-velopment Corporation (MODCO) Community Service Awards Gala, entitled ‘‘A Celebration of Savvy Senior Citizens & Committed Military Servants.’’ Among the things that he said was ‘‘the world is always evolving,’’ in his 90 years he has evolved with the world. And, he has stood the test of time. Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor to wish a very happy 90th birthday to my very good friend, Coach Herman ‘‘Big Man’’ Pittman, whose service and dedication to the State of Florida and our nation is truly admirable. Her-man will celebrate his birthday with his lovely wife Nielza, their three daughters Linda, Lisa, and Lavette, and their four grandchildren Chelsey, Colin, Mika, and Cody, as well as so many in our community, who love and respect all that he has contributed. I wish him many more years of happiness and success.

CONGRATULATING WAYNE FARMS 
HON. DOUG COLLINS 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 10, 2017 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Wayne Farms, a poultry company based in my home of Hall County. While attending this year’s National Safety Conference for the Poultry Industry, Wayne Farms received 10 distinct awards for success in employee safety. More than a year ago, Wayne Farms began carrying out an initiative called ‘‘Zero Accident Culture’’ to further prioritize the safety of its 10,000 employees. Through organized efforts, the company was able to set and meet goals that paved the way for an even more secure atmosphere for its team members. Since its inception, the Zero Accident Cul-ture initiative has brought down the number of injuries within the company, leaving employ-ees with a safer environment to work in each day. Wayne Farms’ leadership in workplace safe-ty signifies the commitment that poultry pro-ducers have made not only to improving the quality of their food, but also to improving the work environment that they welcome their teams into each day. I congratulate Wayne Farms on the strides they’ve made in workplace safety. I wish them the best as they continue to contribute to our community in northeast Georgia.

TO COMMEMORATE THE HONOR-ABLE ANNA G. ESHOO FOR 25 YEARS OF SERVICE IN THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 10, 2017 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise with my colleagues today to commemo-rate the Honorable ANNA G. E SHOO for 25 years of incredible service in the United States House of Representatives. She has rep-resented constituents in San Mateo, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz Counties in California since she was first elected to Congress in 1992. Representative E
SHOO has authored and championed significant legislation on healthcare, technology, intelligence and the environment to improve the lives of her con-stituents and the American people. Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama together signed 39 of her bills into law. She recognizes the goodness of the American people, the tremendous value of di-versity that immigrants bring into our country and the power of technology to transform and improve our communities. She has a remarkable legacy in her healthcare legislative history. Her work en-ables states to provide care to women diag-nosed with breast or cervical cancer. Her re-forms made the Food and Drug Administration more effective and responsive. She introduced legislation to eliminate lifetime caps on health insurance 14 years before it was included in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Many of Representative E
SHOO ’s accom-plishments in Congress involve modernizing technology to solve problems. Firstnet, a na-tionwide public safety network of next genera-tion 9-1-1 services, connected public service agencies across the nation, shortening emer-gency response times and making everyone safer. As a member of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative E
SHOO played a key role following the September 11th Ter-rorist Attacks. She chaired the Subcommittee on Intelligence Community Management, where she focused on policy and management challenges affecting all 16 agencies that com-prise the U.S. Intelligence Community. She worked to ensure that U.S. intelligence efforts were consistent with our nation’s values, which are embodied in our Constitution. She also worked to modernize our intelligence gathering capabilities and to improve Con-gress’ ability to construct meaningful oversight of these programs. Because of legislation introduced by Rep-resentative ESHOO , thousands of acres of Cali-fornia’s public lands are protected, including preservation of Sand Hill Bluff and significant areas of the California Coastal National Monu-ment, the expansion of the Moffett Field Bay Trail, renovation of the Pigeon Point Light-house and the purchase of Bair Island to in-clude in the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge. These priceless lands are protected for future generations be-cause of her leadership. Representative E
SHOO has received many well-deserved commendations, including the Dean’s Medal Award from the Stanford School of Medicine and the President’s Medal from Menlo College. She received the Angel Award from the Child Abuse Council of Santa Clara County and the Thomas Jefferson Inter-national Religious Freedom Champion Award for her work to protect religious minorities in the Middle East. She received the Statesman-ship Award from the U.S. Association of Former Members of Congress for her work to empower tomorrow’s technology leaders. Mr. Speaker, the Honorable A
NNAG. E SHOO  is an important and valued Member of this body. She serves her constituents with great integrity, strength and compassion. It is there-fore fitting and proper that we commemorate her for 25 years of service and send her our best wishes as she celebrates this impressive milestone.
