DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-fore the House the following commu-nication from the Speaker:

PRAYER Rabbi Arnold E. Resnicoff, Retired Chaplain, U.S. Navy, Washington, D.C., offered the following prayer: Almighty God, we pray, reflect, meditate in different ways, but unite in condemnation when hatred rears its ugly head. On this date in 1945 we helped con-vene a court in Nuremberg, pro-claiming some actions so inhuman that they are crimes against humanity itself. We condemned the false belief that any humans are less than human: ‘‘life unworthy of life.’’ Such thinking leads to slaughter, even here at home: dead children in their churches, hated for the color of their skin; beatings, killings, lynchings that stained our landscape, and our history, with what poets called the strange and bitter fruit of bodies hang-ing from the trees; and last month, in a Pittsburgh synagogue, men and women murdered because the shooter thought ‘‘all Jews should die.’’ God, we know that words and prayers still matter, when they are linked to action, grounded in our Nation’s found-ing vision: that all are created equal, with rights to liberty and life, rights and dreams we must forever honor, cherish, and protect. And may we say, amen. f 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to section 2(a) of House Resolution 1142, the Journal of the last day’s pro-ceedings is approved. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. The SPEAKER pro tempore led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f

RECOGNIZING THE RECIPIENTS OF THE 2018 ARTS AWARDS 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 20, 2018 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-ognize ARTSFAIRFAX (formerly the Arts Council of Fairfax County) and the recipients of its 2018 Arts Awards. These awards recog-nize the extraordinary contributions of those who support the arts in our community includ-ing artists and arts organizations, as well as individuals and businesses in Fairfax County, the City of Fairfax, and the City of Falls Church. The economic benefit of that support cannot be overstated. Each year, ARTSFAIRFAX honors a select group of individuals, companies, or organiza-tions that have made extraordinary contribu-tions to the local arts community. It is my honor to include in the R
ECORD the names of the 2018 recipients: The 2018 Jinx Hazel Arts Award is being presented to the Claude Moore Charitable Foundation. Founded in 1987 by Dr. Claude Moore, the Foundation works to enhance edu-cational opportunities for young people. Hav-ing given more than $62 million to organiza-tions and programs throughout the Common-wealth of Virginia, the Foundation is one of Virginia’s largest philanthropic organizations. Its support in Fairfax County has been broad, consistent, and generative, with donations of more than $8 million to organizations and pro-grams including: Claude Moore Colonial Farm, George Mason University’s Fall for the Book festival, George Washington Teachers Institute at Mount Vernon, Lorton Arts Foundation, Foundation for Fairfax County Public Schools, Fairfax Library Foundation, Artist-in-Education Bluemont Concert Series, the Fairfax Sym-phony Orchestra, Virginia Chamber Orchestra, Fairfax County Parks Authority, ARTSFAIRFAX, and many more. The 2018 Arts Education Award is being presented to the American Youth Philharmonic Orchestras (AYPO). Since 1964, AYPO has provided rigorous, conservatory-quality orches-tra training and performance experience for thousands of gifted, young musicians from Northern Virginia. Nearly 90 percent of AYPO members live in Fairfax County and more than two-thirds are minorities. All students take part in competitive auditions and all are selected solely on their musical achievements. These ensembles are open to all youth in the region, not just AYPO members. This has allowed AYPO to serve a broader base of students within Fairfax County Public Schools. For 54 years, AYPO has helped young people de-velop their musical skills and an appreciation for orchestral music to provide opportunities that are rarely available in the schools. The 2018 Arts Impact Award is being pre-sented to the Wolf Trap Foundation for the Performing Arts. Each year, nearly 400,000 people enjoy performances at the Filene Cen-ter, The Barns at Wolf Trap, and Children’s Theatre-in-the-Woods. Wolf Trap is a corner-stone of Fairfax County’s cultural fabric. Edu-cation also has long been core to Wolf Trap’s mission. Though national in scope, the Wolf Trap Institute for Early Learning Through the Arts has roots in Virginia and has been partnering with Fairfax County Public Schools for more than 30 years. During the 2016–2017 school year, the Institute served more than 17,000 children, educators, and parents/care-givers across 18 counties in the Common-wealth, including Fairfax. The 2018 Arts Philanthropy Award is being presented to Virginia McGehee Friend. Ms. Friend is an avid supporter of Washington West Film Festival, Greater Reston Arts Cen-ter, Arena Stage, Washington National Op-era’s Domingo-Cafritz Young Artist Program, Smithsonian Craft Show, Just Neighbors, Loudoun Hunger Relief, Mobile Hope, Canine Companions for Independence, and the Na-tional Humane Education Society. Throughout her life, Friend’s tireless dedication and im-mense generosity to the arts in Fairfax County and across the region have served as a model for philanthropy. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the recipients of the 2018 Arts Awards and in recognizing and thanking the visionaries, leaders, and supporters who help to make our Northern Virginia commu-nities rich with cultural opportunities.

RECOGNIZING THE AWARD RECIPI-ENTS OF THE 2018 CENTREVILLE IMMIGRATION FORUM ANNUAL DINNER 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 20, 2018 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-ognize the Centreville Immigration Forum on the occasion of its 4th Annual Dinner. The theme of this year’s gala is ‘‘Celebrating Our Global Community’’ and will recognize the rich diversity of cultures in Northern Virginia. Northern Virginia is blessed by its diversity. In Fairfax County, nearly 1 in 4 residents is foreign born. More than 100 languages are spoken in our schools, and we are home to more minority-owned technology firms than anywhere else in the nation. Our variety of cultures and heritages do not divide us; they make us stronger. Three exceptional individuals will be hon-ored during this gala who have gone above and beyond in ensuring that everyone, regard-less of their country of origin, has full access to the benefits and opportunities this commu-nity and our nation provide. I am pleased to include in the R
ECORD names of the following 2018 Annual Dinner honorees: Mr. Rodrigo Velasquez Rodrigo is a proud product of Fairfax Coun-ty Public Schools where he attended elemen-tary, middle, and high school. Rodrigo grad-uated from Robert E. Lee High School in 2012 and later graduated from George Mason Uni-versity in 2016 with a Bachelors in Commu-nication with a focus in Public Relations. A for-merly undocumented immigrant from Bolivia, he was the President of Mason DREAMers, where he helped build the organization’s abil-ity to advocate for undocumented immigrants to have better access to higher education. He was also the first Student Support Coordinator at George Mason University, the first position of its kind in Virginia. In this position, he helped undocumented, low income, homeless, and first-generation college students find fi-nancial and social support. Ms. Afeefa Syeed Ms. Syeed is a cultural anthropologist who most recently served as Senior Advisor at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), where she worked to develop policy, define best practices, highlight success sto-ries, and build internal capacity and tools to

frame country strategies that reflect greater expertise in engaging in dynamic cultural con-texts. She has advised the White House, Na-tional Security Council, State Department, UN Democracy Fund, World Bank and various in- country government and non-governmental in-stitutions. Afeefa also founded and is the cur-rent Head of School for Al Fatih Academy, a Reston, VA independent school whose core curriculum is peace education and civic en-gagement. Mr. Ilryong Moon Born in Seoul, Korea in 1957, Mr. Moon im-migrated to the United States in 1974. He quickly became involved in his local commu-nity, primarily through his service on the Fair-fax County School Board, to which he was elected in 1995. He has served in a variety. of capacities on the School Board, as an At- Large Member, Braddock District Representa-tive, Vice-Chairman and Chairman. In addition to his service on the School Board, he has also served on the Urban Policy Task Force, Affordable Housing Advisory Committee, the Police Chiefs Diversity Task Force and the Virginia State Advisory Committee to the U.S. Civil Rights Commission. Mr. Speaker, the efforts of these individuals are noteworthy not only because they are rooted in an appreciation for our region’s cul-tural and ethnic diversity, but also because they help to strengthen the bonds of friendship and cooperation in our community. I congratu-late them on their awards and ask my col-leagues to join me in commending them for their service to the Northern Virginia region.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF MRS. EMMA ROBERTA DAVIE WILSON 
HON. DAVID SCOTT 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 20, 2018 Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to honor the life of an extraordinary Georgian and a great American, Mrs. Emma Roberta Davie Wilson who passed away at the age of 90. She was a loving mother, daughter, sister, and friend. Mrs. Wilson was a wonderful teacher who had a passion for educating youth. Having spent her entire life as a Georgia resident, Mrs. Wilson attended Main High School in Rome, Georgia. After receiving her high school diploma, she attended Paine Uni-versity in Augusta, Georgia, where she re-ceived her degree in early childhood edu-cation. Mrs. Wilson dedicated 25 years of her life to the Atlanta Public School System at Thomas Heath Slater Elementary School. Her tenure within this institution of public learning personifies what it means to be a public serv-ant. In 1948, she married the late Eddie Daniel Wilson. Together, Mr. Speaker, they had five beautiful children, and a host of grandchildren. Mrs. Wilson was also a most devoted Chris-tian. She was a loving member at Macedonia Baptist Church in Joyland Community in At-lanta, Georgia. And she was a Sunday School teacher who helped lead many young children to Christ at an early age. I celebrate Mrs. Wilson for her admirable service to the youth of our nation, the city of Atlanta, and the State of Georgia. My col-leagues and I extend our deepest sympathies to her surviving friends and family members, which include five children, four grandchildren, three great-grandchildren, and a host of nieces and nephews. Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend my condolences to Mrs. Wilson’s family and friends during this time of sorrow. f 
HONORING TROOP 3055 
HON. SEAN P. DUFFY 
OF WISCONSIN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 20, 2018 Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and remember the three beautiful Girl Scouts, and one loving mother, of Troop 3055, who tragically lost their lives on Novem-ber 3, 2018. On that Saturday morning, Au-tumn Helgeson, Jayna Kelley, Haylee Hickle, and Sara Schneider were volunteering their time to pick up trash on the side of the road as a service to their community, when they were fatally struck by a hit and run driver. Though my words can never reverse the awful heartbreak that their families have suffered, I hope that by speaking today we can pay trib-ute to these girls, who at the time of their death were simply trying to make their com-munity a better place. Today, we pray for the families, friends, and Troop of these girls, and for Madalyn Zwiefelhofer, who was sent to the hospital in critical condition as a result of the accident. Please know that the entire community stands with all of the families during this difficult time.

HONORING CPL. BILL EIERMAN 
HON. JOHN H. RUTHERFORD 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 20, 2018 Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service and sacrifice of Corporal William Eierman, a member of the Jacksonville Beach Police Department. Cpl. Eierman is being honored today with the Medal of Valor and Law Enforcement Purple Heart. On August 8, 2018, after hearing of gun-shots, Cpl. Eierman ran toward a scene where a suspect had shot a marked patrol car and was fleeing from officers. While pursuing the suspect, Cpl. Eierman engaged with him and was shot twice. Thanks to Cpl. Eierman’s her-oism, no one else was hurt and the individual was brought to justice. Officer Eierman is a dedicated father and husband who has served the Jacksonville Beach community for 16 years as a member of Jacksonville Beach Police Department after previously working as a Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office corrections officer. In addition to being a family man, Cpl. Eierman is active in his church and always looking for ways to give back to the community he serves. On behalf of a grateful community, I want to thank Cpl. William Eierman for the courage he displayed on that day, and every day. We thank you for your service and wish you a speedy recovery. RECOGNIZING THE ASIAN PACIFIC DEVELOPMENT CENTER HON. MIKE COFFMAN 
OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 20, 2018 Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Asian Pacific Development Cen-ter, a community based non-profit organization that was founded to serve Asian American Pa-cific Islanders, but now extends its services to all immigrant and refugee communities in the Aurora/Denver metro area. The Asian Pacific Development Center has done so now for nearly four decades. The influx of refugees and immigrants from the Asia Pacific region into Colorado shortly after the end of the Vietnam War was the im-petus for the creation of the Asian Pacific De-velopment Center. These new arrivals in Colo-rado faced challenges overcoming language barriers and mental health issues, such as post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. To address these challenges, the Asian Pa-cific Development Center was founded in 1980, staffed with social workers, attorneys, psychologists and psychiatrists. Today the Asian Pacific Development Cen-ter does much more. In fact, it serves as a ‘‘one-stop’’ shop offering compassionate care and an array of other services to immigrants and refugees such as English as a second language instruction. The Asian Pacific Devel-opment Center strives to provide all these services in a culturally appropriate manner. These support services strengthen the health and wellbeing of immigrants who are transitioning into life in Colorado. A key factor in the effective delivery of all these services is the Asian Pacific Develop-ment Center’s Executive Director Harry Budisidharta. He has done a remarkable job and has become a very well-respected leader, not only for the Asian Pacific Development Center, but of our entire community. I am proud that the Asian Pacific Development Center is located in my hometown of Aurora, Colorado.

HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY

Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-ognize the 39th anniversary of Catholics for Housing, Incorporated and to congratulate the 2018 Father Gerard Creedon Housing Award recipients. Founded in response to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops’ Pastoral Let-ter entitled, ‘‘The Right to a Decent Home,’’ Catholics for Housing, Incorporated was es-tablished in 1979 under the tireless leadership of Father Gerard Creedon and sustained by a dedicated group of community members who work to expand affordable housing options and prevent homelessness. Now in its 39th year, Catholics for Housing has grown substantially in both clientele and

breadth of mission. Since its inception, the or-ganization has expanded to provide assist-ance in 21 counties within the vicinity of the Arlington Catholic Diocese. It has adapted over the years with new goals and a renewed vision, while remaining true to its core mission of collaborating with others to support the de-velopment, construction, and rehabilitation of affordable housing. Catholics for Housing projects include affordable housing initiatives, affordable rental housing, senior citizen rental assistance, security deposit assistance, and collaborative education and advocacy efforts. Catholics for Housing is sustained through the dedication and generosity of its board, staff, volunteers, and many community part-ners. It is my honor to include in the R
ECORD the following Catholics for Housing partners for sustaining the vision established by Father Creedon and our dedicated community mem-bers. The 2018 Father Gerard Creedon Hous-ing Award honorees are: Mr. Robert Gibson is one of the co-founders of Catholics for Housing and is being recog-nized for his steadfast support of affordable housing and homelessness prevention. Mr. Jonathan N. Francis, Esquire is being recognized for the assistance he provided to the residents of East End Mobile Home Park when they all faced eviction when the property was declared a health hazard due to ongoing sewer leaks. The City of Manassas is being recognized for approving the sale of East End Mobil Home Park and working with Catholics for Housing as it rehabbed the water and sewer problems. The leadership and actions taken by these honorees resulted in the preservation of af-fordable housing for approximately 300 resi-dents. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the 2018 Father Gerard Creedon Housing Award recipients and in commending the efforts of Catholics for Hous-ing, who continues to work with its partners to provide needed support and assistance to many of our most vulnerable neighbors.

RECOGNIZING OMNI FAMILY HEALTH, INC. 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 20, 2018 Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Omni Family Health, Inc. for forty years of service throughout California’s Cen-tral Valley. Omni Family Health, Inc. was established in 1978 as a health center in the town of Buttonwillow, an unincorporated farming com-munity in California’s San Joaquin Valley. Re-sponding to a profound shortage of medical care in the area, community members founded Buttonwillow Health Center. Before long, Buttonwillow Health Center was invited to ex-pand to neighboring towns and eventually be-came Omni Family Health. The San Joaquin Valley is an extremely rural region with a large population of under-served communities. Due to high unemploy-ment and large populations of migrant work-ers, medical care can be difficult for many to attain. Omni Family Health, Inc. directly re-sponds to these needs, providing medical, dental, and behavioral health services to ev-eryone, regardless of their ability to pay. They strive to break longstanding barriers in the re-gion and meet the communities’ needs head- on. They are a mission-oriented organization, demonstrating a strong commitment to under-served communities. Omni Family Health, Inc. also prioritizes the respect of staff and the hir-ing of compassionate people. That simple show of respect has led to decades-long ca-reers at Omni. From their humble beginnings, Omni Family Health, Inc. has rapidly become one of the largest networks of health centers in the San Joaquin Valley. By the end of this year, they will be operating thirty health centers in Kings, Kern, and Fresno Counties. Their 750 employ-ees serve over 100,000 patients, while their facilities generate $123,000,000 in economic benefits. Their contributions have made them an invaluable and treasured member in the communities they serve. Omni Family Health, Inc. has gained a na-tional reputation for their exceptional care and compassion. In 2015, they were awarded two achievements by the National Association of Community Health Centers: The Outstanding Achievement Award and the Migrant Health Center of the Year Award, which they are ex-tremely proud of. While Omni Family Health, Inc. serves a diverse population of patients, migrant workers will always be their passion. It was the small farming community of Buttonwillow. California, that birthed their mis-sion, so being nationally recognized for their service to migrant workers was especially meaningful to them. Omni Family Health, Inc. shows no signs of slowing down. As they continue to grow and meet the needs of the San Joaquin Valley, they remain committed to their two core ideals, providing healthcare for their commu-nity through compassionate service. The San Joaquin Valley will be forever thankful for the work they have done, and excited for the work they will still do. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives to join me in commending Omni Family Health, Inc. for forty years of service and wishing them further success in their future. f 
IN MEMORY OF OFFICER MICHAEL HUFFMAN 
HON. DAVID P. JOYCE 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 20, 2018 Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I would like to honor the life and service of a con-stituent of mine, Madison Village Police Officer Michael Huffman. Officer Huffman, a 19-year veteran officer, unfortunately passed away while on duty on Wednesday, November 14, 2018. Originally from Painesville, Officer Huffman enjoyed working on cars and spend-ing time with his wife, Viola, and his family. His legacy and dedication to public service will always be remembered. My prayers are with Officer Huffman’s family, his friends, the Vil-lage of Madison, and the Madison Village Po-lice Department during this difficult time. RECOGNIZING MICHELLE MCGOVERN

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 20, 2018 Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I, along with Representative F
RANKEL and Representative H
ASTINGS , rise today in recognition of the ac-complishments and extensive public service record of United States Senator B
ILLNELSON ’s State Director, and our dear friend, Michelle McGovern. Since her time as a student at Florida Atlan-tic University, Michelle has demonstrated a passion for government and the capacity to lead. Her tireless work ethic, combined with her many successes, earned her election as FAU’s student body Vice-President and ap-pointment to Florida’s Board of Regents, as the first and only FAU student appointee. Fast forward to today and Michelle has hon-orably served Senator N
ELSON and the State of Florida for 18 years. She rose quickly through the ranks from a Legislative Cor-respondent to her current position as State Di-rector. In each of her roles, she exemplified leadership and collaboration, while providing superior service to the citizens of Florida. In addition to serving the entire state, Michelle devotes much of her time to serving her local community. She is a past President of the Forum Club of the Palm Beaches, SunFest, and the West Palm 100. She has also served on the Mayor’s Nominating Com-mittee for the City of West Palm Beach, Char-ter Review Committees for West Palm Beach and Wellington, and Wellington’s Education Advisory Board. Michelle is currently the Chairwoman of the School Advisory Com-mittee at Binks Forest Elementary School, where she has long been active in the PTA. On top of all this, Michelle and her husband John, have raised two wonderful daughters, Emilia and Victoria. Today we ask this body to recognize Michelle McGovern for her endless dedication and leadership in our community. Michelle has demonstrated a commitment to service that we should expect from all of our civil servants. We, along with the citizens of Florida, thank her for her service.

HONORING MONTEREY COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY DEAN FLIP-PO 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 20, 2018 Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the long and distinguished career of retiring District Attorney Dean D. Flippo, who has served the people of Monterey County since 1972. Mr. Flippo’s retirement comes after serving eight terms as Monterey County District Attorney. I had the distinct privilege to serve under Mr. Flippo as an Assistant District Attorney and can personally attest to his char-acter. While our community is losing an ex-ceptional public servant, we certainly wish him the best on his well-earned retirement. Mr. Flippo received his bachelor’s degree in 1963 at the College of William & Mary and

earned a Juris Doctorate from Wayne State University Law School in 1966. He began his law career in the United States Army in 1967, where he served as a Chief Prosecutor, Post Judge Advocate, and Military Judge. He was awarded the Army Meritorious Service Medal for his honorable service to our country. Mr. Flippo began his career as a prosecutor in Monterey County in 1972 as an Assistant District Attorney and was overwhelmingly elected to the position of District Attorney in 1990. During his tenure as District Attorney, Mr. Flippo was instrumental in establishing nu-merous innovative programs to improve public safety in Monterey County. Among these pro-grams was the award-winning Truancy Abate-ment Unit, which has received statewide rec-ognition for success in working closely with schools and families to bring about compli-ance with mandatory school attendance laws. Mr. Flippo was also instrumental in making the Monterey County District Attorney’s office one of California’s most productive in child support enforcement. This effort was recognized in 1999, when Mr. Flippo was awarded the Out-standing Manager of the Year by the National Child Support Enforcement Association. Under Mr. Flippo’s leadership, the Monterey County District Attorney’s office maintained a stead-fast commitment to finding new ways to pro-tect our community. In addition to his professional accomplish-ments, Mr. Flippo has also served in numer-ous civic and community organizations. Among the most important lessons I learned from my time as a prosecutor is the para-mount importance of serving one’s community both inside and outside the courtroom, and Mr. Flippo certainly embodied this ideal. He is the past President of the California District At-torneys Association (CDAA) and a past mem-ber of the Board of Directors of the National Child Support Enforcement Association. He is also the State Chair for the CDAA Consumer Protection Committee and a Board Member of the National District Attorneys Association. Lo-cally, he is involved in serving on the board of directors of numerous organization including the Monterey Peninsula College Foundation, Monterey Peninsula Foundation Grant Com-mittee, Child Abuse Prevention Council, Chil-dren’s Council of Monterey County, and Com-munity Alliance for Safety and Peace. He was also an educator at Golden Gate University and Monterey Peninsula College, where he taught Public Administration, Administration of Justice, American History, and American Gov-ernment to the next generation of public serv-ants. Mr. Flippo’s extensive service to his be-loved community stands as an enduring leg-acy. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to share the ac-complishments and distinguished record of one of Monterey County’s most committed and decorated public servants. I know he is look-ing forward to spending more time with his wife, Rene; daughter, Tracy; son, Derek; daughter-in-law, Marianna; and grandchildren, Katherine, Anne, and Douglas. I ask my col-leagues to join me in extending our best wish-es to District Attorney Dean Flippo and his family and thank him for his innumerable con-tributions to the central coast of California. RECOGNIZING DR. GERALD L. GORDON 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 20, 2018 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-ognize an individual who has made an indel-ible mark on the Fairfax County community and the Northern Virginia region as a whole. Dr. Gerald L. Gordon, President and CEO of the Fairfax County Economic Development Authority, is retiring from that role after 35 years of extraordinary service. During his ten-ure, he has guided Fairfax County through in-credible transformative changes. When Dr. Gordon joined the EDA in 1983, Fairfax County had a population of approxi-mately 661,000. Our commercial sector was small compared to those of our regional neigh-bors, with 32 million square feet of office space supporting 243,000 jobs. Fairfax County was largely a bedroom community for federal workers who commuted to Washington, D.C. and the surrounding area. Fast forward 35 years and today, the population of Fairfax County has nearly doubled to more than 1.1 million. Fairfax County is home to a thriving com-mercial sector anchored in Tysons with over 117 million square feet of commercial real es-tate supporting over 600,000 jobs across the county. Ten Fortune 500 companies make their headquarters in Fairfax County, more than 30 states. Fairfax County has evolved from a bedroom community to the economic engine of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The Dulles corridor, which stretches from Tysons to the Loudoun County line supports more tech jobs than any other region of our country outside of California. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate in Fairfax County at the end of September, 2018 was 2.5 percent lower than the Common-wealth of Virginia rate of 2.9 percent and more than a full percentage point lower than the na-tional unemployment rate of 3.7 percent. Successfully managing this explosive growth and economic expansion requires visionary leadership from the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors to make the necessary invest-ments to ensure that the groundwork could be laid for the transformation that is well under-way. Visionary leadership is not enough by itself however. It is also critical that the County government had a willing and able partner in Dr. Gordon and the Economic Development Authority. The benefits of the partnership that we were able to forge are still being recog-nized and will be for decades to come. Dr. Gordon leaves an extensive legacy of accomplishments. These include the creation of the Emerging Business Forum to support small minority and woman-owned businesses and the successful campaign for Fairfax Coun-ty to host the 1998 World Congress on Infor-mation Technology. He has also received a lit-any of awards, including the Virginia Business Person of the Year Award from Virginia Busi-ness Magazine in 2010, the Leadership Fair-fax Northern Virginia Leadership Award in 2011 and the Jeffrey A. Finkle Organizational Leadership Award from the International Eco-nomic Development Council in 2015. Virginia Business has listed him annually as one of its 50 Most Influential Virginians since 2013. He is also a widely respected author who has written 13 books on economic development and strategic planning. Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Gordon for his many decades of service to our community and congratulate him on his vast array of ac-complishments. While he will be dearly missed and leaves behind sizeable shoes to fill at EDA, he will be leaving Fairfax County better positioned to face tomorrow’s challenges. I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing him continued success and all the best in his re-tirement.

HONORING MS. GINA WIRONEN 
HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN 
OF MASSACHUSETTS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 20, 2018 Mr. M
CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a proud servant of the people and Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Ms. Gina Wironen. Gina has been an integral part of the Leominster School District for over four dec-ades as an educator and administrator. In her 43-year career in education, Gina has held many prominent roles within the Leomin-ster School District including serving as the Assistant Principal of Saint Leo School and Principal of Samoset Middle School. Most re-cently, Gina worked as the Director of Com-munity Engagement and Media Relations for the entire school district. Throughout her distinguished career, Gina has consistently been recognized for her ex-emplary service to our district, including: the Learning for Life Leadership Award, Teacher of the Year—Leominster Rotary Award, and most recently, the M.W.C.C. Lifetime Achieve-ment Award. Because of Gina’ s leadership and advo-cacy, Leominster has become one of the most active and collaborative districts that partici-pates in the United Way Youth Venture pro-gram. This service-oriented educational experience works with children and young adults to create ventures using their passions to support the community. Due to Gina’s efforts, over 74 service teams have made an impact within the district since the program’s inception in 2002. Gina has continually worked to expand the program within Leominster and all of Central Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, this alone would be an impres-sive list of achievements that deserves our re-spect and gratitude. But since 2013, Gina has successfully advocated in support of the de-velopment of two new innovation schools in Leominster, and secured funding for a new athletic facility for the local high school. Gina understands that education does not just hap-pen in schools. She has worked with the en-tire community to enhance what is happening in the classroom. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the United States Congress and the people of Massachusetts, I would like to thank and recognize Gina for her work in the Leominster School District to im-prove the Massachusetts education system. Her tireless efforts have forever changed Leominster for the better.

REVEREND DR. WASHINGTON LEE LUNDY’S 50TH PASTORAL ANNI-VERSARY AT EVENING STAR BAPTIST CHURCH 
HON. HAKEEM S. JEFFRIES 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 20, 2018 Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Reverend Dr. Washington Lee Lundy’s 50th Pastoral Anniversary at Glen Terrace in Brooklyn, New York on Saturday, November 17, 2018. Since the founding of Evening Star Baptist Church in 1916, Rev-erend Dr. Washington Lundy has served as the second senior pastor in the church’s 102- year history. From an early age, Reverend Dr. Lundy was called to preach, initially at First Baptist Church in his hometown of McKinney, Virginia. After graduation from high school in 1954, he studied at Virginia Union University, in Rich-mond, VA. A year later, he moved to New York completing his studies at Manhattan Community College. Settling in Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, he joined the congrega-tion of Evening Star Baptist Church where first Senior Pastor Reverend Marcellus French Logan presided. There he met ‘‘the love of his life,’’ Dorothy Fields, whom he married and raised two children with, Christopher Lee and Valerie Anita. Upon the passing of Rev. Logan, Evening Star Baptist Church recognized Reverend Dr. Washington Lee Lundy as Senior Pastor on November 5, 1968. During his dedicated serv-ice to the congregation and surrounding com-munity, he went on to pursue a Doctorate from Baltimore School of the Bible. In his 50 years of leadership at Evening Star, Reverend Dr. Lundy helped organize the Gates Avenue Block Association and established the Evening Star Baptist Church Scholarship Fund for stu-dents entering college and those returning to school for higher education. He also solidified the longevity of the church by settling the church’s mortgage and founding the Eastern Baptist Association School of Religion and Evening Star Youth Ministry. Reverend Dr. Lundy proudly represented Evening Star across the country and world. He served as Vice Moderator at Large of the Eastern Baptist Association (EBA) of New York, and then as Moderator of the EBA from 1988 to 1992. He was elected as Vice Presi-dent at Large of the Empire Baptist Missionary Convention of New York, and then as its President for six years. He also served as Vice President of the National Baptist Conven-tion USA—North East Region. More recently, in 2010 he was the host for the New York State Convention for the 20th Baptist World Congress in Hawaii. Globally, he has carried a message of hope and faith, traveling to var-ious countries in Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Australia. Mr. Speaker, in honor of this great spiritual and community leader, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in con-gratulating the Reverend Dr. Washington Lee Lundy on his 50th Pastoral Anniversary at Evening Star Baptist Church.

RECOGNIZING THE AWARDEES OF THE 14TH ANNUAL FAIRFAX COUNTY HISTORY CONFERENCE 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 20, 2018 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-ognize the Fairfax County History Commission on the occasion of the 14th Annual Fairfax County History Conference. Since 1969, the Fairfax County History Commission has worked to identify, document, record and preserve the historic past of our re-gion. Few areas in the country are as rich in history as ours. Indeed, the history of this re-gion is the history of our country. The History Conference provides an opportunity to reflect on the accomplishments of the past year and to recognize our neighbors who have made significant contributions to preserving and pro-moting our local history. Through the dedi-cated efforts of the History Commission and its many volunteers, we are assured that our history will not be lost and will be available for future generations. This year, several of these dedicated indi-viduals are being honored for their commit-ment to the preservation and education of his-tory. I am proud to include in the RECORD their names: Ms. Carolyn Cornwell Miller, for her efforts in collecting, preserving, researching and maintaining the history of the rural schools of Great Falls, Virginia. Mr. Chuck Mauro, for his extensive body of work documenting the history of Fairfax Coun-ty, including numerous books, plays, lectures and an award-winning movie, ‘‘The Battle of Chantilly (Ox Hill).’’ Mr. Gregory P. Wilson, for his efforts serv-ing our country and Fairfax County by pre-serving, researching and maintaining the his-tory of this area—specifically regarding the contributions of his Quaker ancestors and the Civil War leaders they encountered. Ms. Eloise Lorenze, for her efforts in pre-serving, researching and maintaining the his-tory of the Greenway area of McLean, Virginia through commentaries, photographs and oral histories. Dr. Patricia Farrell Donahue, for her exem-plary work in preserving, researching, docu-menting, analyzing and presenting a complete and thorough review of the history of the Pimmit Hills area of Fairfax County. I commend the Fairfax County History Com-mission for helping to ensure that the abun-dance of history that is available to our com-munity will be preserved far into the future. I congratulate all of the honorees and ask my colleagues to join me in thanking each of them for the important work they do for the Northern Virginia Community.

H. RES. 1138 PASSAGE 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 20, 2018 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I’m proud to be an original cosponsor of House Resolution 1138, and I wholeheartedly support its pas-sage. H. Res. 1138 condemns the heinous anti- Semitic attack on the building housing three congregations, Tree of Life, Dor Hadash, and New Light in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania that re-sulted in the deaths of 11 innocent people. The resolution honors the memory of the vic-tims of the attack, as well as offers condo-lences to and expresses support for their fami-lies, friends, and community. I am saddened and outraged by this hateful act. Unfortunately, anti-Semitic incidents have been on the rise—increasing 57 percent in 2017. This horrific shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue is yet another manifestation of this ancient hatred. Congress stands united in condemning the deadly attack on the Tree of Life synagogue, remembering all who were taken from us on that fateful day, and wishing speedy recovery for those who survived. Last week, Members of Congress passed this bill, not as Repub-licans or Democrats, but as Americans who oppose intolerance. The freedom to worship is a core principle of this nation—one that our forefathers en-shrined in our Constitution to protect us all from undue prosecution. As a Jewish Member of Congress, I stand ready to fiercely defend the right of all Americans to freely exercise their religious beliefs. With anti-Semitism on the rise, we must redouble our efforts to eradi-cate it at home and abroad. I pray for the victims of the Tree of Life shooting and their families, and I know that our community will work to promote religious tolerance and freedom everywhere.

HON. GARRET GRAVES 
OF LOUISIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 20, 2018 Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 30 year anni-versary of LSU’s Pennington Biomedical Re-search Center. Founders C.B. ‘‘Doc’’ and Mrs. Pennington donated to the university in hopes of building ‘‘the biggest and best nutrition re-search center in the country.’’ Their vision has largely been accomplished. As the center has grown, they’ve become a premiere scientific research institution—highly sought after to publish medical research on chronic disease prevention and to host national medical sym-posiums. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) selected Pennington Biomedical for sev-eral medical studies such as diet risk factors for heart disease, the effects of diets on blood pressure, and diabetes prevention. Over the past 30 years, there have been 212,123 sci-entific citations from over 5,000 Pennington Biomedical publications. Their work has im-proved the quality of life for millions of people worldwide. I’m proud to represent this pre-miere research facility, housed at one of Lou-isiana’s finest schools. Well done, Pennington Biomedical Research Facility, on an incredible 30 years of excellence and discovery. RECOGNIZING THE 30TH ANNIVER-SARY OF LEADERSHIP FAIRFAX HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, November 20, 2018 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-ognize an organization that has made an in-credible mark on our Northern Virginia com-munity. Since 1988, Leadership Fairfax has dedicated itself to shaping the future leaders of tomorrow. The dedication of Leadership Fairfax to this endeavor is one that I know well; a number of my staff from my time as Providence District Supervisor and later as Chairman of the Fairfax County Board of Su-pervisors are Leadership Fairfax alumni. Through both the Leadership Fairfax Insti-tute and the Emerging Leaders Institute, Lead-ership Fairfax identifies the leaders of tomor-row and works to equip them with the knowl-edge, experience and skills to not only be-come more productive employees within their organizations, but also to become more pro-ductive members of society and their commu-nities as well. As part of their training pro-grams, enrollees in both LFI and ELI are given a contemporary issue facing Fairfax County to solve. These collaborations have led to invalu-able insight for both the public and private sectors and have at times illuminated possible avenues for partnerships where none seemed to exist previously. Recent ELI and LFI pro-grams have focused on increasing ethics and transparency in government, something which is called for now perhaps more than at any previous point in our history. I commend Lead-ership Fairfax for its continued dedication to enhancing civic life in Northern Virginia. One of the benefits of Leadership Fairfax that I have valued the most is the ability to foster consensus on difficult issues. In Fairfax County, we can pride ourselves on having a model of civil discourse and debate when it comes to dealing with the problems of govern-ment. Even though we might have strong dis-agreements on an issue, we have been able to engage in these discussions without having the forum devolve into personal attacks. As the national political environment grows ever more toxic, it is even more vital that we have programs like Leadership Fairfax which remind us that the main objective of government is to solve problems, not to score political points for one party or another. Mr. Speaker, we in Northern Virginia are blessed with an abundance of civic engage-ment and a belief in giving back to one’s com-munity. That abundance is something which is unique to our region, cultivated over time by the efforts of organizations like Leadership Fairfax. I want to especially thank Tim Sargeant, Karen Cleveland and all the mem-bers of the Board of Directors, staff and volun-teers that have worked to continue that cul-tivation over the last three decades. I also ex-tend my congratulations to all of the graduates of Leadership Fairfax, past and present, for the work you do every day in our community to make it a better place. All your efforts are truly selfless and are worthy of our highest praise. Congratulations on this momentous an-niversary. I look forward to celebrating your continued contributions for many years to come.
