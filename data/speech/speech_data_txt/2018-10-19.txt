CONSTITUENT COMMENTS ON SOBER LIVING HOME PROBLEMS 
HON. DANA ROHRABACHER 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 19, 2018 Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise again regarding the hearing held by the Judici-ary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice on September 28, 2018 on the issue of sober living homes. At that hearing, I had the privilege of testifying in support of my bill, H.R. 5724, to restore local oversight over sober living homes. As part of my testimony, I submitted to the Subcommittee letters from many of my constituents about problems with sober living homes caused by current federal law preventing appropriate local oversight. For the benefit of my colleagues and the American people, I include in the R
ECORD the fifth group of these constituent letters: 
Thank you for bringing our issues with Sober Living Homes (SLH) in our neighbor-hoods to congress. Here is the nightmare my husband, two young sons and I have endured over the past 1.5 years. We live in downtown Huntington Beach that had been known for our lovely beaches and quaint surf culture community, now we are called Rehab Riviera. My nightmare began in April 2017, when the owner of the house across the street from me opted turn down $3800 in rent per month to dozens of families wanting to rent it and instead he sold out the neighborhood for $9000 a month in rent to a business, [REDACTED]. [RE-DACTED] was started by two addicts, [NAME] and [NAME] 1 year and 4 months out of a recovery. They have no special training, they are not licensed by the State of Cali-fornia, DHHS does not regulate their busi-ness and they especially do not have hand- picked doctors, per their website, taking care of the young lives at [ADDRESS]. On February 24, 2018, a handsome, sweet young man, [NAME], overdosed, in the care of [RE-DACTED], at [ADDRESS]. His body laid in his bed for over 8 hours before it was discov-ered. Then his fluid-soaked mattress laid on the sidewalk between the home and the wall separating the houses for 2 weeks before it was finally disposed of properly. On March 13, 2018 [NAME] co-owner of [REDACTED] overdosed at his home in Fountain Valley. According to the reports, [NAME] was appar-ently facing pressure on several fronts. Last year, a text exchange between [NAME]’s business partner, [NAME], and an addict, went public in that forum, laying bare an in-creasingly-common scam: Addicts demand-ing to be paid to get surgical implants of opioid-blocking drugs. The idea is that the addicts know rehab operators and doctors can bill insurance companies thousands of dollars per procedure. I shared the above so you have an idea of the type of so-called Sober Living Home I am dealing with. A business opened by two ad-dicts just to make money while they scam the system and allow young men to die and overdose (survive) in their care. After [NAME] overdose at the unlicensed home I was sure that someone on a state or federal level would have shut them down but noth-ing happened. The house manager, known as [NAME] (no idea what his real name is) has allowed 2 more young men to overdose under his care but luckily both survived. When we asked [NAME] about them he stated they were kicked out of the house and if you have spent any time in Southern California lately, that just means there are now 2 more home-less addicts on the streets. All the clients at [REDACTED] have been flown here from other parts of the country and a few of them have told me that it was a one-way ticket and if they want to go home they have to do it with their own funds. They also tell me they get money whenever they bring in an-other client into the house. . . . In addition to the above the neighbors and I have endured the following: drug deals going down on our street. The clients getting blow jobs while sitting in their cars parked in front of our homes. Constant foul lan-guage coming from the clients and their ‘‘friends’’ who come to visit. Young men wearing their pants down to their knees, ghetto music (music that is loud and con-tains profanity) blaring from their cars and out of the house. At times there are 14 cars on our block from the 7 clients and their 7 girlfriends so we cannot park in front of our homes. I have two young boys and I am con-stantly bringing in groceries or lugging out sports bags, so having to walk a block away to get to and from my car. Trash in the street and in the alley. Hypodermic needles have been found, one of them in the neigh-bor’s backyard. The neighbors to the south of [REDACTED] are elderly and they can’t have their grandkids come over and play outside anymore in fear of a hypodermic nee-dle impaling itself into their little bodies when it comes flying over the wall between the homes. In addition, the clients toss their cigarette butts over the fence into the same neighbor’s back yard. The same neighbors can no longer leave their windows open to get fresh air since they are constantly bombarded with cigarette smoke. Countless fighting going on in the house that has resulted in countless police visits. Intimidation from the clients. There have been many occasions when I am outside in front of my home and one of the clients will stand across the street, drawing on his ciga-rette, with his pants down to his knees, star-ing me down and glaring at my every move. My kids use to skateboard in front of our house, or toss the football, but now they don’t want to be out there. We felt compelled to put up cameras, keep our doors shut and our window curtains drawn. Increase in petty thefts. If we mistakenly leave our cars unlocked the content is stolen during the night. I watched two addicts (not from [REDACTED]) walking down the alley a few months ago tugging on every door han-dle they passed. Then they attempted to break into a shed on a neighbor’s property while I had run home to get my phone and call the police. When we (the neighbors) have complained to [NAME] he tells us to stop talking to his clients, they are grown men and there is nothing he can do about the issues. His big solution is to kick them out after they over-dose, if they are lucky enough to survive. So, I don’t understand how [REDACTED] can run a scam business in my neighborhood. I live a residential zoned neighborhood not in a business zone. How can they stay in oper-ations when the state knows they are unli-censed, their website was criminally mis-leading, and they are allowing young men to OD and die in their ‘‘care’’? I grew up in poverty, crawled my way out of it by going to college on Pell grants (thank you government for giving me a hand up, not a hand out), worked very hard to be able to buy my mother a home and then my-self one in 1995. I have lived here for 23 years and before April 2017 it has been a quiet, peaceful neighborhood with thoughtful and kind neighbors. Now the SLH has greatly re-duced the quality of life my family and I had once enjoyed in our home. We are no longer comfortable in our home, nor on our street. On August 13, 2018 we found out that a re-cently purchased home (at [ADDRESS]) 3 doors down from [ADDRESS] is also going to be a sober living home. We have two side-by- side in the [REDACTED] block of California street. Two more in the [REDACTED] block of Huntington street (one street over) and countless more throughout the neighbor-hood. We understand that a recovery center is building their headquarters in downtown HB. Seriously? Do you know how expensive real estate is in Southern California, and these guys can afford to build a high-rise headquarters 3 blocks from the ocean and a stone throw away from two blocks of bars. This is not about helping these addicts find recovery, this is about money, lots of money! They want to bring them here to this envi-ronment, so they stayed hooked on the drugs and they can continue to scam the America tax payers! C
ATHERINE YOUNG , Huntington Beach, California. 
A Sober Living Facility has moved in next door to my house one and a half years ago. It has probably lowered the value of my house at least $100,000 because no one wants to move in next to a facility like this. I live in Huntington Beach because of the cool coastal breezes and now I have to close my windows because they are constantly smok-ing in the back yard. There are often ciga-rette stubs on the curb and trash around the house. One girl overdosed there last year so the fire stations and the police were there. These sober living facilities should be closer to downtown and not in the middle of family neighborhood. We don’t let our children play as much outside because we never know who may be coming and going from that house. K
AREN PESKO , Huntington Beach, California. 
I see that they have changed the name from Halfway Houses to Sober Living Homes. I am against having these homes in resi-dential areas. The people in these homes are either alcoholics or drug addicts. If they go ‘‘off the rails’’ they could potentially be a danger to innocent people. Let’s take, for ex-ample, a recovering alcoholic living in a resi-dential area. One day he/she gets upset and can’t stop from drinking. He or she gets into their car drunk, in the residential neighbor-hood, and drives. In the drunken state, they have the potential to kill, adults and chil-dren. I’m sure your argument will be that drugs and alcohol are not allowed in the resi-dences, but where there is a will there is a way! That won’t stop them.

My solution for the halfway house situa-tion is for the addiction centers that cur-rently treat these individuals to also build housing within the zoned business area where they are located. L
INDA HICKS, Huntington Beach, California. 
The presence of unregulated Sober Living Homes in our city has negatively impacted our residential communities. These unregu-lated businesses recruit and attract addicts requiring professional treatment for their issues and have no accountability for ade-quately providing necessary care for their clients. Residential areas, such as my neigh-borhood in Huntington Beach, are overrun with multiple such ‘‘homes’’ that bring addi-tional crime, traffic, noise and nuisance to our peaceful communities. One of my neigh-bors, whom lives next door to a SLH, has re-ported active drug dealing on the front lawn of the house, in the presence of his minor children. These SLH are businesses profiting from loopholes in government oversight reg-ulations that have robbed our communities and our citizens of our peace, in our own homes. Law abiding citizens and neighbors living in our residential communities should not have to co-exist and tolerate ‘‘busi-nesses’’ that are operating under the radar of the law, in our own homes. Business should be located in areas zoned for business oper-ations, not in residential neighborhoods. Please restore the peace and tranquility of our communities by eliminating SLH from our residential communities. K
RISTINE KOCH, Huntington Beach, California. 
Dear Congressman Rohrabacher, my fam-ily and I have seen the negative impact from influx of unlicensed sober living homes in our neighborhood. Common effects are loi-tering transients, public intoxication, public drug use and littering of used paraphernalia, prostitution, petty theft including stealing of packages on doorsteps, breaking into cars and at times residents homes. I have been a resident of Orange County, California since 1979 and a resident of Costa Mesa since 1999. I can say firsthand the dete-rioration of Costa Mesa is evident the past 19 years. As a father three children and home-owner I strongly encourage action by our government to resolve and/or prevent of unli-censed sober living homes in our city and county. If this does not occur, then I like other similar families will look to relocate and raise our children in a safer, crimeless environment. G
RAHAM SHUTE , Costa Mesa, California. 
There is Sober Living home that opened on my street. I don’t know why they’re pre-tending to be a sober living home because they’ve already found a bag of heroin not far from the house. This house is located two doors down from a public middle school. Hundreds of kids walked by the house and or are dropped off in front of this house daily. This such facility has no business in a family community. Neighbors complain that there has been strange people coming in and out of the house. Two of those strange people were knocking on resident doors and even jumped the fence and went into one of their back-yards and walked into their house when they were being chased by the police. I believe sober living homes have no business in resi-dential neighborhoods because they are bringing down the quality of life and safety for the residences around them. G
INAWALTERS , Huntington Beach, California. 
We have lived in our current residence on [REDACTED] for the past 16 years. It has been an outstanding neighborhood to live in and raise our 3 children. Unfortunately, our peaceful little neighborhood has experienced a drastic change in recent months with the unwelcome addition of a sober living house right down the street. Since the arrival of the occupants, we have experienced a few no-table incidents with the most recent being a few individuals that apparently were doing drugs around the corner and were quickly pursued by the Huntington Beach Police De-partment. This led to the individuals fleeing through multiple backyards and actually en-tering a residence in an attempt to hide from the police. The individuals were caught on video at one of our neighbor’s houses which showed them moving around the perimeter of the residence as they were attempting to hide from the authorities. During that evening, the residents right next door to the sober living house were holding a sleepover for 8 young girls in their backyard. This is a little too close for comfort. In addition, there is a middle school located less than 100 yards from the sober living home and is in the direct foot travel path of children walk-ing home from school. It is our under-standing that the transient nature of these sober living houses will introduce new resi-dents every 8 weeks. This means a whole new set of problems will rotate through every 2 months. For the safety of our children, the children at our local schools, and the safety of our own properties I am requesting action to be taken to place stricter oversight on the introduction of sober living houses allowed in residential neighborhoods and if possible limit the number of them being imple-mented. We have a serious problem here in California with criminals being released early due to budget reductions being placed on our correctional facilities and the good tax paying citizens of this state have to deal with that fallout. We need effective changes that protect our neighborhoods and our kids. STEVE TRESKES , Huntington Beach, California. 
I grew up in a State Legislator’s home, growing up as a Wolcott (Raymond Oliver Wolcott was my Grandfather, John B. Wol-cott, his son, raised me). I had a decent up-bringing. Later in life, I was ill prepared for my daughter’s death from S.I.D.S. or crib death. She was 4.5 months old. My drinking and marijuana usage escalated to a point where I simply could not contain it. Mer-cifully, I discovered sobriety. So did the mother of our daughter. We were told by nu-merous doctors that getting pregnant again was improbable (as she had three living kids and previous problematic pregnancies before I met her) yet imagine our surprise to the birth of fraternal twin girls. No in vitro or otherwise modern birth science, just a sobri-ety miracle in our eyes. My twins are 19 and currently they’re enrolled at a junior college in the Texas A&M School System. I am very certain sobriety and sober living assisted them in their development. Although I am divorced and have had three relapses, I also have had twenty two years of sober time in my life. I have a brief attached for a ‘‘Christian- sober living’’ that may appear rather con-voluted, however its main highlights are: have events scheduled to keep residents away from the home (so as to minimize riffraff from visitors), cash and carry instead of billable to insurance (No cash on site method of payment), and a giving back men-tality with nurses or doctors that are on call with on staff managers and graduates who need their hours tallied before accreditation. Thank You. D
EDER BARNES , Huntington Beach, California. HONORING THE 100 YEAR ANNI-VERSARY OF THE OHIO CON-TRACTORS ASSOCIATION 
HON. JAMES B. RENACCI 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 19, 2018 Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the Ohio Contractors Association, an organization of more than 500 members in-volved in Ohio’s heavy, highway and utility in-dustry, which turned 100 years on October 10, 2018. Headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, OCA is a recognized voice for needed transpor-tation funding, rational regulatory and legisla-tive accountability, workforce development, im-proving construction practices and relationship building within the industry. While OCA has grown in membership, its mission, although expanded, can be traced to its origin when 50 contractors across the state signed an agreement to form the association. The first meeting of the ‘‘Ohio Road Contrac-tors’ Association’’ was October 10, 1918 in Columbus, Ohio. That initial meeting not only adopted a resolution to drop ‘‘Road’’ from its name and become the Ohio Contractors Asso-ciation, it also created and individually voted upon the acceptances of 10 sections of its constitution. Today, more than 200 Contractor Members and 300 Associate Members provide support, unity and leadership to Ohio’s heavy, highway and utility industry. OCA maintains its state-wide relevance through its nine, Ohio local chapters. Chapter events in combination with statewide committees, events and publications assure that members have the opportunity to provide input and interact with OCA staff so the association remains aware of the issues and concerns of its members and can rep-resent them in a meaningful way. Mr. Speak-er, it is my honor to recognize an organization that has and continues to lead the heavy-high-way and utility construction industry in Ohio.

She is a sensational educator and dedicated volunteer who has long devoted herself to the betterment of Colusa County. As a teacher for Williams Elementary School and Colusa Preschool, Ms. Schumacher’s passion for shaping young minds has been an inspira-tion to her students and fellow educators. Over the past 21 years, she has led and co-ordinated the Super Seven Awards Program which recognizes the top seven 11th and 12th grade students from Colusa High School for their outstanding scholastic achievement. Ms. Schumacher takes the time to write each stu-dent a highly individualized biography to present to them at their awards dinner where her attention to detail and light-hearted touch always manage to bring the event to life.

Ms. Schumacher also generously co-funds a scholarship for Williams High School grad-uates who might otherwise not be able to move into higher education. In short, her cheerful personality, encouraging words, and leadership skills are of endless value to the students and residents affected by her work.

IN MEMORY OF TIM JOHNSON 
HON. JIM JORDAN 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 19, 2018 Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to commend to the House the memory of a former staffer who served the people of Ohio’s Fourth Congressional District for more than twelve years: Timothy Mills Johnson. Tim died on Sunday after a lengthy battle against mul-tiple myeloma. Tim was a native of Jamestown, New York, and took great pride in his hometown and his alma mater, Syracuse University. While at Syr-acuse, where he graduated with a double major in journalism and political science, he started working in radio. After graduation, he returned to Jamestown, where he anchored local radio and television broadcasts for many years. A fellowship from the American Political Science Association brought him to Wash-ington in 1994, where he began working for my predecessor, the late Congressman Mi-chael G. Oxley. Tim handled a wide range of legislative issues for Mr. Oxley through the years, earning a reputation for professionalism in dealing with members, fellow staffers, out-side groups, and constituents. He also put his communication skills to good use, working for several years as both legislative director and communications director. Tim developed a solid grasp of finance issues during his time in Congressman Ox-ley’s office, serving as liaison between the of-fice and the House Financial Services Com-mittee. Following Mr. Oxley’s retirement, Tim moved to the staff of former Congressman Spencer Bachus of Alabama, Mr. Oxley’s suc-cessor as the top Republican on that com-mittee. Tim was known all over the Capitol for his tireless work in support of the annual Con-gressional Baseball Game alongside Con-gressman Oxley, who played for and managed the Republican team throughout his congres-sional career. For two decades, Tim attended every practice, kept statistics, helped set line-ups, and served as bench coach, in addition to working behind the scenes to coordinate press coverage and solicit donations for this exceptional charity event. He was a board member of the Washington Literacy Center, one of the many beneficiaries of the game’s proceeds. His passion for the sport of tennis rivaled his devotion to baseball. As president of the Capitol Hill Tennis Club, he introduced hun-dreds of congressional staffers to the game and encouraged them as they honed their skills. He helped coordinate the annual Mul-tiple Myeloma Charity Classic, a tennis and golf tournament for members of Congress and others that has raised more than $1.2 million in support of multiple myeloma research. Tim was widely praised as a mentor to younger staffers, always taking time to advise newcomers to Washington on how to be effec-tive at their jobs and navigate the legislative process. Tim’s good humor, professionalism, and de-votion to others will long be remembered. We are grateful that good people like Tim Johnson commit themselves to public service and ac-tively inspire so many others to follow in their footsteps. f 
CONGRATULATING THE PICKFORD COMMUNITY LIBRARY FOR WIN-NING THE 2018 SCHOLASTIC SUM-MER READING CHALLENGE 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 19, 2018 Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, it’s my honor to recognize the Pickford Community Library for winning the 2018 Scholastic Summer Reading Challenge. Through its trusted serv-ice and dedication to its local community, the Pickford Library has become an indispensable part of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The Scholastic Summer Reading Challenge is a free online reading program designed to help students turn the ‘‘summer slide’’ learning loss over the summer months into a ‘‘summer leap’’ by encouraging reading for fun. Schools, libraries, and local communities across the country participate in this 18-week challenge. Working with Pickford Public Schools, home school students, and readers throughout the eastern U.P., the Pickford Community Library helped a total of 152 local students read 338,057 minutes—making it the top library in the country. This success was thanks in part to the support of the local community, which helped the library operate its ‘‘piggyback re-wards program’’ to incentivize reading and re-ward students for their efforts. Its dedication to this challenge and efforts to encourage sum-mer reading are just the most recent examples of the Pickford Library’s unwavering commit-ment to the growth and enrichment of the resi-dents of the U.P. In total, the Summer Read-ing Challenge helped encourage more than 135 million minutes of reading by American students. Mr. Speaker, it’s my honor to congratulate the Pickford Community Library, its staff, and its readers for winning the Scholastic Summer Reading Challenge. Day after day, they con-tinue to set a positive example of what can be achieved when the people of a community work together for the common good. On be-half of my constituents, I wish the Pickford Li-brary all the best in its future endeavors. IN HONOR OF FORT BRAGG’S XVIII AIRBORNE CORPS DEPLOYMENT TO IRAQ HON. GEORGE HOLDING 
OF NORTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 19, 2018 Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the brave members of the XVIII Air-borne Corps from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, who deployed September 13, 2018 to Iraq in support of Operation Inherent Resolve. Established in 2014, Operation Inherent Re-solve continues to play an essential role on the front lines of the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. This Combined Joint Task Force is comprised of elite soldiers who have sup-ported many successful efforts, from rescuing Yazidi victims to defending strategic territories in Iraq and Syria, such as Baghdad and Mosul. These troops work closely with partner forces, such as Iraqi Security Forces and Syr-ian opposition fighters, delivering strategic blows to ISIS. Notable successes include Op-eration Tidal Wave II, which destroyed nearly 80% of ISIS oil collection infrastructure and the successful liberation of Ramadi, Iraq and Shaddadi, Syria. Today, Operation Inherent Resolve continues to execute successful oper-ations and uphold its mission to defeat the threat of ISIS and to increase regional sta-bility. I am immensely proud of the members of the XVIII Airborne Corps of Ft. Bragg who will be deployed to support this mission and grate-ful for their tireless service. These brave men and women represent the best our nation has to offer and their bravery and dedication to our nation deserves the utmost respect. I would also like to acknowledge the sacrifice of their families, and commend them for their support throughout deployment.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 19, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Jayne Williams as a woman of the year. She has dedicated her life to mentoring others and is an outstanding example of serv-ice to the community. Over the years she has given her time and talent to organizations aimed at helping people get through tough times, such as after-school programs for low- income children and families, a recovery group for those battling addiction, and Shoulder to Shoulder, a mentoring organization serving young men lacking positive male role-models. She also worked as a Sacramento Court Ap-pointed Special Advocate, Sacramento County Sheriff’s Chaplain for Grant High School, and consultant to Northern California teachers for the Anti-Defamation League. Since moving to her current community of Esparto, Ms. Wil-liams has used her mentoring expertise in co- founding All Leaders Must Serve, a non-profit organization helping young adults pursue ful-filling careers.

It has been Ms. Wil-liams’ vision that has allowed the organization to grow in its ability to serve young adults in Yolo County and make the biggest impact it can for students in the program.

HONORING SERGEANT MAJOR PAUL COLLIER, U.S. ARMY 
HON. STEVEN M. PALAZZO 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 19, 2018 Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the retirement of an outstanding military service member, Sergeant Major Paul L. Collier, Jr. For 40 years, Collier has shown outstanding leadership, professionalism, and technical abil-ity while serving in the Mississippi Army Na-tional Guard. Born in Wurzburg, Germany, Collier began his career at Camp Shelby, then Fort Jackson, South Carolina. Sergeant Major Collier will retire from service at Camp Shelby in his most recent role as Logistics Senior Supply Supervisor of the Joint Forces Training Center. SGM Collier served at home and abroad with great distinction. Deployments included Panama, Italy, and South America, as well as Operations Desert Shield, Desert Storm, Noble Eagle, Enduring Freedom, and Iraqi Freedom. Highly decorated SGM Collier fully engaged in service, earning a collection of awards and decorations too numerous to mention. Among them are the Meritorious Service Medal, Army Commendation Medal (with four Oak Leaf Clusters), Army Achievement Medal (with three Oak Leaf Clusters), and the Armed Forces Service Medal. Educational pursuits have been paramount to SGM Collier’s successful military career. From the Sergeant Majors Academy, NCO courses, Army Combative Instructors Course, Airborne, Battle Skills, Basic Law Enforcement Academy, and Leadership Development, few soldiers rival SGM Collier’s 40-year military education journey. In addition, he also holds a Bachelors’ Degree in Business Management, and is an active member of VFW Post 3036— Hattiesburg, MSNCOA, and EANGUS, Asso-ciation of Quartermasters, and the National In-fantry Association. He is married to the former Paula Stuckey with whom he shares two sons and one daughter-in-law. His numerous accomplishments and exem-plary leadership reflect great credit upon our United States military. It is my honor and privi-lege to recognize Sergeant Major Paul L.

OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 19, 2018 Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sheriff Steve Moore of San Joaquin County Sheriff’s Department and his more than 30 years of outstanding service and com-mitment to public safety in our community. Sheriff Moore grew up in Ventura, Cali-fornia. He began his journey into law enforce-ment as a police explorer at the early age of sixteen. In June 1972 he graduated from Hue-neme High School joining the Oxnard police department as a cadet from shortly thereafter. He then served in the Fresno County Sheriff’s Department as a reserve deputy, starting in 1976. In 1982, Sheriff Steve Moore joined the San Joaquin County Sheriff’s office as a Deputy Sheriff. By 1986, he was sergeant in the cus-tody training unit of San Joaquin County, a po-sition he held until 1990. During his tenure, Moore has been in command of each of the major divisions in the County Sheriff’s Office, including as a Sheriff’s patrol area commander from 1999 to 2002. There he grew in his ca-pacity as a leader, overseeing all private oper-ations. In 2006, he put his considerable lead-ership skills to use and was elected Sheriff in San Joaquin County. Sheriff Steve Moore earned a Bachelor’s Degree in Criminology Law Enforcement Cali-fornia State University Fresno with a single- subject teaching credential. He also graduated from the FBI National Academy, 185th Ses-sion.

Mr. Moore enjoys working, traveling, running, dining with friends, and, above all, spending time with his family. Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring Sheriff Steve Moore for his more than 30 years of service and outstanding contributions to San Joaquin County as well as our country.

INTRODUCTION OF THE PROTEC-TION FROM ALGAL TOXINS ACT 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 19, 2018 Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce a bill to help address the grave threat posed to human health from ingestion of microcystin toxins. Four summers ago, a massive algal bloom exploded in western Lake Erie, which generated microcystin, a cyanobacteria that can cause liver damage, nausea, headaches, and skin blemishes in hu-mans, and is known to be lethal to pets. Just in the last few months, ‘‘do not drink’’ advisories due to microcystin were posted in Salem, Oregon and Rushville, New York. As elected officials, our first priority must al-ways be the safety and health of our constitu-ents. In that vein, this bill moves to ensure microcystin will no longer be a public health threat. This bill amends the Safe Drinking Water Act by specifying that the Environmental Pro-tection Agency (EPA) must make a final deter-mination on a maximum contaminant level goal and to promulgate a national primary drinking water regulation for microcystin toxin. It demands the EPA does this before or by the time the next round of determinations is due, in 2021. I commend the EPA’s work to date to gen-erate a strategic plan for dealing with algal toxins and for publishing an advisory for microcystin. The strategic plan and current health advisory that EPA already released are a good beginning point. But we need a final-ized regulation for the dangerous microcystin that endangers Toledoans every summer with Lake Erie’s recurring algal bloom problem. In addition to the threat they pose to public health, this bacterium casts a huge economic shadow over our vital and beautiful coast. To-ledo’s Water Crisis cost the city government over $200,000 in cleanup costs alone, not counting untold millions in lost business and ultimately lost tax revenue. This concern is not isolated to Lake Erie. Millions of Americans across the country rely on drinking water from natural sources that are similarly threatened by increasing levels of nutrient runoff, and the resulting toxic algal growth. A recent study from USGS showed that algal toxins are present in over 1/3 of all lakes nationwide. Additionally, the EPA recog-nizes harmful algal blooms as a major envi-ronmental problem in all 50 states, with severe impacts on human health. No one should ever have to worry whether the water coming from their tap is unclean or unsafe, no matter if you’re in Toledo, Ohio; Flint, Michigan; Rushville, New York; Salem, Oregon, or anywhere else in America. This bill will make us all safer and I urge my col-leagues to support it. f

TRIBUTE TO PRIVATE FIRST CLASS (PFC) JOHN CALVIN COL-LINS 
HON. WALTER B. JONES 
OF NORTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 19, 2018 Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today to honor the life and legacy of Private First Class (PFC) John Calvin Collins, USA, who was the only Morehead City, North Caro-lina resident to be killed in action in the Viet-nam War. John Calvin Collins was born to John and Della Collins in Morehead City, NC on Novem-ber 14, 1948. He was a product of the public school system and attended W.S. King High School up until his senior year. His final year, however, John was among the first African Americans to integrate West Carteret High School. An exceptional student athlete, he im-mediately received recognition in baseball and lettered in football. In addition to athletics, he was a member of Boy Scouts, Troop #118, where he acquired countless leadership skills. Following a successful year and transition to a new school, John graduated in May of 1967. Shortly after graduation, John registered for the draft on September 15, 1967, and was soon drafted. PFC John Calvin Collins enlisted in the United States Army on October 18, 1967, and reported for active duty the very next day. He received his basic military train-ing at Fort Bragg, North Carolina and contin-ued Advanced Individual Training at Fort Jack-son, South Carolina. The following spring, on May 24, 1968, PFC John Calvin Collins was killed in action as a member of Company B, 1st Battalion, 5th Air Cavalry Division, of the United States Army. Just a few short months after the Tet Offen-sive, PFC Collins became one of the 16,899 Americans in 1968 who paid the ultimate sac-rifice. While he was tragically killed on May 24th, it was not until late August that the Army Casualty Notification Officer was able to notify the Collins family. The military honors provided by the United States Army during the funeral services of PFC John Calvin Collins brought the Vietnam War up close and personal to the town of Morehead City, North Carolina. During his short tenure as a Combat Infantryman, PFC Collins earned the following listed badge and medals: Combat Infantry Badge, Purple Heart Medal, National Defense Medal, Vietnam Service Medal, and Vietnam Campaign Medal. A brave young man, words will never be able to express our gratitude. Upon the 50th year of the anniversary of his passing, I would like to recognize PFC Collins’ ultimate sacrifice to our great nation. PFC John Calvin Collins set an extraordinary exam-ple for all of us to follow through his service and sacrifice, and I am so very proud of this American. John Calvin Collins shall never be forgotten by those who knew him or the citi-zens of Morehead City. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE 107TH NATIONAL DAY OF TAIWAN 
HON. GEORGE HOLDING 
OF NORTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 19, 2018 Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 107th National Day of Taiwan and its relationship with the United States. The United States and Taiwan have enjoyed a prosperous relationship, with our two coun-tries working together in support of enhanced security, trade, and economic prosperity. In 2017, Taiwan was ranked as the 11th largest trading partner of the United States and the 7th largest market for US agricultural products. Numerous jobs in the United States are sup-ported by investment from Taiwan affiliates and by exports of U.S. goods and services to Taiwan. It is clear to me that, as we strength-en our relationship with Taiwan, we succeed in advancing United States interests. People-to-people ties between citizens of the United States and of Taiwan form an im-portant bond between the two nations. There are about 150 sister cities between the United States and Taiwan, connecting our two soci-eties on a global level. In addition, travel for business and pleasure from Taiwan to the United States has increased 50 percent since Taiwan became a member of the U.S. Visa Waiver Program in November 2012. Addition-ally, Taiwanese students represent a signifi-cant demographic of international students studying in the United States. The formational policies for the United States’ relationship with Taiwan, the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances, were crafted almost four decades ago, and continue to be the foundation of this bilateral relation-ship. The people-to-people engagement and mutually beneficial commercial transactions are the mortar that fortifies the relationship. Today I remind my colleagues that we have a valuable ally in Taiwan.

TRIBUTE TO THE MARCO POLO FESTIVAL 
HON. NYDIA M. VELA´ZQUEZ

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my congratulations to the Marco Polo Festival, as it celebrates its 10th anniver-sary on October 20, 2018. As a celebration of culture and heritage, the Marco Polo festivities around New York City remind us of the contributions of these two historical communities of immigrants and their joint history. Through the story of Marco Polo traversing the Silk Road, we can draw par-allels to New York City’s own vibrant history, including the shared experiences of Chinese and Italian immigrants coming to the U.S. and the establishment of a historic district cele-brating both cultures. Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratu-lating the Marco Polo Festival and its leader-ship, the Marco Polo Festival Committee and Two Bridges Neighborhood Council, on this special 10-year anniversary. These dedicated individuals exemplify outstanding leadership through their public service to the community. I wish the Marco Polo Festival continued suc-cess in many more years of service. f

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 19, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Heidi Shelton as woman of the year. She is a caring community advocate with a passion for providing resources to those in need.

Throughout her many years of service, Ms. Shelton has aided the people of Sutter County with fair-ness and dedication, proving her willingness and ability to provide quality and exceptional service.

the residents who call her ‘‘home.’’ Most Mis-sissippians have a warrior spirit, a tenacity, a willingness to do whatever it takes to live and nurture each other with compassion and inten-tional care. These qualities embody one of Mississippi’s youngest and most determined warriors—ten-year-old Emma Hartley. Emma was born August 2, 2008, missing a heart valve. Less than 24 hours after her birth, Emma underwent the first of what would be-come many surgeries. Perhaps it was an in-nate fighting spirit and a purpose to persevere for the sake of loving others that brought Emma and her heart safely through that first critical surgery. Perhaps she knew then that she would need to grow strong and develop a voice to encourage others to face tough bat-tles with a smile. Perhaps it is simply that God has big plans for this little girl. What is known is that Mississippi’s Gulf Coast is blessed by Emma’s heart, beating now for over 10 years, and Emma’s desire to make a difference in the lives of those facing similar health chal-lenges. Emma has outlived the expectations of many of her doctors, and she will soon under-go her fifth surgery. Before age 18, she is like-ly to face several more; but, she endures each procedure with courage and grace. From an early age, Emma participated with her mom, Lisa Northrup, in fundraising efforts such as Rock Your Scar, the March of Dimes, Mended Little Hearts, and the Heart Walk for the Amer-ican Heart Association. Now, with the support of family, friends, and her church, Emma champions her own efforts, working hard to raise funds, give speeches, and boost aware-ness of these causes in her local commu-nities. Crafting and creating artwork, two of Emma’s hobbies, are incorporated into her philanthropic efforts, too. For one of her fund-raisers this year Emma sold handcrafted wood signs, some of which were ordered from far away. Also, Emma’s artwork has been repro-duced in awards given to the top Heart Walk high achievers. This year’s Gulf Coast Heart Walk is on September 22. Emma will offer the opening prayer to start the event. Mississippi is fortu-nate to have such a brave, talented, ambi-tious, and inspiring warrior, like Emma Hartley.

COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF BISHOP JAMES WALKER HOOD ON THE ONE HUNDREDTH ANNI-VERSARY OF HIS PASSING 
HON. G.K. BUTTERFIELD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 19, 2018 Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the legendary Bishop James Walker Hood on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of his passing. Bishop Hood is credited with establishing the North Carolina African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church Con-ference, the Prince Hall Masons of North Carolina, and Livingstone College, all in my home state of North Carolina. On May 30, 1831, James Walker Hood was born to Levi and Harriet Walker Hood on the farm of Ephraim Jackson in Chester County, Pennsylvania, nine miles from Wilmington, Delaware. Hood’s parents instilled their love of the church and a spirit to help fellow African Americans improve their lives in their twelve children. Hood’s father was a Methodist min-ister and his work moved the family around the country as he served various churches. Together, Hood’s parents became involved in the AME Zion church, established as the Methodist church for Blacks. Upon coming of age, James Walker Hood’s moral and religious convictions led him into ministry. In 1856, Hood secured his license to preach from the New York Conference of the AME Zion Church. In the following years, Hood moved to Connecticut and Nova Scotia to preach and work as a missionary. In early 1864, following the path of the Union Army, Hood was appointed to missionary work in North Carolina, recognizing that legal slavery would soon end. He would then stay in North Carolina for the remainder of his life. Although Hood was met with strong opposi-tion in establishing the North Carolina Con-ference of AME Zion Church for African Amer-icans, he persuaded the Black Southern Meth-odist congregations in New Bern and Beaufort, North Carolina to affiliate with the AME Zion Church. Among the more than 300 churches he successfully established in North Carolina are St. Peter’s AME Zion Church (New Bern), Evans Metropolitan AME Zion Church (Fay-etteville), and St. John AME Zion Church (Wil-son). After becoming a Presiding Bishop in 1872, Bishop James Walker Hood resided in Fay-etteville until his death on October 30, 1918. He is interred in Cross Creek Cemetery in Fayetteville. Hood helped establish Zion Wes-ley Institute, now Livingstone College, in Salis-bury, North Carolina to train African American students for the ministry and to become pro-ductive citizens in North Carolina. He presided over the school’s board of trustees for over thirty years. Bishop Hood was politically active on behalf of his people. In 1865, he presided over the first statewide political convention for African Americans. In 1868, he participated in the state constitutional convention, which abol-ished slavery, provided universal male suf-frage, and established free public education for all children. He also held several govern-ment positions, including magistrate and as-sistant superintendent of the North Carolina Freedman’s Bureau. Bishop Hood was a man of courage, convic-tion, and persistence. He was unwavering in his commitment to the cause of Christianity and the establishment of the AME Zion Church in North Carolina. It is remarkable that Bishop Hood, who had little formal education, would publish five books, including The Negro in the Christian Pulpit (1884) and Sketch of the Early History of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church (1914). Mr. Speaker, by the grace of God, Bishop James Walker Hood left an indelible mark on North Carolina that is still recognized one hun-dred years after his passing on October 30, 1918. On behalf of the people of the First Con-gressional District of North Carolina, ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Bishop James Walker Hood’s life, work, and legacy on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of his passing. HONORING ROBERT HOOKS HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 19, 2018 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the House of Representatives to join me in recognizing Robert ‘‘Bobby’’ Dean Hooks, a native of the District of Columbia, for his life-time of empowering African Americans in the arts and for his contributions to race relations in the District. Robert Hooks’ lifelong passion for theater began at the age of nine with his first play, The Pirates of Penzance. He later honed his stagecraft at West Philadelphia High in clas-sical works by playwrights such as William Shakespeare and Samuel Beckett. In 1959, Mr. Hooks pursued acting professionally in New York City with works such as Lorraine Hansberry’s A Raisin in the Sun and LeRoi Jones/Amiri Baraka’s Dutchman in his rep-ertoire. Mr. Hooks simultaneously launched his award-winning television career with his groundbreaking role as the first African Amer-ican lead on the original N.Y.P.D. series. He is recognized for his over 100 roles in film and television in a career that spanned over 40 years. During his time in New York City, Mr. Hooks also started the Group Theater Workshop and the Negro Ensemble Company, both of which offered free training in the arts to underprivi-leged New York City youth. Following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Mr. Hooks returned to the city of his birth—a move he made after meeting with radio host Petey Greene and then-City Administrator Walter E. Washington about the riots of 1968, which had engulfed the District. In 1970, Mr. Hooks unveiled his plans for the DC Black Repertory Company, an all-black theater company in the District, as part of a plan to harness what he believed to be the so-cially transformative power of theater. Mr. Hooks executed his plan in partnership with D.C.-area black theater professionals and students at Howard University. The DC Black Repertory Company directly contributed to re-ducing community tensions during those tu-multuous times. The group produced more than 20 plays, telling black stories that had not been told. The DC Black Repertory Company was dissolved in 1976, but its legacy con-tinues through The Rep, Inc. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Represent-atives to join me in recognizing Robert Hooks for his lasting artistic and social contributions to the African American community and to the District of Columbia.

Serving two separate terms as the President of the Soroptimist International of Dixon, Mary Lou Batchelor has worked tire-lessly to advance the status of women and girls, continually advocating for equality and opportunity. She also served as chair of the Soroptimist’s countless events, programs, local projects, and fundraisers. She has been instrumental in bringing positive and significant changes to her community.

Her passion for volunteerism in the community is evident in her role at the League of Women Voters, helping to encour-age and engage women in the community to become informed voters. She currently is in-volved in the city of Dixon’s Volunteer Pro-gram in which she will be assisting agencies such as the Police Department, Fire House, or City Hall when needed. Mary Lou is hard- working, responsible, compassionate, and an effective community leader who truly cares about her community and embodies all the qualities of a true public servant.

IN MEMORY OF BENJAMIN MARIO BELTRAMO

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 19, 2018 Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today along with Congressman J
IMMY  P
ANETTA to honor the life and memory of Ben-jamin Mario Beltramo who recently passed away. Ben was the middle child of five born to Mario and Linda Beltramo. He grew up in Fresno where he attended catholic schools throughout his lower education. Upon grad-uating from high school, Ben decided to follow in his father’s footsteps and attend the Univer-sity of Notre Dame, where he majored in English. After completing his undergraduate studies, Ben again followed in his father’s foot-steps and chose to become a lawyer by gain-ing entrance into Berkeley’s prestigious Boalt Hall School of Law. Soon thereafter, Ben ac-cepted a job with the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office, to begin after completing a clerkship with a federal court judge in southern California. On November 12, 2002, Ben officially began serving the citizens of Alameda County and the State of California as a Deputy District At-torney. He joined his brother Matt there, who in part had inspired him to join the District At-torney’s Office. In less than a year, Ben’s work ethic, intelligence and commitment to justice was recognized when Ben was asked to sit second chair on a high-profile case involving corruption in a local police department. Ben impressed not only the Senior District Attorney assigned to the case but gained the respect of the defense attorneys and the judge presiding over the case. Ben played an active role in the prosecution of that case and was subse-quently assigned to the Felony Trial Team at the Rene C. Davidson Courthouse in Oakland. During his career, Ben held a variety of impor-tant assignments; specifically, he was as-signed to the Law and Motion division, the Strike Team which targeted dangerous felons within the City of Oakland, and Felony Trial Staff on three separate occasions. He also headed the Narcotics Task Force, and on No-vember 22, 2013, was assigned to the Ala-meda County Gang Team. He served on the Gang Team until his untimely death. An effective trial lawyer is equal parts effort, determination, intelligence and charm. In all of these aspects, Ben excelled. Even before his untimely passing, Ben was often described as ‘‘the best of us’’ by many of his friends and colleagues. Ben successfully handled several high-profile cases as a trial lawyer. In August 2006, Ben obtained a guilty verdict in the bru-tal beating death of a homeless woman in Berkeley. In February 2010, Ben prosecuted the murder of a 17-year-old young man who was tragically killed a short time before he was scheduled to attend the University of Or-egon on a football scholarship. In May 2014, Ben prosecuted two gang members respon-sible for the fatal shooting of three-year-old victim Carlos Nava. Ben treated victims and their families, defense attorneys and their cli-ents and the process with the utmost profes-sionalism. Even with the professional accolades and quiet contentment Ben received from his ac-complishments, he would argue, and convince everyone, that his real success was in his per-sonal life. On October 7, 2006, Ben married his amazing wife Shara Mesic Beltramo. The two of them met at work as Shara was also a Deputy District Attorney. Ben often remarked how lucky he was to have found Shara. From their union, Mateo, age 8, and Luke, age 6, were born. Anyone who saw Ben with his boys knew that he had no greater joy than being a father. Ben loved spending time with his family and was always the proud father and husband. In addition to all of these re-markable qualities, Ben was a bit of a renais-sance man. He really enjoyed the outdoors and working with his hands. He worked dili-gently to remodel his family home, removing and replacing most of the woodwork in the house, as well as installing skylights in his master bedroom. Making his and Shara’s house a home was foremost among Ben’s many goals. On October 8, 2018, Benjamin Beltramo’s family, the citizens of Alameda County and ev-eryone touched by Ben’s life, suffered a tre-mendous loss. Despite this loss, we are made better by having known Ben.

HONORING CHIEF KEN ARNOLD 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 19, 2018 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Chief Ken Arnold, on his retirement as the Chief of Police for Napa Val-ley College in Napa, California. Chief Arnold was born in Orlando, Florida and raised in the Los Angeles and San Fran-cisco areas. In 1983 he graduated from Napa Valley College with two Associate of Science degrees in Law Enforcement and Private Se-curity. Chief Arnold also earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Business Administration from Saint Mary’s College of California in 1991. From 1979 to 1997 he served in the Army Re-serve and was honorably discharged as a Ser-geant First Class. Chief Arnold has served Napa Valley Col-lege as Chief of Police since 1990. He also is the head of parking services and emergency management, among many other responsibil-ities that are essential to keeping the students and college safe. Chief Arnold is an adjunct professor at the Napa Valley College Criminal Justice Training Center. He teaches first aid for law enforcement, cultural awareness, emergency management and campus law en-forcement, among other courses. In addition, Chief Arnold coordinates the Napa Valley Col-lege police academy and in-service training programs. Since 1989, he has also taught emergency preparedness and trained other in-structors for the Napa County Community Emergency Response Team training program. During the October 2017 wildfires, Chief Ar-nold displayed incredible leadership and great-ly assisted our community. He set up a tem-porary shelter at Napa Valley College for fire evacuees when the fire first broke out and in-cluded a kennel for displaced animals. At the college, Chief Arnold led the coordination of emergency operations, community donations, distribution of food and clothing, staff shift management and volunteers. Chief Arnold has held numerous leadership roles. He is the former president of the Cali-fornia College and University Police Chiefs As-sociation and Napa and Solano County Train-ing Managers Association and was Board Chairman of the Napa chapter of the Amer-ican Red Cross. He has also served on the board of Saint John’s Lutheran School. Mr. Speaker, Chief Arnold is an admirable leader who is dedicated to serving and pro-tecting our community. It is therefore fitting and proper that we honor Chief Ken Arnold here today. f

TRIBUTE TO WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY 
HON. BRENDA L. LAWRENCE 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 19, 2018 Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today along with my colleagues, Representatives D
EBBIE DINGELL , PAULMITCHELL , MIKEBISHOP , S
ANDER LEVIN, DANIEL KILDEE , FRED UPTON , J
OHN MOOLENAAR , and J ACKBERGMAN to rec- ognize Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, on the occasion of its 150th—or sesquicentennial—celebration. Located in the heart of Detroit, Wayne State University is ranked among our nation’s best research insti-tutions, educates over 27,000 students among 13 schools and colleges, and is the eighth- largest employer in the city of Detroit. In addition to educating and training leaders in research, the arts, law, and medicine, Wayne State University has for over 150 years, consistently served the people of De-troit, the great state of Michigan, and our na-tion. Wayne State University began, and has remained, in Detroit—a city that has seen the highest heights and the deepest depths, and is now reinventing the very definition of the great American city. Through the tireless work and effort of its first university president, Dr. Edward W. Jenks, to the current president Dr. M. Roy Wil-son, Wayne State University is the embodi-ment of public service and access to edu-cation. Under the direction of Dr. Wilson, Wayne State University has dramatically in-creased its overall six-year graduation rate, with African American graduation rates double what they were just a few years ago. Today, Wayne State University attracts, and is com-posed of, many of the best and brightest stu-dents and researchers, with an excellent team of administration, faculty, and staff profes-sionals. They remain firmly rooted in the com-munity while preparing their diverse student body to impact locally and globally making the university a thriving hub of innovation and aca-demia. Wayne State University has also cemented its status as a leading research institution and a champion for women and children in our na-tion. In fact, Wayne State University is the only site outside of Bethesda, Maryland, that houses a branch of the National Institutes of Health. Thanks to the Perinatology Research Branch, over 20,000 women, children, and families have received access to world-class prenatal health care that they might not have otherwise been able to access. Through the Integrative Biosciences Center (IBio), the University is reimagining the way science approaches urban health issues. IBio was named the 2017 Renovated Laboratory of the Year by R&D Magazine and Laboratory Design. This 127,000-square-foot, $90 million facility is dedicated to studying and eliminating the many health disparities that plague resi-dents of Detroit and communities across the country. IBio includes faculty with expertise in environmental sciences, bio and systems engi-neering, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, asth-ma, and bio-behavioral health. Opened this fall, the Mike Ilitch School of Business, further expands the Wayne State campus into The District Detroit while adding academic pro-grams in the business of sports and entertain-ment. The mission of Wayne State University is to create and advance knowledge, prepare a di-verse student body to thrive, and positively im-pact local and global communities. We con-gratulate and thank Wayne State University’s student body, Board of Governors, President M. Roy Wilson, faculty and administrators for living out the passion and principle of their mission statement. Reaching their 150th anni-versary is a milestone, and we eagerly look forward to what the University accomplishes in its next 150 years. Wayne State University has been, is and will always be Warrior Strong.

IN RECOGNITION OF MS. IRENE WHITLEY MARCUS 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 19, 2018 Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a civil rights hero in the greater Kansas City area for her dedication and determination to ensuring the success of the African Amer-ican community through equality and oppor-tunity. Since the mid-twentieth century, Ms. Irene Whitley Marcus has worked feverishly to demolish anti-Black sentiments and discrimi-natory policies, in order to create accessible housing in the Kansas City community. During a time when segregation laws disproportion-ately afflicted Black Americans and civil unrest persisted, Ms. Marcus held firm to her belief that all of America’s children were deserving of the liberties and rights guaranteed under the constitution, regardless of their skin tone. Through her memories and experiences, the history of the Black community in Kansas City is preserved and respected. World War II pro-vided many Black families an opportunity for upward social mobility in the workforce and created the opportunity for minorities to pur-chase homes. Ms. Marcus tells of a time when Black businesses were rare and social life ex-isted only in Black American homes due to

segregation laws that prohibited Blacks from eating at restaurants, attending clubs, and seeing movies in theatres. In an era when Black Americans worked twice as hard for subpar housing and employ-ment, Ms. Marcus never gave up the fight for equality and opportunity. After a long day of work in 1958, she could be found amongst protesters, picketing the racist segregation policies that were commonplace during the time. For two months, she continued to chal-lenge the current system as a member of the Twin Citians Social Club alongside the Com-munity Committee for Social Action, until three establishments caved into their demands and banned segregation. The butterfly effect of this united front had begun. Many more establish-ments followed suit to remove such policies, and in 1963 Black activists in the city pushed to pass an ordinance effectively banning dis-crimination practices in all establishments available to the public. Ms. Marcus’s vigilance opened doors for job-seeking Black Americans and allowed her to build the home she still lives in to this day. The Kansas City ordinance banning discrimi-nation predated the Civil Rights Act, though it was not until the Act was passed that hun-dreds of Black Americans truly began to exer-cise their newly granted rights. She has seen her neighborhood, commu-nity, and city progress and continues to pro-vide first-hand knowledge of the hardships many Black Americans endured and continue to face. Currently, Ms. Marcus is in posses-sion of the largest photo collection of historic Black Kansas City. Her noteworthy contribu-tions to establishments such as The Black Ar-chives of Mid-America, the Kansas City Star, and the State Historical Society of Missouri have immortalized the hard work of countless Black civil rights activists. The entire district, myself included, is grateful to have such a de-voted and determined social justice advocate in our community. Mr. Speaker, please join me and all of Mis-souri’s Fifth Congressional District in honoring Ms. Irene Whitley Marcus for her commitment to social justice and her historic contributions to the Black community both in Kansas City and nationwide. It is with great respect that I urge all my colleagues and fellow citizens across the country to join me in showing our appreciation to Ms. Marcus for her unwavering dedication to protect Black history and civil rights.

HONORING MARYAH STOOTS WITH CALIFORNIA’S THIRD DISTRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 19, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Maryah Stoots as a woman of the year. She is a parent advocate with a heart of service and a strong desire to help others. She is Vice President of the Williams Parent Teacher Organization where she fundraises for school spirit wear and educational pro-grams. She was instrumental in the introduc-tion of Learning Dynamics, an early learning reading program designed to promote child-hood and family literacy. She is also a parent representative on the elementary school Site Council, a coalition of teachers, parents and employees who work closely with the school principal to develop, review, and evaluate school improvement efforts. She has been successful in securing funding from the Colusa Board of Supervisors for playground improve-ments and bringing the National Archery in School Programs to Williams Unified Schools. Above all, Ms. Stoots played a very important role in advocating for the implementation of a bullying prevention program to the elementary school in Williams. Outside of work, she volun-teers for the Little League where you will often find her working the snack bar, pounding nails on the bleachers, or assisting with mainte-nance efforts. In 2016, Ms. Stoots was elected President of Citizens for a Better Williams, a non-profit focused on promoting community improvements. Whether she is fundraising for childhood education programs or volunteering in the community, Maryah Stoots exemplifies the qualities of selfless service and embodies the qualities of a public servant. f 
HONORING THE EXCEPTIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF RICHARD MAHACEK 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 19, 2018 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the career and achievements of Richard Mahacek, a longtime Merced resident. His 35 years of shaping the character of the Merced County 4–H community as well as his national leadership in developing curricula for 4–H youth have earned him a spot in the 4–H Hall of Fame. Mahacek’s lifelong commitment to in-stilling values such as working together and experiential learning has made immeasurable positive impacts on our Merced community. Beginning when he was 10 years old, Mahacek’s involvement as a 4–H youth mem-ber included participating in projects in elec-tricity, woodworking, and raising cattle. He also worked on his family farm and managed a 120-home newspaper route for six years. Using money made from his paper route, Mahacek earned a bachelor’s degree in indus-trial arts at San Jose State University in 1974. Following graduation, he chose to pursue a career that allowed him to give back to the 4– H community that had given him so much. In 1976, Mahacek was named the 4–H Youth Development Advisor for Merced County. Mahacek made his most notable contribu-tions to 4–H in the field of science. His en-gagement with the youth and his development of curricula and activities in science proc-esses, robotics, computers, GIS/GPS, bio-se-curity, and environmental issues have played a critical part in the development of 4–H. He was a member of the team that developed the 4–H Science Experiences and Resources for Informal Educational Settings (SERIES) cur-riculum. SERIES was the first science edu-cation curriculum to join 4–H’s traditional projects. In 2004, Mahacek served on the na-tional leadership team for 4–H Science, Engi-neering, and Technology (SET), a project which aims to stoke young people’s interest in developing the knowledge and skills nec-essary for the 21st Century’s technically-ori-ented careers. Mahacek has received distinguished service awards from the state and national 4–H asso-ciations. The Merced County Farm City Ag Business Committee presented him with its ‘‘Agri-Education Award’’ in 1992. In addition, Mahacek received the ‘‘Hands-On Heroes Award’’ at the Merced County Children’s sum-mit. On October 19, Mahacek was inducted into the 4–H Hall of Fame in recognition of his outstanding citizenship, leadership, character, and career accomplishments. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring Richard Mahacek for his dedi-cation and service over the past 4 decades. He has made a real difference and left a re-markable impact on Merced County and the congressional district I have the honor of rep-resenting. I wish Richard and his family contin-ued health and happiness. f 
RECOGNIZING MALNUTRITION AWARENESS WEEK 2018 
HON. JOYCE BEATTY 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 19, 2018 Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to ob-serve Malnutrition Awareness Week which was September 24 through 28, 2018. Access to proper nutrition is critical for all Americans, especially our seniors. Every 60 seconds, ten hospitalized patients with mal-nutrition go undiagnosed, and many of these patients are older adults. The malnutrition awareness outreach effort is a step in the right direction to defeat this problem that plagues vulnerable populations. Malnutrition Awareness Week is a multi-or-ganizational, multi-pronged effort created by the American Society for Parenteral and En-teral Nutrition to: educate healthcare profes-sionals to identify and treat malnutrition earlier; educate consumers and patients about the need to discuss their nutrition status with healthcare professionals; and increase aware-ness of nutrition’s role in patient recovery. The Malnutrition Awareness Week cam-paign also highlights the need to focus on common-sense solutions that can close the care gap, thereby helping to reduce premature morbidity and mortality as well as hospitaliza-tions, re-admissions and other variables that may increase the cost of care. We can begin by measuring the scope of the problem and by adding metrics for older adult malnutrition to national dietary guidelines. I believe increasing awareness will help our nation educate fami-lies and help seniors live healthier lives for years to come.

Dr. Freeman was appointed by the NIU Board on September 20, 2018, to serve as the university’s 13th president and first woman president—lucky number 13. As a proud NIU alum, earning my PhD in political science from NIU in 2004, I’m excited to welcome Dr. Freeman to her new, and fi-nally, official role. She previously served as acting president since July 2017. Dr. Freeman has dedicated her career to the promotion of social excellence and en-gagement in teaching and learning, research and scholarship, creativity and artistry, and outreach and service. I have no doubt that her inspiring nature and example will surely lead NIU to greater heights under her steadfast and visionary leadership. Her commitment to the academic excellence of the students and faculty at NIU will maintain NIU’s leadership as a world-class institution. Throughout her career, Dr. Freeman has fos-tered an inclusive learning environment where students and faculty can live, grow and thrive. As a proud NIU alum, I can recount the mo-ments throughout my educational journey where men and women, like Dr. Freeman, helped pave a way for me and others to suc-ceed, in the classroom, in our careers and in life. In my current role as the Congresswoman for Illinois’ 2nd District, it encourages me to see the broad-spectrum collaboration and par-ticipation underway at NIU, from science and mathematics to political science, business and the arts. My office and constituents have certainly benefitted from the great educational experi-ence available at NIU. In fact, a number of my current and former staffers and interns are all NIU alums, and they work hard every day to serve the great people of the 2nd Congres-sional District. As our institutions of higher learning face 21st century challenges, I know that NIU, under Dr. Freeman’s leadership, will rise up and not only meet but also exceed these chal-lenges. In particular, Dr. Freeman’s own personal examples as a barrier-breaking researcher in the STEM field will certainly inspire many young people to find their own place and path in the dynamic, growing and innovative STEM fields. As a proud Husky, it’s my honor to welcome Dr. Freeman as the 13th President of Northern Illinois University. I am confident that under her leadership, NIU will continue to flourish as an innovative and world-leading, student-cen-tered, research-focused public university. Welcome once again and go Huskies.

HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 19, 2018 Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Ms. Natalie Audage as a woman of the year. She is committed to serving her community through her career as a Child Abuse Prevention Coordinator for Yolo County Children’s Alliance. Her down-to-earth and en-gaging personality and commitment to profes-sionalism enable her to bridge divides and af-fect positive change in social service sectors in Yolo County. Through her work, Ms. Audage produces a guide of resources that aims to prevent child abuse by providing par-ents and caregivers with skills that encourage healthy interactions with their children. As a coordinator of Yolo County Children’s Alli-ance’s Family Strengthening Network, she spearheaded the effort to train collaborative providers on the World Cafe´model, an initia-tive which brings parents, leaders, educators, agency staff, and students together to pursue improvements in county systems. This model ensures that people of all communities are reached and offered the opportunity to reach their potential and thrive. Ms. Audage also worked for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, where she researched and produced resources related to violence prevention and the adverse effects of child abuse across the lifespan. She brings this expertise to her work fighting for families in Yolo County. She is a passionate and dedi-cated advocate for children and is leaving an indelible mark on Child Abuse Prevention in Yolo County. I commend Natalie Audage for her passion and commitment to keeping chil-dren safe and in healthy family environments. f 
SCARSDALE VOLUNTEER FIRE COMPANY NO. 1 125TH ANNIVER-SARY 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 19, 2018 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, first responders are the heroes of our local communities. We in the 16th Congressional District of New York are fortunate to have had the Scarsdale Vol-unteer Fire Company No. 1 for the past 125 years, and I want to honor them on reaching that amazing milestone. Established in 1893, the Scarsdale Volun-teer Fire Department No. 1 started with a handful of dedicated volunteers as they hooked a couple of horses to a wagon at-tached with fire extinguishers, and were with-out a fire station until the following year. Now, the Scarsdale Volunteer Fire Company is one of three fire stations throughout the Village of Scarsdale comprised of 47 career members and 70 volunteer firefighters across 3 different fire stations. In 2016 alone, the Scarsdale Fire Depart-ment responded to 1,499 alarms, which in-cluded 42 structure fires, 139 motor vehicle accidents and victim rescues, 268 hazardous condition requests, and 258 public assistance calls. The skill and professionalism of the Scarsdale firefighters is evident in their aver-age response time of 3 to 4 minutes per emer-gency. This has made the Scarsdale Fire De-partment one of the best in Westchester County, and within the top 10 percent of fire departments in New York State. I want to commend Fire Chief James E. Seymour IV for his outstanding leadership as well as all the career firefighters and volunteer firefighters who dedicate their time and service for protecting the Scarsdale community. Mr. Speaker, every community unknowingly relies on the dedicated service of unsung he-roes. The Village of Scarsdale is fortunate to have the amazing first responders of the Scarsdale Volunteer Fire Company protecting them for over a century. f

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 19, 2018 Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the National Adoption Day cele-bration that will take place in Ector County on November 16th at the Crossroads Fellowship Church. Throughout the day, local courts in Ector County will finalize the adoption process for families in the community. It is no coincidence that National Adoption Awareness Month falls in the same month of Thanksgiving. During this time of year, we re-flect on the many blessings in our lives, such as family. Our families play an instrumental role in our lives by helping shape our char-acter, providing unconditional love, motivating us through challenging times, and giving us a lifetime of memories that we will always cher-ish. Sadly, over 100,000 children are waiting to find their permanent home. Many of these chil-dren have various medical, developmental, and emotional needs that require special nur-turing from parents and families. Our world is fortunate enough to be blessed by people who open their hearts and homes to these children. These selfless individuals provide an important service not only to these children, but also to our communities and country. These new families hold a special place in my heart because I am adopted myself. My fa-ther adopted my little brother, sister, and me, so seeing other children who have the benefit of a loving family warms my heart. I want to thank the Court Appointed Special Advocates of the Permian Basin and other adoption organizations across the nation that make National Adoption Day possible. I also want to thank the dedicated individuals who make a powerful difference in the lives of chil-dren through adoption.

Among the many services they provide include early childhood education, public policy advo-cacy, and community outreach. First 5 Madera County has been a com-mitted partner to many community groups, working toward prevention and early interven-tion systems that promote optimal health and development for infants and toddlers. Partner-ships such as First 5 and Madera County Workforce have been essential in supporting families with young children to ensure access to professional opportunities that will help them further develop their social emotional learning and family support. In twenty years, First 5 has increased public participation and efforts to bring awareness to issues affecting families and their children. They have focused on the elimination of per-sistent disparities in the community. Dedicated staff and volunteers have also created edu-cational workshops for underserved families to help them have the tools necessary for suc-cess. In recent years, First 5 Madera County has continued to demonstrate its independent leadership while recognizing the value of es-tablishing meaningful partnerships. They have succeeded in educating the public on the im-portance of child advocacy, further developing research issues affecting infants and toddlers and promoted health and education for young children. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring First 5 Madera County on the occasion of their 20th anniversary. I look forward to the opportunity to continue to work together to further First 5 Madera County’s mission. Once again, con-gratulations on this special milestone.

IN RECOGNITION OF ROBERTO S. JUAREZ AND HIS 40 YEARS OF SERVICE TO CLINICAS DEL CA-MINO REAL, INC. 
HON. JULIA BROWNLEY 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 19, 2018 Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Roberto S. Juarez, one of Ventura County’s most notable leaders and engaged citizens, on the momentous occasion of celebrating his 40th anniversary as Chief Executive Officer of Clinicas del Camino Real, Inc. Throughout these four decades, Roberto has been tremendously effective and abso-lutely indispensable in serving as a voice for those who are underserved by our healthcare system. With Roberto at the helm, Clinicas del Camino Real, Inc. has provided quality, inte-grated, and comprehensive health care serv-ices at 13 locations in Ventura County that are accessible to the least advantaged in our com-munity. Roberto is a man that came from very hum-ble means. As a son of immigrants from Mex-ico, he was the first in his family to attend col-lege. He studied business administration, re-ceiving degrees from the University of Cali-fornia, Los Angeles and California Lutheran University. Roberto’s tenacity and ability to overcome obstacles played an instrumental role in all of his achievements. Roberto has not only distinguished himself as a highly regarded citizen in our community, but also as a model and courageous patriot of our nation. From 1966 through 1970, Roberto served in the United States Army’s elite Ready Reactionary Force. After serving courageously and with distinction in Vietnam from December 1966 to December 1967, Roberto was award-ed the Bronze Star, the Combat Infantry Badge, the Meritorious Service Medal for out-standing admirable achievement, and the Pur-ple Heart. These awards reflect credit upon him and are in the keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Army. Roberto maintained his commitment to com-munity by obtaining a position as an adminis-trator at Ventura County Hospital shortly after being discharged from his military service. Soon thereafter, he assumed the role as Chief Executive Officer of Clinicas del Camino Real, Inc., which, at the time, consisted of only five employees while serving 1,300 patients a year. Roberto’s unparalleled vision, leadership, and desire to bring quality and affordable care to the residents of Ventura County quickly ex-panded the non-profit to a staff of well over 700 that now serve countless of patients over 370,000 visits a year.

HON. MARK WALKER 
OF NORTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 19, 2018 Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 50th anniversary of Cox Toyota in Burlington, North Carolina.

professional experience. She earned her Bachelor of Fine Arts from Carnegie Mellon University, where she met her husband, a vet-eran of World War II and the Korean War. Alongside her husband, Mrs. Turnbull raised two accomplished children who excel in their work, volunteer in their communities, and de-vote time to their families. She taught her chil-dren by example.

Mrs. Turnbull is also an educa-tor whose career has spanned 60 years. She has taught at a wide variety of schools across the country and within the California State Uni-versity system. She had the honor of being featured as a Multiple Year Honoree in the na-tional edition of ‘‘Who’s Who Among America’s Teachers.’’ She also devotes time to her com-munity by serving as the Chairwoman of the Orland Arts Commission and the Gallery Di-rector for the Orland Arts Center where she uses her many artistic talents to teach others.

HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 19, 2018 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the career achievements of Ms. Lilia Gonzales Chavez. Lilia is being honored by Arte Americas with the Armando Rodriguez Legacy Award, in honor of her dedication and commitment to the preservation of the arts of California’s Central Valley. This award is given to a person who has broken barriers in civil rights, education, and/or the promotion of the arts to the broader community and selflessly promoted the advancement of the underrep-resented. It is both fitting and appropriate that we honor Lilia today for her years of service to our Valley. Lilia, a native of Fresno, attended California State University, Fresno and obtained her Bachelor of Arts degree in Child Development and a master’s degree in Administrative Lead-ership from Fresno Pacific University. In 1987, Lilia co-founded Arte Americas and for nearly ten years served as their director. Arte Americas is currently the Valley’s largest non-profit Latino Cultural Center. After her time at Arte Americas, Lilia took on a new challenge. In 2011, she was appointed as the Executive Director of the Fresno Arts Council. Lilia has also served on the board of the Fres-no Art Museum, the board of the Fresno Arts Council and is a key member of the League of Mexican-American Women in Fresno where she serves as Chairperson of the Scholarship Committee. Lilia has worked as an educator at Fresno City College where she taught child develop-ment and psychology. Lilia also worked with the County of Fresno as an Administrative An-alyst and Coordinator of the Inter-Agency Council for Children and Families, where she assisted many underserved communities throughout Fresno County. An achievement that Lilia is most proud of was being appointed by Governor Jerry Brown to serve as a Trustee on the Board for Cali-fornia State Summer School for the Arts, serv-ing on the Dean’s Advisory Council for the De-partment of Arts and Humanities at California State University, Fresno and the California State University Summer Arts Advisory Board. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me today in honoring Mrs. Lilia Gonzales Cha-vez for receiving the Armando Rodriguez Leg-acy Award. Lilia has been an inspiration, not only through her professional achievements, but also through the community leadership throughout the years. I ask that you join me in wishing Lilia and her family continued success and prosperity.
