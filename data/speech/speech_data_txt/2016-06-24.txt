OUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , June 23, 2016. Hon. P
AULRYAN, Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. D
EAR MR. SPEAKER : Upon reflection, I hereby make official my resignation from the U.S. House of Representatives effective immediately. In my previous letter I indicated a later resignation date in order to provide for an orderly transition of my office after 21 years of service in the House. However, out of re-spect for the entire House Leadership, and so as not to cause a distraction from the House’s work for the people, I have changed my effective date. I am proud of the work we have accom-plished during my tenure in the House, as we have passed legislation that has helped tens of millions of families. Through GEAR UP more than 12 million young people have been able to achieve their dream of a college edu-cation; hundreds of thousands of families were able to stave off foreclosure because of the Homeowner’s Emergency Relief Fund; across the nation new policies at all levels of government have been established to ensure all children have access to a high-quality education as a result of the work from the Equity and Excellence Commission; local and state governments have implemented comprehensive energy efficiency policies be-cause of the Energy Efficiency and Conserva-tion Block Grant Program; and most impor-tantly, millions who suffer from brain re-lated diseases have a renewed sense of hope for a cure or treatment because of the groundbreaking work being conducted under the Fattah Neuroscience Initiative and the President’s BRAIN Initiative. As a result of my work in Congress tens of thousands of families throughout the Phila-delphia region now live in affordable revital-ized housing; major investments have been in the city’s infrastructure; and millions of dollars have been invested in K–12 education and University research and outreach ef-forts. None of my success in the Congress would have been possible without the bipartisan support of my colleagues; the hard and dedi-cated work of my staff; the votes of the citi-zens of the Second Congressional District; and the strong support of my family. I am honored to have had the privilege to serve. Very truly yours, C
HAKA FATTAH , Member of Congress.

CONGRATULATING ALEXIS FROST 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 24, 2016 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Alexis Frost, who is a 6th grade student at Lorton Station Elementary School, for placing second in the Junior Divi-sion, Individual Performance Category, of the Virginia National History Day Contest. She, along with winners from other states competed at the Kenneth E. Behring National History Day Conference, which took place June 12 through 16 at the University of Maryland in College Park. Each year there is a specific theme on which the students’ research must focus with this year’s theme being: ‘‘Exploration, Encoun-ter, Exchange in History.’’ For her entry Alexis created a performance titled ‘‘Amelia’’ in which she portrays Amelia Earhart, an early aviation pioneer who was the first female pilot to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean and who was an inspiration to women throughout the world. This year approximately 600,000 students from across the United States participated in these contests. For the contests, students cre-ate entries showcasing original historical re-search utilizing primary and secondary sources. They then present their information in one of five categories: documentary, exhibit, paper, performance, and website. Less than 1 percent of all contestants are invited to go to the national competition. At the National History Day Finals, Alexis’ project along with those of the other state win-ners were evaluated by more than 300 histo-rians and education professionals. Scholar-ships totaling $150,000 were awarded to the winners of the contest ranging from $250 through $1,000 per award. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in commending Alexis Frost for her out-standing performance in the National History Day contest and in wishing her the very best at the National Finals as well as throughout her educational career.

HONORING CHRIST CHURCH CATHEDRAL 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 24, 2016 Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a very special church in Lexington, Kentucky. Christ Church Cathedral was established in 1796. This year they celebrate 220 years of ministry. The congregation of Christ Church has included several prominent members, in-cluding statesman Henry Clay, who rep-resented Kentucky in both the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives, served three nonconsecutive terms as Speak-er of the House, and served as U.S. Secretary of State under President John Quincy Adams. Christ Church was the first Episcopal Church congregation west of the Allegheny Mountains. The earliest church building was a small frame church, which was replaced by a larger brick building in the early 1800s. The current church building was designed by the famous architect Thomas Lewinski in the Gothic Revival style and completed in 1848. The first rector of Christ Church was Rev. James Moore, who also served as the first President of Transylvania University. The church is currently led by The Very Reverend Carol Wade and serves a unique downtown Lexington ministry. Some of Christ Church’s many community outreach ministries include mentoring at-risk students, serving the home-less through Room in the Inn and Church Under the Bridge ministries, and providing Christmas gifts to needy children through the Angel Tree project. Many lives have been changed by the min-istry of this church. Indeed, my own family has been blessed by this vibrant spiritual commu-nity: I served in the Christ Church men’s and boys’ choir during my childhood years; I par-ticipated in services as an acolyte as a young man; my wife Carol and I were married in the Cathedral in 2008; and both of our daughters were baptized there. As the Cathedral cele-brates its historic 220th anniversary, its mem-bers will continue their ministry to worship and serve God through Jesus Christ. My family and I are honored to call Christ Church Cathe-dral our spiritual home and I am honored to recognize this historic Cathedral before the United States House of Representatives. f 
COMMENDING HERITAGE BAPTIST CHURCH ON THE OCCASION OF ITS 35TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 24, 2016 Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 35th anniversary of Heritage Baptist Church, led by Pastor Michael Edwards. During its 35 years of selfless serv-ice to the Kingdom of God and to the commu-nity, this church has proven itself to be a con-gregation full of energy, conviction, and action. Heritage Baptist Church was founded by Pastor Michael E. Edwards and held its first service on June 28, 1981 at Potomac Senior High School. One year later, in 1982, Heritage Baptist Church moved to a new location on Telegraph Road in Woodbridge. As the church continued to grow in faith and in members, Heritage built a new church on Spriggs Road in Woodbridge, Virginia where it has continued its growth and expansion. Sensing the role it could play in the commu-nity and in educating children, Heritage Baptist church opened Heritage Christian School. The School began as a K5 through 9th grade insti-tution with 70 students and, through the Lord’s blessing, has grown to over 390 children in K4 through 12th grades. The School’s mission is to equip young people, both academically and spiritually, to fight for the faith and to engage culture in the service of Jesus Christ. Heritage Baptist Church, with Heritage Christian School, has served the community by opening their doors to our office on April 30th, 2016. Heritage Baptist facilitated our Women Veterans Forum and staffed the event to help meet our administrative needs. At-tended by representatives from the Veterans Affairs’ Administration, the Virginia Department of Veteran Services, and many other Veteran service organizations, the event celebrated the role women have played in our nation’s mili-tary and provided support resources to our local women Veterans. Heritage Baptist Church’s support of this event shows their commitment to our nation’s military, Veterans, and larger community. Mr. Speaker, it is with heartfelt gratitude that I congratulate Heritage Baptist Church on their 35th anniversary. I pray that the Lord will con-tinue to bless and prosper this congregation for many years to come. f 
RECOGNIZING DAVID P. BOBZIEN ON THE OCCASION OF HIS RE-TIREMENT AS FAIRFAX COUNTY ATTORNEY 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 24, 2016 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-ognize and commend David P. Bobzien, of Reston, on the occasion of his retirement after a distinguished career spanning three decades of public service to the residents of Fairfax County, the largest local jurisdiction in the Commonwealth of Virginia and the National Capital Region. For the past 23 years, David has served as the Fairfax County Attorney. Prior to that, he served four years on the Fair-fax Planning Commission, representing the former Centreville District, and he also is a past chairman of the Fairfax County Goals Ad-visory Commission. I had the great pleasure of working with David throughout my 14 years on the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, particularly dur-ing my 5 years as chairman. David was re-sponsible for providing sound legal advice to the Board of Supervisors on any number of issues, from land use and zoning applications to civil litigation to personnel matters. He was always meticulous and thoughtful in his ap-proach and was a trusted counselor to the board and county staff. David also has more than a decade of serv-ice with the federal government, where he served as assistant counsel in the Office of Professional Responsibility of the Department of Justice. Prior to that, he spent four years in private practice as an associate with the Fair-fax firm of Fitzgerald and Smith, and he also

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE988 June 24, 2016 
served four years as a Captain in the Judge Advocate General’s Corps of the United States Army. Mr. Bobzien has ably represented Fairfax on a number of boards and associations and has used his passion for the law to benefit com-munities across the Commonwealth. He is a former president of the Virginia State Bar. He was the first government attorney ever to hold that post. He is a past chair of the Local Gov-ernment Law Section of the Virginia State Bar, a past president of the Local Government At-torneys of Virginia, a past president of Law-yers Helping Lawyers, the organization that assists lawyers in Virginia suffering from sub-stance addiction or mental illness, a past president of the Fairfax Law Foundation, and a past president of the Virginia Law Founda-tion. Even as he neared retirement, David has remained active and is the current chairman of the Virginia CLE Committee of the Virginia Law Foundation and is a board member of Virginia Law Foundation, the Fairfax Law Foundation, and Lawyers Helping Lawyers. He is a Virginia State Bar delegate in the Amer-ican Bar Association’s House of Delegates having previously served on the ABA’s Com-mission on Domestic and Sexual Violence. He is a fellow of the Fairfax Law Foundation and the Virginia Law Foundation and a Life Fellow of the American Bar Foundation. His leadership and commitment to the law have been recognized by his peers. In 2012, David was selected to receive the Golden Gavel Award from the Fairfax Law Founda-tion’s Society of Fellows. The Golden Gavel Award recognizes individuals, organizations, and businesses for their exceptional commu-nity service. Mr. Speaker, David Bobzien’s commitment to our community and the mission of local government is unparalleled, and he leaves be-hind a legacy of integrity that will benefit our community for generations to come. His ca-reer in public service is truly commendable and deserving of our sincere appreciation. When I was chairman of the county board, we often joked when retirement announcements like this came before the board that we should pass an ordinance to disallow such talented and dedicated professionals to leave public service. I certainly wish that was the case here. I have been privileged to call David not only a professional colleague but also a con-stituent and a friend. I wish David and his wife, Cathy, and the rest of their family the best of luck in his retirement, and I ask my colleagues in the House to join me in express-ing our appreciation for his unswerving devo-tion to serving the residents of Fairfax County.

BASQUE HERITAGE AND SMITHSO-NIAN FOLKLIFE FESTIVAL 
HON. DINA TITUS 
OF NEVADA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 24, 2016 Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the annual Smithsonian Folklife Festival which begins on June 29 and focuses this year on the Basques. Their history, contributions, and culture will be highlighted through music, sto-rytelling, artifacts, and food. Since the late 1800s, the Basques have been an integral part of Nevada’s story. Well known and highly respected Basque families in Nevada include the Laxalts, Ascuaguas, Etcheverrias, Juaristis, and Goicoecheas, among others, who have left a legacy at all levels of govern-ment, business, academia, and the legal pro-fession. Their history has been recorded in the sheep camps of the Northern Nevada moun-tains and in the boarding houses of small towns like Elko, Winnemucca, Battle Mountain, and Ely. Their strength of character and per-severance inspire us all. I look forward to see-ing some of Nevada’s Basque dancers on the National Mall, and I invite you to join me in celebrating this amazing community and its heritage. f 
HONORING THE 65TH ANNIVER-SARY OF THE ROSE OF SHARON MISSIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH 
HON. K. MICHAEL CONAWAY 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 24, 2016 Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Rose of Sharon Missionary Baptist Church as they celebrate their 65th anniver-sary. Over the last 65 years, Rose of Sharon has served as a place of worship for countless numbers of West Texans. Rose of Sharon was founded by Reverend A.H. Goings in 1951. After meeting in various homes for sev-eral years, the church finally found a perma-nent home on 300 Fitch St. in June of 1985 under the leadership of Reverend J.W. Han-son. From that point moving forward, the church was able to flourish as they made it their mission to spread the teachings of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Tragically on June 25, 2014, the church burned down and was declared a total loss. But out of the ashes and through the power of prayer and the support of the First Baptist Church of Odessa, Rose of Sharon per-severed and overcame the adversity that they were dealt. After many months of rebuilding, Rose of Sharon reopened the doors to their newly constructed house of worship in Feb-ruary 2016. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing the Rose of Sharon Baptist Church as they celebrate their 65th anniver-sary. I wish them continued success moving forward. May God continue to bless the pa-rishioners and the church leaders for many years to come.

CONGRATULATING COLONEL GUY T. SHIELDS ON HIS INDUCTION INTO THE ARMY PUBLIC AF-FAIRS HALL OF FAME 
HON. PETER A. DeFAZIO 
OF OREGON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 24, 2016 Mr. D
EFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, today, we are here to honor Colonel Guy T. Shields on his induction into the Army Public Affairs Hall of Fame, an honor deserving of a man who has dedicated his life to serving our country. Colo-nel Shields’ accomplishments are many, and his time in the Army has been a story of pas-sion, leadership, and innovation. For nearly twenty years he served in the Army as a Public Affairs Officer, and he estab-lished himself as a media relations expert. He was respected and trusted by all he worked with: internal and external media, his military superiors, his peers, and his subordinates. At the NATO Nuclear Planning Conference in 1987, he successfully established an inter-national press center, and under his guidance a team was able to handle more than 200 members of the international media for four days. His success continued as he covered stories and events such as the 50th Anniver-sary of the Normandy Landings, Exercise Double Eagle, Operations Support Hope, Just Cause, Golden Pheasant, and Iraqi Freedom. While working in Bosnia he coordinated the construction and operation of a radio tower and taught a team who had never worked with the equipment before how to broadcast mes-sages to the Bosnian people. He truly has done it all. Colonel Shields’ time spent as an Army Public Affairs Officer set the standards for contingency public affairs operations for the Army and Joint Operations. Through his serv-ice, he set an example for contingency deploy-ments worldwide in both peacetime and war. Every day I am grateful for the sacrifices and work that our service men and women do and Colonel Shields exemplifies both a dedication to our country as well as a model soldier with exceptional public affairs skills. I would like to join in congratulating him on this much de-served award. f 
HONORING THE RECIPIENTS OF THE WEST SPRINGFIELD RO-TARY CLUB FIRE, RESCUE AND FIRST RESPONDER AWARDS 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 24, 2016 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-ognize the West Springfield Rotary Club and to congratulate the recipients of the 2016 Fire, Rescue, and First Responder of the Year Awards. The West Springfield Rotary Club (WSRC) was established over 25 years ago, making it one of the oldest of the nearly 60 clubs that comprise Rotary District 7610. Throughout its existence, the WSRC and its members have dedicated themselves to service to our neigh-bors and our community. Each year, the WSRC recognizes area first responders who have gone above and beyond the call of duty. This year, the three individuals who will be honored are stationed at West Springfield Fire Station 27, and it is my honor to submit their names and to congratulate each of them on receiving this award. Master Technician Hyun Lee has been a Fairfax County firefighter for 12 years, the last six as an engine driver. Two years ago, she earned the proficiency designation of Master Technician (MT) and assumed additional re-sponsibilities including company and battalion level training and ensuring proficiency of the station. Master Technician Lee is known for her hands-on instruction and training of newer firefighters and personal attention to their pro-fessional growth. Her dedication has allowed her to instill her work ethic and passion into

the trainees at Fire Station 27. In addition to her work on the job, Master Technician Lee serves as Secretary and Treasurer of the Fair-fax County Asian Firefighter Association. Technician William Harrington has been a Fairfax County firefighter for eight years, serv-ing as an EMS Technician for the past four. He is also a paramedic and has volunteered as a preceptor to instruct new medics. He is described as tireless and thorough, and goes above and beyond even on his days off. Tech-nician Harrington truly exemplifies the motto of ‘‘service above self,’’ through his initiative and ability to lead by example in even the most dangerous of situations. He is a role model to all and sets the tone for others to follow and succeed. Fire Technician Antwaun Hawkins has served for more than 11 years with the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Department and has been with West Springfield station since 2012. He currently serves as the EMS Technician on the B-shift and is Operator in Charge of Medic 427 nearly every day. He has successfully completed Hazmat School and is completing Inspections training to build his skills, exper-tise, and to open up advancement opportuni-ties in the future. Even with the demands of his position and family responsibilities to his wife and sons, he is known for his calming presence and philosophical conversations. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me commending the West Springfield Rotary Club for its support of our community and our first responders, and in congratulating the re-cipients of the 2016 Fire, Rescue, and First Responders of the Year awards. These indi-viduals along with their colleagues throughout the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Depart-ment do not hesitate to place themselves in harm’s way to protect and serve county resi-dents and property. I thank each of them for their service, bravery, and dedication. Stay Safe.

RECOGNIZING THE 20TH ANNIVER-SARY OF CAMP BOGGY CREEK 
HON. DANIEL WEBSTER 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 24, 2016 Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to recognize Camp Boggy Creek, headquartered in Orlando, Florida, on the oc-casion of its 20th anniversary. Camp Boggy Creek was founded in 1996 by actor/philan-thropist Paul Newman and General H. Norman Schwarzkopf, with one simple premise in mind, that every child, no matter their illness, could experience the transformational spirit and friendships that go hand in hand with camp. With unobtrusive expert medical care, it was their dream that Camp would provide se-riously ill children with a fun-filled experience defined by compassion, laughter and accept-ance. Since 1996, Camp Boggy Creek has made it possible for children with serious illnesses to enjoy a camp experience in a safe, medically sound environment. Located in central Florida, the 232-acre camp serves children ages 7 through 16 who have been diagnosed with chronic or life-threatening conditions. Camp Boggy Creek never charges campers to attend and never asks them to contribute anything other than a positive, playful attitude. The camp is entirely funded by generous do-nations from individuals, corporations, founda-tions and healthcare partners. Camp Boggy Creek is a proud member of SeriousFun Chil-dren’s Network. As a year-round retreat, Camp Boggy Creek is able to serve thousands of campers and their families through activity-packed weekly and weekend camp programs. The camp of-fers children the chance to catch their first fish, go horseback riding or climb a ropes tower, all while making new friends. Beyond boundless fun, Camp Boggy Creek provides fellowship. Children can spend time with oth-ers who are just like them and share their life- experiences, which serves as a reminder that they are not alone. It is my honor to recognize Camp Boggy Creek on the occasion of its 20th anniversary. f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF RETIRED AIR FORCE MASTER SERGEANT FRED ‘‘BULLDOG’’ BECKER 
HON. DON YOUNG 
OF ALASKA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 24, 2016 Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I come to the House Floor today with a heavy heart. On June 11, 2016, a ‘‘Bulldog’’ in the Alaska Veterans community passed from our world, and joined his comrades from Vietnam, family, and friends in Heaven above. On behalf of the countless Alaskans who were touched by Re-tired Air Force Master Sergeant Fred ‘‘Bull-dog’’ Becker, Mr. Speaker, I would like to share my condolences with his son Fred, daughters Elizabeth, Melinda, and their many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Mr. Speaker, I recall one special occasion when I joined Bulldog on our nation’s birthday, July 4, 2010, after he and his brothers in arms rode across the country in honor of fallen Naval Chief Special Warfare Operator Lance Vacarro. From the moment we met so many years ago, to that day in 2010, and until his passing, his commitment to his fallen brothers was never-ending, and I will always treasure our friendship. Mr. Speaker, though Bulldog was never one to flaunt his own achievements, it is only fitting to mention several of them in recognition of this remarkable Alaskan. Bulldog served his country in the United States Air Force for 20 years, including three tours in Vietnam, before retiring in 1981. Among his many commenda-tions, he is the recipient of the Air Force Com-mendation Medal with 1 Oak Leaf cluster, a Presidential Unit Citation, the Vietnam Service Medal, the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Palm, and the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal. Mr. Speaker, upon ‘‘Bulldog’’ Becker’s retire-ment, he chose to call the great state of Alas-ka home. In Alaska, and across the country, he was a tireless advocate for our nation’s veterans. He proudly dedicated his life to serv-ing our nation, my home State of Alaska, and all those who wore the uniform of our great nation. Mr. Speaker, Master Sergeant Becker never backed down from a challenge. A proud mem-ber of the Vietnam Veterans Motorcycle Club and later the Combat Veterans Motorcycle Club, he always fought to ensure our men and women in uniform received the care and re-spect they not only deserved, but earned. Mr. Speaker, I have always believed that a hero is someone who has given his or her life to something bigger than themselves. In the eyes of anyone who knew him, MSgt. Fred ‘‘Bulldog’’ Becker was a true American hero. Bulldog, Godspeed my friend, until I see you again, riding through the clouds of Heaven. f 
PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. JOHN K. DELANEY 
OF MARYLAND  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 24, 2016 Mr. DELANEY. Mr. Speaker, on June 16, 2016 the House voted on 26 amendments to H.R. 5293, the Department of Defense Appro-priations Act for Fiscal Year 2017. Congress-man C
ONYERS offered an amendment, roll call vote number 327, to block funds from being used to transfer or authorize the transfer of cluster munitions to Saudi Arabia. Amendment votes are taken in quick succession, with two minutes allowed for each. I mistakenly voted NO when I meant to vote AYE on Mr. C
ON-
YERS ’ amendment. Saudi Arabia is a U.S. ally in the Middle East, supporting our counterterrorism efforts in the region. As with many allies, the United States enters into agreements to sell military equipment to help achieve mutual goals. In-cluded in the sale with Saudi Arabia were cluster munitions. Alarmingly, Saudi Arabia has used cluster munitions contrary to U.S. law which prohibits the use of this weapon in populated areas and those that have a failure rate of above 1 percent. Cluster munitions contain multiple, explosive submunitions that are released mid-air and spread out, making targeting a specific loca-tion difficult and may put civilians in harm’s way. The weapon is designed to kill enemy personnel and destroy their transportation and infrastructure. When used improperly, the clus-ter munitions are a danger to innocent civil-ians. Additionally, unpredictable landings and explosive remnants can put civilians in danger long after the violence had ended. This is a human rights issue. President Obama recently blocked the sale of cluster munitions to Saudi Arabia for use in Yemen amid reports by human rights organi-zations that have documented killing and wounding of civilians in violation of U.S. law. I support the President’s decision to halt the sale of these dangerous weapons and support Congressman C
ONYERS ’ amendment to pre-vent the sale of cluster munitions in the De-partment of Defense Appropriations for Fiscal Year 2017.

Springfield Civic Association on the occasion of its 60th anniversary. North Springfield was forest and meadows when developer Edward R. Carr received the permits to create a community here. Construc-tion started in 1954, and the first homes were occupied around July 1, 1955. The North Springfield Civic League (later renamed Asso-ciation) was formed shortly thereafter with the first official meeting on January 25, 1956. Over the last 60 years, the North Springfield Civic Association has led the effort to promote civic pride among its residents, inform the community about local and regional issues that affect the residents, and advocate for land use policies and public service investments that benefit the community. The quality of life and community spirit enjoyed by the residents now is a testament to their success. As the former president of my own civic as-sociation, I know firsthand that when residents invest their time, care, and energies in their communities, it benefits us all. Fairfax County is considered one of the best places in the na-tion in which to work, live, and raise a family, largely because of the willingness of so many to become actively involved. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating the North Springfield Civic Association on its 60th anniversary and in thanking all of the residents for their tireless efforts and dedication to the community and region.

TRIBUTE TO ROCKY HEIGHTS MIDDLE SCHOOL 
HON. MIKE COFFMAN 
OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 24, 2016 Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Rocky Heights Middle School for being designated as a School to Watch by the National Forum to Accelerate Middle-Grades Reform this year. This designation recognizes Rocky Heights Middle School, as well as 145 other schools nationwide, as being on-track to fulfill the requirements to be designated as a school of high performance. Rocky Heights Middle School’s designation as a School to Watch places it in an elite tier of adolescent education institutions. The Na-tional Forum sets criteria for high performance in middle schools, which includes, creating an environment that challenges all students, set-ting up structures that address and account for the significant and unique challenges of stu-dents in early adolescence, and ensuring that students have access to high-quality teachers and resources. Rocky Heights Middle School, as a School to Watch, is well on its way to meeting these criteria. Its high level of academic achievement and its strong community have fostered an excel-lent educational environment for the students of Rocky Heights. This designation is an affirmation of the ex-cellent achievements of Rocky Heights’ stu-dents, as well as the continually improving work being done by the faculty. I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to the stu-dents and teachers of Rocky Heights Middle School for being one of the nation’s premier adolescent education institutions.

He entered St. Joseph College Seminary in Los Altos in 1990 and completed his studies at St. Patrick’s Seminary in Menlo Park. Dio-cese of Oakland Bishop John Cummins or-dained him to the priesthood in 1997, and he began serving as parochial vicar at St. Augus-tine Parish in Pleasanton. Later he was ap-pointed parochial vicar at St. Joseph Parish in Pinole and then as parochial administrator at St. Ignatius Parish in Antioch in 2001. In 2005, he assumed the role of Pastor at St. Anne. During his time as Pastor, Father Geoffrey was a beloved figure who inspired countless people.

Diocese. He shepherded a ‘‘living church’’ where parishioners practiced their faith through service to others. Today, due to Father Geoffrey’s leadership, St. Anne is one of the largest parishes in my congressional district, with over 5,000 parish-ioners. In addition, ministry groups have thrived while faithfully and effectively serving Union City and the entire Tri-City area. They have established a variety of programs to as-sist the homeless and hungry in their commu-nity. Father Geoffrey was also instrumental in es-tablishing S.M.A.R.T., which stands for ‘‘St. Anne Medical Action Response Team.’’ He helped assemble a medical team of over 80 volunteers, including doctors, nurses, medical students, and other health professionals to provide first aid and basic care to parishioners during all of the often-crowded weekend serv-ices. Father Geoffrey will begin a new ministry starting on July 1, 2016, when he becomes Pastor of St. Joseph’s Church and School in Pinole. I wish to thank Father Geoffrey on his contributions to the 15th Congressional District during his time at St. Anne, and I wish him well in his new assignment.

HON. JOSEPH CROWLEY 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 24, 2016 Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service of Marilyn Bitterman. Marilyn is a beloved member of the Queens commu-nity, who plans to retire after 40 years of serv-ice to Community Board 7. Marilyn has been working part-time for the Community Board since 1976 and was pro-moted to Assistant District Manager in 1984. In 1988, she was appointed to the position of District Manager, and she has worked dili-gently for the people of Queens ever since. She has been a blessing to the community for over four decades and the Community Board, and surrounding community, will miss her dearly. Marilyn is an extremely active member of the Queens community in many ways. She has worked on the Borough President’s Flush-ing Meadows Corona Park Coordination Com-mittee and the Queens Traffic Safety Board. She currently sits on the Community Advisory Boards of Flushing Hospital and the New York-Presbyterian Hospital Queens. She is a graduate of the Citizens Police Academy and presently serves as co-president of the Bay Terrace Garden Jewish Center. Marilyn is an incredible and giving individual, who has dedi-cated her life to the betterment of her commu-nity. At the end of August, Marilyn will be retiring as District Manager from the Community Board. She has worked for much of her life to improve her community, and I would like to personally thank her for her dedication to serv-ing the residents of Queens. I also would like to acknowledge Marilyn’s loving husband, Jack, two children, Noel and Tracy, a son-in- law, Michael, and three grandchildren, Gabriel, Sadie and Cassidy, and thank them for shar-ing Marilyn with the people of Queens for so many years. While the Community Board may be losing an asset to their team, the whole community is extremely grateful to Marilyn for her many years of selfless service. I hope all my colleagues will join me in hon-oring Marilyn Bitterman’s service to the Queens community and in wishing her a happy retirement. f 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE EX-TRAORDINARY SERVICE OF AM-BASSADOR RUTH A. DAVIS 
HON. CHARLES B. RANGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 24, 2016 Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate Ambassador Ruth A. Davis on re-ceiving the prestigious Lifetime Contributions to American Diplomacy award. I want to give thanks to this exceptional public servant for her exemplary service to her country as a United States diplomat. Her contributions to American diplomacy over the length of her im-pressive career with the Department of State, as well as in retirement, have contributed to making the world a safer and more peaceful place. Her vision has especially ensured that the future of America’s diplomacy reflects our country’s strength—its diversity. Ambassador Davis was born in Phoenix, Ar-izona, but was primarily raised in Atlanta, Georgia during the Jim Crow era. She grad-uated magna cum laude from Spelman Col-lege where she studied abroad in Europe and the Middle East as a Merrill Scholar. She later received her Master’s Degree from the Univer-sity of California at Berkeley. In 1969, she em-barked on one of the most challenging and re-warding careers as a U.S. diplomat. Among her many notable accomplishments, Ambassador Davis was the first African Amer-ican to become a Career Ambassador, the highest ranking position within the Foreign Service. At the time of her retirement, she was the longest-serving Career Ambassador in the department’s history. Her hard work, sacrifice, and dedication to public service allowed her to serve her country all over the globe including in Porto, Benin, Nairobi, Kenya, Tokyo, Japan, Barcelona, Spain, and Naples, Italy. As the Consul General in Barcelona, Spain, she played an important leadership role in the or-ganization of the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games, and later utilized her experience to help Atlanta’s successful Olympic bid in 1996. As a colleague and a friend, I have always ad-mired her strength, tenacity, and selflessness in choosing to serve on the frontlines of Amer-ican foreign policy at a time when the partici-pation of African Americans and women was not welcomed at home or abroad. Through her leadership, she emulated the excellence of our society to America’s global partners and pio-neered a path and secured a place for minori-ties to represent our nation as diplomats. Her unique talents and skills continued to bring greater understanding of and interaction between domestic and foreign policy matters. As a Pearson Fellow, she worked as a Special Advisor for International Affairs for the Wash-ington, DC Municipal Government where she substantially enhanced the city’s involvement in the international, economic, cultural, and diplomatic fields. In 2002, she was nominated by Secretary of State Colin Powell and ap-pointed by President George W. Bush as the Director General of the U.S. Foreign Service. As the Director General, Ambassador Davis managed the promotion, discipline, career de-velopment, recruitment, and retirement policies and for all of the State Department’s Foreign and Civil Service employees. During her time in Washington, she generously imparted her knowledge, expertise, and wisdom as the Dis-tinguished Advisor for International Affairs at Howard University. I am lucky to count Ambassador Davis as a friend and a fellow advocate of civil rights. She has dedicated her life in the Foreign Service and beyond to fostering the next diverse gen-eration of diplomats. Her work as a mentor and supporter of those from underrepresented backgrounds will ensure that America’s diplo-matic force mirrors the beautiful mosaic of races, religions, and ethnicities in our country. From her service at Howard University, to the President of the Thursday Luncheon Group, an affinity group at the State Department, to her helping found the International Women’s Entrepreneurial Challenge, to her endless sup-port for the Charles B. Rangel Fellowship, she has worked tirelessly to ensure that the For-eign Service is a more inclusive, and thus a more effective institution. I am certain that her efforts in diversifying the American diplomatic corps and mentoring rising diplomats will con-tinue to advance the safety, security, and prosperity of our country for years to come. Mr. Speaker, for this, I ask that you and my distinguished colleagues in Congress join me in applauding this extraordinary public servant, whose service to our country has made the U.S. and the world a better place.

Obtaining cer-tification and completing the renewal process is a personal and public statement of one’s commitment to the evolution of effective in-struction methods. Certified educators support a vision of teaching based on the following five core principles: 1. Teachers are committed to students and their learning; 2. Teachers know the subjects they teach and how to teach those subjects to students; 3. Teachers are responsible for managing and monitoring student learning; 4. Teachers think systematically about their practice and learn from experience; and 5. Teachers are members of learning com-munities. I extend my personal congratulations and appreciation to the following National Board Certified Teachers for receiving their respec-tive certifications and renewals: Ali M. Allen, Minnieville Elementary School Cassandra Cornwell, Tyler Elementary School Carolyn Doyle, Montclair Elementary School Kimberly Lervold, Vaughan Elementary School Martha Lipscomb, Antietam Elementary School (Renewal) Jessica Mason, Triangle Elementary School Tanya Parrott, Chris Yung Elementary School (Renewal) Laura Provencio, Montclair Elementary School Sheryl Quinlan, Marsteller Middle School (Renewal) Kelly Serrano, West Gate Elementary School Sarah Tracy, Minnieville Elementary School Gerald Vile, Marsteller Middle School (Re-newal) Tamara Zimmerman, Saunders Middle School (Renewal) Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in commending these teachers for their commitment to education, professional devel-opment, and the students of Prince William County Public Schools. The world-class edu-cation provided to our students is due to the tireless efforts of teachers who make excel-lence the standard and I thank them for their invaluable contributions.

ON THE RETIREMENT OF U.S. ARMY COLONEL CAROLYN CLOSS-WALFORD 
HON. G.K. BUTTERFIELD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 24, 2016 Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and congratulate Colonel Carolyn Closs-Walford, the Senior Strategic Advisor to the Director of the Army National Guard, on her retirement. Colonel Closs-Walford is a career Army offi-cer who dedicated her life to protecting and supporting our great nation. As a young col-lege student at Winston-Salem State Univer-sity in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, she dis-covered her passion for the Army and joined the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC). Upon graduation, she was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the Signal Corps and accepted a reserve commission in the Army Reserve. While in Washington, D.C., she also completed her graduate studies at National Louis University and later transferred to the Quartermaster Corps to fulfill the Army Re-serve’s mission of combat service support. Colonel Closs-Walford served as a ‘‘Citizen Soldier’’ and demonstrated continuous com-mitment throughout her deployment and serv-ice in Southwest Asia during Operation Desert Storm. Her impressive leadership skills did not go unnoticed, and Colonel Closs-Walford be-came a fulltime active soldier serving as the Logistics Planner for the European Command with extensive travel to Germany, Bosnia, and Kosovo. Colonel Closs-Walford has devoted her life to public service. She has served in senior po-sitions in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense and acted as an interagency liaison to the National Security Council, the United States Congress, and the Departments of De-fense and State. She has also had the distinct honor of serv-ing as the Director for Global Outreach in the White House for U.S. Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, fulfilling a variety of roles that provided support to the President, Deputy National Security Advisor, and the Counselor to the President. Additionally, Colonel Closs-Walford served members of the U.S. House of Representa-tives and their staffs in the Army’s House Liai-son Division where she tracked and influenced legislation that impacted the Army’s budget and missions. Colonel Closs-Walford orga-nized and led 16 congressional delegations to Iraq, more than any other Legislative Liaison during that time. Her most recent assignment was in the Of-fice of the Chief of Staff of the Army (CSA), where she served as a Military Fellow. Hand-picked by the CSA, she was responsible for identifying and studying potential obstacles that the Army is projected to face in the year 2025 and beyond. Colonel Closs-Walford’s extensive experi-ence in defending and protecting our country demonstrates her true commitment to our great nation, a dedication that deserves the highest recognition and acknowledgement. Colonel Closs-Walford embodies the definition of a true patriot, steadfast in her devotion to answer no matter what the call. Mr. Speaker, Colonel Closs-Walford has spent her life advancing the mission of the United States of America, on both the domes-tic and international stage. She has solidified a legacy of patriotism that will live on through each person that has been fortunate enough to work with her. On behalf of a most grateful nation, I ask my colleagues to join me in con-gratulating Colonel Carolyn Closs-Walford on her retirement.

OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 24, 2016 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the House of Representatives to join me in congratulating Deshauna Barber of North-east Washington, D.C., a graduate of Virginia State University and the University of Mary-land University College, who was crowned Miss USA 2016 this month. Ms. Barber dem-onstrates the best qualities of District resi-dents, and we believe she will bring out their best qualities as well during her reign. We are particularly proud that Ms. Barber is a lieuten-ant in the United States Army Reserve, serv-ing as a Logistics Commander for the 988th Quartermaster Detachment Unit at Fort Meade, Maryland. She also works as an IT consultant at the United States Department of Commerce. During her downtime, Ms. Barber enjoys hometown D.C., and has a particular fondness for Gallery Place in Chinatown and our hometown staple Ben’s Chili Bowl. Deshauna is a strong advocate for gender equality, particularly for our nation’s military women. The nation, especially the District of Columbia, takes great pride in the constella-tion of characteristics and talents Miss District of Columbia brings to her work as Miss USA 2016. A District resident has won Miss USA only three times. Lt. Barber’s victory comes at a watershed moment when District residents will be asked to approve a new D.C. statehood constitution in November. This effort has al-ready significantly increased the visibility of D.C. statehood throughout the country. Our D.C. Miss USA almost surely brings new inter-est in her hometown and everything about D.C., including its quest for statehood. Today, Miss USA 2016, Deshauna Barber, has earned not only her title, but, like the almost 700,000 other residents of the District, the right to full and equal citizenship. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Represent-atives to join me in congratulating Miss District of Columbia, Deshauna Barber, the 2016 Miss USA, and to thank her for her service to the country as a lieutenant in the United States Army Reserve and as a representative of the best of the citizens of the District of Columbia as Miss USA 2016.

HONORING MS. JAN SABO 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 24, 2016 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Jan Sabo, the Assistant Superintendent of the Napa County Office of Education, upon her retirement from an im-pressive career in education that spanned 42 years. A New Jersey native, Ms. Sabo completed her B.S. in Education at Boston University and her Master in Education at Lesley University before attending the University of Massachu-setts and the University of California, Davis for her post-graduate work. Ms. Sabo has held a number of positions during her 19 years with the Napa County Of-fice of Education. She joined the office as a Resource Specialist and served as the Coordi-nator of Curriculum and Instruction and as Di-rector of Curriculum and Instruction before as-suming her current position as Assistant Su-perintendent of Academic Services. Through-out her time with the Napa County Office of Education, Ms. Sabo has overseen early child-hood education and summer programs, and has dedicated particular attention to the devel-opment of academic services for special edu-cation and low-income students. In addition to her work in education, Ms. Sabo is a leader in our community. She spear-headed the creation of the Education Support Team serving Napa, Solano, and Contra Costa, which raises funds to support edu-cation across three counties in Northern Cali-fornia. Ms. Sabo belongs to the Association of California School Administrators, is a board member of Congregation Beth Shalom, and co-chairs the Every Student Succeeding Com-mittee. She also volunteers time as a mentor for at-risk youth, to support the Humane Soci-ety, and with political organizations including the League of Conservation Voters. Mr. Speaker, Ms. Sabo has dedicated her career to ensuring every student in our com-munity receives a top-notch education from the day they first step foot in a classroom. Therefore, it is fitting and proper that we honor her here today and extend our best wishes for an enjoyable retirement and many happy memories to come with her husband, Tom, and children Sam, Emma, and Mary. f 
HONORING THE AWARDEES OF THE LITERACY COUNCIL OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA RECOGNI-TION CELEBRATION

RECOGNIZING THE PROTECT AMERICA ACT 
HON. MICHAEL G. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 24, 2016 Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Protect America Act. On June 12, 2016 we watched in horror as a lone terrorist, pledging allegiance to ISIS, carried out the nation’s worst terror attack since September 11, 2001. As we continue to grieve and pray for those devastated by this attack, we must redouble our efforts and be clear in our resolve to protect our nation and her citizens from the radical Islamic terrorism that continues to target us. Part of the effort to protect our homeland must be to ensure the Federal Bureau of In-vestigation and other law enforcement officials have the tools they need to block terrorists from purchasing a gun. That’s why I support the Protect America Act which would establish a process to deny firearms and explosives to individuals suspected of terrorism. This com-mon sense bill is carefully crafted to only tar-get terrorists, and to protect the Constitutional principle of due process for law-abiding Ameri-cans who seek to exercise their Second Amendment rights. We must absolutely deny terrorists the means to attack us, but we must not undermine our freedom in the process. Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, the threat of radical Islamic terrorism is real. And it is once again threatening us on our own soil. From Fort Hood, to Boston, to San Bernardino, and now to Orlando, we have been tragically re-minded that there are radical Islamists who seek to kill us simply for who we are as a peo-ple. Blocking terrorists’ ability to purchase weap-ons that can be used to wage war on innocent Americans is an important step. But we must have clear eyes about what it will take to de-feat this enemy. Our efforts to combat this radicalism must be carried out on multiple fronts: through diplomatic action, military force, and countering the finances used to carry out these attacks. We cannot back down in fear. We must fight back. We must win. f 
TRIBUTE TO MILES WILKIN 
HON. JOHN L. MICA 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 24, 2016 Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a wonderful friend and an accom-plished leader in American Theater, Mr. Miles Wilkin. Mr. Wilkin was recently recognized with a National Special Tony Award for his innova-tion in bringing Broadway to communities across America. A six-time Tony Winner, Miles Wilkin is the COO and Executive Vice President of Key Brand Entertainment and responsible for the vision and development of ‘‘Broadway Across America’s’’ significant touring network, which has expanded significantly over the years. Based on the simple principle that everyone cannot get to New York’s Broadway, those productions have been taken to cities across the United States, providing millions with great Broadway theater in their communities. Wilkin was one of the founders of North America Touring Theater, which initially brought these shows to people in every corner of our country. He was a past executive with Clear Channel Entertainment, PACE Entertain-ment and PACE Theatrical. Charlotte St. Martin, President of the Broad-way League said, ‘‘Miles paved the road for the modem theater touring system.’’ At the June 12th American Theatre Wing’s 70th An-nual Tony Awards in New York City, Miles Wilkin received a Special Tony Award for dis-tinguished achievement and for his substantial work in promoting American Theatre and Broadway productions. It has been my great honor to know Miles Wilkin for nearly fifty years. He was a fellow student, friend and leader of Tau Kappa Epsi-lon at the University of Florida campus, where he launched his theater production career. Later on in Orlando, Florida, Miles success-fully managed theater productions at the Bob Carr Auditorium in the community where we both resided. It has been wonderful to watch Miles advance his career over the years and bring America’s finest Broadway production to all of our doorsteps. It is fitting that my friend and promoter of the arts is the recipient of such a special and prestigious award and recognition. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratu-lating Mr. Miles Wilkin on his accomplishments and contributions to American culture and the-atre. f 
RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVER-SARY OF AUTO-OWNERS INSUR-ANCE 
HON. BILL HUIZENGA 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 24, 2016 Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Auto-Owners Insur-ance Company’s one-hundred years of serving citizens in Michigan and across the country. Founded in one room of a bank building in 1916, Auto-Owners is now the largest property and casualty insurance company based in Michigan. Auto-Owners maintains its head-quarters in Lansing, Michigan, where it serves its policyholders with a team of more than 43,000 agents. Today, the company offers auto and life insurance claims to Americans in more than half the country. Over the last one-hundred years, Auto-Own-ers has consistently demonstrated its strength and commitment to its policyholders. During the Great Depression, the company paid all claims in cash, writing more than $2.5 million in insurance premiums, despite drastic defla-tion and widespread instability throughout the country. Auto-Owners now issues over 5.1 mil-lion personal, commercial, and life policies with the same values of financial account-ability and loyal service. As demonstrated by its A++ rating from A.M. Best, Auto-Owners has continued to put its policyholders first. Auto-Owners’ stated mission is to provide the best claim service in the industry. It is a mission they have fulfilled for the last century, and this centennial milestone is an important achievement. For one-hundred years, Auto- Owners has maintained its dedication to its policyholders to be there when people need them most. Their unwavering commitment is worthy of recognition and applause. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Auto-Owners Insurance, its employees, and its loyal agents for their efforts to live the values that define them and deliver on the promise found in their products.

For the second year in a row, the College of DuPage is one of only two community colleges invited to participate in the 2016 NASA Robotic Mining Competition held at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. This year’s NASA Robotic Mining competi-tion features participants from 40 different col-leges from across the country. The competi-tion consists of undergraduate and graduate students who are required to design and con-struct a mining robot that could traverse the simulated Martian surface, collect samples of gravel, and place the samples into a bin. The members of the Engineering Club who participated in the recent NASA competition come from all corners of DuPage County and each member has a strong passion for engi-neering. It was necessary that the members to work together and rely on one another as they repeatedly tested their robot design to ensure the best possible strategy for the competition. The participant’s hard work and long hours will prepare them for the rigors of engineering school and the lessons learned from the com-petition will serve them greatly in their future careers. Mr. Speaker and my distinguished col-leagues in the House please join me in con-gratulating College of DuPage Engineering Club and wishing them the best of luck in the future.

THE INSTITUTE OF INTERNAL AUDITORS’ 75TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. JOHN L. MICA 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 24, 2016 Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-ognize and congratulate an organization from Florida’s 7th Congressional District, located in Altamonte Springs. This July, The Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) celebrates its 75th anni-versary. As many of my colleagues know, internal auditors play a vital role in maintaining public trust in our institutions. Whether it is protecting shareholder value at large publicly traded companies or ensuring appropriate use of tax-payer dollars in federal, state or local govern-ment, the internal auditor is ever-vigilant in en-suring that our institutions operate effectively. For 75 years, The IIA has helped inspire and educate generations of internal auditors who play a crucial role in our nation’s success. The IIA was founded in 1941 in New York City by a core group of 24 internal auditors with the intention of bringing the practice of in-ternal auditing to the forefront of American business. These initial members of The IIA created many of the core principles and best practices we see in internal audit functions across the United States and world today. While the organization began with only two dozen members, it now includes more than 185,000 worldwide, with 63,000 in the United States. In effective risk management and control, there are three lines of defense for share-holders and taxpayers who want to see our in-stitutions play by the rules. The first line of de-fense is management. The second line of de-fense is compliance and oversight functions established by management. The final line of defense is independent assurance of compli-ance and control through an internal audit. The IIA is the internal audit profession’s global voice, recognized authority, acknowl-edged leader, chief advocate and principle ed-ucator. The IIA is a trusted resource, providing key standards, guidance and certifications for the internal audit profession. Further, The IIA’s certification programs en-sure that internal auditors are recognized as employing the highest standards to protect shareholder value and to ensure proper com-pliance and risk management procedures are followed. The IIA and its members are truly the leaders of the internal audit profession and are consistently recognized internationally as an organization setting industry standards. I have personally had the opportunity to meet with and discuss today’s challenges with The IIA over the years. I am proud of the work its members do and how their organization is run.

RECOGNIZING THE 2016 BLACK AND GOLD SCHOLARSHIP BALL AWARD RECIPIENTS 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 24, 2016 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-ognize the Joyce-Gillespie-Harrington Chari-table and Educational Foundation and the Zeta Upsilon Lambda Chapter of the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity on the occasion of their 36th annual Black and Gold Scholarship Ball. Since 1980, these two organizations have made tremendous contributions to promoting academic opportunities for youth in Northern Virginia and in the greater Washington, D.C., metropolitan region. The programs offered by the foundation are vital to the success of our students. This year’s Black and Gold Scholarship Ball will support scholarships for ten college-bound high school students. During the last eighteen years, ninety students have received scholar-ships awarded by the foundation and have at-tended some of the top colleges and univer-sities in the country. With the typical college graduate’s debt averaging about $30,000, the foundation’s continued support of these stu-dents is absolutely crucial. I am pleased to enter the following names of the 2016 scholarship winners: Alisha Harris (Robinson Secondary School), Charles Sterling (Stone Bridge HS), Cory Pringle (Annandale HS), Diego Flores (Herndon HS), Evan Belcher (AOS Stone Bridge HS),

IN RECOGNITION OF MAJOR MARISA PACE 
HON. JOSEPH CROWLEY 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 24, 2016 Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure I rise to pay tribute to Major Marisa Pace for her exemplary dedication to duty and service as an Army Congressional Liaison for the Chief of Army Reserve. In that role, she managed the Appropriations Portfolio for the Army Reserve. I am grateful that she will con-tinue to serve the Army and Congress in her new assignment as Plans Officer for the 1179th Surface Deployment and Distribution Command in Fort Hamilton, New York. I know we all wish her well in her new position. A native of Woodside, New York, Major Pace graduated from West Point in June of 2001 and was commissioned into the Trans-portation Corps as a 2nd Lieutenant. In the course of her career, she also earned a Mas-ter’s degree in Legislative Affairs from The George Washington University. Major Pace has served in a broad range of assignments during her 15 years of service as an officer in the United States Army. Prior to moving to the Army Congressional Liaison Of-fice in 2011, she was assigned to Head-quarters Army, G–4 (Logistics) as the Execu-tive Officer for the Director of the Transpor-tation and Distribution Directorate. She de-ployed in 2003 as a Platoon Leader with 68th Transportation Company, 28th Transportation Battalion, Mannheim, Germany and again in 2005 as the Plans and Training Officer for 37th Transportation Brigade out of Kaiserslautern, Germany. Major Pace’s other assignments include Osan Airbase, Korea, where she served as the Officer In Charge of the Movement Control Team from 2001–2002 and Germany, where she served as a Platoon Leader in 28th Transportation Battalion and the Headquarters and Headquarters Company Executive Officer and Training Officer for 37th Transportation Brigade. Her service in the Army Reserve is high-lighted by her selection in 2012 to serve as an Army Congressional Fellow. While assigned to the Office of the Chief of Army Reserve from 2012 to 2016, Major Pace spent a year rep-resenting the Army to the Congress by work-ing in the office of Senator Mary Landrieu (D– LA). In this role, Major Pace served as policy advisor on all matters relating to defense and national security. After this, she served as a legislative liaison in the Office of the Chief of Army Reserve. In this capacity, Major Pace di-rectly represented the Chief of Army Reserve to the Senate and House appropriations com-mittees to educate and inform Senators, Rep-resentatives, and staff on critical Army Re-serve funding issues. Major Pace grew accustomed to living so far from family during her time in the Army. So let me also acknowledge her parents, Paul and Renee Pace, her sisters Megan Pace and Michele Pace-Holthusen, her brother Paul Pace Jr. and her in-laws John Holthusen, Micky Harris and Janine Accardi for their un-wavering love and support. I thank them for their sacrifices as well and wish them all the best for continued success in the future. Throughout her 15 year career, Major Marisa Pace has made positive impacts on the careers and lives of her soldiers, peers, and superiors, and I am grateful that she has chosen to continue to serve back in our home state of New York. I join my colleagues today in honoring her dedication to our Nation and invaluable service to the United States Con-gress as an Army congressional liaison.

COMMEMORATING THE 66TH ANNI-VERSARY OF THE KOREAN WAR 
HON. CHARLES B. RANGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 24, 2016 Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recog-nize a very significant event in our nation’s history during which 1.8 million American men and women courageously served to defend freedom and liberty. June 25th of this year marks the 66th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War. As a veteran who almost died fighting in Korea, I would like to pay trib-ute to my comrades-in-arms and all those who never made it home. I thank Ambassador Ahn Ho-Young of the Republic of Korea and his Government for continually expressing gratitude to the Korean War veterans. He and his predecessors have annually honored the sacrifices through the wreath-laying ceremony at the National Ko-rean War Veterans Memorial. Through this commemoration, they have paid respect to our service members who went to a country they never knew, for people they never met, for the pursuit of democracy on the Korean peninsula and around the world. I also applaud over two million Korean Americans who are flourishing across the nation and have never ceased to express their appreciation to the Korean War veterans community. I am proud to have worked with my col-leagues Representatives SAMJOHNSON and J
OHN CONYERS , two other remaining veterans of the Korean War in Congress, to champion many bills that will cement the legacy of the Korean War veterans. Most recently, we spon-sored H.R. 1475, the Korean War Veterans Memorial Wall of Remembrance Act of 2015, which passed in the House. The Wall pays tribute to those who were killed in action, wounded, or listed as missing from the Korean War. The Wall serves as a reminder that America will never forget those who serve to promote and defend international security, economic prosperity, and peace. Mr. Speaker, our nation has a responsibility to make sure that we honor the members of the United States Armed Forces who served alongside the Republic of Korea and twenty other Allied nations. We have a responsibility to remember the 36,573 American lives and the 103,000 wounded to preserve the legacy of our Forgotten Victory. We have a responsi-bility to make sure we do not forget our men and women who sacrificed to defend the free-doms we enjoy. Since the Korean War, the United States and the Republic of Korea have established an enduring friendship with shared interests, such as denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, combatting aggression abroad, and strength-ening our economies. It is with great pride that I have witnessed Korea rise to become an in-fluential, international leader out of ashes of war. Its rapid and successful transformation testifies to the victorious efforts of our vet-erans. The Korean War must never again be called the Forgotten War and the American people must never forget our heroes.

HONORING MS. MARINA TORRES 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 24, 2016 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Ms. Marina Torres who is being honored by the Calistoga Associated Teachers upon her retirement after 35 years of service to Calistoga Elementary School and our Calistoga community. Ms. Torres, a native of Monterey Park, Cali-fornia, earned two Bachelor of Arts degrees. One from the University of California at Santa Barbara for Combined Social Sciences in 1979 and one from Sonoma State University for Latino Studies with a minor in Children’s Literature in 1981. Throughout her long tenure as a teacher at Calistoga Elementary, Ms. Torres has been a dedicated mentor to her students and a pio-neer in bilingual education for young children. In fact, Ms. Torres was the first Latina teacher hired by the Calistoga Joint Unified School District in 1981. She translated her academic and personal background into a passion for educating students about living in a culturally diverse community. Ms. Torres launched the Student Advocate Program in 1987 to address the needs of stu-dents in crisis and was inducted into the ‘‘Who’s Who of American Teachers’’ in 1995 for her innovative teaching and dedication to her students’ needs. Ms. Torres shares her

experience with new teachers starting their ca-reers as a beginning teacher support and as-sessment provider in Napa County. A resilient fighter, Ms. Torres has overcome two different forms of cancer. Now in remis-sion, she is an outspoken advocate for early cancer screening and expanding access to health care. During retirement, she plans to continue her support for at-risk children and for expanding education in the Calistoga com-munity. Mr. Speaker, Marina Torres has devoted 35 years to serving her students and our commu-nity as both a teacher and an advocate for others’ needs. She is a friend of Calistoga and a friend of mine. Therefore, it is fitting and proper that we honor her here today and ex-tend our best wishes for an enjoyable retire-ment and many happy memories to come with her husband Michael and her children Frank, Rafael and Liliana. TRIBUTE TO DR. T. WAYNE BAILEY 
HON. JOHN L. MICA 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 24, 2016 Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Dr. T. Wayne Bailey of Stetson Uni-versity who will be retiring this year. After more than half-a-century of faculty tenure and teaching thousands of students who pursued careers in public service, he announced his retirement at the end of this semester. Few individuals in Florida history have had a more significant impact on political policy or in advancing the careers of those dedicated to public service. In 1963, he founded Stetson University’s Department of Political Science and was a cofounder of the Stetson University Model Student Senate, which has hosted thousands of students for both memorable and valuable learning experiences. Generations of Stetson students studied civics, political science and public policy under his tutelage. His positive influence has advanced the ca-reers of federal leaders, including Members of Congress, many federal and state office hold-ers and public servants in Florida and through-out our Nation. Dr. Bailey has also been an active leader in the local, State and National Democratic Party. He has been the State of Florida Demo-cratic Party Chair, National Committeeman and a delegate to numerous Democratic Na-tional Conventions. He has been a leader and active in the American Lung Association, Tiger Bay, Florida Hospital DeLand Foundation and numerous other local, community and state or-ganizations. The Discovery Channel presented Dr. Bailey with their Discovery Health Channel Medical Honors award. It was my pleasure to first meet with Dr. Bailey and Dr. Bud Fleuchaus as they led the Volusia County Charter Review Commission. His knowledge and insight helped develop and enact that County’s first Charter and local gov-ernment Constitution. Mr. Speaker, today I ask you and our col-leagues to join me in recognizing a great Flo-ridian and a dedicated American, my friend, Dr. T. Wayne Bailey. His life and work signifi-cantly impacted thousands. I congratulate him on the occasion of his retirement and for his years of dedication and service to Stetson University of DeLand, Florida.
