The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was called to order by the President pro tempore (Mr. H
ATCH ).

PRAYER The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-fered the following prayer: Let us pray. Savior of all, make us patient and kind. Help us to not do to others what we wouldn’t want done to us. Lord, fill the hearts of our Senators with Your overflowing love. Enable them to love their neighbors as You have commanded them to do. Plant within our lawmakers a sure con-fidence in Your prevailing providence. Renew and refresh them for the chal-lenges of this day. Keep them congenial with their colleagues, ever eager to ex-plore common ground. We pray in Your great Name. Amen.

FAA REAUTHORIZATION BILL Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator T
HUNE , says that keeping Americans safe from future attacks is a top priority. He is right, of course. From Brussels to Egypt, events around the world underscore the need for stronger security measures for our Na-tion’s air traffic. That is why I was glad when large bi-partisan majorities voted last week to advance the FAA Reauthorization Act and then to strengthen it further with the most comprehensive airline secu-rity reforms in years. We appreciate Senator THUNE ’s work with the Aviation Subcommittee chair, Senator A
YOTTE , as well as Senators N
ELSON and C ANTWELL , to move an amendment designed to keep pas-sengers safer and to help deter ter-rorism in airports on U.S. soil. The amendment will help shore up security measures for international flights com-ing into the United States as well as improve vetting and inspections of air-port employees. I would also like to recognize Sen-ator H
EINRICH for his work to include provisions that will increase security measures in prescreening airport zones and expand preparation for active shooter events. This FAA reauthorization legislation will do more for security than any other in years. It will do more for pas-sengers than any other in years as well. Don’t take my word for it. A con-sumer columnist for the Washington Post labeled it ‘‘one of the most pas-senger-friendly Federal Aviation Ad-ministration reauthorization bills in a generation.’’ It includes a number of consumer-friendly provisions, like fee disclosures and refunds for lost bags or services paid for but not received, and does so without imposing choice-lim-iting regulations or fees and taxes on airline passengers. This is a good bill and a good exam-ple of what can get accomplished with a Senate that is back to work. It would help keep Americans safe, both in our airports and in the skies. It has en-joyed support from both sides of the aisle. If Members have additional ideas they think might strengthen the bill further, I would again encourage them to work with the bill managers so we can continue moving forward. RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER The PRESIDING OFFICER. The mi-nority leader is recognized. f 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS Mr. REID. Mr. President, later today the Senate will confirm Waverly Cren-shaw to serve as a district judge for the Middle District of Tennessee. Mr. Crenshaw is a superb nominee with impeccable credentials and a sharp legal mind. He works at a pres-tigious law firm in Nashville, where he became the first ever African-Amer-ican partner. Mr. Crenshaw is well liked by Demo-crats and well liked by Republicans. His nomination is supported by the Re-publican Senators from Tennessee, and the Judiciary Committee reported his nomination unanimously. Waverly Crenshaw’s confirmation is desperately needed. The vacancy he will fill in the Middle District of Ten-nessee is a judicial emergency, mean-ing there are more cases than the judges in that district can administer. While I am pleased the Senate will confirm Mr. Crenshaw later today, I wonder why this eminently qualified nominee wasn’t confirmed a long time ago. It has been more than a year since President Obama nominated him. The Judiciary Committee reported his nomination unanimously more than 9 months ago. That a consensus nominee like Wa-verly Crenshaw had to wait so long to be confirmed is another example—and not a good one—of Senate Republicans’ concerted effort to undermine the American judiciary system. The Re-publican leader and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee are leading an all-out assault on our Na-tion’s courts by depriving them of qualified judges. Americans know of Republicans’ un-precedented obstruction of President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee,

Merrick Garland. Republican gridlock is precluding Judge Garland from a hearing and a vote. But that same grid-lock is extending to important lower court nominees also. Republicans’ slow-walking and ob-struction of circuit and district court nominees is so pronounced that it is actually making history, and I am not sure it is good history. To date, this Republican-controlled Senate has confirmed only 16 judicial nominations. Today will be the 17th. According to the nonpartisan Congres-sional Research Service, that is good enough to make this Republican Sen-ate the worst at confirming circuit court and district court judges. Chairman G
RASSLEY is running the least productive Judiciary Committee since World War II, measured in both judges reported out of committee and judges confirmed. Because of the Re-publicans’ sloth, judiciary emergencies have nearly tripled, leaving our courts overworked and Americans without prompt access to their judiciary sys-tem. Republicans are refusing to do their job, and the American people are suffering as a result. Republican efforts to cripple our judiciary will rever-berate for decades, preventing Ameri-cans from obtaining justice. It is time for the Republican leader and the senior Senator from Iowa to put an end to this obstruction. It is time they discontinue using the Senate Judiciary Committee as a political arm of the Republican leader’s office and start doing their job. This should begin by doing their constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on Presi-dent Obama’s Supreme Court nominee. The Republican leader and Senator G
RASSLEY should give Judge Garland a hearing and a vote. They should stop stalling, hoping that Donald Trump or T
ED CRUZ will nominate Justice Scalia’s successor. This should give even Republicans pause. Then the Republican leader and the Judiciary Committee should move the backlog of qualified judicial nomina-tions who are awaiting confirmation— and there are a lot of them—nominees like Paula Xinis, whom President Obama nominated to serve as a judge for the District Court of Maryland. Ms. Xinis, who is a partner in a renowned Baltimore law firm, has 13 years of ex-perience as a Federal public defender. For 5 years she worked as the director of training for the Office of the Federal Public Defender in all of Maryland. The Judiciary Committee reported Ms. Xinis 7 months ago. Yet, for more than half a year, Senator G
RASSLEY  has ignored her nomination. She is not alone. The Republican leader is delaying other qualified, con-sensus nominations. Edward Stanton was nominated to the Western District of Tennessee and is supported by Senator A
LEXANDER  and, of course, Senator C
ORKER . The committee reported his nomination in October. Robert Rossiter was nominated to the District of Nebraska and has the support of both of his home State Re-publican Senators. The committee re-ported his nomination in October. And there are two nominees to the Western District of Pennsylvania, Susan Paradise Baxter and Marilyn Jean Horan, who were recommended by Senators CASEY and T OOMEY . But even though it was recommended by a Re-publican Senator, the committee re-ported the nominations in January but hasn’t done anything since. There are many other nominees whom the Judiciary Committee is ig-noring altogether—not even holding hearings. So why aren’t Republican Senators pressing the Republican leader to do his job and schedule votes on these stalled nominations? Why isn’t the Ju-diciary Committee doing their part to get these judges confirmed? Why isn’t the chairman of the committee doing his part? This is the same Senator G
RASSLEY  who in 2008 said this: 
We should get our job done and confirm these nominees because that is what it takes for the judicial branch to get their work done. The judiciary needs to have the per-sonnel to get their job done. 
So let’s do what Senator G RASSLEY  said a few years ago. Let’s get the job done. From the Supreme Court down to the district courts, let’s get the job done for our Nation’s judiciary.

AFFORDABLE CARE ACT Mr. REID. Mr. President, last Thurs-day a Gallup and Healthways survey revealed more good news about the ever-shrinking rate of uninsured Amer-icans. Because of the Affordable Care Act, 91 percent of American adults now have health insurance. ObamaCare has been especially helpful to working Ameri-cans. For adults making less than $36,000, the uninsured rate has been cut by one-third. Ninety-two percent of Americans making between $36,000 and $90,000 a year now have health insur-ance. Every day more and more people who were previously without health insur-ance are now covered. That is espe-cially true across racial and ethnic lines, where the uninsured rate is plummeting. According to this survey, ‘‘across key subgroups, blacks and His-panics have experienced the largest de-clines in their uninsured rates since the fourth quarter of 2013.’’ The numbers really bear that out. The uninsured rate for African-Ameri-cans has dropped by more than 50 per-cent, and the uninsured rate for His-panics has dropped by more than 25 percent. These are the facts. All across the Nation, our constituents are get-ting the health care coverage they were promised when Congress passed the Affordable Care Act. So I think it is time for our Repub-lican colleagues to stop denying the evidence. The evidence is that ObamaCare is working for the Amer-ican people. Mr. President, I see no one on the floor. I ask the Chair to announce the business for the remainder of the day. f

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MARKEY.

FAA REAUTHORIZATION BILL Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a number of my amendments to the FAA reauthoriza-tion bill. I filed Markey amendment No. 3467 to protect consumers from ridiculously high airline fees. In recent years, fees have gone up despite the fact that gas prices and airline choices have gone down. Regrettably, the only thing com-petitive about the current airline in-dustry is the battle for overhead com-partment space. Since 2001, 10 major airlines have become 4, allowing air carriers to charge ridiculous fees and act in uncompetitive ways. The four major airlines now control 80 percent of the seat capacity in the United States. At some major airports, pas-sengers only have one or two airlines to choose from. Airline fees have climbed as high as the planes on which passengers are traveling. We must stop their rapid as-cent to protect the everyday airline passenger. According to an excellent report released by Ranking Member N
ELSON last year, three airlines in-creased checked baggage fees by 67 per-cent between 2009 and 2014 and four air-lines increased domestic cancellation fees by 33 percent. One increased its fee by 50 percent, and one increased its fee by 66 percent. Airlines should not be al-lowed to overcharge captive passengers just because they need to change their flight or check a couple of bags. It is just not fair. There is no justification for charging consumers a $200 fee to re-sell a $150 ticket that was cancelled well in advance when the airline can then resell that ticket for a higher fare to a different traveler. Further, air-lines such as Delta, United, and Amer-ican charge as much as $25 for the first

checked bag and $35 for the second bag even though there appears to be no ap-preciable cost increase for processing the second bag. That is $60 to check two bags one-way or $120 round-trip to check two bags. My amendment prohibits airlines from imposing fees that are not reason-able and proportional to the costs of the services provided. This common-sense consumer protection does not prevent airlines from charging fees; the amendment simply caps airline fees at a fair rate to ensure that passengers are not getting tipped upside down at the ticket counter. I am pleased that Senators B
LUMENTHAL and K LOBUCHAR have co-sponsored my amendment. I offered this amendment in the Commerce Committee, and it received a vote of 12 to 12. It is time to break this tie on the Senate floor. Further, my amendment enjoys broad support from several groups, in-cluding the National Consumers League, the Consumer Federation of America, and Travelers United. Mr. President, I intend to offer my cyber security amendments as well, Markey amendment Nos. 3468, 3469, and 3470. In December, I sent letters to 12 do-mestic airlines and two airplane manu-factures requesting information on the cyber security protections on their air-craft and computer systems. What I found was startling. Currently, airlines are not required to report attempted or successful cyber attacks to the govern-ment. Let me say that again. Airlines are not required to report attempted or successful cyber attacks to the Federal Government. According to the National Air Car-rier Association, which represents Alle-giant, Spirit, and Sun Country—some of the country’s smaller airlines—some of their carriers experience several hundred hacking attempts into their system every single day, but since there is no requirement to share this information with the FAA, potentially valuable cyber security information may not get to the other airlines, man-ufacturers, and regulators. My amend-ments address these concerns by man-dating that airlines disclose cyber at-tacks to the FAA, directing the FAA to establish comprehensive cyber security standards, and commissioning a study to evaluate the safety and security risks associated with Wi-Fi on planes. My amendments enjoy broad support from the Association of Flight Attend-ants, the Federal Law Enforcement Of-ficers Association, and the Inter-national Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. Mr. President, finally, on drone pri-vacy, in committee we added a require-ment that government operators dis-close where they fly drones, the pur-pose of the flight, and whether the drone contains cameras, thermal imag-ing, or cell phone interceptors. My amendment would extend those re-quirements to commercial drone opera-tors. I encourage all Senators to support my amendments. I thank the Chair for giving me this opportunity to address the Chamber. I yield back the remainder of my time. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this week the Senate is continuing its con-sideration of the reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration and bringing important improvements in terms of aviation infrastructure and public safety. I am glad the Senate voted—notwithstanding the impression I think people get from the outside that all we do is bicker and we don’t actually solve any problems. I am glad the Senate has worked in a bipartisan way to move this legislation forward. We have a lot of heavy lifting left to do on this legislation this week, and none of these issues is easy, but it is impor-tant we do everything we can to dem-onstrate to the American people that our interests are their interests in moving bipartisan solutions forward for their benefit. 
NATIONAL CRIME VICTIMS ’ RIGHTS WEEK  
Mr. President, I wish to just take a moment and point out that this week is also a very important week because it is National Crime Victims’ Rights Week. Too often crime victims in our coun-try aren’t treated with the fairness and respect they deserve. So often it seems as though we focus our attention on those who commit the crime and not nearly enough on those who are vic-tims of crime they had no part in insti-gating but perhaps happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. When we don’t show the proper respect for victims of crime, it can lead to distrust in our communities between law en-forcement and the public, and it can make our country a more dangerous place. The fact is, our law enforcement pro-fessionals work best with community cooperation. Frequently, the commu-nity can be the eyes and the ears for law enforcement and help give them in-formation they need in order to pre-vent crime from occurring in the first place or to make a show of force to in fact deter the commission of a crime. When I was Texas attorney general, I had the privilege of overseeing our State’s Crime Victims’ Compensation Fund. This is an idea which said we ought to take the fines and the pen-alties from people who commit crimes and then use those funds to make grants to the victims of crime and the people who attempt to help them heal and recover from the consequences. Time and time again, I saw that when we don’t support the victims of crime, they and their families aren’t the only ones who suffer. It can also impede law enforcement efforts when they feel this disjuncture or disconnection between the victims and the law enforcement professionals. So it is important for many reasons—out of basic fairness and compassion but also in the inter-ests of law enforcement, generally, to make sure we do everything we can to keep law enforcement and the victims of crime on the same page and the com-munities in which they reside. We need to continually look for ways to improve our support for crime vic-tims. One way we can do this is by con-tinuing assistance to State and local governments in a variety of ways. We recently had a hearing on the intersec-tion of mental illness and law enforce-ment. Unfortunately, in our society today—because of the deinstitu-tionalization of people with mental ill-ness, with no safety net to take its place—many people who suffer from mental illness are residing in our jails, filling our emergency rooms, or simply living on our streets. So we need to re-direct more than just the 1 percent of funds currently directed by the Federal Government to State and local law en-forcement for support and training. We need to redirect more of that in a tar-geted fashion to deal with this crisis in mental illness. Here is an anecdote. Recently, I had the chance to meet with some members of the Major County Sheriffs’ Associa-tion. The sheriff of Bexar County, TX, a friend of mine, said: How would you like to meet the largest mental health provider in the United States? I said:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES1844 April 11, 2016 
Well, sure. Who is that? She said: Meet the sheriff of Los Angeles County. This made a deep impression on me, and it tells me we still have a lot to do. Another example of where the Fed-eral Government can play an appro-priate support role for local and State law enforcement—and I am not sug-gesting the Federal Government take over State and local law enforcement, far from it. Rather, the Federal Gov-ernment should recognize and support the important role that local and State law enforcement play and provide that support, where possible, here at the Federal level. Nowhere else have I found that more important recently than our efforts to try to audit and test the massive na-tionwide rape kit backlog. It has been estimated there are 400,000 rape kits collected from the forensic evidence from sexual assaults that remain un-tested. We know these rape kits con-tain vital DNA evidence that can put criminals behind bars, exonerate the falsely accused, and help detect those who commit crimes serially—not just once but over and over and over again until they are ultimately caught. As we know, many communities at the local level simply do not have the re-sources or expertise to test these rape kits in a timely fashion, so that is an area where we can help. That means that while evidence is collecting dust on a shelf for years, criminals will re-main loose—unless we continue to act—and make it impossible for the victims of these crimes to find closure. I will give just one example. Last year Houston had a backlog of thousands of rape kits going back into the 1980s. Fortunately, due to resources provided by the Federal Government under the Debbie Smith Act, and with the determination of the local leader-ship, Mayor Annise Parker, the city of Houston, began to work with the State of Texas and the Federal Government to eliminate Houston’s rape kit back-log. So far they have tested thousands of rape kits, resulting in 850 CODIS matches. That is the DNA check sys-tem run by the FBI, where when people have been arrested for offenses in the past, their DNA information is re-corded in this data base and then can be matched against that collected in a rape kit or other forensic evidence. So just as a result of the city of Houston undertaking this massive effort—again, with the cooperation of the State and Federal Government—to eliminate its rape kit backlog, they have gotten 850 hits in the CODIS system. In other words, by testing the evidence they al-ready had, Houston officials have been able to identify hundreds of people who are perpetrators of crime—because the DNA evidence does not lie—and to place them at the scene of a crime. Again, as we find out, sadly, people who commit sexual assaults frequently don’t do it just once in their life. Many of them do it serially or until they get caught, looking for victims of oppor-tunity—sometimes even children. It is terrible. Fortunately, with the tools and re-sources provided by the Debbie Smith Act and something called the SAFER Act, Houston will complete the testing of all backlogged rape kits this year. This is important because in the past, testing of these rape kits was viewed as mainly a way of just confirming the identity of the assailant using DNA evidence, but frequently the identity of the assailant is not an issue in these cases, and it is expensive to test rape kits. Frequently, the assailant is known and the question is one of con-sent or nonconsent. What we have found is by testing more rape kits— even where the issue of identity is not in question—we can literally tie these defendants in criminal cases to other sexual assaults in a way that is a pret-ty powerful and pretty revolutionary way. I am proud of the work Houston and the State of Texas are doing, working with the Federal Government, to end the rape kit backlog, but it is going to take a lot more work from us on an on-going and long-term basis because, first, one of the things we need to do, which Congress has already required, is an audit to make sure we know where all of these rape kits are—whether they are sitting in an evidence locker or whether they are still sitting in a po-lice station in an investigation locker. We need to make sure there is an audit done so we can get our arms around the size and scope of the problem. Then we need to redirect more of the resources the Federal Government has already appropriated money for under the Debbie Smith Act to actually test these rape kits. This is very important because we need the survivors of sexual assault to know we continue to stand with them in their fight. Thank goodness for brave women such as Debbie Smith and so many oth-ers whom I have met along the way who I think demonstrate not only their own courage but also give other people courage to stand up for their own rights when they are, through no fault of their own, victims of sexual assault. The Crime Victims’ Rights Week is more than just about this crime of sex-ual assault. It is about respect for all victims of crime. That is why I am proud to be working with the senior Senator from Vermont, Mr. L
EAHY , and Congressman T
EDPOEof Houston, TX, on the Justice for All Reauthorization Act. This is comprehensive legislation to increase rights and protections for crime victims across the country. It will reauthorize the landmark Justice for All Act signed into law by Presi-dent George W. Bush in 2004. As part of the reauthorization, it will also increase the collection of com-pensation and restitution for crime vic-tims, it will protect the housing rights of domestic violence victims, and it will strengthen the forensic sciences to swiftly put criminals behind bars and to improve the integrity of the forensic testing. Frequently, we know that both the expertise and the equipment used by local governments and law enforce-ment are sometimes pretty spotty. In order to maintain the integrity of this important and powerful type of evi-dence, it is very importants we provide some guidance—perhaps best prac-tices—for forensic sciences. We have the ability to do that because of the re-sources of the Federal Government; again, not to commander or mandate but basically to help local and State governments improve their forensic sciences and their testing. This legislation will also improve ac-cess to legal and health care resources for all victims and will ensure that we are efficiently providing direct services for crime victims on a national basis. This legislation is supported by more than 130 different law enforcement and victim advocacy organizations nation-wide, including the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network—the so-called RAINN organization—the National Dis-trict Attorneys Association, the Na-tional Center for Victims of Crime, the International Union of Police Organi-zations, the National Network to End Domestic Violence, and the National Organization for Women. It is a pretty broad spectrum of organizations along the political or ideological spectrum, and they are all unified in supporting this important bill. This Chamber has done what it takes to help victims in the past, and we should continue to build on the legacy of legislation like the Justice for Vic-tims of Trafficking Act, a law that is already making a clear difference in the lives of victims across the country. One of the best moments in this Chamber last year was when we passed the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act by a vote of 99 to 0. It was a rare and welcomed coming together of all Members, from all different parts of the country, all across the ideological spectrum, to enact the most important assistance for victims of human traf-ficking that we have done in basically 25 years, providing for something as basic as shelter for victims of human trafficking, when many of them had nowhere to live or to turn. One of the important pieces of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act was something called the HERO Pro-gram. This was primarily inserted into the legislation at the request of the Senator from Illinois, Mr. M
ARKKIRK, a veteran of the U.S. Navy himself. Just yesterday, the Army Times ran a story on a program that was perma-nently authorized under the bill known as HERO, which trains veterans to work alongside Federal law enforce-ment officials to go after child preda-tors—in other words, using some of the expertise the veterans acquired in their training and their service in the mili-tary to help victims of child pornog-raphy and the predation, unfortu-nately, that happens too often on the most innocent. So far, according to this article, the program has already trained about 80 different veterans with plans to train

40 more this year, giving many of these veterans—some of whom have been se-riously injured during the course of their military service—a real purpose in life. Indeed, in the Army Times story I mentioned just a moment ago, there are some heartrending, touching stories about how, even for people who suffered very traumatic injuries during their military service, this gives them a new sense of purpose and focus, and it is very, very encouraging. I had the chance to see the HERO program in action last year in San An-tonio, and it is protecting our children and taking criminals off the street. It is pretty clear that when we set our minds to it, we can make a difference in the lives of crime victims. We proved that with the passage of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, and we can do it again. I encourage all of our colleagues to consider supporting the Justice for All Reauthorization Act. This is a bi-cameral, bipartisan proposal that would help victims get the support they need and they deserve. As advocates and survivors across the country use this week to highlight the needs of millions of crime victims, let’s also remember that we have a re-sponsibility and an opportunity to do something about it right here in this Chamber. Mr. President, I don’t see anyone in-terested in recognition, so I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
ZIKA VIRUS  
Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, the Zika virus is getting very serious. Today one of the officials at the Cen-ters for Disease Control said that ‘‘this is scarier than we initially thought.’’ As to a pregnant woman who is in-fected with the Zika virus, it may not only cause the fetus to be deformed with a much smaller head, but they are finding other birth defects as well as premature births. Normal, otherwise healthy people who become infected with the virus usually have relatively mild flu-like symptoms, but there are devastating consequences when the virus is contracted by a woman who is pregnant. Today the CDC said: ‘‘Most of what we’ve learned is not reas-suring.’’ They also said: ‘‘Everything we look at with this virus seems to be a bit scarier than we initially thought.’’ That is coming straight from the experts at CDC. When you look at where this virus is, unfortunately, there are more people in my State of Florida who have the virus than in any other State in the country. Nationwide, there are multiples of hun-dreds who have the virus. In the State of Florida, we have identified just under 100 people who have the virus. Thankfully, of those who were infected in Florida, none of them contracted it in Florida; they contracted the virus someplace else. There is a vast amount of traveling that goes on between Florida and Puer-to Rico. Puerto Rico is one source where the virus is coming from. When that mosquito bites you, it transmits the virus, and that mosquito is quite prevalent in Puerto Rico. So the island is having its own trauma with the Zika virus manifesting there, but there is also a source in other countries throughout Central America, the Car-ibbean, and Latin America. What do we need to do? Well, one lit-tle bit of good news I can give you is that the bill we passed in the Senate before the Easter recess is now in the House, and it will be taken up by the House tomorrow. They should pass it and send it to the President’s desk for signature. What that bill does is give financial incentive to the drug compa-nies by adding Zika as a virus to the list of tropical diseases for which the drug companies have a financial incen-tive to go and find a cure or a vaccine. This bill is complicated as far as what the financial incentives will be. I could explain that, but for purposes of discus-sion here, I just wanted to share that little bit of good news. We are going to have that bill in law, and we want to unleash the creative potential of our pharmaceutical industry to go and find a cure or vaccine that will take care of it. The other side of it is what the CDC is saying is scarier than we thought, and that is the fact that it is having such devastating societal and medical consequences for a woman who is preg-nant and gets the virus. We can imag-ine the trauma to that family with a deformed child being born as a result of the virus. We can imagine the expense to society of a child who is severely handicapped. As a result, we are talk-ing about major effort. There is something else we can do about it; that is, the President’s budg-etary request has $1.9 billion specifi-cally targeted for helping to do the re-search on the Zika virus. It is my hope, and I know I have the cooperation and, indeed, the considerable help and en-ergy of my colleague from Florida, Senator R
UBIO, in wanting to seek this and to get successfully in the appro-priations bill for the Department of HHS the $1.9 billion to continue the re-search and all of the ancillary expenses that are coming as a result of it. Down the road, we will find a vac-cine. Down the road, we will be able to manage this problem. But, in the meantime, there is a great deal of trau-ma, some extraordinary heartbreak to some families, which should be, again, the warning: If you are pregnant, do not go anywhere exposing the skin to a mosquito bite, particularly in those re-gions with that variety of mosquito that carries the Zika virus. So I hope by this time tomorrow night, we will say one hallelujah that the House bill has passed, the Senate bill has passed the House, and it is on the way to the President’s desk for sig-nature. Then, let’s take up this issue in the appropriations bill when it hits the floor in another few weeks. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COATS ). The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. NELSON.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will pro-ceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Waverly D. Crenshaw, Jr., of Tennessee, to be United States District Judge for the Middle District of Tennessee. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 minutes for debate only on the nomina-tion, equally divided in the usual form. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time dur-ing quorum calls be charged equally. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. NELSON.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, in December of 2014, Judge William Jo-seph Haynes, Jr., of the Middle District of Tennessee, assumed senior status, creating a vacancy on the Middle Dis-trict bench. That vacancy has resulted in increased caseloads for the three ac-tive Federal district judges—Judge Sharp, Judge Campbell, and Judge Trauger. Fortunately, help is on the way. In June, Senator C
ORKER and I had the pleasure of introducing Waverly Crenshaw to the Senate Judiciary Committee when it met to consider his nomination. I was pleased that the committee agreed with our position, and they reported out his nomination by voice vote the following month. It’s easy to see why Tennesseans sup-port Mr. Crenshaw and are excited about his nomination—and the pros-pect that the Senate will confirm him tonight. He was born in Nashville, and then he stayed—attending Vanderbilt

University for both college and law school. After law school, he clerked for Judge John Nixon in the Middle Dis-trict of Tennessee, the same court where we hope he will soon serve. After his clerkship, he worked for the Ten-nessee attorney general before entering private practice. In 1987 he became an associate of a small labor and employ-ment law firm in Nashville. In 1990 he joined one of our largest firms—Waller Lansden Dortch & Davis—where he is currently a partner. He is also active in the Nashville community serving as unpaid legal counsel to the Nashville Conventions and Visitors Corporation, the Ten-nessee Independent Colleges and Uni-versities Association, and the YWCA, among others. The Middle District of Tennessee is fortunate to have such a well-qualified nominee. Waverly Crenshaw is a man of good character and of good tempera-ment, and today I encourage my col-leagues to vote for his confirmation. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-ior Senator from Tennessee. Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I am glad to join the senior Senator, as I have many times, but I thank him for his comments about this distinguished person whom I hope is going to be con-firmed this afternoon as a district court judge. When the White House began looking for someone to fill this position, I spoke with people, as I am sure Sen-ator A
LEXANDER did, across Middle Tennessee to really find someone who not only would serve in his position well but had, in his current role, been involved in the community and had done many other things outside of law to benefit the community itself. Cer-tainly, this is someone who has done that. It became very clear that he has dis-tinguished himself not only as a tal-ented attorney but also as a well re-spected leader in the Nashville commu-nity. As Lamar has mentioned, he is a lifelong Middle Tennessee resident. He received his law degree from Vander-bilt University. He was the first Afri-can-American attorney at the Waller law firm, and he has been a partner since 1994. He served as Tennessee’s assistant attorney general from 1984 to 1987, and as a law clerk, as was mentioned, for the Honorable John Nixon. This is ex-actly the branch he hopes to serve in. I am confident he will serve the peo-ple of Middle Tennessee in this new role in an honorable fashion. I am proud to be here to support him with our senior Senator and with so many other people, by the way, in Middle Tennessee who want to see him con-firmed in this position. I hope others will join us today in confirming him, and I look forward to him serving. By the way, it is a place where there is a dire need to have someone of his capac-ity. We have many cases that are backed up. This is one of those places where we not only need someone to fill the role, but we need someone as dis-tinguished as Mr. Crenshaw. I thank the Presiding Officer for the time. This Senator looks forward to his confirmation. I hope everyone will join in confirming this nominee. I yield the floor. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we will finally vote on the nomination of Waverly Crenshaw to fill a judicial emergency vacancy in the Federal Dis-trict Court in the Middle District of Tennessee. This vacancy has been open since December 2014, and Mr. Crenshaw was nominated over a year ago, on Feb-ruary 4, 2015. He has the support of his two Republican home State Senators, Senators ALEXANDER and C ORKER . He was voted out of the Judiciary Com-mittee by unanimous voice vote last summer on July 9, 2015. There is no good reason why it has taken 14 months to confirm this nominee. Mr. Crenshaw is currently a partner at the law firm Waller Lansden Dortch & Davis, LLP, in Nashville. Mr. Cren-shaw was the first African-American partner at Waller, and in his nearly three-decade career in private practice, he has tried approximately 50 cases to verdict. Mr. Crenshaw also served for 3 years in the Tennessee attorney gen-eral’s office as an assistant attorney general. He has the experience and qualifications necessary to serve on the Federal bench, and he should be con-firmed. This is our first judicial confirmation vote in 2 months. In the last 2 years of the Bush administration—with a Democratic majority—the Senate con-firmed 68 judges. This new Congress, the Republican leadership has allowed only 16 judges to be confirmed since they gained the majority last year. This record of obstruction began last year, when Senate Republicans con-firmed the fewest judicial nominees in more than half a century. Senate Republican leadership is fail-ing our Federal judiciary with their ob-struction of judicial confirmations. When Senate Republicans took over the majority in January of last year, there were 43 judicial vacancies. Since then, vacancies have dramatically in-creased more than 75 percent to 79. Furthermore, the number of judicial vacancies deemed to be ‘‘emergencies’’ by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts because caseloads in those courts are unmanageably high has nearly tripled under Republican Senate leadership—from 12 when Republicans took over last year to 34 today. After we vote on Mr. Crenshaw’s nomination, 19 judicial nominees will remain pending on the Executive Cal-endar. This includes nominees with home state support from Republican Senators, including Robert Rossiter for the Federal District Court in the Dis-trict of Nebraska; Edward Stanton for the Federal District Court in the West-ern District of Tennessee; and Susan Baxter and Marilyn Horan for the Fed-eral District Court in the Western Dis-trict of Pennsylvania. We can reduce the empty judgeships in those states if Republican leadership would allow timely votes on the pend-ing judicial nominees on the Executive Calendar. All of those nominees were reported out of the Judiciary Com-mittee by voice vote. There should not be any further delay in confirming them. Last Thursday, the Leadership Con-ference on Civil and Human Rights and 42 other organizations submitted a let-ter to Chairman GRASSLEY expressing their dismay with the failure of the Ju-diciary Committee to do its job to process nominees for our Federal trial and appellate courts, creating a grow-ing backlog of judicial nominations. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the R
ECORD a copy of this letter at the end of my statement. The American people expect Senators to do their jobs. This is true with judi-cial nominations to the lower courts, but it is even more crucial for the Su-preme Court of the United States be-cause no one can fill in for the vacant seat on our highest Court. In just the last few weeks, the Supreme Court has deadlocked twice, so it was unable to serve its constitutional function. Re-fusing to consider Chief Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court is not only unfair to him, it is irresponsible and a threat to a functioning democ-racy. A recent poll shows that nearly 70 percent of Americans—including a ma-jority of Republicans—say that the Senate should hold a hearing for Chief Judge Garland. That is what the Amer-ican people are saying, but Republicans are refusing to hear them. Instead of listening to their constituents, they are listening to powerful interest groups. Since public confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominees began in 1916, the Senate has never denied a Supreme Court nominee a hearing and a vote. And based on the Senate’s precedent for decades, the Senate Judiciary Com-mittee should hold a hearing for Chief Judge Garland this month. A public hearing would allow Ameri-cans to engage in the process of consid-ering the nomination and hear directly from Chief Judge Garland, but Senate Republicans continue to refuse to do their jobs. Instead, Republicans have outsourced their job to political inter-est groups whose only goal is to raise millions of dollars to launch a smear campaign against the nominee’s admi-rable record of public service. These outside groups are not accountable to the American people. They do not have the American people’s interest in mind. They are private, powerful groups whose only goal is to advance their own special interests at any cost. These special interest groups are spending millions of dollars in dark money to run ads distorting Chief Judge Garland’s record. At the same time, Republican Senators are plan-ning to deny Chief Judge Garland a chance to defend himself at a public

hearing. It is wrong, it is harmful, and it is unfair. Some Senators have claimed that their unprecedented obstruction against Chief Judge Garland is based on ‘‘principle, not the person.’’ But it is not principled to attack Chief Judge Garland’s sterling career and then refuse to allow him the chance to re-spond at a public hearing. Rather than following the demands of unaccountable interest groups, Re-publicans should listen to the Amer-ican people who want to see real lead-ership in Washington. Americans want Republicans to do their jobs and con-sider for themselves the merits of Chief Judge Garland’s record through a pub-lic hearing and a vote. I am glad that several Republican Senators have agreed to meet with Chief Judge Garland. This is a person who has spent almost three decades in public service and has more Federal ju-dicial experience than any Supreme Court nominee in history. Those who meet with Chief Judge Garland will see what I have seen: that he has an excep-tional legal mind and a deep respect for the Constitution. His commitment to public service is inspiring, from his days at the Justice Department work-ing as a prosecutor on the ground in the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing to his nearly two decades as a Federal appellate judge. But simply meeting with Chief Judge Garland is not enough. The Senate must act on his nomination. In the last several weeks, the Supreme Court deadlocked twice and was not able to carry out its constitutional role as the final arbiter of our Nation’s laws. Where you live will impact what your rights are. That is unacceptable and contrary to our constitutional system. If Republicans’ irresponsible obstruc-tion of Chief Judge Garland does not stop, this will continue at the Supreme Court for two terms. I hope Senate Republicans will listen to the American people, roll up their sleeves, and do their job. We must carry out one of our most important and solemn responsibilities and con-sider the Supreme Court nomination before us. There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R

THELEADERSHIP CONFERENCE  
ONCIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS , Washington DC, April 7, 2016. Hon. C
HARLES GRASSLEY , Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Wash-ington, DC. D
EAR CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY : On behalf of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and the 42 undersigned orga-nizations, we write to express our dismay with the failure of the Judiciary Committee to address a growing backlog of federal judi-cial nominations. With only 16 judges con-firmed so far, the 114th Congress is on pace to have the lowest number of judges con-firmed since the 82nd Congress in 1951–1952. Even worse, in the face of rising caseloads and continuing judicial emergencies, it ap-pears that the Committee is determined to shut down the confirmation process en-tirely—putting political considerations ahead of the national interest in a well-func-tioning judicial branch, and ahead of the constitutional responsibility of the Senate to do its job of providing advice and consent on presidential appointments. While a great deal of public attention has rightly been focused on the pending nomina-tion of Chief Judge Merrick Garland to the U.S. Supreme Court, vacancies on the lower courts must not be lost amidst the debate. This year, President Obama has nominated seven individuals to serve on U.S. Courts of Appeal in various circuits throughout the country, including several in circuits that are currently experiencing judicial emer-gencies. While some senators have expressed vague and superficial reasons for opposing consideration of individual nominees, the qualifications of these nominees cannot be seriously disputed— every one of the nomi-nees below has an outstanding background, as well as the widespread respect of those in the legal community who know them best: Rebecca Ross Haywood (Third Circuit): Nominated on March 15, Ms. Haywood has spent most of her legal career as an Assist-ant U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, including as the Appellate Chief of the Civil Division since 2010. She regularly practices before the court to which she has been nominated—and, if confirmed, would be the first African-American woman to serve there. Lisabeth Tabor Hughes (Sixth Circuit): Nominated on March 17, Judge Hughes was appointed to the Kentucky Supreme Court in 2007 by then-Governor Ernie Fletcher and was reelected twice, including without oppo-sition in 2014. She previously served on the Kentucky Court of Appeals (also having been appointed by Gov. Fletcher), and has exten-sive experience in both private practice and as a trial judge in Jefferson County, Ken-tucky. She would be the first woman from Kentucky on the court. Donald Karl Schott (Seventh Circuit): Nominated on Jan. 12, Mr. Schott graduated cum laude from Harvard Law School in 1980. Since then, he has spent most of his legal ca-reer in private practice at Quarles & Brady, where he became a partner in 1987, and has extensive trial and appellate litigation expe-rience, at both the state and federal levels, specializing in securities and business fraud, commercial disputes, health care, and en-ergy-related issues. Myra C. Selby (Seventh Circuit): Nomi-nated on Jan. 12, Ms. Selby spent 15 years in private practice and Indiana state govern-ment before being nominated in 1995 to the Indiana Supreme Court. She was the first Af-rican American and first woman to serve there, and authored more than 100 majority opinions, before returning to private prac-tice in 1999. Since then, she has specialized in commercial and health care litigation. She would be the first African American from In-diana and the first woman from Indiana on the Seventh Circuit. Jennifer Klemestrud Puhl (Eighth Circuit): Nominated on Jan. 28, Ms. Puhl spent several years in private practice and as a clerk on the North Dakota Supreme Court. In 2002, she joined the criminal division of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of North Dakota, where she prosecutes a wide range of criminal cases and specializes in computer hacking and cybersecurity, intellectual property, and human trafficking. She would be the first woman federal judge at any level in North Dakota. Lucy H. Koh (Ninth Circuit): Nominated on Feb. 25, Judge Koh became the first Asian American judge to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, having been confirmed in 2010 by a 90–0 vote. Prior to her current position, she worked for the Senate Judiciary Committee, held sev-eral positions within the Department of Jus-tice, and spent six years in private practice. In 2008, she was appointed as a judge to the Superior Court of California for Santa Clara County by then-Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. She would be only the sec-ond Asian American woman ever to serve on a federal circuit court. Abdul K. Kallon (Eleventh Circuit): Nomi-nated on Feb. 11, Judge Kallon has served on the U.S. District Court for the Northern Dis-trict of Alabama since 2009, after being con-firmed by the Senate by unanimous consent. For the previous fifteen years, Judge Kallon specialized in labor and employment law as a partner at the Birmingham, Alabama firm Bradley Arant Boult Cummings LLP. If con-firmed, Judge Kallon would be the first Afri-can American from Alabama to serve on the Circuit. In addition, the committee has failed to act on dozens of pending district court nomi-nees—too many to list here—from through-out the country. As with the above appellate nominees, many of these nominees would fill seats in districts that are currently facing judicial emergencies. Many of the district and appellate nominees come from states in which both senators have returned their so- called ‘‘blue slips,’’ indicating their approval of the nominees. Normally, this should clear the way for hearings and up-or-down con-firmation votes. Instead, these nominees have fallen victim to election-year games-manship. The complete obstruction of nominees is unprecedented, and the arguments some are making in defense of this obstruction are wholly unpersuasive. In 2008, the Democratic party-controlled Senate confirmed 22 judges in the last seven months of George W. Bush’s presidency, including 10 in September 2008. During Ronald Reagan’s presidency, the Sen-ate on average confirmed 16 judges in the second half of presidential election years. There is no legitimate reason why things should be any different in the last year of President Obama’s second term. While the Committee refuses to do its job, the American people are left to pay the price. There are currently 32 judicial emer-gencies nationwide (16 of the pending nomi-nees would fill these seats), and more than 40 total nominees pending in committee or on the Senate floor. Many of the pending nomi-nees would fill vacancies in courts that have been left shorthanded for years. Donald Schott would fill a Seventh Circuit seat that has been vacant for more than six years, and more than 30 of the 46 pending nominees are nominated to seats that have been empty for more than a year. Meanwhile, the inaction is slowing the wheels of justice for all types of parties who are seeking to vindicate their legal and con-stitutional rights. Numerous judges have ex-plained the consequences they and litigants face: long delays on even the most simple fil-ings and motions, protracted waits for post- conviction sentences, spoiled evidence, wit-nesses whose memories fade, lost businesses and the jobs that go with them while waiting for trials, and many more. Not only is the situation rife with injustices, but it is also completely unsustainable. The Committee has a constitutional re-sponsibility to provide advice and consent on presidential nominees, and a duty to the American people to simply do its job. In the coming weeks and months, our organizations will continue to make the case until it does. If you have any questions, please contact Rob Randhava, Senior Counsel at The Lead-ership Conference on Civil and Human Rights at (202) 466–3311, or any of the organi-zations listed below.

AMENDMENT NO . 3524 
Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, while we are waiting for members of the Ju-diciary Committee to come and speak to the judicial nomination we will vote on shortly, I want to take the oppor-tunity to talk about a pending amend-ment which is being offered by Senator B
ENNET of Colorado and which I would recommend to the Senate that they fa-vorably consider. It is dealing with families traveling on airlines. As you know, things get very specific about seats and how much they charge for the seats. You pay extra for some baggage and other services, and then you get into seats that are getting in-creasingly smaller. It is even worse for a woman who is pregnant or is trav-eling with small children. Senator B
ENNET ’s amendment is a family-friendly amendment. If a parent has a minor child who is going on the plane by themselves, it would require TSA to allow the parent to accompany the child throughout the screening process. To a small child, that can be quite intimidating. Secondly, it would require the air-lines to provide pregnant women with the opportunity to preboard the flight. How many times have we seen every-body queueing up to get on the flight? The special advantage passengers get on, the first class passengers get on, the members of the frequent flyer pro-gram get on, and here is a lady who is quite along in her pregnancy still standing. That is just common sense. That is being gentlemanly about the rules of airlines. Thirdly, the amendment tries to keep families together because it would re-quire the airlines to make sure that at least one adult of the family who is traveling together can sit next to the child on the plane without the airlines saying the parent will have to pay an extra fee in order to guarantee having a seat next to their minor child. This is common sense, and it is encouraging family travel. I certainly urge my colleagues to support this amendment as we will be taking up the FAA bill after this judi-cial nomination confirmation vote. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. ALEXANDER. I yield back any remaining time.

VIEQUES Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we are all concerned about the plight right now of Puerto Rico and what is hap-pening over there financially. And later on this week I will revisit the issue of the 4-year battle of Vieques that took place from 1999 to 2003. I am very much concerned that we might have an opportunity here to rectify something that was done that should not have been done back in 2002. The island off of Puerto Rico called Vieques had been an integrated train-ing center for many years—about 60 years—up until 2002. For purely polit-ical reasons at that time, it became quite an issue. First of all, joint train-ing took place on the island of Vieques. Joint training means you have dif-ferent branches of the military trying to accomplish something together that they couldn’t do individually. In the case of Vieques, it was the Marines, the Navy, and the Air Force. We were able to do the type of training we couldn’t do anyplace else.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1849 April 11, 2016 
It sounds kind of ridiculous, but when they were talking about doing away with using Vieques for a military center—what they had been doing for 60 years—it was all around an estab-lishment called Roosevelt Roads. Roo-sevelt Roads was a major naval sta-tion. We had about 7,000 sailors there. They added something like $600 million a year to the economy of Puerto Rico. Anyway, we found out there was a great effort by a lot of people who I will always suspect wanted to ulti-mately develop that island for private purposes and to financially gain from that. Consequently, with no regard for the contribution it made to our de-fense, they started a major problem. One person was killed in 60 years on that island, and because that happened to have taken place, they used it as a reason to try to shut that down. It be-came quite a political football at that time. I know Al Gore was very much involved in that, and there were some great benefits, I am sure. From World War II through the oper-ation in Kosovo, our military has been ready to execute combat operations due to the training they were able to get on the island of Vieques. In fact, during Kosovo they used those individ-uals to conduct successful operations. They were all trained at no place other than Vieques. The reason for that is if they were going into Kosovo, as our Air Force was going in, they would have to be able to draw coordinates from a high enough elevation that the surface-to- air missiles would not be able to reach them, for their safety. And if we hadn’t had all those guys over there who were trained at Vieques, it was speculated that they would not have been success-ful. Secretary Richard Danzig, who was then the Secretary of the Navy, said that ‘‘only by providing this prepara-tion can we fairly ask our servicemem-bers to put their lives at risk.’’ Admi-ral Johnson, then Chief of Naval Oper-ations, and General Jones, then Com-mandant of the Marine Corps, said that Vieques provides integrated live-fire training ‘‘critical to our readiness’’ and that the failure to provide for adequate live-fire training for our naval forces before deployment will place those forces at an unacceptably high risk during deployment. Those are quotes from those two individuals. Admiral Ellis, then director of oper-ations, plans, and policies on the staff of the commander in chief of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet, said during his con-firmation hearing—and I was there at that time—to be commander of Stra-tegic Command, ‘‘Those types of facili-ties, particularly those in which we can bring together all of the naval, and that means both Navy and Marine Corps, combat power for integrated and joint training, are particularly useful elements of the overall warfighting preparation.’’ At the time we felt there was a prob-lem, I personally went around the world to every place that might have been a substitute for Vieques. I went to Cape Wrath—I always remember that— which I think is in northern Scotland, and I went to Southern Sardinia in Italy, and none of those places were adequate and none could provide the same type of support. Admiral Fallon, then commander of the Navy’s Second Fleet, and General Pace—remember Peter Pace—the com-mander of all Marine Forces in the At-lantic, testified that the United States needs Vieques as a training ground to prepare our young men and women for the challenges of deployed military op-erations. GEN Wes Clark, the Supreme Allied Commander at that time, said: ‘‘The live fire training that our forces were exposed to at training ranges such as Vieques helped ensure that the forces assigned to this theater’’—and he was talking about Kosovo. That is when we had to be ready on arrival to fight and win and survive, which we did. CAPT James Stark, then the com-manding officer of Roosevelt Roads Naval Station—there were about 7,000 of our sailors there—said: 
When you steam off to battle you’re either ready or you’re not. If you’re not, that means casualties. That means more POWs. That means less precision and longer cam-paigns. You pay a price for all this in war, and that price is blood. 
Admiral Murphy, then commander of the Sixth Fleet of the Navy, said the loss of training on Vieques would ‘‘cost American lives.’’ And it has cost Amer-ican lives, and that has been since 2002. We are talking about American lives unnecessarily put at risk if they are not fully trained for combat oper-ations. I remember one person back at that time talking about the analogous situ-ation of a football team where you have all the quarterbacks training over here, all the backs over here, and all the defensive people training over here, but never training together, and then they go and lose. You have to have in-tegrated training. We don’t even have that today. We have tried to find and to replicate that effort, and it isn’t there. This week, I understand—and the reason I came down quite unprepared is because I didn’t know this was coming up—the House Natural Resources Com-mittee is going to consider legislation that provides bankruptcy powers to Puerto Rico while subjecting it to the authority of a Federal oversight board. This is something that is going to be-come very controversial. There will be a lot of people around saying: Why are we doing this? And once you provide these benefits to Puerto Rico, there is no reason why others won’t line up and want the same thing. I really am concerned that Puerto Rico, apparently—and I don’t know if this is true, but they are saying it— owes some $73 billion in government debt. In January, Puerto Rico started defaulting on part of that debt. Section 411 of this legislation—we are talking about the legislation that will be discussed tomorrow over in the House—would turn over approximately 3,000 acres of Department of Interior conservation zones that were formerly part of Vieques. What happened in 2002 was that the land that had been used for the train-ing range was turned over to this de-partment. Now they are talking about taking it out, I suppose, for people to develop. I remember so well the time when we were talking about closing Vieques. I was the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee Readiness Sub-committee. Puerto Rico’s Governor Rossello came. He is not in office any-more. But he made all kinds of threats: It is just a bluff that it would be clos-ing. I made the statement that if we are denied the opportunity to use the is-land of Vieques for joint training, then we were going to lose Roosevelt Roads. Governor Rossello sat there and said: INHOFE is not telling the truth. We are not going to lose that. Of course, they did lose it. So in 2003 the total impact from the Navy was es-timated to be $600 million a year. The departure of the Navy also impacted business and contracts, as we know. I was visiting with Miriam Ramirez just today. At the time, she was in the State Senate in Puerto Rico and was talking about the disastrous economic effects if they closed Vieques. She is still concerned about that, and many of the people who were the strongest op-ponents of my efforts at that time to keep Vieques operating are now saying we should have left it open. So I think any kind of a deal that is made has to include consideration that the training is still available. There is still no range like Vieques anywhere in the Western Hemisphere. What can be done in Vieques cannot be done in one location by a joint force. I understand firsthand both the importance and the significance of having a range in your home State. I remember a popular TV show at that time called ‘‘Crossfire.’’ I was on the show in May of 2000. Juan Figueroa was the president of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, and we were debating this on live TV. He said: Well, how would you, I
NHOFE , like to have a live range in your State of Oklahoma? I said: Let me tell you about Fort Sill. They train 360 days out of the year, 24 hours a day, and they make all kinds of noise. It is within 1 mile of a population of 100,000 people—at that time, Vieques was within 9.5 miles of 9,000 people—and there are all these people who hear this noise down there. They were in town last week. They said: When we hear that noise, it is the sound of freedom. Here is something interesting. They opened up what is considered to be the most modern, most progressive ele-mentary school. They call it Freedom Elementary School. They named it after that phrase: It is the sound of freedom.

So this is what is happening. I am very much concerned that we are going to stumble and pass up an opportunity that might still be there. We have an opportunity to actually go back and use that for some of our joint training. So later this week I am going to go back and relive the history on the 4- year battle of Vieques. Hopefully, this might be an opportunity for us to save American lives and to have integrated training, which we still don’t have today and which we had back in that time. With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. M

TRIBUTE TO ROBERT HAWKES GRAY Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to an extraordinary Vermonter, Robert Hawkes Gray. Bob, as he is known to family and friends, grew up in Putney where his parents worked at the Putney School. His fa-ther, Edward, was in charge of build-ings and grounds, and his mother, Mabel, ran the kitchen. Ed’s ability to fix anything and Mabel’s cooking and way of keeping order are remembered vividly and fondly to this day by thou-sands of Putney graduates. Bob attended Putney where he learned to ski cross-country thanks to Olympian skier John Caldwell, the fa-ther of cross-country skiing in America who taught at the school. Bob went on to run the outdoor work program at Putney and coached cross-country ski-ing and running. He became an Olym-pian himself, competing in the 1968 and 1972 winter games, and was inducted into Vermont’s Ski and Snowboard Mu-seum Hall of Fame. After skiing, Bob’s lifetime passion has been farming. He and his wife, Kim, own and manage Four Corners Farm, one of the most successful vegetable and dairy farms in Vermont. Located on a beautiful hillside that levels off along the Connecticut River in South Newbury, the sprawling acreage of the farm is a model of order and aston-ishing productivity. Just about any-thing that will grow in Vermont, either in fields or in greenhouses heated by wood stoves, can be found there in abundance. Everyone knows that farm work is hard by any standard. It means rising before sunrise and long hours of stren-uous physical labor that continues into the night. Anyone who visits Four Cor-ners Farm can’t help but wonder how they do it all. It is a testament to the benefits of regular physical exercise, as Bob, now 76, looks closer to 60 and has the strength of someone half his age. It wasn’t all due to farming though. It is said that, when Jack Dempsey was the world heavyweight champion, Ed Gray’s biceps measured the same di-ameter. Of course, Ed was an accom-plished gardener himself. I could go on about Bob’s talents as a farmer. A teacher by instinct, anyone who visits the farm may find them-selves treated to a lesson in pruning to-mato plants, planting and mulching strawberry seedlings, or the peculiar habits of honey bees. Kim, a former al-pine ski racer herself, is also a gifted farmer whose stamp on the business can be seen everywhere. Neither could have made Four Corners Farm what it is today without the other. Bob never stopped skiing for fun, but he didn’t take up racing again until the 1990s. This past winter he showed that, if you love something enough and give it everything you have got, just about anything is possible. At the World Masters cross-country ski races in Voukatti, Finland, and at the National Masters at Royal Gorge, CA, Bob won a gold medal, two silvers, and a bronze. Some might think that, by the time you get to be 76, you are probably skiing pretty slowly and there isn’t that much competition in your age group anyway. Let’s just say that at the Masters no one skis slow-ly—no one skis anything remotely like slowly. These are the best skiers in the world, and to the rest of us mere mor-tals, there isn’t that much difference between them and today’s Olympians. A March 31, 2016, article in the Valley News, entitled ‘‘Septuagenarian Gray Skiing His Way to Wins’’ tells the story. I congratulate Bob Gray. He ex-emplifies the very best of Vermont for his inspiring work ethic, his ski racing accomplishments, and the example he has set for future generations of Vermont skiers and farmers. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the R
ECORD . There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows:

EPTUAGENARIAN GRAYSKIING HISWAY TO  W
INS (By Jared Pendak, Valley News Staff Writer) N
EWBURY , VT.—Bob Gray returned to cross country skiing several years ago, primarily as a way to keep his heart pumping. As it turned out, he’s more than capable of break-ing the hearts of opponents. Gray, 76, recently swept a pair of races at the National Masters Championships in Soda Springs, Calif., winning the Masters 5B (ages 75–79) 10K classic race on March 19 in 33 min-utes, 58.6 seconds, more than nine minutes faster than runner up Hans Muehlegger, of Idaho, and good for 20th overall in a field of 53. The next day, Gray placed fifth overall while winning his 70–79 age group in the sea-son-ending U.S. Marathon National Cham-pionship, finishing the 14K bronze race in 48:12.1—again more than nine minutes ahead of Muehlegger. A two-time Olympian who competed on the U.S. Nordic Ski Team from 1960–74, Gray had also swept both events in the 2015 National Masters Championships, held closer to home at the Craftsbury (Vt.) Nordic Center. ‘‘There isn’t much competition for my age group in that event,’’ said Gray, who co-owns the Four Corners produce and dairy farm in Newbury, Vt. ‘‘I’d like to think part of it is that I’m in pretty good shape.’’ Gray’s competition was stiffer last month at the Masters World Cup in Vuokatti, Fin-land, where he left with two silver medals and a bronze. On Feb. 6, he bettered 75–year- old Frenchman Daniel Chopard by two sec-onds for second place in the 10K skate in 33:40, then beat Chopard by 35 seconds with a time of 47:34.1 in the 15K skate Feb. 12. Norwegian Finn Magnar Hagen decidedly won both skate races, finishing the 10K a good 2:40 ahead of Gray and besting him in the 15K by nearly four minutes. ‘‘There was just no catching Finn; he was just gone,’’ said Gray. ‘‘On the other hand, me and Chopard had a great time going back and forth. We’d pass each other and say, ‘All right, I’ll see you up ahead on the hill.’’’ Neither Hagen nor Chopard competed in the 5K classic on Feb. 8, a race in which the top four were separated by just 17 seconds. Russia’s Gennady Ushakov won in 18:10.9, fol-lowed by Austrian Josef Schniagl, Gray (18:19.7) and Finland’s Taplo Wallenkus (18:27.9). ‘‘I think I had a chance to win that race, but my skis just weren’t up to par with some of the skis these other guys had,’’ Gray said. ‘‘I made one tactical error, started kicking too lightly and it got me off-track. I was still able to make up most of the places I lost and close the gap. It was a close race, a fun race.’’ Gray, a Vermont Ski & Snowboard Mu-seum Hall of Fame inductee whose wife, Kim, is a former U.S. Alpine skier, competed in the 1968 and ’72 Olympic Games. His best finish was 12th place in the 4x1OK relay in the ’68 Games in Grenoble, France, comple-menting three combined top-50s in individual events at Grenoble and the ’72 Games in Sapporo, Japan. The Putney, Vt., native also skied four seasons in the FIS Cup (now known as the FIS World Cup), winning national titles in the 15K and 50K and earning the top U.S. ranking in 1973. The Grays opened the Green Mountain Touring Center in Randolph in 1977 while running their first farm in Hartland Four Corners, inspiring the moniker they kept even after moving operations to their plot in Newbury. Bob Gray later had about a 12-year hiatus from the sport while devoted to raising the couple’s three children and farming, not strapping on skis again until the early 1990s. He competed off and on in various national and international competitions, capturing bronze at an event in Quebec City in 2001 and two silvers and a bronze five years later in British Columbia. He began refocusing on training and competing in earnest several years ago, motivated equally by the desire to keep his heart rate up as much as keeping his competitive juices going. ‘‘When you get older, if you don’t keep moving, you get sick and die,’’ Gray said plainly. ‘‘So much of your health is about staying active and exercising. I get some of that on the farm, but I’m much more of a manager type now than I used to be. So (re-turning to skiing) is a way to keep my heart beating.’’ Like any snow sports athlete based in the area, Gray faced challenges finding suitable surfaces to train on this winter. He ventured to Craftsbury Nordic Center at times to practice on their manmade trails, but most often settled for dry-land exercises. ‘‘I’d go up (North Haverhill’s) Black Moun-tain, Mount Moosilauke, sometimes Mount Ascutney, always with ski poles to help prac-tice balance,’’ Gray said. ‘‘I’d go uphill on

paved roads on rollerblades—I like rollerblades better than roller skis. I can go from here up Snake Road to West Newbury, which is about three miles, so that’s perfect. The only problem with that is that I’m too tired to skate home after that so I have to have someone come get me.’’ Gray, who was trained in his youth by former Dartmouth skier and Olympian John Caldwell, would like to see more kids today on Nordic skis. He’s given lessons in recent years at Strafford Nordic Center and else-where. ‘‘It’s a great sport, a great way to get kids off of the couch or away from the computer,’’ Gray said. ‘‘Plus, you can do it until you’re my age.’’ f 
TRIBUTE TO MAURICE GEIGER Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Maurice Geiger, known by family and friends as Maury, an ex-traordinary individual who, although a longtime resident of Conway, NH, with his wife, Nancy, is deserving of the title of honorary Vermonter. Maury Geiger’s lengthy career began in the U.S. Navy back in the 1950s, from where he went on to Georgetown Law School and jobs at the Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice. He later served as a county prosecutor in New Hampshire, founded the Rural Justice Center in Montpelier, VT, where I first got to know him, became a national expert in court administra-tion, and has provided advice and guid-ance to help reform dysfunctional jus-tice systems in foreign countries for more than two decades. In no country has Maury devoted more passion, time, and energy than Haiti, where justice has long been more of a fantasy than a reality for the ma-jority of the Haitian people. Since the 1990s, Maury has traveled to Haiti scores of times, often paying out of his own pocket. His purpose was simple: to help improve access to jus-tice for thousands of people caught up in a byzantine system in which it is common to be detained in squalid, grossly overcrowded, sweltering pris-ons rampant with life-threatening dis-eases, for months and years, without ever seeing a lawyer or judge or being formally charged with any crime. Over the years, often against great odds, Maury has worked to train nu-merous Haitian prosecutors, judges, and other judicial officials and to insti-tute recordkeeping systems to improve case management and reduce the chance that inmates are forgotten or their case files are lost. Maury is not only among a handful of the most experienced experts in the field of court administration; he is a person of exemplary integrity. He has never had the slightest interest in prof-iting himself, as his modest lifestyle demonstrates, but rather to do what-ever he could to provide help and dig-nity to those who are the least able to help themselves. He has done so, year after year, with uncommon compassion and commitment, never losing his wry sense of humor, in a country where the political will for justice reform at the highest levels of government has often been weak or lacking altogether. Maury is in Haiti again this week, and I want him to know that the exam-ple he has set of selflessness, of caring, commitment to human rights and equal access to justice, and of an un-wavering belief in the basic dignity of all people regardless of their station in life, is one that every law student, every lawyer, every prosecutor, every judge, and every prison warden should strive to emulate. f 
HONORING POLICE OFFICER SUSAN FARRELL Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Des Moines police officer Susan Farrell had a lifelong dream of a career in law en-forcement. At the young age of 30, she was living out her dream and on course for a bright career. But on March 26, just five months after joining the Des Moines Police De-partment, Officer Farrell lost her life in the line of duty along with fellow of-ficer Carlos Puente-Morales when their vehicle was struck by another that was driving the wrong direction on Inter-state 80 near Waukee. I wish to take a moment to celebrate Officer Farrell’s life and service. Early on, growing up in the Des Moines area, Officer Farrell knew she wanted a career in public service. She studied criminal justice at Hamilton College and returned to her home town after graduating to begin living her dream. She worked as a detention offi-cer in Polk County Jail for several years and was promoted to deputy just a year ago. She joined the Des Moines Police Department last fall and was ex-cited to expand her education there. Along the way, Officer Farrell quick-ly earned the respect of her colleagues. She was someone they could always count on to help resolve situations. She also received awards of commenda-tion and lifesaving for her work on the response team. One colleague summed up her abilities like this: ‘‘There wasn’t a situation where I wouldn’t want Susan with me.’’ Officer Farrell will be greatly missed by her family and friends, as well as the Des Moines community that she worked to protect. I express my deepest sympathies to Officer Farrell’s family, friends, and colleagues and my sincere gratitude for her service to our State and for her work to keep our communities safe. 
f 
HONORING POLICE OFFICER CARLOS PUENTE-MORALES Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Des Moines Police Officer Carlos Puente- Morales’s life was marked by a com-mitment to serving others and frequent expressions of love—love for his family and love for those he worked with. On March 26, Officer Puente-Morales lost his life in the line of duty along with fellow officer Susan Farrell when their vehicle was struck by another that was driving the wrong direction on Interstate 80 near Waukee. I wish to take a moment to celebrate the life and service of Officer Puente-Morales. Officer Puente-Morales served tours in Iraq and Afghanistan in the Iowa Army National Guard, where he at-tained the rank of staff sergeant. He served his community as a deputy sher-iff for Franklin County and as an Ottumwa police officer before coming to Des Moines to be closer to family. He joined the Des Moines police force just last year. Des Moines Police Chief Dana Wingert has referred to Officer Puente- Morales as a loyal servant. I believe this to be a very fitting description. He was loyal to his family, to his commu-nity, to his country, and he did it with a heart full of love. He was just 34 years old when he left us, but his serv-ice and the example he set for all of us will endure for many years to come. Officer Puente-Morales will be missed by his family and the commu-nity that he served. Officer Puente-Morales’s mother wisely said, ‘‘We shouldn’t wait for a tragedy to recognize our heroes.’’ She is exactly right. On behalf of Iowans and all Americans, I express my grati-tude for Officer Puente-Morales’s serv-ice to community and country. My deepest sympathy is with his family in this difficult time. I thank all those who walk in Officer Puente-Morales’s *COM007*footsteps to protect and serve. f 
CONGRATULATING LEONARD MINSKY Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, at its 214th commencement on May 14, 2016, the University of Maine at Orono will award an honorary doctorate degree to Leonard Minsky of Bangor. Today I wish to congratulate my dear friend for this recognition and to join people throughout Maine in thanking him for his uncommon generosity, vision, and dedication that have made our univer-sity’s flagship campus a center for the arts and humanities. A member of the class of 1950, Leon-ard received an outstanding education at UMaine and has never stopped giv-ing back. His passion for the arts and commitment to the highest expressions of human ideals are evident throughout the beautiful Orono campus. Minsky Recital Hall in the school of per-forming arts is a marvelous place for students, faculty, and world-class vis-iting artists to perform. In recent years, I have had the pleasure of hear-ing the University Singers, which in-cluded my niece, perform there. The Minsky Gallery in the Maine Center for the Arts celebrates the vis-ual arts around the world. The Minsky Culture Lab at the Hudson Museum of-fers interactive, hands-on experiences for Maine schoolchildren and UMaine students. With Leonard’s support, the UMaine Museum of Art in downtown Bangor features the best in modern and

contemporary art, from Andrew Wyeth to Andy Warhol. Leonard’s partner in these endeavors is his partner in life, his extraordinary wife, Renee. Leonard’s service has in-cluded leadership roles on the univer-sity’s development council, the Cam-paign for Maine, and the UMaine Board of Visitors. Renee, one of the first vol-unteer docents at the Hudson Museum, has held leadership roles on advisory boards for both the Hudson Museum and the Maine Center for the Arts. Both have been active Patrons of the Arts, the UMaine program that sup-ports tours by university performing arts ensembles and that encourages student involvement in the arts through outreach to elementary and secondary schools across Maine. The university’s Fogler Library, Maine’s largest research library, is home to the Minsky Jewish Heritage Collection. This priceless cultural and historical resource is a gift from Renee and Leonard Minsky, along with his brother, Norman. For several years, I had the good for-tune to live just across the street in Bangor from Renee and Leonard Minsky. They were wonderful neigh-bors. Since that time, I have been blessed with their friendship and in-spired by their leadership. Students, faculty, and visitors to the UMaine campus cannot help but feel similarly blessed and inspired. The en-ergy and excitement of the University of Maine’s arts and humanities commu-nity that Leonard Minsky has helped to create enriches our State today and will do so for generations to come.

200TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TOWN OF KINGFIELD, MAINE Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the 200th anni-versary of the town of Kingfield, ME. Known today as a gateway to the rug-ged and beautiful Longfellow Moun-tains, Kingfield was built with a spirit of determination and resiliency that still guides the community today. Kingfield’s incorporation on January 24, 1816, was but one milestone on a long journey of progress. For thou-sands of years, the mountains and river valleys of western Maine were the hunting grounds of the Abenaki Tribe. The reverence the Abenaki had for the natural beauty and resources of the re-gion is upheld by the people of Kingfield today. The town’s namesake is a central fig-ure in Maine history. In 1807, merchant and shipbuilder William King and his partners purchased lands in the wilder-ness and began attracting settlers. In 1820, Maine achieved statehood, and William King, by then a respected statesman and decorated military offi-cer, became its first Governor. The early settlers were drawn by fer-tile soil, vast forests, and fast-moving waters, which they turned into produc-tive farms and busy mills. Roads and a railway were built, and the wealth pro-duced by hard work and determination was invested in schools and churches to create a true community. Among the earliest settlers was Salomon Stanley, whose descendants became the business, social, and reli-gious leaders of the town. At the dawn of the 20th century, his twin sons Francis Edgar and Freelan Oscar in-vented the groundbreaking Stanley Steamer automobile and were re-nowned violin makers. Along with their sister, Chansonetta, they intro-duced many technological and artistic advancements to the growing field of photography. The Stanley Museum, lo-cated in a beautiful century-old Geor-gian schoolhouse, celebrates the genius of a remarkable family. When industry in Kingfield began to decline in the 1950s, outdoor recreation rose to prominence, driven by the en-ergy, enthusiasm, and vision of the townspeople. Today skiing at Sugarloaf Mountain Resort, hiking, golf, and snowmobiling, along with some of the most spectacular scenery of the Appa-lachian Trail, place Kingfield among America’s favorite destinations for the outdoor enthusiast. The decision by Nestle’s Poland Spring to open a bot-tling plant in the town is a testament to the region’s pristine environment and diversifying economy. From the valiant service of Colonel William King in the War of 1812 to the conflicts of our time, Kingfield is a town of patriots. It is significant that the town’s plans for its yearlong bicen-tennial celebration include enhance-ments to the memorials honoring Kingfield veterans. Kingfield is also a town of involved citizens. The active historical society, volunteer fire department, and library are evidence of a strong community spirit. The planning and volunteerism that have gone into the bicentennial festivities are evidence that Kingfield’s spirit only grows stronger. This 200th anniversary is not just about something that is measured in calendar years; it is about human ac-complishment and an occasion to cele-brate the people who, for more than two centuries, have worked together and cared for one another. Thanks to those who came before, Kingfield has a wonderful past. Thanks to those who are there today, Kingfield has a bright future.

TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL EDWARD P. ASH Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to my constituent LTC Edward P. ‘‘Ned’’ Ash for his exem-plary dedication to duty and service to the U.S. Army and to the United States of America. Lieutenant Colonel Ash will retire this summer after more than two decades in the U.S. Army. Entering the Army from Vancouver, WA, Lieutenant Colonel Ash earned a commission from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point with a degree in international relations and was com-missioned an armor officer in 1994. Lieutenant Colonel Ash served in a variety of cavalry units and assign-ments during his 22 years of service. As a lieutenant, he served as a tank pla-toon leader, scout platoon leader, troop executive officer, and as a squadron staff officer in the 2nd Squadron, 3d Ar-mored Cavalry Regiment. As a captain from 1999 to 2001, Lieutenant Colonel Ash remained in a hardship assignment with the 2nd Infantry Division for 3 years to serve in Korea. While assigned to the 2nd Infantry Division, he com-manded Bravo Troop and Headquarters Troop in the 4th Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment. After working at the na-tional training center, where Lieuten-ant Colonel Ash trained units that were preparing to deploy in support of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Endur-ing Freedom, he was assigned to the 1st Squadron, 71st Cavalry Regiment. He deployed with this unit to Iraq while serving as the operations officer and then to Afghanistan as the squadron executive officer. Lieutenant Colonel Ash spent his last 4 years in the Army as a budget liaison in the office around the corner from mine in the Russell Senate Office Building and has become a fixture in the Halls of the U.S. Senate. My staff have called on him many times to help with issues affecting the soldiers and military families in Washington State and around the country. Lieutenant Colonel Ash has approached every in-quiry from my staff, from requisition requests for tents to detailed questions about national strategy, with the same calm wisdom and thoughtfulness that puts serving people and getting results above all else. Lieutenant Colonel Ash has also led the teams that supported the logistic requirements for the funer-als of two of my colleagues who served in the Army: Senator Daniel Inouye and Senator Frank Lautenberg. His ef-forts during these funerals helped en-sure that they were conducted with the dignity befitting the memories of these giants of the Senate. I can confidently say that Lieutenant Colonel Ash’s leadership has positively impacted his soldiers, peers, and superiors through-out his career. On behalf of a grateful nation, I join my colleagues today in recognizing and commending LTC Edward P. Ash for over two decades of service to his coun-try. We wish Ned and his wife, Jamie Skaluba, all the best as they continue their journey of service.

TRIBUTE TO JORDAN HANSON ∑Mr. ROUNDS.

(4) Since 1991, the Secretary of Defense has improperly withheld taxes from severance pay for wounded veterans, thus denying them their due compensation and a signifi-cant benefit intended by Congress. (5) Many veterans owed redress are beyond the statutory period to file an amended tax return because they were not or are not aware that taxes were improperly withheld.

TRIBUTE TO BARB JORGENSEN 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Barb Jorgensen of Harlan, Iowa, as one of Iowa’s 2016 Heroes of the Heartland, sponsored by the American Red Cross of Greater Iowa. Each year, the American Red Cross serving greater Iowa honors individuals for their acts of great bravery, dedication and service to the community. The winners are nominated by their peers, highlighting Iowa’s most compas-sionate and caring individuals. These extraor-dinary people commit actions which dem-onstrate the potential heroism and kindness which is in all of us. Heroes of the Heartland reflect the values and vision of the American Red Cross, leaving a positive impact on cen-tral Iowa. On December 28, 2015, Barb went outside to shovel snow when she noticed thick black smoke pouring from her neighbor’s front win-dow. She ran to the side of the house with the bedrooms and alerted her neighbor and occu-pants to leave the burning home. Because of Barb’s actions and persistence, the neighbor and his son were able to escape the home safely. Mr. Speaker, Barb is an Iowan who has made central Iowa citizens very proud. She has dedicated her life to doing what is right and not seeking much attention. But it is with great honor that I recognize her today. I ask that my colleagues in the U.S. House of Rep-resentatives join me in honoring Barb for her courage. I thank her for her service and wish her continued success in all her future en-deavors.

6TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SMOLENSK DISASTER 
HON. MICHAEL G. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, it is with sadness that I join in acknowledging the sixth anniversary of the Smolensk Disaster, a trag-edy that claimed the lives of Polish President Lech Kaczynski, his wife, Maria, and 94 others aboard a government aircraft on April 10, 2010. Among the victims were high-ranking generals and government officials, clergy, anti- communist leaders and the family members of victims enroute to a ceremony for the 1940 Katyn Forest Massacre. Also on the plane was one American citizen on an official mission for the City of Chicago. The crash at Smolensk North Military Airfield in western Russia is cen-tral to the event sponsored by the Commemo-ration Committee for the Smolensk Disaster and held at the National Shrine of Our Lady of Czestochowa in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. On Sunday, April 17, 2016 prayers will be of-fered for the souls of the 96 crash victims and honor those who served their country. f 
COMMEMORATING WORLD HEALTH DAY 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and commemorate World Health Day. World Health Day is celebrated every year on the founding day of the World Health Orga-nization (‘‘WHO’’), which was established in 1950. WHO puts together regional, local, and international events to shed light on a specific world health issue. Under the leadership of United Nations Sec-retary-General Ban Ki-moon, this year the WHO is focusing efforts and attention to com-bat the rise in diabetes and improve the lives of those living with this preventable and treat-able disease. Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body is unable to utilize the insulin produced. We need to focus on increasing preventa-tive healthcare policies in America by pro-viding the public and healthcare providers with innovative prevention strategies. Diabetes can be controlled by increasing ac-cess to the following: diagnosis, self-manage-ment education, and affordable treatment. In 2008, approximately 347 million people in the world had diabetes. The number of cases have grown exponen-tially over the years. Eighty percent of approximately 1.5 million deaths, attributed to this disease, occurred in low- and middle-income countries. By 2030, the World Health Organization projects that diabetes will be the 7th leading cause of death. We need to acknowledge this as an epi-demic and increase awareness towards the staggering burdens/consequences associated with diabetes. I support this World Health Day’s 2016 goal to scale up prevention, strengthen care, and enhance surveillance through the launch of the first Global report on diabetes.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF EARL GRIGSBY 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I would like to use this time to acknowledge one of my constituents who has demonstrated for nearly a half-century what it means to serve their neighbor. Earl Grigsby will be retiring on April 1st as Superintendent of Public Works for Loudoun County after 44 years of dedication to the community. Mr. Grigsby began his public service 44 years ago as a laborer at the county’s landfill. Over the years, his hard work and positive outlook led him on a path to retiring as Super-intendent of public works. His time with the county has been marked by efficiently leading his workforce, as well as guiding the county operations in emergency situations. Mr. Grigsby leaves office not only receiving honors from the Board of Supervisors, but also a standing ovation from colleagues and kin alike. Mr. Speaker, having already been honored by family and coworkers, I ask that my col-leagues join me in recognizing Mr. Grigsby’s public work, and implore each of us to imitate his dedication to duty. I wish Mr. Grigsby the best in his future endeavors. f 
HONORING THE WEST POINT JEWISH CHAPEL CADET CHOIR 
HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the West Point Jewish Chapel Cadet Choir, who will soon perform at the B’nai Torah Congregation in Boca Raton, Florida. From the over half a million Jewish Ameri-cans have served in the armed services since World War II to Simon Levy who was one of the two original West Point Class of 1802, Jewish Americans have a rich history of serv-ice in our Armed Forces. The West Point Jew-ish Chapel Cadet Choir honors that history and ensures that the contributions of Jewish Americans are not overlooked. The choir consists of members from all four classes at the academy and has both men and women participants. The choir is an ex-tension of the active Jewish body at the Acad-emy; there are between 70 and 80 Jewish ca-dets at West Point. Next year, West Point is set to graduate its 1,000th Jewish cadet. For more than 65 years, the choir has per-formed at West Point community services and, by invitation, to congregations throughout the United States. Since its inception in 1947, ca-dets have had the opportunity to experience other facets of Judaism through participation in other congregations and events around the country. Every year they perform at the White House during the Holiday festivities, and most recently, performed at the United Nations ceremony commemorating the Holocaust. I join the B’nai Torah Congregation in wel-coming these twenty five extraordinary men and women to the synagogue on April 8th.

TRIBUTE TO JOE HOGAN

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Joe Hogan of Altoona, Iowa, as one of Iowa’s 2016 Heroes of the Heartland, sponsored by the American Red Cross of Greater Iowa. Each year, the American Red Cross serving greater Iowa honors individuals for their acts of great bravery, dedication and service to the community. The winners are nominated by their peers, highlighting Iowa’s most compas-sionate and caring individuals. These extraor-dinary people commit actions which dem-onstrate the potential heroism and kindness which is in all of us. Heroes of the Heartland reflect the values and vision of the American Red Cross, leaving a positive impact on cen-tral Iowa. Joe Hogan founded the non-profit organiza-tion, Train to Inspire, to improve the quality of life for individuals with mental and physical disabilities. He encourages participants to soar higher than their perceived limits while cre-ating opportunities for them. Train to Inspire hosts free events that feature new experi-ences for participants including a Super Hero Obstacle Course. Participants are drawn to Joe and his huge heart. While overcoming ad-diction, Joe has developed a passion for help-ing others see what they can accomplish, not what they cannot accomplish. Mr. Speaker, Joe is an Iowan who has made central Iowa citizens very proud. He has dedicated his life to quietly living with honor, doing what is right and not seeking much at-tention. But it is with great honor that I recog-nize him today. I ask that my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives join me in hon-oring Joe for his courage. I thank him for his service and wish him continued success in all his future endeavors.

HONORING MR. PERCY PINKNEY 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues, Congresswoman M
AXINE WATERS , and Congresswoman K
AREN BASS, to honor the extraordinary life of an outstanding public servant and advocate, Mr. Percy Pinkney. With his passing on Saturday, March 18th, we honor his long, extraordinary life of service and the experiences he shared. A native of McComb, Mississippi, Mr. Pinkney began his adult life as a member of the United States Army. He later received his Bachelor’s degree at San Francisco State Uni-versity, and went on to receive a Master’s in Social Work from Lone Mountain College in San Francisco. Mr. Pinkney was an active part of California politics for over 30 years, serving in pres-tigious positions with many influential leaders. During Governor Jerry Brown’s first adminis-tration, Percy led his community relations de-partment for seven years, beginning in 1975. In 1992, he joined Senator D
IANNE FEINSTEIN ’s staff as a field representative, overseeing issues affecting Los Angeles’ Black commu-nity. He faithfully served the community until his retirement in 2014. Mr. Pinkney founded the Black American Political Association of California (BAPAC) in 1979. The organization has since become one of the largest political grassroots organizations in the state, with 60 chapters and more than 40,000 active members. Since its founding, BAPAC has continued its mission of devel-oping, documenting, and identifying the re-sources necessary to achieve cultural, eco-nomic, and educational goals of underserved citizens in California. The organization has also played an effective role in increasing Afri-can Americans participation in the civic and political process. Overall, Mr. Pinkney’s commitment to com-munity building and advancement is unrivaled and BAPAC’s leadership has helped countless constituents develop their educational and economic goals. His love for his community and his neighbors will be remembered for years to come, and his achievements in public service have given many Americans the hope and prosperity they deserve. Mr. Percy Pinkney is survived by his dutiful daughter, Delane Sims, his son in law, Jerry Sims, his brother, Salahudin Tulah, and many grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. He will forever be remembered as a beloved father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. On a personal note, we remember the sup-port, strategic advice, and friendship Percy gave and owe him a debt of gratitude for his selfless contributions to our success as elect-ed officials. Today, California’s 13th Congressional Dis-trict salutes the life of an exemplary individual and devoted community member, Mr. Percy Pinkney. I join all of Mr. Pinkney’s loved ones in celebrating his inspirational life and achieve-ments, and offer my sincerest condolences. I am joined in these sentiments today by my colleagues, MAXINE WATERS , of California’s 43rd Congressional District, and K
AREN BASS, of California’s 37th Congressional District, who also knew Mr. Pinkney personally and valued his service.

OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a true civil servant, Mr. Tim B. Witt, who after forty years with the United States Depart-ment of Agriculture’s Risk Management Agen-cy is retiring this year. Initially hailing from Nebraska, Tim started with the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) in 1976, adjusting losses, conducting training and performing quality control work. From 1980 to 1985, he worked in the Kansas City Office with the United States Department of Agriculture, holding various insurance ad-ministrative positions including several assign-ments pertinent to the design, development and implementation of the Federal crop rein-surance delivery system. In 1985, Tim trans-ferred to FCIC headquarters in Washington, D.C., where he assumed the responsibility for the design and implementation of FCIC regu-latory and oversight program activities. From 1990 through 1992, Tim managed the Office of Insurance Services responsible for admin-istering the delivery of crop insurance pro-grams to America’s producers through the Standard Reinsurance Agreement. In 1992, he returned to Kansas City and serves as the Deputy Administrator for Product Management responsible for the administration and man-agement of corporate policies, underwriting standards and actuarial structures related to the various risk management programs rein-sured by FCIC. Tim has had a long and distinguished ca-reer, and his contributions to the Department of Agriculture for four decades cannot be over-stated. I want to thank him for his service, and wish him nothing but the best in retirement. f

LIVENGRIN FOUNDATION 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. MICHAEL G. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, congratula-tions to the Livengrin Foundation on 50 years of providing hope and healing to those strug-gling with drug and alcohol addictions and for addressing the recent wave of opiate and her-oin overdoses in the region. The mission- based, non-profit was one of the first Pennsyl-vania centers established for the treatment of alcoholism and drug addiction and has grown to include the original inpatient facility in Bensalem, Bucks County, and now eight out-patient locations throughout the Philadelphia region and Lehigh Valley. Livengrin has pro-vided drug and alcohol addiction services to more than 4,000 patients and their families and disbursed more than $1.6 million for sub-sidized and unreimbursed services. Livengrin’s impact on the community goes beyond its treatment services to include innovative solu-tions that served as models for other pro-grams throughout the country. Additionally, the Livengrin Foundation also offers specialty treatment tracks for young adults, nurses, other health care workers, first responders and veterans and numbers of support groups and seminars. Recently, Livengrin hosted Naloxone training and distributions to combat the wave of opiate and heroin overdoses in southeastern Pennsylvania. For a half-century, Livengrin has been a beacon of hope for thou-sands. We sincerely wish the Livengrin Foun-dation and all those who contribute to the mis-sion continued success with utmost gratitude for the good work.

RECOGNIZING ART PING LEE FOR HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE DIS-TRICT OF COLUMBIA CHINESE AMERICAN COMMUNITY 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the House of Representatives to join me in recognizing Art Ping Lee, who has spent his career advocating on behalf of the overseas Chinese community. Born in Taishan County, Guangdong Prov-ince, Mr. Lee immigrated to the United States in 1936. After the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out, only a year after Mr. Lee’s arrival in his new home in the District of Columbia, Mr. Lee began national fundraising efforts to support the Chinese army to resist the inva-sion of Japan. After World War II, Mr. Lee worked tirelessly to assist Chinese families af-fected by the war. Many Chinese families were kept from being reunited with their loved ones due to U.S. immigration laws and immi-gration quotas. Mr. Lee was one of the found-ing members of the National Chinese Welfare Council, in 1957, which campaigned aggres-sively for lifting of immigration quotas. As a re-sult, 40,000 Chinese immigrants were allowed to enter the U.S. every year. Mr. Lee has also advocated to enhance and strengthen the relationship between the United States and Taiwan. Mr. Lee is a founder of several organizations, including the Chinese Youth Club of Washington, D.C., the Wash-ington, D.C. Lodge of the Chinese American Citizens Alliance, and the Lee Federal Credit Union. Mr. Lee, who turns 102 this year, continues to contribute to his community, where he serves as an Honorary Elder of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association of Wash-ington, D.C., a Senior Advisor to the Overseas Community Affairs Council of the Republic of China (Taiwan), and an Honorary Elder to The Lee Family Association in the United States. He has received the Hua Kuang Medal, First Class, which is given by Taiwan to Chi-nese people who have made special contribu-tions in overseas Chinese affairs. Mr. Lee has an impressive record of service and leadership to overseas Chinese commu-nities throughout the United States, particularly in the Washington metropolitan area. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Represent-atives to join me in recognizing Mr. Lee and his lifetime of service to the Chinese American community in the District of Columbia and for his continued contributions and care for the people he serves.

TRIBUTE TO TREY RICE 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Trey Rice of Grimes, Iowa, as one of Iowa’s 2016 He-roes of the Heartland, sponsored by the Amer-ican Red Cross of Greater Iowa. Each year, the American Red Cross serving greater Iowa honors individuals for their acts of great bravery, dedication and service to the community. The winners are nominated by their peers, highlighting Iowa’s most compas-sionate and caring individuals. These extraor-dinary people commit actions which dem-onstrate the potential heroism and kindness which is in all of us. Heroes of the Heartland reflect the values and vision of the American Red Cross, leaving a positive impact on cen-tral Iowa. On Sunday July 12, 2015, Trey was floating down the Raccoon River with his cousin and friends. While resting on a sandbar, they heard a young boy yelling, scared and tangled in branches and floating debris. The victim seemed to be struggling to keep his head above the water and he was not wearing a life jacket. Without hesitation, Trey and his cousin jumped into the river, but the current pulled them rapidly downstream. After fighting their way back to shore, Trey again found a familiar place along the river where he knew he could reach the young boy. After jumping into the river for a second time, Trey was able to reach the young boy and pull him to safety. I, too, grew up along this stretch of the Rac-coon River and know that while still waters run deep, Iowa’s rambling river can turn vicious in a moment’s notice. Trey is a hero for all of us who swam the river. Mr. Speaker, Trey is an Iowan who has made central Iowa citizens very proud. He has dedicated his young life to doing what is right and not seeking such attention. But it is with great honor that I recognize him today. I ask that my colleagues in the U.S. House of Rep-resentatives join me in honoring Trey for his courage. I thank him for his service and wish him continued success in all his future en-deavors. f 
COMMEMORATING NATIONAL MINORITY HEALTH MONTH 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the importance of April as National Minority Health Month. As a senior member of the Congressional Black Caucus and co-chair of the Congres-sional Caucus for Women’s Issues Task Force on Women of Color, I have always believed that access to quality health care should be a universal right of all citizens. National Minority Health Month is a time to reflect and renew our shared dedication and responsibility to eradicating racial disparities in health. Commemorated every year, National Minor-ity Health Month is to heighten public aware-ness of the importance of minimizing health disparities and improve the health status of minority populations. National Minority Health Month was estab-lished 14 years ago when Congress passed H. Con. Res. 388, a concurrent resolution des-ignating April as the month to ‘‘promote edu-cational efforts on the health problems cur-rently facing minorities and other health dis-parity populations.’’ H. Con. Res. 388 encouraged ‘‘all health or-ganizations and Americans to conduct appro-priate programs and activities to promote healthfulness in minority and other health dis-parity communities.’’ Mr. Speaker, the differences in places where we live, work, and play frequently result in inequalities in opportunities like quality childcare and education, access to healthy foods, and safe places to be physically active. ‘‘National Minority Cancer Awareness Week’’ is observed during the third full week in April and directs attention to the fact that cancer has a disproportionately severe impact on minorities and the economically disadvan-taged. The rate of premature death (death before age 75 years) from stroke and coronary heart disease are higher among non-Hispanic blacks than among whites. In 2009, homicide rates were 263 percent higher among males than females and 665 percent higher among non-Hispanic blacks compared with non-Hispanic whites. The motor vehicle-related death rate for men is approximately 2.5 times that for women. In addition, the motor vehicle-related death rate for American Indians and Alaska Natives is more than twice as high as for other racial and ethnic groups. Tuberculosis rates declined among all racial and ethnic minority groups and among both U.S. and foreign-born persons from 2006 to 2010. Rates of tuberculosis cases, however, re-mained persistently higher among racial and ethnic minority groups than among whites in 2010. Obesity rates remain higher among racial minorities than whites. Non-Asian racial/ethnic minorities continue to experience higher rates of human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) diagnoses than whites. Diabetes prevalence is highest among males, persons aged 65 years and older, non- Hispanic blacks and those of mixed race, His-panics, persons with less than high school education, those who were poor, and those with a disability. During 2010, approximately 40 percent His-panic adults and 25 percent of non-Hispanic black adults were classified as uninsured. In my district, two outstanding organizations, African-American Breast Cancer Outreach and Gateway to Care, have dedicated themselves to advocacy efforts for minority health. The African-American Breast Cancer Out-reach program received ‘‘models of achieve-ment’’ awards from the Center for Research on Minority Health of the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and Gateway to Care was awarded special recognition for its work to help uninsured and underinsured residents acquire health care. Mr. Speaker, National Minority Health Month serves to remind each and every one of us of the importance of addressing the very real ra-cial and ethnic health disparities that still plague our nation and to recognize and com-mend those community organizations that do yeoman work in eradicating them.

HONORING LEARNINGSPRING SCHOOL 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, as a father and a former school teacher I can safely say there is nothing more beautiful, or more fulfilling, than watching a child learn and grow. Schools that cultivate that growth, and allow their students to reach above and beyond their potential are an incredible asset to any community, and for 15 years the LearningSpring School in New York City has done exactly that. The story of LearningSpring, or LSS as it is commonly known, is as special and unique as the population it serves. In the fall of 2000, a group of parents were faced with finding ap-propriate placements for their children with Au-tism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Disappointed with the options presented to them, these par-ents decided to create their own school, one that would address all of their children’s aca-demic, social, emotional, and therapeutic needs. Their school would also be designed to incorporate the families of the children as an important partner in the education of their child. The parents determined they needed to start a foundation, not just a school, to achieve all they had set out to achieve, and in the fall of 2001, the LearningSpring Founda-tion opened its first program, the LearningSpring Elementary School. Fifteen years later, LearningSpring has flourished into one of the top schools in the city. The LSS model celebrates the fact that the children in the program are bright, but in need of an educational environment that isn’t exclusively focused on academic performance. This holistic approach to education is one of the reasons LSS has been a tremendous suc-cess, helping hundreds of graduates with ASD prepare to live wonderful, happy, and inde-pendent lives. I have personally seen all of the wonderful work LSS does, and I have always been in-credibly impressed with their approach to edu-cation. This year, LSS is celebrating their 15th Anniversary at their LearningSpring Blossoms celebration, honoring their 2002 Seedling Trustees. I want to congratulate those hon-orees and the entire LearningSpring commu-nity on the occasion.

HONORING MR. PAUL F. WOXLAND 
HON. KEITH ELLISON 
OF MINNESOTA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Paul F. Woxland, and to recognize the nearly twenty-five years of service that he has given to our region as well as to the fed-eral government in his work with the Depart-ment of Housing and Urban Development. Mr. Woxland began his service with the De-partment of Housing and Urban Development in 1991, where he assumed a position as Di-rector of the Minneapolis Multifamily Asset Management Division and Satellite Office Co-ordinator. In this role, Mr. Woxland was tasked with the ultimate responsibility for physical, managerial, and financial condition of every HUD property within the region. Mr. Woxland has also been instrumental in the development and improvement of housing in Minnesota and in our neighboring state of Wisconsin. In this capacity, he has overseen thousands of housing developments, working diligently to provide all families with access to one of our most basic yet most needed re-sources, a safe space to call home. To that end, Mr. Woxland has had a direct hand in over one thousand affordable housing projects in Minnesota, and over eight hundred projects in Wisconsin. This staggering number of de-velopments has had an immeasurable impact upon the health of the region, and in partner-ship has provided permanent housing to over fifteen thousand households. Mr. Woxland’s work with the Interagency Stabilization Group has shown the true level of his commitment to providing housing for very low income residents. Mr. Woxland, through this collaborative organization, has succeeded in not only preserving but stabilizing affordable housing in Minneapolis for thousands of low- income residents. Some notable developments this partnership has preserved are Ebenezer Tower, Cecil Newman Plaza, and Riverside Plaza, a local landmark that is honored in the National Register of Historic Places. To his colleagues and staff, he is regarded as the leader of one of the most effective and efficient HUD offices in the nation. Mr. Woxland leaves a legacy at HUD of tireless commitment and of service to our most under-privileged. For that he deserves our gratitude. He also leaves a legacy of touching countless lives and fostering inclusive communities throughout the region. f 
TRIBUTE TO DOLORES DIAZ– CARREY—28TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Women’s History Month. Each year, we pay special tribute to the contributions and sacrifices made by our nation’s women. It is an honor to pay homage to outstanding women who are making a difference in my Congressional District. I would like to recog-nize a remarkable woman, Dolores Diaz- Carrey, of Pasadena, California. Born in Los Angeles, Dolores attended Sa-cred Heart Elementary School and Sacred Heart High School. She received her Bachelor of Arts Degree in Spanish Literature from Holy Names University and her Master’s Degree in Education from the University of Southern California. In addition, Dolores obtained a Counseling Credential from the University of California, Los Angeles and an Administrative Credential from California State University, Los Angeles. A consummate educator, Ms. Diaz-Carrey’s long career in education began as a teacher at the elementary and junior high school levels in Northern California, after which she moved to Mexico City to teach. In 1969, Dolores joined the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) where she worked for 35 years. In LAUSD’s Division of Adult and Career Edu-cation, she worked in many capacities, includ-ing as an ESL (English as a Second Lan-guage) instructor, teacher advisor, counselor, assistant principal, and principal. From 1973 to 1975, Ms. Diaz-Carrey was Executive Pro-ducer of the first bilingual ESL television se-ries for adults, ‘‘POCHTLAN″, for which she was awarded an Emmy from the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. From 1987 to 1998, she was Principal of Garfield Commu-nity Adult School and while there, founded a family literacy program for adults and their children. In 1998, Dolores became Director of the Adult Instructional Services Unit where she was responsible for overseeing the develop-ment and implementation of all the curricula for adults, including ESL, high school diploma, basic education, parenting, and nursing pro-grams—during this time, she was also Pro-gram Director of the Community Based English Tutoring program. Dolores is a longtime member of the East Los Angeles Rotary Club, where she serves as the Rotarian advisor for a youth club, and is the incoming club president. In 2011, she received the Rotarian Foundation District Service Award. Dolores is a member and past President of the San Rafael Library Associ-ates, a support group for the San Rafael Li-brary in Pasadena, and is a generous sup-porter of the arts, including the Los Angeles Music and Art School, and the Youth Orches-tra Los Angeles. A forty-year resident of Pasadena, Dolores enjoys traveling, daily walks with her dog, Dodger, long-distance cycling, and attending Los Angeles Philharmonic concerts and events at the Hollywood Bowl. I ask all Members to join me in honoring an exceptional woman of California’s 28th Con-gressional District, Dolores Diaz-Carrey, for her extraordinary service to the community. f

RECOGNIZING SAMUEL M. YOUNG, JR., PH.D. 
HON. PATRICK MURPHY 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Mr. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding constituent and renowned neuroscientist, Dr. Samuel M. Young, Jr. of Jupiter, Florida. Growing up in Caldwell, New Jersey, Sam ‘‘Stump’’ Young’s strength on the High School football field led him to Princeton University, where he discovered a passion for scientific research that would last a lifetime. Sam chose to major in molecular biology at Princeton, an unlikely choice for the Princeton Tigers’ star defensive tackle and one who challenged the assumptions of his professors and fellow stu-dents. As a postgraduate, Dr. Young studied at some of the leading laboratories in Germany and the United States before joining the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience in Ju-piter in 2010, where he currently serves as Research Group Leader in Molecular Mecha-nisms of Synaptic Function. At Max Planck, Dr. Young and his team use innovative tech-niques to create models of how synapses function, and their path-breaking research helps shed light on the causes of brain dis-ease. On Sunday, April 3rd, I was honored to have Dr. Young deliver the keynote address at a ceremony I hosted to recognize 65 local stu-dents and recipients of this year’s Congres-sional Award, the United States Congress’ award for young Americans who have dem-onstrated outstanding achievements in four areas: volunteer public service, personal de-velopment, physical fitness, and expedition/ex-ploration. These young men and women exemplify the best values of hard work, determination, pas-sion, and leadership, and I thank Dr. Young for sharing his story with them. I know that by following his example and pursuing their own passions—no matter what—they too will achieve incredible successes in life. CELEBRATING CESAR CHAVEZ DAY HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my deepest appreciation for the life, legacy, and actions of the late Cesar Estrada Chavez. The changes that Cesar Chavez fought for throughout his life have dramatically changed the way that farm workers are treated in our country. Cesar Chavez was one of the nation’s greatest civil rights activists and the tireless champion of migrant farm workers fighting for humane working conditions. As a young man Cesar Chavez worked in the fields where he saw firsthand the dan-gerous conditions which farm workers were forced to endure. In 1952 he became an orga-nizer for the Community Service Organization (CSO), a Latino civil rights group, and eventu-ally became the national director of the organi-zation. In 1965, Chavez co-founded the National Farm Workers Association with Dolores Huerta which evolved into the United Farm Workers union. The National Farm Workers Association was successful in securing fair wages and safe working conditions for farm workers. The UFW also led a worldwide grape boy-cott that helped ensure farm workers had a voice in contract negotiations. Cesar Chavez is also known for his fasts which he used as a nonviolent method of pro-moting his beliefs. In 1972, Chavez fasted in response to Ari-zona’s passage of legislation that prohibited boycotts and strikes by farm workers during the harvest season. Cesar Chavez achieved unprecedented gains for farmworkers. His influence also exceeded to empowering the people to strive for their own rights. Numerous other social movements utilized his tactics in their own work. On April 23, 1993 Cesar Chavez died, bringing great sadness to the farm workers community that he spent his life fighting for. With his death also came a great sense of pride for all the progress that Cesar Chavez brought as a direct result of his unwavering commitment to farm workers’ rights. I urge my colleagues to join me in cele-brating Cesar Estrada Chavez’s life and leg-acy. America is a better place because of Cesar Chavez.

IN HONOR OF COLONEL FERDI-NAND CLARENCE ‘‘FRED’’ BIDGOOD 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of my constituent, Colonel Ferdinand Clarence ‘‘Fred’’ Bidgood, a retired United States Army officer, a patriot, and a true leader. After his birth in 1938 in Fort Benning, Georgia, Fred went on to live in London, Eng-land, where he graduated from Central High School in 1955. He matriculated into the United States Military Academy’s Class of 1960 where he received a Bachelor of Science degree. Fred later earned a Master’s degree in civil engineering from Texas A&M, and graduated from the Armed Forces Staff College. Following his graduation from the United States Military Academy, Fred was commis-sioned as 2nd Lieutenant in the Army and served around the world in command and staff positions in both Artillery and Engineer units. Throughout his career, he served as Associate Executive Director of the Paralyzed Veterans of America in Washington, DC and Chief of Staff for the National Victory Celebration, where his duties included welcoming home troops from the Gulf War. He also served as Director on the Board of Governors of the World United Services Organization and Chairman of their Human Resources Com-mittee, and he was a member of the Board of Advisers of National Handicapped Sports. Fred lived much of his life in South Run For-est community in Springfield, Virginia. On Vet-erans Day, Flag Day, and Memorial Day, Fred enjoyed distributing flags across his entire community to share his patriotic spirit with his neighbors in honor of our country and all those who have served it bravely with him. Fred will be remembered dearly across the South Run Forest community by all those he touched on a daily basis. He was well known by many of his neighbors for having a witty sense of humor. One of Fred’s neighbors, Norman Bayne, once told me about a time when he was mowing his lawn and wearing shorts, Fred came out and shouted, ‘‘If I had legs like that I would wear pants.’’ Fred always had a way to brighten the day of those around him. Fred’s final assignment in the military was as an Executive Assistant to the Administrator of the Veterans Administration. He passed away a decorated veteran, having earned four awards of the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star, two awards of the Meritorious Service Medal, the Air Medal, and the Army Com-mendation Medal. He was preceded in death by his daughter Kerri. He is survived by his wife Marilyn of 55 years, two sons Mark and Matthew, and four grandchildren, Damon, Haley, Aidan, and Brianna. I am honored to commemorate Fred today for his life of leader-ship, service, and selfless contributions to our great nation. We are fortunate to have citizens like Fred who are willing to put their life at risk to serve the United States of America. f

Heroes of the Heartland reflect the values and vision of the American Red Cross, leaving a positive impact on cen-tral Iowa. Meredith knows first-hand about Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) because it took her mother’s life when she was young. At 34, Meredith was diagnosed with the same incur-able disease. Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension or PAH is a chronic and deadly combination heart and lung disease where the pulmonary artery causes the heart and lungs to become strained. It is less often that I meet a hero face to face but I have had the honor and privilege of visiting with Meredith and her hus-band, Randy who founded the Blue Lips Foun-dation with the goal of changing how and when PAH is diagnosed through awareness and education, as well as funding research and the development of diagnostic tools. They are warriors for a just cause. Mr. Speaker, Meredith is an Iowan who has made central Iowa citizens very proud. She has dedicated her life, doing what is right and not seeking much attention. But it is with great honor that I recognize her today. I ask that my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representa-tives join me in honoring Meredith for her courage.

OBSERVING EQUAL PAY DAY 
HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to observe Equal Pay Day, the day when wom-en’s wages finally catch up to men’s. Fifty three years after passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, women and minorities continue to experience inequitable pay differentials. In fact, women who work full time, year round in the United States were paid only 79 cents for every dollar paid to their male counterparts in 2014. In Florida, a woman who holds a full- time job is paid, on average, $34,768 per year while a man who holds a full-time job is paid $40,971 per year. For minorities, the gap is even larger. This equates to a combined 17 billion dol-lars loss of wages annually for Florida women with full-time jobs. These lost wages mean Floridian families have fewer resources to buy goods and services. The wage gap directly hurts Florida’s families and our economy. If change continues at the same slow pace as it has during the last 50 years, it will take nearly 50 more years—until 2059—for women and men to finally reach pay parity. I join the Enterprising and Professional Women of South Florida in observing Equal Pay Day and calling attention to the continuing wage disparity women in our nation and state face. ON THE MURDER OF YONATAN SUHER HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, it is with deep sadness that I express my condolences to the family and friends of Yonatan (Yoni) Suher—one of dozens killed or wounded on March 19th in a suicide bombing in Istanbul, Turkey. This horrific attack highlights the struggle we continue to face in ending these senseless acts of terrorism. Yoni was born in my hometown of Portland, Oregon, as was his father. He shared my love for the city, as well as for the Portland Trail Blazers, and visited his family there often. Though no longer with us, I know Yoni will live on in the hearts and minds of those near-est and dearest to him. I wish his loved ones all the best during this difficult time.

CELEBRATING DEAN CLAUDIO GROSSMAN 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the House of Representatives to join me in celebrating Dean Claudio Grossman and his 21-year tenure at American University’s Wash-ington College of Law (WCL). As WCL’s first Latino dean, and lifelong advocate for human rights, he brought his unparalleled commit-ment to diversity and support for students of color. Dean Grossman, a native of Chile, spent many years in political exile in Europe after serving in the administration of democratically- elected President Salvador Allende, before fi-nally coming to the United States. His legal scholarship is focused on inter-national human rights and he has served in several roles within the United Nations, most notably in the United Nation’s Committee Against Torture, and the Inter-American Com-mission on Human Rights. Dean Grossman has also served as the chair of the United Na-tions Human Rights Treaty Bodies and board member of the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice & Human Rights. He is one of the few Latino law school deans in the country, and the first to serve in that capacity at WCL. He will be succeeded by Camille Nelson, the first black dean at WCL and the first woman in that role in the last 60 years. He leaves large shoes to fill. As dean, he has made great contributions to the legal profession through his work expand-ing WCL’s LL.M. program, semester abroad programs, and clinical programs that advocate for immigrants and the disabled. He has also presided over WCL’s new Tenley Campus ex-pansion. Previous honors for Dean Grossman’s work on human rights and international law include the Rene´Cassin Award from B’nai B’rith Inter-national in Chile and the Harry LeRoy Jones Award from the Washington Foreign Law Soci-ety. Since becoming dean of WLC, Dean Grossman has received a host of honors, in-cluding: Outstanding Dean of the Year by the National Association of Public Interest Law (now known as Equal Justice Works) in 2000, the Inter American Press Association’s Cha-pultepec Grand Prize 2002 for his achieve-ments in the field of human rights, the Charles Norberg International Lawyer of the Year Award from the Washington, D.C. chapter of the Inter-American Bar Association, the Life-time Leadership Award from the Hispanic Na-tional Bar Foundation, and the Leadership Award from the Maryland Hispanic Bar Asso-ciation. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Represent-atives to join me in recognizing Dean Claudio Grossman’s remarkable efforts across his 21- year tenure at WCL. Dean Grossman has dedicated his life to human rights and inter-national law, serving as an exemplary leader. His contributions to the legal profession have laid a foundation for generations. f 
HONORING SHIRLEY SAUNDERS 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a Bronx leader who has been a friend and partner to me in the Co-op City commu-nity for many years, the incomparable Shirley Saunders. I have been friends with Shirley ever since we attended Evander Childs High School together, and I have always known her to be a tremendous force for good in the neighborhood. Shirley was born and raised in the Lincoln Projects in Harlem. She is a product of the New York City public school system, including my alma maters, Hunter and Lehman Col-leges. For 30 years, Shirley has lived in Co- op City and been actively involved in the man-agement of the largest co-operative housing development in the world. She was elected and held a seat as a member and secretary of the Riverbay Board of Directors, which gov-erns Co-op City, and served in those roles for more than 12 years. Shirley has also been ac-tively involved in other community and civic or-ganizations, including the Parents Association for P.S. 153, for which she served as presi-dent; the Sister to Sister program; the local Boy and Girl Scouts chapters; the local little league programs; and is a founding mother of the Jack & Jill of America Bronx chapter. In fact, Shirley was such an integral part of the community, I had to make her a part of my Congressional Staff. She served as Senior Staff Assistant with me for over 20 years, and was extraordinary in that role. But for all of her incredible service to the public, it was always family that was Shirley’s true passion. She has been married to her husband, Rod, for more than 40 years, and to-gether they have three wonderful children and two beautiful grandchildren. This year, Shirley is celebrating her 69th birthday. On the occasion I want to thank her for years of friendship, and wish her nothing but the best.

TRIBUTE TO CARL BURT 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Carl Burt of Des Moines, Iowa, as one of Iowa’s 2016 Heroes of the Heartland, sponsored by the American Red Cross of Greater Iowa. Each year, the American Red Cross serving greater Iowa honors individuals for their acts of great bravery, dedication and service to the community. The winners are nominated by their peers, highlighting Iowa’s most compas-sionate and caring individuals. These extraor-dinary people commit actions which dem-onstrate the potential heroism and kindness which is in all of us. Heroes of the Heartland reflect the values and vision of the American Red Cross, leaving a positive impact on cen-tral Iowa. In announcing the Award, Red Cross offi-cials explained why Mr. Burt is being recog-nized for his heroism. Last spring, he was having an outdoor dinner with a friend and her mother when the friend noticed her mother slouched back in her chair, barely breathing. Mr. Burt immediately took action and at-tempted to begin cardio-pulmonary resuscita-tion (CPR) but her jaw was clenched. He told his friend to call 9-1-1 emergency while he continued giving rescue breaths. Mr. Burt started doing chest compressions and after only two compressions, the mother suddenly awakened. Emergency services arrived, checked her vitals and determined that she had had a seizure but would recover. As part of his daily role as a jail service aide for Polk County, Iowa, Mr. Burt is required to be cer-tified in CPR. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Burt is an Iowan who has made central Iowa citizens very proud. He has dedicated his life to quietly doing what is right and not seeking such attention. But it is with great honor that I recognize him today. I ask that my colleagues in the U.S. House of Rep-resentatives join me in honoring Mr. Burt for his courage. I thank him for his service and wish him continued success in all his future endeavors.

COMMEMORATING APRIL AS NA-TIONAL CHILD ABUSE PREVEN-TION MONTH 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the importance of April as National Child Abuse Prevention Month. As Co-Chair of the Congressional Children’s Caucus, I have always believed that our chil-dren are our nation’s greatest strength and re-source. National Child Abuse Prevention Month is remembered as a time to reflect and renew our shared dedication and responsibility to protect every child in our country, no matter their social or economic background. As elected officials, we have an obligation to condemn this violence, work for stronger en-forcement of the law and provide adequate funding for programs to assist children who may have experienced such abuse. There is no crime greater that an individual can commit than the crimes of child abuse, in all of its forms. The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) established the first federal child protection legislation, and was signed into law by President Nixon on January 31, 1974. This marked the new precedent for the na-tional response to child abuse and neglect. Then in 1983, President Reagan proclaimed the month of April as National Child Abuse Prevention month. In 1989, the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect awarded nine grants to assist in developing and implementing community- based prevention strategies, in furtherance of that cause. In addition, these grants assisted in devel-oping a coordinated multidisciplinary training program for professionals and community leaders to improve public awareness cam-paigns, and implement crisis intervention pro-grams. In 1996, under the Clinton Administration’s emphasis on collaboration and integration among child and family serving systems, a new grants program called the Community- Based Family Resource and Support (CBFRS), was created. These grants reflected the belief that public and private child abuse prevention and treat-ment programs must work together toward common goals. In 2005, there was a renewed commitment to make child abuse prevention a national pri-ority. As a result, the Children’s Bureau focused on making safe children and healthy families a new priority, a theme that was also adopted by the National Conference on Child Abuse and Neglect. Mr. Speaker, children were not forgotten during the great debate over the Patient Pro-tection Affordability Care Act, which included key provisions that created the Maternal, In-fant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Pro-gram. Thus far during my time in Congress, I have continually proposed amendments aimed to assist families and children across the nation. My amendment to HR 3700, which was passed in this chamber, directed the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and the Secretary of Labor to work together to produce an annual report on inter-agency strategies. These strategies would strengthen family economic empowerment by linking housing with essential supportive services, such as employment counseling and training, financial growth, childcare, transportation, meals, youth recreational activities and other responsive services. Once again, I thank my colleagues in the House for their efforts in protecting the chil-dren of this nation. Mr. Speaker, this important month serves to remind each and every one of us, that as Americans we have a solemn responsibility to educate, feed, and protect our children at all costs. HONORING ALECIA A. DECOUDREAUX 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary career of Mrs. Alecia A. DeCoudreaux. Mrs. DeCoudreaux serves as the President of Mills College, my Alma Mater, and will be stepping down to conclude a suc-cessful tenure in academia. Born in Chicago, Illinois, Mrs. DeCoudreaux began her academic career as a student of English and Political Science at Wellesley Col-lege in 1976. After receiving her Bachelor of Arts degree, Mrs. DeCoudreaux continued her education and received a Doctor of Laws de-gree from the Indiana University School of Law in 1978. While at Mills, Mrs. DeCoudreaux furthered inclusion by instituting the first women’s col-lege policy for admitting transgender students. This policy has become a model for women’s colleges across the nation. She also expanded Mills’ global focus and reach by participating in the U.S. Department of State’s Women in Public Service Project (WPSP), hosting 25 women delegates from 22 countries in a 10- day conference focusing on women solving the climate crisis. Mrs. DeCoudreaux led the campus commu-nity and collaborated with the school’s board of trustees to find solutions to tough economic circumstances. Many educational programs have suffered similar downturns, and Mrs. DeCoudreaux’s commitment to higher edu-cation succeeded in sustaining Mills College. In January 2016, Mrs. DeCoudreaux joined 11 other Northern California colleges and uni-versities in signing the Oakland Promise Col-lege Pathway Partnership, which offers finan-cial aid and mentoring support to Oakland high school graduates. These graduates learned the skills necessary to continue a path in academics and further their careers. Her many accolades portray Mrs. DeCoudreaux as a tireless advocate for ac-cess to education, including the Award for Education from the Convention of the Elimi-nation of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women; the ABC 7 News Profiles of Excel-lence Award; the Madam C.J. Walker Pioneer Award; and recognition as a Leadership Cali-fornia Trailblazer. She was selected as one of San Francisco Business Times’ Most Influen-tial Women in Business, and she was included in Diverse Issues in Higher Education maga-zine’s 30 Women Making a Difference feature. On behalf of the residents of California’s 13th Congressional District, Mrs. Alecia A. DeCoudreaux, I salute you. I thank you for your outstanding leadership in higher edu-cation and wish you continued success as you transition to this exciting new chapter of life.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE392 April 11, 2016 
Mr. Koonce was born in Donaldville, Geor-gia and grew up in Newark, New Jersey. He moved to Los Angeles in early adulthood to work with Van Vorse Mattress Company and later became a successful entrepreneur. He was devoted to his family and to his community. He married the late Barbara Talley and they had three sons. He also had a daughter. He raised his family in the Vermont Knolls neighborhood of South Los Angeles, where he quickly took on positions of leader-ship. He served as President of the Vermont Knolls—81st Street Block Club many times over the course of nearly five decades. He worked to build partnerships that would contribute to improving the area, including with the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), the city council office, and later with the Com-munity Coalition for Substance Abuse Preven-tion and Treatment (CoCo). I came to know him as he took active roles in CoCo programs such as the Greater Re-sources through Organizing and Work (GROW) Project. Mr. Koonce helped win changes in grocery store health and safety practices, such as selling expired meat and wilted produce in South L.A. stores. He also fought to beautify the area and calm traffic, making it nicer and safer to walk in the neigh-borhood. As a result of his efforts he was selected to take part in the Neighborhood Leadership Pro-gram of the prestigious Coro Southern Cali-fornia Leadership Center, further enhancing his skills. He was also chosen to sit on the LAPD Community Police Advisory Board and was recognized repeatedly by LAPD for his work to improve safety and solve problems. Never afraid to put in hard work, Mr. Koonce would not settle for less than he thought his community deserved. He will be deeply missed, and my heart is with his family and friends as they gather to honor his mem-ory.

RECOGNIZING THE GIVE CENTER 
HON. JODY B. HICE 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the leadership and volunteer efforts of the GIVE Center on its 20th anniversary. Located in Milledgeville, Georgia, the GIVE Center connects Georgia College & State University students with vol-unteer opportunities to help make a difference on campus and throughout the local, state, na-tional, and international communities. In two short decades through the GIVE Center, stu-dents have completed 650,000 volunteer hours, participated in 140,000 service projects, and contributed $15,000,000 of service to the community. With the help of 150 student organizations, 236 community partners, 245 volunteer pro-grams, and countless helping hands, the GIVE Center has established itself as a pillar of humble service. The servant-leadership and community engagement that are displayed by the faculty, staff, students, and volunteers at the GIVE Center are inspirational, and I am honored to have a place of such excellence and achievement in the 10th District of Geor-gia. CELEBRATING THE 150TH ANNI-VERSARY OF ESSROC CEMENT HON. CHARLES W. DENT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to bring to the House’s attention the 150th Anni-versary of ESSROC Cement, a company deeply rooted in the foundation of Pennsylva-nia’s Lehigh Valley. In 1866, David O. Saylor, a resident of Al-lentown, purchased 30 acres of property in Coplay, PA. He, along with Esias Rehrig and Adam Woolever, chartered the Coplay Cement Company. Saylor, an innovator, developed a process that allowed Portland type cement to be made in the United States. Saylor patented the process, and by 1900, Coplay Cement was providing over 70 percent of the Portland Cement used in America. Coplay Cement provided the material that became the building blocks of the massive in-frastructure expansion and city-building that occurred in post-Civil War America. Paris-based Ciments Francais ultimately ac-quired Coplay Cement in 1976. The 1990s were a time of great activity for the company. It adopted the ESSROC name in 1990. In 1992, Italcementi became ESSROC’s parent company. Now, 150 years later, ESSROC has oper-ations across four continents. In North Amer-ica, the Nazareth-based company has the abil-ity to produce over 6.5 million metric tons of cement annually. To this day, Saylor Cement remains one of their main product lines. ESSROC has demonstrated itself as an im-pressive business, based not only on its cor-porate metrics, but more importantly on its commitment to the greater Lehigh Valley. ESSROC is a valued manufacturer in our community, a provider of good jobs with good wages, and a respected corporate citizen. Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to offer my congratulations to the men and women who work at ESSROC both in the Lehigh Valley area and across the United States. May they enjoy continued prosperity.

TRIBUTE TO MSGT JAMES ROBERT HAYWORTH 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate MSgt James Robert Hayworth of Bondurant, Iowa, for his retirement on March 29, 2016 after nearly 30 years in the United States Air Force and Iowa Air National Guard, 132nd Wing, Des Moines. MSgt Hayworth entered the United States Air Force in May 1986, receiving his basic military training at Lackland AFB, San Antonio, Texas, beginning his extensive, successful ca-reer within the United States military. His serv-ice gave him the opportunity to travel across our great nation and around the world. After completing basic military training, MSgt Hayworth was assigned to the 55th Services Squadron at Offutt Air Force Base in Bellevue, NE. From there he came to Iowa, serving in the 132nd Combat Support Squadron at the Iowa Air National Guard Base in Des Moines. His first overseas deployment was during Op-eration Provide Comfort, where he was sta-tioned at the Air Base Wing of Incirlik Air Base, Adana, Turkey. MSgt Hayworth returned to the United States where he served in var-ious roles until his next deployment overseas in 2009, supporting the 432nd Maintenance Group and our military efforts from the Joint Base Balad in Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom. He later returned to Iowa, com-pleting his career with the Iowa Air National Guard. Mr. Speaker, MSgt Hayworth’s unyielding commitment to his country is a true testament to his patriotism. I am honored to represent him in the United States Congress. We will never be able to thank him enough for the sacrifices he has made in order to keep our country safe. I ask that all of my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in thanking him for his service, con-gratulating him on his retirement and wishing him nothing but continued success and happi-ness. f 
COMMEMORATING THE PASSAGE OF THE HEALTH CARE AND EDU-CATION RECONCILIATION ACT 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the passage of the empowering ‘‘Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act.’’ Over the past three decades, the average tuition at a public, four-year college institution has more than tripled, while the typical family’s income has become plateaued. This great struggle pitting the interests of the banks and financial institutions against those of vulnerable students finally came to an end on March 30, 2010, when President Barack Obama signed this legislation into law. This law reinvested savings back into edu-cation by upgrading community colleges facili-ties, increasing Pell Grants, and making it easier for responsible students to pay off their loans. Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Serving Institutions in this nation were resultantly able to receive a needed ben-efit. For new borrowers after 2014, student loans are eligible to be forgiven after 20 years to those making timely payments, down from the previous 25 year requirement. This law also has helped parents invest in their children’s education by simplifying the federal education loan borrowing process. Specifically, in my home city of Houston, Texas, this legislation has helped many of the 9,700 students currently attending the pres-tigious HBCU, Texas Southern University, alongside the 42,704 students attending the University of Houston. During my time serving our country, I have fought to make higher education accessible to all who strive to achieve it. That is why I am proud to have stood with 220 of my colleagues in voting ‘‘yea’’ in sup-port of this legislation.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Janet Mahoney for her accomplishments in over twenty years of service to The American Legion Auxiliary, Montgomery Unit No. 429 in Rhinebeck, NY. Janet is a recently retired dental hygienist, proud grandmother of eight grandchildren and also the widow of a Vietnam Veteran. She has always been passionate about Veterans, their families, and their communities. Throughout her selfless and tireless service in the American Legion Auxiliary, Janet has served on multiple committees and in many leadership positions at the local and state lev-els. Some of her positions include: three terms as Unit President, three terms as County President, and two terms each as District Vice President and District President. Janet has served at the State level since 2007 as the Education Chairman, Public Rela-tions Chairman, Americanism Chairman, Vice- President and President. During her tenure of outstanding service at the State level, she was instrumental in the organization winning na-tional awards for Department of New York Press Book, Best Overall Department Public Relations Program, The National Americanism Award, The National Children and Youth Award, and The National Veterans Affairs & Rehabilitation Award. In Janet’s current capacity as New York American Legion Auxiliary President, she oversees multiple programs aimed at assisting Veterans as well as the communities of New York. One of her main priorities as President is raising money to support Vietnam Veterans impacted by Agent Orange. Janet is leading a statewide campaign, cov-ering all 62 counties across New York, and has a goal to raise over $75,000.00. All funds raised in support of ‘‘Changing the Legacy of Agent Orange’’ will support Veterans with doc-umented Agent Orange related medical needs. Funds will also support these Veteran’s chil-dren with documented Agent Orange related medical needs. Mr. Speaker, Janet Mahoney has distin-guished herself throughout her remarkable twenty plus year career in the New York American Legion Auxiliary where she has been an unwavering advocate for our Vet-erans, their families, and our communities. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating her on her countless achievements during a remarkable career. f 
TRIBUTE TO EAGLE SCOUT JEFFREY WALTON 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Jeffrey Walton of Boy Scout Troop 104 in Corning, Iowa for achieving the rank of Eagle Scout. The Eagle Scout rank is the highest ad-vancement rank in scouting. Only about five percent of Boy Scouts earn the Eagle Scout Award. The award is a performance-based achievement with high standards that have been well-maintained for more than a century. To earn the Eagle Scout rank, a Boy Scout is obligated to pass specific tests that are or-ganized by requirements and merit badges, as well as completing an Eagle Project to benefit the community. Jeffrey’s Eagle Scout project involved constructing a large sign to be placed in the yard at Country Haven, a residential care facility, making it easier for people to lo-cate the facility. The work ethic Jeffrey has shown in his Eagle Project and every other project leading up to his Eagle Scout rank speaks volumes of his commitment to serving a cause greater than himself and assisting his community. Mr. Speaker, the example set by this young man and his supportive family demonstrates the rewards of hard work, dedication and per-severance. I am honored to represent Jeffrey and his family in the United States Congress. I ask that all of my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating him on reaching the rank of Eagle Scout and in wishing him nothing but continued success in his future education and career. HONORING SARAH TURNER HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a woman who is tenderly known as ‘‘Mama Sarah’’ within her community: Mrs. Sarah Pauline Turner. Sarah turned 100 years old on April 2nd, 2016, and I am so grateful to be able to help celebrate her reaching that remarkable milestone by honoring her in the hallowed halls of Congress. Sarah is a treasured member of her com-munity whose love for people became self-evi-dent early on in her life when, after completing her education, she worked for the Veteran Ad-mission in Washington, D.C. She later moved to New York City and became a friend to ev-eryone she has met in the Bronx. Sarah’s list of community service accomplishments is long and distinguished. She has received an im-pressive amount of awards and recognition from her community, including for some of her most important work with RAIN Eastchester Senior Center and Eastchester Housing. As involved as she is with her community, Sarah is just as involved with her church. She has offered spiritual guidance to the members of Burke Avenue Baptist Church for over 50 years, and has also served as part of the Pas-tor’s Aide Ministry, Gospel Chorus, Senior Usher Board, and is currently President of Willing Workers Ministry. Sarah’s unwavering dedication to her church community has not gone unnoticed. She gained a lifetime mem-bership of the Eastern Stars Organization, where she serves as Worthy Matron. There is no doubt that Sarah is an out-standing citizen of the Bronx Borough. She has been a pillar of her community, who has gracefully bestowed joy and happiness upon everyone she has met. I want to congratulate Sarah on reaching this remarkable milestone, and as Congressman for the northeast Bronx, thank her for all she has done in the commu-nity.

PATTY DUKE ‘‘QUEEN OF TV MOV-IES AND TIRELESS ADVOCATE FOR THOSE STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES’’ 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Patty Duke, an American icon and advocate for those suffering in silence from various forms of mental illness, who passed away on March 29, 2016 at the age of 69. Patty Duke was born Anna Marie Duke on December 14, 1946 in Elmhurst, New York. Anna Duke and her siblings grew up in a difficult household, raised by an alcoholic fa-ther and a mother who suffered from what was then called ‘‘manic depression,’’ later known to be bipolar disorder. Anna Duke was introduced to acting by her brother’s managers, John and Ethel Ross, who changed her name to Patty and eventu-ally became her guardians. Later in Patty Duke’s life, she revealed that she was a survivor of sexual assault. In 1959, Patty Duke’s first big role came when she was cast as Helen Keller in the Broadway version of The Miracle Worker, with Anne Bancroft portraying her teacher, Anne Sullivan. Then in 1962, that play was turned into a feature film, in which she also starred. For her performance in the film, the 16-year- old won a ‘‘Promising Newcomer’’ Golden Globe as well as an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress—making her the youngest person to win an Oscar at that time. Sadly, following her Oscar win, Patty Duke began to privately unravel. The abuse she endured along with her fam-ily’s history of bipolar disorder began to plague her. All the while, she continued to dazzle the outside world with a successful career. Patty Duke then starred in her own sitcom called The Patty Duke Show, which she art-fully played two cousin characters simulta-neously. In 1965, she also became a pop music con-tender with her top 10 hit ‘‘Don’t Just Stand There’’ and headlined the acclaimed film Billie, which was the first movie ever sold to a tele-vision network. Thus, began Patty Duke’s reign as the ‘‘Queen of TV Movies.’’ Patty Duke continued her big-screen career by starring in the cult classic Valley of The Dolls in 1967 and indie films such as Me, Nat-alie in 1969. Patty Duke married assistant director Harry Falk, remaining in the marriage from 1965 to 1969. After her marriage ended, Patty Duke bore a son named Sean Patrick Duke. In 1972, she married actor John Astin, who played Gomez in the television version of The Addams Family. John Astin adopted her son Sean, and fa-thered her second son, Mackenzie Astin, born in 1973. Then in 1976, Patty Duke won her second Emmy for the highly successful mini-series Captains and the Kings. Other popular TV movies followed, including the 1979 small screen version of The Miracle Worker, in which she portrayed Anne Sullivan, a role that won her third Emmy. In the mid-1980s, she became president of the Screen Actors Guild. Her 1987 autobiography, Call Me Anna, was made into a TV movie in 1990 in which she portrayed herself and served as co-producer. Following in 1992 second book, A Brilliant Madness: Living With Manic Depression Ill-ness, was published. With the help of family and friends Patty Duke was able to quiet her personal demons, and become a vocal advocate for those suf-fering from mental illnesses, along with dispel-ling social stigmas attached to them. Patty Duke died on March 29, 2016 in Coeur D’Alene, Idaho, at the age of 69 from a sepsis infection from a ruptured intestine. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to take a mo-ment of silence in remembrance of this strong woman who was able to stand against the suf-focating struggles of depression and became a source of inspiration for hundreds of thou-sands of Americans struggling with mental ill-nesses.

STANDARD MERGER AND ACQUISI-TION REVIEWS THROUGH EQUAL RULES ACT OF 2015 
SPEECH OF  
HON. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN 
OF MARYLAND  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, March 23, 2016 Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in opposition to H.R. 2745 or the SMARTER Act. This bill is another delay tactic that stops us from the meaningful work of passing a budget. Too many bills that have come out of the Judiciary Committee this year are designed to erode consumer rights and roll back estab-lished judicial precedent. We should be considering and debating meaningful bills to address criminal justice re-form and common sense gun safety. Instead, we are here voting to fix a problem that does not exist and does not need our at-tention. A Politico article from two days ago was ti-tled ‘‘Congress setting a low bar for doing nothing.’’ My Democratic colleagues and I have bills and agendas that we would like to bring to the floor to address real problems facing real Americans. This bill is not smart. It is a timewaster and I hope after spring recess we can come back to a robust agenda and work on behalf of the American people.

HONORING SYDNEY ALDERMAN PERRY ON THE OCCASION OF HER RETIREMENT 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Ms. D
ELAURO. Mr. Speaker, today marks the end of an era at the Jewish Federation and Jewish Community Center of Greater New Haven as they gather to celebrate the retire-ment of their President and CEO, and my dear friend, Sydney Alderman Perry. Sydney began her career with the Jewish Federation and JCC nearly 30 years ago in the Department of Jewish Education. Edu-cation was her passion and over the course of her seventeen years in that department she not only worked to improve the synagogue supplementary schools, she also developed and implemented a number of innovative edu-cation programs for both adults and teens. In addition to ‘‘A Taste of Honey,’’ an adult learning lecture series that attracts hundreds of adults, Sydney spearheaded the Israel Ex-perience Savings program, which helps young people travel to Israel and initiated Talmud Torah Meyuchad, an individualized Jewish education program for children with special needs. But perhaps the contribution she is most proud of is the establishment of the suc-cessful community Hebrew High School, MAKOM, which serves hundreds of teens throughout the New Haven area every year. She was tapped as associate executive di-rector to supervise such things as the Holo-caust Education and Prejudice Reduction Project and went on to become the executive director of the federation for six years, before taking on the title of CEO of the merged fed-eration and the Jewish Community Center of New Haven. Under her leadership the federation has ex-panded its agenda and outreach to enhance Jewish life and enrich the lives of those most in need both locally and internationally. Food4Kids sends local students who depend on the breakfast and lunch programs home with a backpack of staples for the weekends. The Jewish Coalition for Literacy has more than two hundred volunteers who read and talk with students. The federation supports the elderly housing complexes as well as edu-cational institutions across Greater New Haven and raises funds for Yale Hillel and the University of Connecticut Hillel; the Jewish Historical Society and the JCC. Beyond her leadership at the Jewish Fed-eration and JCC, Sydney is an extraordinary advocate for Jewish continuity. She has served as a consultant to the community on educational endeavors, including the Anne Frank Project, Shepherd ’92, Jerusalem 3000 and the celebration of Israel’s 50th Anniver-sary. Sydney is an extraordinary scholar, often called upon nationally to give workshops and has served as scholar-in-residence for several communities. Sydney has shown an unparalleled dedica-tion to Jewish education in our community and throughout the nation—a commitment that is reflected in the myriad of awards she has been honored with over the years. She is an inspiration. I am proud to join the many family, friends, and colleagues who have gathered this evening in extending my sincere thanks and appreciation to Sydney Alderman Perry for her incredible work with the Jewish Federation and Jewish Community Center of Greater New Haven and her outstanding service to our community. My very best wishes to her, her children, and grandchildren for many more years of health and happiness as she enjoys her retirement.

TRIBUTE TO RYANNE MULLEN 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Ryanne Mullen of Villisca, Iowa, for being awarded first place for her outstanding essay honoring our military veterans by the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Department of Iowa. Ryanne is a stu-dent at Enarson Elementary in Villisca, Iowa. The theme for this essay contest was ‘‘What Does A Veteran Mean To Me?’’, and was open to all fifth graders in public, private, and home schools throughout Iowa. Ryanne’s essay reads: 
I deeply thought about what a veteran means to me. I have chosen to share emo-tional descriptions of what a veteran means to me. The initial meaning of a veteran to me is how fear is considered, understood, and accepted but they still make the decision to face this fear for the freedom of their fami-lies and all other families they are standing strong for. The second meaning of a veteran to me is courage. The attitude of never giving up, never backing down, and always remaining faithful. These are characteristics of semper fidelis. The third meaning I want to express is brotherhood, which is described as equally caring for the life of your fellow soldier. The fact that no one is left behind especially the veterans that are KIA, MIA, or POW. I will carry memories of them with me forever. 
Mr. Speaker, I applaud and congratulate Ryanne for earning this award. It is because of Iowans like her that I’m proud to represent our great state. I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating Ryanne for writing this outstanding essay honoring our veterans. I wish her nothing but continued success in all she does.

ST. EPHREM CHURCH PARISH 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. MICHAEL G. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, St. Ephrem Church Parish, founded in June 1966, is cele-brating 50 years of faithful service to the Bensalem, Bucks County parish—a Golden Jubilee. The heart of the parish is the Catholic faith; its mission, meeting the spiritual needs of all parishioners. Dedicated, devout pastors and priests have overseen the mission throughout its history and continue on this path, today. For a half-century, the small par-ish has grown to include 3,300 registered fam-ilies and more than 11,000 members. St. Ephrem’s also provides an excellent education in pre-K through 8th grade to approximately 450 children, including another 200 in Sunday School. St. Ephrem’s is known to have a strong community outreach program that touches many families in the parish through the Boy and Girl Scouts, Catholic Daughters of America, Bereavement Support, Family Counseling and active Teen and Youth sports programs. For your 50 years of spiritual guid-ance, we extend our heartiest congratulations on this Golden Jubilee and sincere wishes for continued growth and service in the coming years. f 
HONORING DANIEL BEN-ZAKEN AND RACHEL BEAN 
HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor of Daniel Ben-Zaken and Rachel Bean, who were awarded in this year’s C-SPAN stu-dent documentary contest. Daniel and Rachel are students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Their powerful documentary, ‘‘Target,’’ ex-plores the issues and arguments surrounding gun safety and school shootings. The theme of this year’s contest was ‘‘Road to the White House: What’s the Issue You Most Want Can-didates to Discuss during the 2016 Presi-dential Campaign?’’ Nearly three thousand video submissions from almost six thousand students across the nation were submitted to this contest, and I am thrilled that Daniel and Rachel’s documentary was recognized as ex-ceptional. I am honored that these young filmmakers chose to interview me for their documentary. In my remarks, I expressed my deep concern regarding gun violence in America, especially in schools. Our students must be able to study and learn in a safe environment absent the threat of gun violence. With an average of nearly one school shooting every week, this documentary covers a timely and vital issue facing our nation. Again, congratulations to Daniel and Rachel. I wish them the best of luck with their future endeavors and academic pursuits. It is with great pleasure that I honor them, and I hope they will continue to inspire young South Flo-ridians to become involved in issues they care about.

RECOGNIZING CASILDA LUNA 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the House of Representatives to join me in recognizing Casilda Luna, who celebrated her 90th birthday on Wednesday, April 6, 2016. A native of Sanchez, Dominican Republic, Casilda Luna is often referred to as a pioneer in the Hispanic community. Casilda Luna moved to Washington, D.C. in 1961, and was one of the first Hispanic activists in Adams Morgan. Casilda organized weekly social gath-erings that evolved into community discus-sions, which addressed social problems in the community. She then became involved with the Latin American Festival organizing com-mittee and the Latino Affairs Office of the Dis-trict of Columbia. Casilda was the co-founder of the Hispanic Festival and the Mayor’s Office of Latino Af-fairs, where she helped to promote the inclu-sion of Hispanics in the Metropolitan Police Department. She also founded Mujeres Unidas Latinas en Accion (MULA), which helped Hispanic women who were new to the District of Columbia by bringing them together through community activities. I ask the House to join me in recognizing her 90th birthday and her more than 50 years of activism in the national capital region. Casilda Luna is a special woman whose serv-ice to our community is greatly appreciated. f 
IN HONOR OF THE RETIREMENT OF BILL HANEY 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this time to acknowledge one of my constituents who has demonstrated day-in day-out what living the American dream really means. Bill Haney graduated from the College of New Jersey with a Bachelor of Science in Education. While teaching elementary school in Talbot County, Maryland, Bill worked to earn his Master’s Degree in Supervision and Human Relations from George Washington University. In 1983, Mr. Haney accepted the position of Chief Executive Officer of Every Citizen Has Opportunities, Inc. (ECHO), a Leesburg, Virginia based non-profit which pro-vides employment, training, and community in-tegration to individuals with disabilities. Mr. Haney has decided it is time to retire from his life’s work, thus ending a bright chapter in ECHO’s history. As Mr. Haney’s extraordinary career comes to a close, I would like to take a moment to highlight the work he has done over the years. When Mr. Haney took over as CEO at ECHO, the organization was supporting about 75 indi-viduals with disabilities, with an annual budget of under three hundred thousand dollars, and only two worksites. Under Mr. Haney’s leader-ship, ECHO’s budget has grown to nearly five million dollars, and has expanded services to nearly 170 individuals with disabilities. ECHO has approximately 15 work locations, ranging from Loudoun County Public Schools to Inova Hospitals. In addition to his work at ECHO, Mr. Haney has extended his skills to the community through his work on the Board of Directors for the Loudoun County Red Cross, as Cubmaster for the Pack 11 Boy Scouts in Boyce, Virginia, and as a Sunday school teacher at St. John the Baptist Roman Catho-lic Church in Front Royal, Virginia. Mr. Haney leaves ECHO after a storied 33 years at the helm with zero debt, positive cash flow, and outright ownership of its facility. ECHO will continue serving our community, but without a doubt, will miss Mr. Haney’s leadership and dedication. At this moment, Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in extending our sincerest thanks to Mr. Haney for all the work he has done in our community, and wish him the best in his future endeavors.

THE 48TH ANNIVERSARY OF AS-SASSINATION OF REV. DR. MAR-TIN LUTHER KING, JR. 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 11, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this year, the nation observes for the 48th year, the an-niversary of the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Each year on this day, Americans remember the life and legacy of a man who brought hope and healing to Amer-ica. Fatally shot at the Lorraine Motel in Mem-phis, Tennessee, on Thursday, April 4,1968, at the age of 39, Dr. King was rushed to St. Joseph’s Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 7:05 p.m. that evening. He was a prominent leader of the Civil Rights Movement and Nobel laureate for Peace who was known for his creative use of nonviolence and civil disobedience. Our hearts continue beating, rejoicing his enduring leg-acy, and knowing that nothing is impossible when we are guided by the better angels of our nature. The incident of domestic terrorism that took the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s life, reminds us of his belief, ‘‘that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality. This is why right, temporarily defeated, is stronger than evil triumphant.’’ Dr. King confronted the risk of death and made that recognition part of his philosophy. He taught that murder could not stop the struggle for equal rights. His inspiring words filled a great void in our nation, and answered our collective longing to become a country that truly lived by its noblest principles. Yet, Dr. King knew that it was not enough just to talk the talk; he had to walk the walk for his words to be credible. And so we commemorate on this day a man of action, who put his life on the line for free-dom and justice every day. We honor the courage of a man who endured harassment, threats and beatings, and even bombings. We commemorate the man who went to jail 29 times to achieve freedom for others, and who knew he would pay the ultimate price for his leadership, but kept on marching, protesting and organizing anyway. Dr. King once said that we all have to de-cide whether we, ‘‘will walk in the light of cre-ative altruism or the darkness of destructive selfishness. ‘‘Life’s most persistent and nag-ging question,’’ he said, is ‘‘what are you doing for others?’’ Strikingly, when Dr. King discussed the end of his mortal life during one of his last sermons, ‘‘I’ve Been to the Moun-tain Top,’’ on February 4, 1968, in the pulpit of Ebenezer Baptist Church, even then he lift-ed the value of service upward as the hall-mark of a full life, remarking: ‘‘I’d like some-body to mention on that day, Martin Luther King, Jr. tried to give his life serving others. I want you to say on that day, that I did try in my life . . . to love and serve humanity.’’ We should also remember that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was, above all, a per-son who was always willing to speak the truth. There is perhaps no better example of Dr. King’s moral integrity and consistency than his criticism of the Vietnam War, waged by the Johnson Administration; an administration that was otherwise a friend and champion of civil and human rights. Martin Luther King, Jr. was born in Atlanta, Georgia on January 15, 1929. His youth was spent in our country’s Deep South, then run by Jim Crow laws and the Klu Klux Klan. For young African-Americans, it was an environ-ment even more dangerous than the one they face today. Nonetheless, a young Martin man-aged to find a dream; one that he pieced to-gether from his readings, including the Bible, classics, philosophical literature, and just about any other book he could get his hands on. Not only did those books allow him to edu-cate himself, they also allowed him to work through the destructive and traumatic experi-ences of blatant discrimination, and the dis-criminatory abuse inflicted on him, his family, and humanity. The life of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. that we honor today, could have turned out to be the life of just another African-American who would have had to learn to be happy with the limitations of his circumstances—with only what he was allowed. He learned however, to use his imagination and his dreams to see right through those ‘‘White Only’’ signs—to see the reality that all men, and women, re-gardless of their place of origin, their gender, or their creed, are created equal. Through his studies, Dr. King learned that training his mind and broadening his intellect effectively shield-ed him from the demoralizing effects of seg-regation and discrimination. Dr. King was a dreamer. His dreams were a tool, through which he was able to lift his mind beyond the reality of his segregated society and into a realm where it was possible that white and black, red, yellow and brown, and all others live and work alongside each other and pros-per. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. how-ever, was not an idle daydreamer. He shared his visions through speeches that motivated others to join the nonviolent effort to lift them-selves from poverty and isolation and create an even better America where equal justice is a fact of life. In the Declaration of Independ-ence in 1776, Thomas Jefferson wrote, ‘‘We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all Men are Created Equal.’’ At that time and for centuries to come, Afri-can-Americans were historically, culturally, so-cially and legally excluded from inclusion in the institutional execution of that declaration. Dr. King’s ‘‘I Have a Dream’’ Speech, deliv-ered nearly 53 years ago, on August 28, 1963, was a clarion call to each citizen of this great nation that still echoes today. His request was simply and eloquently conveyed—asking America to allow its citizens to live out the words written in its Declaration of Independ-ence and to have a place in this nation’s Bill of Rights. Provoking that clarion call, the 1960s were a time of great crisis and conflict. The night-mares of Americans were filled with troubling images that rose like lava from volcanoes of violence and the terrors that they had to face, both domestically and internationally. The dec-ade bore the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War; and Americans were left to cra-dle the assassinations of President John Fitz-gerald Kennedy, Malcolm X, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and the man we honor here today. Dr. Martin Luther King’s dream helped us turn the corner on civil rights. Set in motion with Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, enduring 381 days, ending only when the United States Supreme Court ruled that discrimination, on account of race in the field of interstate public transportation, was uncon-stitutional. The dream whisked forward into the hearts of those aggrieved in Alabama’s Bible belt and the minds of Selma citizens orga-nizing and peacefully marching for suffrage on March 7, 1965—a march that ended with vio-lence at the hands of law enforcement offi-cers, as demonstrators crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Dr. King used nonviolent tactics to protest against Jim Crow laws in the South, orga-nizing and leading demonstrations for deseg-regation, labor and voting rights. When the life of Dr. Martin Luther King was stolen from us, he was still a very young man, only 39 years old. People remember that Dr. King died in Memphis, but few remember why he was there. On that fateful day in 1968 Dr. King came to Memphis to support a strike by the city’s sanitation workers. The sanitation work-ers there had recently formed a chapter of the American Federation of State, County and Mu-nicipal Employees to demand better wages and working conditions for themselves. The city, however, refused to recognize the union and when the 1,300 employees walked off of their jobs, the police broke up the rally with mace and police batons. Resultantly, union leaders summoned Dr. King to Mem-phis. Despite the danger he might face, enter-ing such a volatile situation, it was an invita-tion he could not refuse—not because he longed for danger, but because the labor movement was deeply intertwined with the civil rights movement, for which he gave so many years of his life. Moments before his murder, Dr. King went out onto the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis and standing near his room, he was struck at 6:01 p.m., by a single .30-06 bullet that James Earl Ray fired from a Remington Model 760 Gamemaster, completing the as-sassination. The killing sparked outcry and riots across the country, in addition to stimu-lating political support for passage of the Gun Control Act of 1968. For some, Dr. King’s assassination meant the end of the strategy of nonviolence. Others in the movement reaffirmed the need to carry on his work—as the nations’ work—continuing the tradition of nonviolence. That night in Indi-anapolis, shortly after discovering that Dr. King had been murdered, New York Senator Robert F. Kennedy, campaigning to gain the presi-dential nomination to represent the Democratic Party, who himself would be murdered in Los Angles two months later, addressed an angry, heart-broken, shocked, and horrified audience in a predominantly black neighborhood of the city. The Chief of Police in Indianapolis advised Senator Kennedy that he could not provide protection and was worried he would be at risk in talking about the death of the revered lead-er. Robert Kennedy saw something more pow-erful though and, channeling Dr. King’s spirit, decided to go ahead. Standing on a flatbed truck, he spoke acknowledging that many would be filled with anger as rumors of riots palpated in listeners’ hearts. He said: ‘‘For those of you who are black and are tempted to be filled with hatred and mistrust of the in-justice of such an act, against all white people, I would only say that I can also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling. I had a mem-ber of my family killed . . . killed by a white

man.’’ The Senator said that the country had to make an effort to, ‘‘go beyond these rather difficult times,’’ and needed and wanted unity between blacks and whites, and asked the au-dience members to pray for the King family and for the country. The death of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., will never overshadow his life. His legacy as a dreamer and a man of action stands strong. It is a legacy of hope, tempered with peace. It is a legacy not quite yet fulfilled. I hope that Dr. King’s vision of equality under the law is never lost to us who, in the present, toil in times of disparities of inequity. For with-out that vision—without that dream—we can never continue to improve on our collective human condition. For those who have already forgotten, or whose vision is already clouded by the fog of complacency, I would like to recite the immor-tal words of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.: 
‘‘I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former shareholders will be able to sit down together at the table of brother-hood. I have a dream that one day, even the State of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but for the content of their character. I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day down in Ala-bama with its vicious racists, with its Gov-ernor having his lips dripping with words of interposition and nullification—one day right there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with lit-tle white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it to-gether.’’ 
Positioning the nation to accept a bold call to action to address the wrongs of slavery, ‘‘separate, but equal,’’ boycotts, assassina-tions, and Black power—he gave a much longed for voice to the history of uprising that drove global civil rights forward. Dr. King’s dream did not stop at racial equality; his ulti-mate dream was one of human equality and dignity. He believed that freedom and justice were the birthrights of every individual in America. His dream became the dream of a people, documenting their collective chal-lenges and struggle toward change; a hope to achieve a more perfect Union. The powerful words of his beloved widow Coretta Scott King remind us that, ‘‘Freedom is never really won; you earn it and win it in every generation.’’ Were he alive today, I be-lieve that Dr. King would embolden us to ac-knowledge that this story and struggle, that started many centuries ago, continues today— with you. His, is an American story, and it is for us, the living, to continue that fight today and forever, following the great spirit that in-spired the Rev.
