PASSENGER RAIL REFORM AND 
INVESTMENT ACT OF 2015 
SPEECH OF  
HON. ELIZABETH H. ESTY 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Wednesday, March 4, 2015 
The House in Committee of the Whole 
House on the state of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 749) to reauthor-ize Federal support for passenger rail pro-grams, and for other purposes: 
Ms. ESTY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to 
voice my strong support for high-speed rail service along the Northeast Corridor with stops in Connecticut. High-speed rail service provides a fast, safe, and reliable transpor-tation alternative for passengers. Expanding high-speed rail in Connecticut would go a long way in alleviating highway congestion and pro-moting faster travel within and through the state. In addition, high-speed rail along the Northeast Corridor would create new jobs, boost manufacturing, and bolster America’s competitiveness in our global economy. Not including a stop for Connecticut in a study on high-speed rail along the Northeast Corridor is a serious mistake, and I stand firmly against any proposal that excludes Connecticut.

STEPHEN AND KATHLEEN HUVANE 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, March 13, 2015 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is always a 
pleasure when neighborhood groups in my district pick incredibly deserving community members to fill important positions of promi-nence. This year, the planning committee of the Eastchester Irish American Social Club (EIASC) has outdone themselves with the se-lection of Stephen and Kathleen Huvane as Honorees of the annual Eastchester St. Pat-rick’s Day Parade. 
Like me, Stephen and Kathleen are both 
Bronx natives, with families who immigrated to America searching for a better life. Stephen’s parents came from the counties Mayo and Galway in Ireland, while Kathleen’s came from County Kerry. 
A graduate of Manhattan College, Stephen 
received his B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering, while Kathleen earned her B.S. in Nursing from the College of Mt. St. Vincent. Today, Kathleen is a Registered Pediatric Nurse at the Eastchester Pediatric Medical group, and Stephen works at Purdue Pharma LLP. 
Both Stephen and Kathleen are active in the 
community, especially the EIASC, of which they have been members for over 16 years. They are also five year members of Swazi Legacy, a not-for-profit that helps marginalized and homeless young people in Swaziland. Today Stephen and Kathleen live in 
Eastchester, where together they have raised four wonderful children; Kaitlin, Eilish, Ste-phen, and Kieran. They are active members of various school functions and fundraisers, in addition to Stephen’s work on the EIASC St. Patrick’s Parade Committee, which he has been a part of for the past 10 years. 
As this year’s St. Patrick’s Day Parade ap-
proaches, I want to congratulate Stephen and Kathleen for their selection as Parade Hon-orees, and thank them on the occasion for all they have done to better our community.

HONORING VERNA TELLER 
HON. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM 
OF NEW MEXICO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, March 13, 2015 
Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New 
Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Verna Teller, a remarkable woman whose steadfast political leadership and tireless civic activism has had a lasting impact on the peo-ple in her community. 
In March of each year, we celebrate Wom-
en’s History month to honor women who have made invaluable contributions to their commu-nities and the world. Verna is one such woman. Verna has never tired of fighting for the community she loves. In the face of gen-der discrimination, Verna ushered in a new era of leadership, becoming the first female governor of Isleta Pueblo in 1987. By spear-heading passage of a constitutional amend-ment requiring tribal leadership positions to be elected, as well as fighting to make tribal council meetings more open and accessible, Verna ensured that women’s voices were not only heard but amplified within the Pueblo community. 
Following her tenure as governor, Verna 
continued to serve Isleta Pueblo as Chief Jus-tice, President of the Tribal Council, and coun-cil member. Under her watchful guidance, Isleta Pueblo became the first tribe in the United States to assert their right under fed-eral law to establish water quality standards to protect their community. 
Verna went on to serve as project manager 
for the Native Peoples-Native Homelands Southwest Initiative, a project sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Adminis-tration (NASA) to examine the effects of cli-mate change on Native Americans. As Project Director for Tribal Tobacco Health, Education and Outreach, Verna helped develop cancer prevention programs through Indian Health Services, the Centers for Disease Control, and the American Cancer Society. She also ran a consulting business, ATV Enterprises; served as a member of the All Indian Pueblo Council; was named ‘‘Indian Woman of the Year;’’ and has received numerous other accolades. 
It is astonishing to think of all that Verna 
has accomplished in her life. In the face of ad-versity, discrimination, and uncertainty, Verna’s determination to lead her community 
never faltered. As Eleanor Roosevelt once said: ‘‘We gain strength, and courage, and confidence by each experience in which we really stop to look fear in the face—we must do that which we think we cannot.’’ Verna’s enduring legacy of community development, service and sacrifice will continue to be an in-spiration for future generations of young women.

THE ANNIVERSARY OF SUMGAIT 
POGROMS 
HON. DAVID N. CICILLINE 
OF RHODE ISLAND  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, March 13, 2015 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, this week we 
commemorate the 27th Anniversary of the hor-rific Sumgait Pogroms. On February 27, 1988 organized mobs of Azerbaijanis aimed at kill-ing and driving Armenian Christians living in Sumgait from their homes. Police allowed the pogroms to go on for 3 days, during which Ar-menians were burned alive and thrown from windows. 
The Sumgait massacre is a black mark on 
history and sadly, this event sparked further violence as Armenians would be targeted less than 9 months later in Kirovbad and again in Baku in 1990. 
The Azerbaijani Government has shamefully 
continued to undermine prospects for a lasting peace in the Southern Caucuses, recently they were reported violating the ceasefire and killing several Armenian soldiers on the bor-der. 
From the earliest days of its formation, the 
people of Nagorno Karabakh have fought and died for their independence and held open and transparent elections, a tradition of de-mocracy that the United States should honor and respect. 
As we reflect on these horrific outbreaks of 
ethnic violence, I join with Armenians in Rhode Island, and across the world in remem-bering these victims and renewing our commit-ment to justice, independence and finding last-ing peace.

HONORING JOSEPH B. HOULIHAN 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL

Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, the story of Amer-
ica is the story of men and women emigrating from foreign lands to make a better life for themselves and their families. Joseph Houlihan’s success, a result in part of the sac-rifices his great grandparents made in coming to America from county Kerry in Ireland, is ex-actly what that American story is about. 
The Houlihans came to America and found 
success in real estate, a family business that

endured the generations. Joe, a graduate of 
Iona College with a degree in Business Ad-ministration, followed suit, earning a CPA be-fore commencing his own real estate career. 
As the Managing Partner of the Residential 
Sales Group at Houlihan & O’Malley Real Es-tate Services in Bronxville, Joe has had tre-mendous success. His work has been recog-nized by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, where he won the Diamond Award for sales over $15,000,000, while also receiv-ing the Westchester County Five Star Real Estate Agent Award on several occasions. 
Outside of work, Joe is an active member of 
St. Joseph’s Parish in Bronxville, and the Eastchester Irish American Social Club (EIASC). He has also been on the Board of Trustees at the School of the Holy Child in Rye, and currently resides in Fleetwood with his beautiful wife, Anna Filipkowski, and their three incredible daughters, Kasia, Julia, and Emily. 
This year, the EIASC selected Joe to be the 
Grand Marshal of the annual Eastchester St. Patrick’s Day Parade. Joe was shocked and amazed by the nomination, a testament to his humble nature and belief that you work hard not for accolades or adulation, but simply to improve your life and the lives around you. 
Joe’s selection, however, was no accident. 
For all he has accomplished and all he has done to improve the community, I can’t think of a better honoree to be Eastchester’s St. Patrick’s Day Parade Grand Marshal. Con-gratulations to Joe and to the entire Houlihan family on this honor.

HONORING THE 75TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE DOCHIKI CIVIC AND SOCIAL CLUB, INC. 
HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, March 13, 2015 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the 75th anniversary of the Dochiki Civic and Social Club in Newport News, Virginia. 
Originally known as ‘‘Los Amigas,’’ the club 
was founded on March 15, 1940 by eleven businessmen gathered at the Odessa Barber Shop located at 29th Street and Chestnut Av-enue in Newport News. Two years later, the name of the club was changed to ‘‘Dochiki,’’ a word of Chinese origin meaning love and friendship. The founders of the club were Homer Hines, Ward Bridgeforth, Virgil Evans, B. C. Anthony, Oliver Hawkins, James Haw-kins, Harold Heath, James Jones, Irving Thomas, Robert Whitney, and Howard Ovelest. 
The club initially met in members’ homes, 
and in 1948 they relocated to a room above a club member’s garage which they nick-named ‘‘Alley Inn.’’ As membership increased, the club leased larger space to accommodate its growing membership, and, on August 7, 1952, the club purchased property at 2705 Chestnut Avenue in Newport News, where it still meets today. In addition to this property, the club has acquired additional property along Chestnut Avenue through donations of club members, including Cornelius Glover, which allowed the club to significantly expand its facilities. Today, the club occupies much of the 2700 block of Chestnut Avenue and in-
cludes numerous amenities, such as a 300- seat ballroom, a commercial kitchen, restroom suites, office space, recreational and storage areas, lounges, a 24-seat bar with adjacent kitchen, a locker room, and ample parking, all of which are accessible for individuals with disabilities. The club offers its facilities for use free of charge to many community groups and has also served as the Chestnut Avenue vot-ing precinct for many years. 
While Dochiki remains a place for men to 
socialize, debate politics, and enjoy sports, women have also played an active role in the club for much of its history. In 1960, the Dochiki Wives Auxiliary, Inc. was established to compliment the men’s club and support its educational, social, health and civic projects targeted at aiding charities, youth programs, and senior citizens. 
Since its founding 75 years ago, the Dochiki 
Civic and Social Club has been actively in-volved in the Newport News community pro-viding outstanding civic, social and philan-thropic leadership to their fellow citizens. The club has raised tens of thousands of dollars for local charities, youth programs, and senior citizen projects. It has also strongly encour-aged all of its members and fellow citizens in the community to be actively engaged in the electoral process. 
Today, the club’s membership includes busi-
nessmen, educators, elected officials, mem-bers of the military and other professionals throughout the community, all of whom are de-voted to supporting and improving the New-port News community through active civic en-gagement. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Dochiki 
Civic and Social Club on their 75th anniver-sary and I thank them for all that they have done to make Newport News a better place to live, work, and raise a family.

HONORING LELA KASKALLA 
HON. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM 
OF NEW MEXICO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, March 13, 2015 
Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New 
Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Lela Kaskalla, a passionate woman who has remained steadfast in her commitment to sup-port economic growth and cultural develop-ment in her community. 
This past Sunday marked a special moment 
for women across the globe; it was Inter-national Women’s Day, a time when we come together to remember the progress that women have made and recognize the many firsts that have opened doors for younger gen-erations of female leaders. It made me think of Lela Kaskalla, who in 1996 became the first woman elected governor of Nambe Pueblo. 
During her term as governor, Lela worked 
tirelessly to defeat anti-tribal legislation that proposed a tax on tribal gasoline distribution and went on to become the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) recording sec-retary. Lela’s presence made an immediate impact, and she was instrumental in NCAI’s 54th annual meeting in Albuquerque. 
Lela is a natural leader who understands 
the importance of a strong, united community. In an interview with the Albuquerque Journal she explained: ‘‘You don’t do much standing 
alone, but together you can do more.’’ Lela’s passion, commitment and ability to build a co-alition around a common cause caught Gov-ernor Gary Johnson’s attention. 
In 1998, Governor Johnson appointed Lela 
to the New Mexico State Fair Commission, where she later became Vice Chair of the State Board. Whether it is through Lela’s ac-tive engagement with the Nambe Women’s Group and the Northern New Mexico Commu-nity College Pueblos Institutes, her time as a member of the board of directors for the In-dian Pueblo Cultural Center/Indian Pueblos Marketing, Inc., or in her current role with the Branch of Administration for the Bureau of In-dian Affairs at the Northern Pueblos Agency, Lela’s commitment to tribal communities in New Mexico has never wavered. 
Lela’s groundbreaking achievement set an 
example for other women in New Mexico. It reminds me of the progress women before us have made in our nation’s history, and in par-ticular, the large, white, rough-hewn statue of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony and Lucretia Mott that sits in the Capitol Build-ing in Washington D.C. It is a striking figure featuring the faces of the three revolutionary women, carefully etched and chiseled into the unfinished block of marble. The unfinished composition represents the unfinished work left with respect to equal rights for women. With the help of leaders like Lela right here in New Mexico we can, and we will, finish that work. Lela’s commitment to her community will continue to be an inspiration for future genera-tions of young women.

HONORING HATTIE L. LUCAS 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, March 13, 2015 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, communities 
thrive when hard work, dedication, and sac-rifice are set by voluntary example. Hattie L. Lucas’s actions embody these ideals for her community in Co-op City. 
Hattie Lucas was born in Bramberg, South 
Carolina. Her family decided to relocate to New York City when Hattie was six years old, living in both Manhattan and Brooklyn. Eventu-ally, Hattie settled in Co-op City in the Bronx, where she has lived for 40 years. 
Hattie began her long career of service in 
Co-op, serving the NYC Department for the Aging, Co-op City NORC Advisory Board, and the Bronx Preparatory Charter School Parents Association Executive Board. She also has been active in her church, Co-op City Baptist Church, the Dreiser Retirees, and the Co-op City NAACP. Hattie has also been an out-spoken supporter of our young people through the Youth and Community Affairs Committees. 
Even with her busy schedule, Hattie worked 
hard to receive a Bachelor’s degree from Mercy College, and a Master’s of Social Work from Fordham University. 
As a professional, Hattie dedicated herself 
to her work at the City of New York, where she served for 35 years. She was admired for her efforts with the Human Resources Admin-istration, Health and Hospital Corporation, and as Director of Advocacy at the Administration for Children’s Services.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E325 March 13, 2015 
As dedicated as she has been to the com-
munity, Hattie’s true pride is the family she’s raised in the Bronx, including one son, six grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren. She also raises her 17-year-old grand-daughter, Ashley. Following Hattie’s retirement from the City, 
she became the Program Director of the Co- op City Grandparent Connection Program. The program, under her leadership, grew into a ne-cessity for her neighborhood; becoming the largest relative caregiver programs in New York City, which includes a myriad of services for deserving grandparents, adolescents, and 
children. 
After retiring in November 2014, Hattie con-
tinues to volunteer and use her sharp skills for her Co-op City community. It is an honor to join the JASA Grandparents Connection in celebrating Hattie on her retirement.
