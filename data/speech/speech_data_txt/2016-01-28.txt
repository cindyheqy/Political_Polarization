PRAYER The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-fered the following prayer: Loving God, Your providence guides our going out and coming in, and we praise Your great Name. Today, help our lawmakers to exer-cise that cool judgment that is worth far more than a thousand hasty words. Remind them that soft answers turn away anger and that humility precedes honor. As they work to do what is best for our Nation and world, use their lips to provide more light than heat, as their words build up instead of tearing down. May the words of their mouths and the meditations of their hearts glo-rify You. And, Lord, bless the faithful mem-bers of our fall page class as they pre-pare to leave us. We pray in Your mighty Name. Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The Presiding Officer led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f

ENERGY POLICY MODERNIZATION BILL Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, the last time a broad energy bill was signed into law was back in 2007. It may as well have been a lifetime ago as far as America’s energy situation is concerned. While we were once living in an era of energy scarcity, we are now living in an era of higher energy production and lower technology costs. It is change that represents many op-portunities but also challenges—aging infrastructure, bureaucratic hurdles, outdated policies, and needless redtape. These are the kinds of challenges we will need to address if we want to sup-port America’s rise as one of the world’s preeminent energy superpowers and if we want to support the accom-panying potential for jobs, for growth, and for increased energy independence. That is why the Senate is considering the Energy Policy Modernization Act. It is broad, bipartisan legislation that will modernize our energy policies to keep pace with a changing world. It will help Americans produce more en-ergy. It will help Americans pay less for energy. It will help Americans save energy. This bipartisan bill builds on techno-logical progress in order to strengthen and sustain America’s energy advances while protecting our environment at the same time, all without raising taxes or adding to the deficit. It is the latest reminder of what is possible with cooperation in this Senate. A huge majority of the Senate energy committee supported the bill when it came to a vote. The top Republican on the committee supported it and the top Democrat on the committee supported it. They are the managers of this bill today. They have worked with Mem-bers of both parties and have lined up amendments already. They are work-ing with Members of both parties to schedule even more. If you have an amendment you would like considered, please work with them. Let’s get this process moving. Let’s get this bill passed so we can support more jobs, more growth, and more energy inde-pendence for our country. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO MIKE BRUMAS Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, be-fore I leave the floor, let me say this as well. The chair of the energy com-mittee knows how to write good legis-lation. We have proof of that before us today. But here is something else: The chair of the energy committee also knows how to pick good staff. Take Mike Brumas as one example. He served as her communications director. He served as communications director for the junior Senator from Alabama, too, and as chief of staff for the State’s senior Senator. Mike also spent time covering Washington back when he was a reporter. Mike Brumas obviously had a lot of experience under his belt by the time he came to work for me. Mike was an important part of my team, he worked hard, and he earned positions of trust among respected Members of our con-ference and among the Washington press corps. Mike was there both in the minority and in the majority as we made our way through many chal-lenges, but he never let his good humor or his zest for life get lost along the way.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES298 January 28, 2016 
People will tell you that Mike loves history and political history in par-ticular. It is a shared passion that kept me challenged and often entertained. People will tell you a few other things about Mike too. He is always smiling. He is always laughing. He always has a story to tell and a recipe to share. This aspiring chef and endeavoring fly fish-erman is happiest when he is with his family—his delightful wife Ann and his sons Alex and Will—and Mike is at his best when he is outdoors camping or biking or just simply enjoying life be-yond these walls. When Mike told me it was his time to retire from the Senate, I was sad to see him go, but at the same time I was glad to see him able to spend more time around the people and things that make Mike, Mike. Ronald Michael Brumas came to my office as a colleague and leaves as a friend. I thank him for his many years of dedicated service to me and to this body, and I send him best wishes for a retirement that promises to be any-thing but boring.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The Democratic leader is recog-nized. 
f 
ENERGY LEGISLATION Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have joined with the Republican leader over the last couple of days saying good things about the bill that is on the floor. But today my friend the Repub-lican leader stated that nothing has happened with energy in this country since 2007. That simply is not right. It is not true. We have done a lot of stuff in the Senate under President Obama to do good things about energy. For example, the first major bill under President Obama was the so- called American Recovery Act, the stimulus bill. In that bill there was a lot of stuff to change the energy deliv-ery system in this country to allow the creation of new power lines which were so badly needed all over America. For those of us who represent Ne-vada, we have a power line that now goes from northern Nevada to southern Nevada, and it would never have hap-pened but for that legislation we passed. And there was an announce-ment made 2 weeks ago that that line is now going to be taken even farther to make it easier to transport power to California—renewable energy power. I spoke to the owner of that line, who owns half of it with NV Energy, and soon they will be taking it clear to the Northwest. Of course, in the stimulus bill, it was the first time there has been major leg-islation allowed for tax credits, tax in-centives for doing renewable energy. And the bill we just passed, the omni-bus bill, the tax extenders—there is tremendous stuff in that bill for renew-able energy and other electricity ini-tiatives. So I like this bill that is on the floor. It is a good bill. But it simply is not valid to say that nothing has happened since 2007 because that is a gross un-derstatement. I really hope we can pass the bill that is on the floor. The vast majority of this bill contains the Shaheen-Portman legislation that we tried valiantly to get done in the past. It was blocked by Republican filibusters. Sadly, the co-sponsor of the bill twice voted against his own bill. The Senator from Ohio voted against his own legislation. I hope that doesn’t happen again. f 
NOMINATIONS Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Presi-dent of the United States deserves the right to choose a team to carry out the work that is being done here, and the leader of that work to be done here is the President. It was the same way with President Bush, President Reagan, and President Clinton. They deserved a team—a team they chose— to help effectuate policies they saw as necessary for this country. The Presi-dent of the United States deserves the right to choose a team to carry out his vision here at home and around the world—his vision. I am not alone in that belief. My friend, the senior Sen-ator from Arizona, Mr. M
CCAIN, said: ‘‘The President, in my view, has a clear right to put into place the team he be-lieves will serve him best.’’ Sadly, since President Obama was elected, Republicans have stopped at nothing to undermine the President’s team—seeking to prevent progress by denying him the personnel he wants to carry out his agenda. Despite record obstruction, President Obama has achieved remarkable progress. I talked about some of that just a minute ago. Imagine what President Obama could have accomplished if Republicans took their constitutional duties seriously. Regrettably, during the Obama Presi-dency, Republicans have done every-thing within their power to block, ob-struct, stonewall, hinder qualified pub-lic servants from serving. In the first year of Republican control, the Senate confirmed the fewest nominations of any first session in memory. This bla-tant strategy of obstruction is shame-ful and dangerous to our economy and the national security of our country. Headlines around the world remind us each day of the turmoil that exists in the global financial market and ter-rorism that threatens the world. Today we learned of multiple bombings yes-terday and last night in Nigeria—lots of people killed. We can only wait and see where else that turmoil will arise. Most Americans agree that we need a full complement of appointees to ad-dress the challenges we face. Repub-licans are preventing our government from doing its job at home and around the world. According to the Congressional Re-search Service, the Senate banking committee has reported out at least one nomination every year for the past 50 years, but not last year—last year, not a single nominee. Currently, nomi-nees to the Federal Reserve Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and other important financial assign-ments are stalled in the banking com-mittee. The committee has been oper-ating under Republican leadership for the past 13 months, and they have yet to report a single nomination out of that committee. That is the definition of historic obstruction. If there is any nominee who deserves to be confirmed immediately, it is a man by the name of Adam Szubin, whom the President nominated to com-bat terrorism financing—think about that—terrorism financing. He is des-perately needed at the Treasury De-partment. Jack Lew has called me on many occasions talking about how this man needs to fill this assignment. He has expressed to me the importance of his job in trying to slow ISIS and their financial network and other terrorism activities around the country. As Under Secretary for Terrorism and Fi-nancial Crimes, Szubin would lead a team that disrupts terrorist financing networks, cutting off money for terror-ists so they can’t finance their evil deeds. He has served as a career civil servant under both Republican and Democratic Presidents. Despite the importance of his work, Republicans are preventing a vote in the banking committee and thus pre-venting Adam Szubin from having a vote here on the Senate floor. He is currently acting—he is certainly act-ing in a role that is not permanent, which is why they call him an acting member of the Treasury Department. He lacks the stature that his counter-parts have around the world. So he is not able to do all that should be done to disrupt terrorist financial networks throughout the world. In a September hearing on his nomi-nation, the chairman of the banking committee, the senior Senator from Alabama said: ‘‘Mr. Szubin is emi-nently qualified for this [position].’’ Eminently qualified, not reported out of the banking committee, no vote here on the Senate floor—why are we hold-ing up this critical nomination? We all know why. Powerful rightwing groups have announced that they are scoring votes on Presidential nominations. In fact, Heritage Action, which is a front group for the tea party and the Koch brothers, said the Senate should only confirm nominees they deem worth-while—they deem, not Senators but this rightwing cabal. This comes at the expense of the American people and our national security. If the Republican leadership follows this weird plan, scores of Ambassadors charged with representing our interests around the world could be prevented from service. They have been prevented from service. We have several credible nominees currently awaiting floor votes. Ms.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S299 January 28, 2016 
Azita Raji, who has been nominated to represent America in Sweden, is an ac-complished businesswoman who has lived and worked in Europe, Latin America, and Asia. There has been more than 300 Swedish citizens who have left Sweden to fight with ISIS in either Syria or Iraq, making this na-tion the second largest country of ori-gin per capita for foreign fighters com-ing from Europe to the Middle East. We need to get this done. It is not right for America to not be able to deal, on a daily basis, with the authority to help Sweden with their issues. The Swedish Government is on heightened alert for an attack. Yet we don’t have a Senate- confirmed ambassador to represent us in Stockholm. She was first nominated to be Ambassador in October 2014. We are now in 2016. We don’t have an am-bassador to Sweden. We don’t have an ambassador to Nor-way, and it has been that way for more than 2 years. President Obama nomi-nated a person by the name of Samuel Heins, an accomplished lawyer and hu-manitarian from Minnesota. His nomi-nation is not controversial. It is only controversial, I guess, to the Koch brothers, the tea party, and Heritage Action. He should be confirmed with-out delay, but it has been 2 years. Other State Department nominations have been blocked for partisan reasons by the junior Senator from Texas. Tom Shannon has been nominated to be Under Secretary of State. We don’t have an ambassador to Mexico. Tom Shannon has been nominated to the fourth highest ranking position in the State Department. He would like to be serving. He would serve as the day-to- day manager of overall regional and bi-lateral policy issues and oversee State Department bureaus around the world. He is a career Foreign Service officer, having served under Presidents of both parties. If he is confirmed, he would be the highest ranking career diplomat in the State Department. John Kerry called me saying: How can I continue this job I have? I don’t have people to do the work. He doesn’t even have a lawyer. The State Depart-ment doesn’t have a lawyer. We have tried to confirm Brian Egan starting back in September 2014, but he has been held up for months and months. Do you know what this is about? Clinton’s emails—Secretary Clinton’s emails. If the senior Senator from Iowa is interested in getting answers to his countless letters to the State Depart-ment, wouldn’t a Senate-confirmed legal advisor be of some help? Eric Fanning, the President’s nomi-nee to be the next Secretary of the Army, is being blocked by the senior Senator from Kansas, even though the senior Senator from Kansas, Mr. R
OB-
ERTS , said: ‘‘I think [Fanning’s] a pret-ty good nominee.’’ In spite of that, there is no vote on his nomination. The Army needs Mr. Fanning’s leadership and responsibility for over a $200 bil-lion budget for more than 1 million servicemembers. Right now they are making due at the Pentagon, but we should have a Secretary of the Army. Unless Republicans change course, these important vacancies will go un-filled for the rest of the Obama admin-istration, and our diplomacy and rela-tionships around the world will con-tinue to suffer because of what is going on here. I do not understand what my Republican colleagues are doing. If Re-publicans had their way, they would stop confirming officials at just about every key agency. According to the Congressional Re-search Service, the Senate has con-firmed an average of 351 nominations during the first session of the Congress. Last year the Senate didn’t even get to half of what it normally does. The Re-publicans should get to work and schedule votes on the President’s nomi-nees. Valid concerns about the qualifica-tions of these nominees should be brought forth. We haven’t heard any, but denying a vote for partisan gain does nothing to strengthen America at home or around the world. The Amer-ican people deserve better. This Senator says America is less safe because of what is going on with the Republicans in the Senate. We are not as secure as we should be. We have vacancies for Ambassadors all over the world that are not being filled. People within the State Department, the Treasury Department whose job is to deal with terrorism are being blocked. For the first time in 50 years we don’t have anyone reported out of the bank-ing committee. America is less safe be-cause of what Republicans are doing to our country. I yield the floor, Mr. President. f

Under the previous order, the time until 12 noon will be equally divided between the managers or their designees. The Senator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, good morning. This morning we are on day 2 of the Energy Policy Moderniza-tion Act. Yesterday, we took up this broad, bipartisan energy bill, the first of its kind in more than 8 years. Tak-ing this up was a good moment for the Senate. It was an important step. It is the beginning of a series of steps that we will take to modernizing our Na-tion’s energy as well as our mineral policies. I am hopeful we are going to have a good day of debate today. As we begin this morning, I would like to summarize very briefly where we are in this process and what Mem-bers might expect over the course of the day. As of this morning, we have a total of 89 amendments that have now been filed to the underlying bill. We are already starting to process those amendments. We recognize that some will go by voice vote, some will of course need rollcall votes, and others simply will not be voted at all. Right now we do have six amend-ments pending before the body. We have amendment No. 2963 that I have offered, which improves a provision in the underlying bill related to reli-ability impact statements. We have amendment No. 2968 from Senator S
HA-
HEEN to clarify a definition for the term ‘‘smart manufacturing’’ that is contained within the underlying bill. We have an amendment from Senator M
ARKEY , amendment No. 2982, to re-quire the Government Accountability Office to study the economic aspects of crude oil exports annually for 3 years. We have an amendment from Senator B
ARRASSO , amendment No. 3017, to es-tablish a prize for technologies that can separate carbon dioxide molecules from dilute sources such as ambient air. At noon we are scheduled to proceed to a rollcall vote on amendment No. 3021 to promote research into nuclear energy. There is a strong list of Mem-bers who are supporting this amend-ment: Senators C
RAPO and R ISCH from Idaho, along with Senator W

New Jersey, Senator H ATCH of Utah, and Senators K
IRKand D URBIN from Il-linois. There is a good bipartisan mix of Senators from around the country coming together to promote nuclear re-search with this amendment. At 1:45 p.m. we will proceed to amendment No. 2965. This has been of-fered by Senator S
CHATZ , and it will in-crease the authorized funding levels for ARPA–E in the underlying Energy bill. Senator C
ANTWELL and I are both working with our staffs to reach agree-ment on any additional amendments that can be brought up for votes today. We will try to keep Members apprised as to what they can expect. I think both of us are hopeful that we will see more votes added to the list I have just described. We may have one as early as 11:30 this morning. That has not been worked out yet, but there is an option of course for more amendments in the afternoon, if Members are willing to stick with us on this. As I mentioned yesterday in terms of some housekeeping details, and it is worth repeating today, I would urge Members not to wait to file amend-ments. Get your amendments in so we can be looking at them and assessing where they might fit, in terms of how we handle and process them. I think the earlier you are able to file these amendments the greater the likelihood that you will see a vote on them. Again, as I mentioned yesterday, any amendments that cost money, any amendment that is going to score, you are going to need to find a viable offset in order for us to consider it. Further, if it is a measure that would result in a blue slip because it involves a tax provision or a tax amendment, know that is something we cannot consider. Before I make some comments about some individuals, I want to make a few more brief remarks about the bill itself, this broad and bipartisan Energy Policy Modernization Act. I mentioned yesterday that we have a total of five titles within the bill, and we did not just construct them for organizational purposes. They represent some impor-tant themes in our policies within these areas. The first title is ‘‘Efficiency.’’ When you think about the importance of effi-ciency in the energy sector, it is a crit-ical component. We should all always be looking for ways to be saving en-ergy. It is just smart. It is smart from a cost perspective. It is smart from being a good steward perspective. It is just smart all the way around. It helps our businesses and our families save money. It makes our resources last longer. It is good for our environment. Efficiency is good overall. ‘‘Infrastructure’’ is our second title. Typically, when we think about infra-structure, we think about the roads and bridges, but our energy infrastruc-ture is integral to the daily operation of commerce that goes on around us when we are talking about energy in-frastructure. It may be the big infra-structure such as the Hoover Dam. It is also the electric wires, pipelines, and it is the whole infrastructure package. We have a responsibility to keep our infrastructure in good shape so that we can reliably and safely transport en-ergy from the place where it is pro-duced to the place where it is needed. I joke sometimes, saying it is frus-trating because there is not more edu-cation or understanding about our en-ergy and our energy resources and how they work as much as we would like. I have joked that some ascribe to this ‘‘immaculate conception’’ theory of en-ergy—it just happens. The lights come on, the temperature is what we would like it to be, and we do not care how or why it came to us or the fact that we might not have that energy resource right here in our neighborhood. It is just here, and as long as we are not in-convenienced because it is not too ex-pensive and it is reliable, we are good with it. We do not think about how it gets to us and the necessity of reliable, safe infrastructure to take that from the source to the customer. The fourth title is accountability. Again, like efficiency, it just makes good sense to ensure that, as we are building out our energy policies, there is a level of accountability that comes with it—that our Federal agencies work efficiently and effectively as good stewards of taxpayer dollars. I think we have plenty of room for improve-ment when it comes to accountability right now. I mentioned yesterday that in addi-tion to a pretty robust accountability title, we remove some deadwood, some reports and requirements that have built up over the years that get incor-porated into our United States Code, and then they just sit there. As they sit there, it is not just that they are benign. The agencies still go ahead, and they have the reports that we here in Congress have required of them. That costs money. Nobody reads them. We have taken care of that with-in the accountability title. Then the fifth title is the title that relates to conservation aspects as it re-lates to the Land and Water Conserva-tion Fund, an issue that I know the Presiding Officer is very interested in and would like making sure there are reforms there. We want to work to make sure that the reforms are good and sound, also making sure that our national parks have the focus on main-tenance that they need. We have a re-sponsibility to ensure that we are tak-ing care of our parks and public lands, to not let the addition of more parks come at the cost of not taking care of what we already have. Rather than just kind of doing the 30,000-foot level on each of these var-ious titles, I want to highlight today a little bit about the third title of this bill, the title that deals with energy supply. Over the past few years, we have seen several things. We have seen a lot of good things that happen when we are producing our own energy here in this country and the benefits that accrue to us when our energy is abundant. It is not just access to energy, but it is also what allows us in terms of energy eco-nomic security, something that leads to the creation of good jobs. As the economy grows here, our security in-creases. Really, we become far more competitive. So, again, when I talk about energy, strong energy policies, and an energy security focus, keep in mind these things reinforce one another. You have energy security leading to economic security, leading to national security. It moves all the way around. That, again, allows us to be more competi-tive over all other nations. Our bill would help keep our Nation’s oil and natural gas production going strong. We have included a pilot pro-gram from Senator H
OEVEN for oil and gas permitting. We would expedite the process for liquefied natural gas ex-ports, which could help us raise our do-mestic production levels. I want to say also that we did not just focus on oil and gas in this bill because we recog-nize drawing our energy from a variety of sources creates reliability and sta-bility. We all know that Alaska is an oil-producing State. We focus a lot in our State on oil and being able to ac-cess it responsibly. We also know that when you are reliant on one source, there is a vulnerability. So when we talk about an ‘‘all of the above’’ ap-proach to energy production, we mean it. This kind of approach just makes sense. It makes sense because it lessens your vulnerability. It increases not only your energy security, but your economic security and your national security as well. So focusing on all aspects of our en-ergy sources is key to what we do with-in this bill. We took some good steps to produce more hydropower in this coun-try by helping to reduce the regulatory barriers and extending the licensing pe-riod for hydropower projects. This is important to us as a nation, especially when we think about resources that al-ready exist through hydropower and the additional capacity that we could potentially gain from these already exiting hydropower resources. This is significant. Geothermal is another area where we have an emissions-free source of base-load energy. Again, so much of what we talk about with renewables and part of the big problem that we face is that some renewables are intermittent. The wind does not always blow and the sun is not always out, so you have to have a reliable baseload. Our reliable base-load for a century has been coal. We have a reliable baseload with nu-clear. When others think about those other areas where we have reliable baseloads, they also ought to think about the potential of geothermal. Our bill includes a number of provisions to help us expand the use and reduce the cost of this important renewable re-source. We are doing some exciting

things up in Alaska, as we are identi-fying sources to access geothermal en-ergy resources. In another area, in Alaska and in some of the other coastal States, whether it is Maine or down in Oregon, we are seeing some good progress, some interesting progress when it comes to marine hydrokinetic energy, which has the potential to draw the power from the movement of the oceans and river currents. I just mentioned reliable baseload. You need to have something that you can rely on. The Presiding Officer comes from the interior part of the country. I come from a State that has almost 34,000 miles of coastline. One of the things that we know in Alaska is how the tides come and go. We can print up tide books because there is reliability as to when the tide is in and when the tide is out. So think about the potential for energy resources from our oceans, from our river currents. What we do within the bill is help advance marine hydrokinetic energy. We are attempt-ing to help move it out of its infancy and focus the DOE on some pretty crit-ical research areas. We also have a great subtitle on min-erals. Oftentimes we forget about the strategic importance of critical min-erals. Every one of us is walking around nowadays with a smartphone. Every one of us, therefore, is reliant on some form of critical mineral. For those who want to advance the energy future in the direction of renewables, well, in order for you to have a wind turbine, you are going to need some of these critical minerals from the Earth to allow us to really build out tech-nologies. Minerals are really the foundation of our modern society. We need them for everything, as I said, from our smartphones to our military assets. Yet, despite this importance, we have really failed as policymakers to focus on mineral security. We have not been thinking about it enough. We have been talking a lot about this: Oh, we do not want to be reliant on oil. We do not want to be reliant on OPEC, and we work to address that. In the meantime, we have taken our eye off the ball when it comes to mineral security. We now import 100 percent of 19 separate mineral commodities and more than 50 percent of some 24 additional commod-ities. This is happening despite the growing importance of those minerals in our everyday lives and despite what we have here in this country, which is a world-class mineral base. When we talk about energy security and making sure that we are able to produce more here to reduce our vulnerability, en-ergy security also needs to include that mineral security. We also have provisions to promote our domestic supply of helium. A lot of people do not think about helium in the energy space. We promote nuclear power, particularly our advanced nu-clear power, to help foster a strong en-ergy workforce. So when we talk about the direction that this energy bill goes, I mentioned yesterday that innovation is the key to so much of what we are trying to push out as we modernize our energy policies. As important as innovation is, supply is a case where more really is better. As a result of this good title that we have contained in the Energy Policy Modernization Act, I think our energy and our mineral supplies will increase in the years ahead to the benefit of America. 
TRIBUTE TO MIKE BRUMAS  
Mr. President, I know my colleague from Hawaii is here on the floor, but I want to take just a few minutes to ac-knowledge something the leader men-tioned regarding an individual in his office, someone that has served him well, Mike Brumas. Mike has been working for Leader M
CCONNELL now for a number of years and has done a great job in the communications department. I too am very privileged to have had him leading my communications de-partment between 2008 and 2010. Mike is one of those men whom you can call a southern gentleman. He has a little bit of a twang that did not quite fit with the Alaska reporters, but it did not matter because he was so knowl-edgeable on all issues—all issues that we dealt with, including some of the most parochial and local of Alaskan issues. Mike Brumas embraced his job with an enthusiasm and a professionalism that was genuinely and sincerely ap-preciated. I know that he and his wife Ann are probably going to be spending a lot more time out on their bicycles and enjoying their time together. We happen to share timing; their two sons are just about the same age as the two sons that Vern and I have been raising. So we kind of shared parenting experi-ences as our sons grew into men. It has just been a delight to spend the time getting to know Michael Brumas and seeing him as an excep-tional professional here serving the Senate, both for me and for Leader M
CCONNELL . So I wish him well and great adventures in his retirement. 
TRIBUTE TO KAREN BILLUPS  
Mr. President, as I am speaking about retirement, I must mention a woman who is not with us as we are de-bating and navigating this Energy Pol-icy Modernization Act. That woman is a friend and an incredible professional who headed up the Energy and Natural Resources Committee for me for the majority of the past several years. After 25 years in the Senate, Karen Billups has said: I am moving on to more excitement, moving on to spend that time with a young son that she has. Karen is an individual with an in-credible reputation, incredible integ-rity, and a graciousness that will be long remembered on this floor and around this body. She first joined the Energy and Natural Resources Com-mittee back in 1995. Before that, she had served with distinction at the De-partment of Energy during the first Bush administration. She was in pri-vate law practice, and she was also on the staff of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. She has had a breadth of experience on the private side, within the Executive branch, in the House and then, of course, in the Senate. After joining the committee again in 1995, Karen served as counsel and then she came on as senior coun-sel. I think it is worth noting that Karen has worked through—or perhaps lived through—two Murkowskis because when my father was the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Karen Billups worked for him. And when I came to the Senate and had Karen at the helm working as counsel, I have to tell you it was ex-traordinarily reassuring. In those early years, she focused on a whole host of different issues that face our Nation, from energy to civilian and defense nu-clear waste. She was also the trouble-shooter. She mentored our younger committee staff and ensured that Members and senior staff were all in alignment and that the direction was clear. Again, this was with a focus that was firm but yet very appreciative of the different dimensions she had to deal with. She is a woman who was able to navigate with a level of finesse. She is a woman who is able to navigate with finesse. After service in the private sector, Karen came back as deputy chief coun-sel in 2003, and I was very grateful when she accepted a promotion to be my chief counsel in 2009. Then in 2013 she agreed to step up to serve as my staff director and had been in that ca-pacity until we concluded the end of 2015. I think it is so important to acknowl-edge what Karen not only lent to the committee, to me, to my office, but also to the many on the floor who worked with her on energy issues. Karen set a standard for excellence and achievement, and she worked tire-lessly—truly tirelessly—to improve our policies to upgrade and to improve our Nation’s energy resource, lands, and forestry policies. You might say she was a policy wonk, but you didn’t get that impression from her because she did it with a genuineness and a passion that clearly showed. Karen steered a wide range of legisla-tion into law, everything from bound-ary adjustments, to helping the econo-mies of small western towns, to the landmark Energy Policy Act of 2005. Then as we wrapped up last year, she was able to pull together the end-of- year omnibus with the energy pieces that we had attached to that, the Transportation bill that had an energy title that had come over from the House side, and tax extenders. She worked in a way that was quiet and amenable but, again, firm and effec-tive. In many ways her work continues today through this bipartisan Energy bill and the other legislation she guid-ed to introduction. What we are seeing

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES302 January 28, 2016 
today has been done with the assist-ance—the mastermind, if you will—of Karen Billups. As the ranking member and now chairman of the committee, I depended daily on Karen’s thoughtful leadership, her patient counsel, and her wise judg-ment. I mean it when I say she was not only a trusted advisor but deeply skilled and motivated by the best tra-ditions of service to the Senate and to the Nation on every issue that came before the committee. She had an un-derstanding of the operations of this body. I know those who work the floor ap-preciated Karen’s evenhanded skills. She helped point the way with a stra-tegic vision for policy and oversight. I think she is probably one of the best lawyers I have ever met. Again, she was not just a leader for the staff, she was a mentor for them. She was an ad-vocate for them. That is very telling of true leadership. Karen’s service to the Senate was marked not by length but by distinc-tion and by grace. She has truly earned the tremendous respect that she enjoys here and all throughout our Nation’s Capital. Her legacy speaks for itself—a stronger energy policy that benefits every American and an Energy and Natural Resources Committee that continues to work together to tackle our toughest challenges. For all of these reasons and so many more, Karen truly stands out in my mind not only as a leader but as a real friend. As she embarks on this very well-deserved retirement, she knows that I wish her, her family, her hus-band Ray, and her great son Davis all the best as she goes off to her new en-deavor. I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge the good work of a great lady who has helped shepherd this bill we have before us. Mr. President, I notice that we have a couple of Members on the floor who I am assuming would like to speak to the Energy bill before us. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Hawaii. Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I wish to start by congratulating the chair of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the senior Senator from Alaska, for her leadership on this bill and so many other issues. She is a tes-tament to how the Senate should oper-ate. She is a testament to the tradition of bipartisanship that characterizes this body when it is behaving properly. I thank her and congratulate her for her leadership on this issue and many others. I also thank the ranking member, Senator C
ANTWELL from Washington State, for her leadership on this and many other issues. They have formed a good and productive partnership. Our energy system is undergoing a fundamental transformation. In the last 8 years, wind power capacity has grown by more than 400 percent, and solar capacity has grown by more than 2,500 percent. In 2015, wind and solar comprised 61 percent of new generation capacity. Last year in the United States, by far the majority of new gen-eration was clean energy. So what has happened is that the clean energy revo-lution is no longer aspirational. It is no longer something people put in a bullet point in their campaign brochure or as a talking point in a debate. It is actu-ally happening. It is actually real, and it is across the country. We drive more hybrids and electric vehicles and in-creasingly use efficient appliances and manufacturing equipment. We have made incredible progress in driving down the costs of clean energy, but we cannot let this progress stall out. We need to modernize our infrastructure in order to integrate greater amounts of renewable energy and save money for consumers through energy efficiency. This bill is a positive step in transitioning our energy system from the 19th and 20th centuries into the 21st. There are a number of provisions that are worth highlighting. First, the bill proposes $500 million in research and development for grid- scale storage. This will allow us to use even more electricity from renewable sources. There is no doubt we are going to continue to need baseload power, but the assumptions about the percent-age of baseload power that we need in order to have good power quality across our grids are changing. For in-stance, in the State of Hawaii the basic assumption was that you couldn’t have more than about 15 percent of penetra-tion of intermittent renewable energy. Well, we now have parts of our grid that are 35 percent, 45 percent, renew-able energy. So the old assumptions are being thrown out the window, but no doubt we are going to continue to need to have Federal research and pri-vate sector research into this question of how much intermittent renewable energy a grid can accommodate with-out sacrificing power quality. This $500 million investment is going to be a big help toward that. This bill will also continue invest-ments in grid modernization that will help to smooth the integration of dis-tributed renewable generation. This will make a real difference in improv-ing reliability while reducing individ-uals’ reliance on fossil fuels. This bill would also permanently re-authorize the Land and Water Con-servation Fund. This is not just the most successful conservation program in our Nation’s history—and that would be a good enough reason to per-manently reauthorize it—it is also an economic driver, returning $4 in eco-nomic value for every $1 invested. AMENDMENT NO . 2965 
Last, but certainly not least, this bill increases funding for energy research and development at the Advanced Re-search Projects Agency-Energy, which is desperately needed because only the Federal Government can undertake the kind of high-risk, high-reward research that will allow us to maintain our eco-nomic dominance in this space. But I think we must do more on en-ergy innovation, so I have offered an amendment to increase the authoriza-tion for ARPA-E above and beyond what is in this bill. Specifically, the amendment sets forth authorization levels as follows: $325 million for fiscal years 2016 to 2018 and $375 million per year for fiscal years 2019 through 2020. This is a relatively modest increase of just $113 million over 4 years. It is important to remember that ARPA-E was the brainchild of a National Acad-emies report which recommended to Congress that they establish an ARPA- E within the U.S. Department of En-ergy, modeled after a very successful program in the Department of Defense called DARPA. The agency was cred-ited with such innovations as GPS, the stealth fighter, and computer net-working. In 2007, Congress passed and Presi-dent George W. Bush signed into law the America COMPETES Act, which of-ficially authorized the creation ARPA- E. In 2009, Congress appropriated and President Obama allocated $400 million to the new agency, which funded ARPA-E’s first projects. In the years since, despite bipartisan support, ARPA-E has not received more than the $280 million in funding. Yet this agency has had incredible suc-cess with even this modest amount of funding. For example, ARPA-E award-ees have developed a 1-megawatt sil-icon carbide transistor the size of a fin-gernail and engineered microbes that use hydrogen and carbon dioxide to make liquid transportation fuel. They invest in pioneering research that is groundbreaking, transformative, and amazing. Think about what they could do with just a little more money. Innovation in advanced energy tech-nologies can be a significant part of the solution to any number of challenges: increasing the reliability of our grid, lowering our electricity rates, hard-ening our energy infrastructure against cyber attacks, and many oth-ers. ARPA-E is helping to fund projects at the cutting edge of all of these chal-lenges—and more. I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to continue to support ARPA-E and to vote for this amend-ment and to support the underlying bill, which is an important step to pav-ing the way to a revolution in the way in which we produce and consume en-ergy in the United States. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent that all time during the quorum calls be equally charged to each side. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I sug-gest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S303 January 28, 2016 
Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise to praise the ranking member and the chairman of the committee on the great job they have done on this legis-lation. I have worked for years with Senator M
URKOWSKI . She is a real trooper and has done a great job for our country and for her State of Alas-ka. Senator C
ANTWELL of Washington is the same. I am pleased to work with them on this particular legislation, which I support today. I am rising to talk for a minute about an amendment Senator B
ENNET  of Colorado and I will be offering to the bill at the appropriate time called the SAVE Act. The SAVE Act is a way to encourage people to finance and include in the purchase of a new home the right types of energy efficiency additions to that home, which will lower the cost of en-ergy to the home, improve the rate of consumption of energy in the home, and make it easier for people to afford energy-saving R-factors for insulation, Thermopane for doors and windows, and other treatments they need to re-duce costs. I spent 33 years in residential real es-tate. I don’t know much about any-thing, but I know a lot about people buying houses and about housing laws and about financing, and I know this: For the entry-level borrower—and this addresses only FHA loans—the most important thing to have the right type of energy efficiency is to be able to af-ford it, and the best way to be able to afford it is to be able to finance it. If you don’t allow the incorporation of the value of the additional cost of the additional R-factor for insulation or Thermopane factor for windows and doors, then people don’t end up choos-ing energy efficiency; they choose less efficient houses which last for 30 or 40 years and burn more energy in their lifetime than they would have if we had not had a way to incentivize people to incorporate energy efficiency into the purchase of their new home. So my story is very simple. We are here today to encourage energy effi-ciency, encourage savings on energy, and encourage people to focus on en-ergy, to be a more energy-independent country. The best way to do that is to make sure we take the mechanisms of purchase—being the FHA loan in this case—and incorporate and consider for financial value purposes, for the ap-praisal and for the loan-to-value ratio and for qualification purposes, the sav-ings of the R-factor improvements, Thermopane improvements, and other energy efficiency improvements put in. At the appropriate time—sometime today—I will ask the chairman to rec-ognize me to set aside the pending amendment and make this amendment pending, but until that time, I wanted to come to the floor to let Members know we have an outstanding piece of legislation which scores at zero in terms of costs, applies only to FHA loans, encourages energy efficiency, and allows people to afford to build it into the financing of the purchase of a house. It is a win-win-win. I am proud to work with Senator BENNET on this legislation. I appreciate being recognized by the Chair. Mr. President, I yield to the minority whip. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The as-sistant Democratic whip. 
FOR-PROFIT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES  
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to two separate issues. First, I wish to speak to the issue of for-profit colleges and universities. Yesterday another for-profit college was accused by a Federal agency of misleading and deceiving students. The Federal Trade Commission announced it filed suit against DeVry University for advertisements that deceived con-sumers about the likelihood that stu-dents would find jobs and earn money after they graduated from DeVry. DeVry’s commercials and advertise-ments date back to at least 2008—about 9 years that they have been claiming that ‘‘since 1975, 90% of DeVry grad-uates system-wide in the active job market held positions in their fields of study within 6 months of graduation.’’ Starting in 2013, they also claimed that DeVry graduates ‘‘had 15 percent high-er incomes one year after graduation on average than graduates of all other colleges and universities.’’ The Department of Education started investigating these claims in August of last year. After asking DeVry for proof of their statements in these ads, the Department announced yesterday that the company was ‘‘unable to substan-tiate the truthfulness of those rep-resentations, as is required by federal law.’’ As such, the Department of Edu-cation ordered DeVry to stop making these false claims and required DeVry’s future claims related to employability and income to be verified by an inde-pendent monitor. At the same time, it appears the Department will allow DeVry to continue to participate in Federal title IV programs—receiving taxpayer dollars and enrolling new stu-dents. How much Federal funding does DeVry receive? In 2013 and 2014, DeVry Education Group, brought in more than $1 billion in taxpayer funding through title IV. The company’s president, Daniel Hamburger, received $5.7 million in total compensation in 2014—$5.7 mil-lion. If we compare the salary this president took from DeVry Univer-sity—which receives the lion’s share of all of its funds from the Federal Gov-ernment—we will find he is com-pensated dramatically more than col-lege presidents across the United States. The president of the University of Illinois—a major flagship institution and research university—makes a base salary in the neighborhood of $600,000. By comparison, DeVry’s president, Daniel Hamburger, received $5.7 mil-lion in total compensation thanks to the taxpayers and students. Meanwhile, according to a recent study by Brookings, DeVry students cumulatively owe more than $8.3 bil-lion in federal student loan debt. It is no wonder considering the average cost of an associate’s degree—a 2-year de-gree—at DeVry is about $40,000. In 2009, DeVry’s 5-year cohort default rate on student loans was 43 percent. That means that of the students who left DeVry in the year 2009, 43 percent—al-most half of them—had defaulted with-in 5 years of leaving DeVry. I have said it before of Corinthian—a for-profit school that went out of business—and I will say it now of DeVry: Students shouldn’t be left holding the bag for the misdeeds of these private, profit- making corporations that are skim-ming so much money from the tax-payers. The Department of Education has found that DeVry’s claims could not be substantiated as required by Federal law. The Federal Trade Commission is also suing DeVry over claims of mis-leading students and consumers. Stu-dents who were harmed should be eligi-ble for expedited Federal student loan relief through defense to repayment. But let me remind those who are fol-lowing this debate: Follow the money. Taxpayers across America pay their taxes. The money goes into the Federal Treasury, and then the money goes— through the Treasury and through Pell grants and student loans—to students and their families, to these private, for-profit colleges and universities. The private, for-profit colleges and univer-sities, such as DeVry, deceive and mis-lead the students about the value of their education and whether they will get a job after they graduate. The stu-dents end up wasting their time and their money because they end up with a huge student debt when it is all over. And what happens? They default on their debt, which means the taxpayers don’t see the money going back to the Treasury, which we hope for, or in some cases the schools—like Corin-thian—fail, and as a result the students are relieved of their debt obligations— as they should be, so the taxpayers again are the ultimate losers. The for-profit colleges and univer-sities of the United States of America are the most heavily subsidized private sector businesses in our country—not a defense contractor or a farm operation; for-profit colleges and universities. The DeVry news follows a particu-larly bad year for this industry. In 2015 more misconduct and schemes were ex-posed when it came to for-profit col-leges and universities than ever before. Enrollment across the industry is de-clining, as students and their parents finally realize that many of these schools are just bad news. State and Federal regulators are shining a light on the illegal tactics of the for-profit college and university industry. Stock prices for these private, for-profit cor-porations are plummeting because in-vestors realize that exploiting these students, misleading these students, and swindling taxpayers is not a sus-tainable business model.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES304 January 28, 2016 
Years of bad behavior are catching up with for-profit colleges and univer-sities, and it shows in how for-profit education companies are closing their schools across the country. Even in my home state of Illinois, we have seen dramatic changes over the last year. It started with the collapse of Corinthian. This company was inflating its job- placement rates to lure in new stu-dents, defrauding the students, their families, and taxpayers, and lying to the accrediting agencies and Federal Government. When Corinthian col-lapsed, more than 70,000 students were left in the lurch, many with more debt than they could possibly repay and a Corinthian education that turned out to be virtually worthless. In Illinois, the campuses Corinthian operated as Everest College in the vil-lages and towns of Bedford Park, Burr Ridge, Melrose Park, Merrionette Park, and Skokie were then sold to ECMC. ECMC was a new creation. This company that created this new not-for- profit, in name at least, college, inci-dentally, is a major debt collector for the U.S. Department of Education and had no previous experience running an educational enterprise. What qualified them to start a college, I don’t know. Unfortunately, ECMC maintained much of the old Corinthian leadership and maintained practices to keep stu-dents from suing them for misconduct. After the Illinois Board of Higher Edu-cation pushed them on some of these issues, ECMC decided to teach-out its newly acquired campuses in Illinois and leave the State, thank goodness. Then there is Westwood. Illinois at-torney general Lisa Madigan—whom I respect very much—sued Westwood College for engaging in deceptive prac-tices. Attorney General Madigan’s suit focused specifically on Westwood’s criminal justice program. In order to lure students into the program, this private, for-profit college, Westwood, convinced the students they could get jobs with the Chicago Police Depart-ment or the Illinois State Police if they would just hang on and get a de-gree from Westwood. What happened when the students graduated and took their degrees and diplomas to employ-ers and applied for a job? The employ-ers laughed at them. They didn’t recog-nize a Westwood degree. In November, Attorney General Mad-igan reached a settlement with Westwood. It agreed to forgive $15 mil-lion in private student loans for Illi-nois students—private loans, not fed-eral loans. Shortly thereafter, Westwood announced it would stop en-rolling students and end operations at its campuses nationwide, including the four it operates in the Chicagoland area. Thank goodness and good rid-dance to Westwood. Also in 2015, Career Education Cor-poration, which is another for-profit college, announced it would close its brands Sanford Brown, Harrington Col-lege of Design, and Le Cordon Bleu, all of which had campuses in Illinois. Thank goodness and good riddance. In Chicago, an associate’s degree in cul-inary art at Le Cordon Bleu would have cost $42,000, and students had a one-in- five chance of defaulting on any loans they took out for that associate’s de-gree. If the students walked a few blocks away to Chicago City Colleges’ Kennedy King Campus, in comparison, they could have received the same de-gree not for $42,000 but for $7,000. And the likelihood of defaulting on student loans at City Colleges is not 1 in 5, as it was at Le Cordon Bleu, it is 1 in 20. Harrington—I have talked about them before. Harrington College of De-sign exploited Hannah Moore, a young woman from Chicago whom I have come to know. She got her degree at Harrington after transferring from a community college. She couldn’t find a job in her field with her Harrington de-gree. It turned out to be worthless. What did it cost her to get the degree, this for-profit college degree that Har-rington heavily marketed? Hannah paid $125,000. She still carries that debt to this day, and it is growing. She can’t pay it off fast enough, and it has ballooned to $150,000. This poor young woman. Her life is compromised be-cause of the exploitation of her ambi-tion to do something important in life. She had to live in her parents’ base-ment. Her dad came out of retirement to try to help his daughter pay off her students loans because, you see, the loans that are taken out to go to any institution of higher education are not like money borrowed for a car or a home; these student loans are not dis-chargeable in bankruptcy. What does that mean? You are going to carry them to the grave. Many student loan debts that are in default are being collected in the most unusual places. Grandmothers who helped their granddaughters by co-signing their loan for college—when the granddaughter defaults, it is the grandmother and in some cases her So-cial Security payments that are with-held to pay off these student loans. These loans will haunt these students, many of them for a lifetime, particu-larly if they have gone to these for- profit schools. Finally, even though it is not in Illi-nois, I want to mention Ashford Uni-versity. On a campus in Clinton, IA, just across the Mississippi River, Ashford has shown itself to be one of the worst actors in the for-profit col-lege industry. A Bloomberg News story told of James Long, who suffered a brain in-jury when he was in service to his country in the Army, driving a humvee in Iraq that was attacked. An Ashford recruiter went after James Long and got him to sign up to use his military education benefits to enroll in classes that this individual, sadly, could not even remember because of the trau-matic brain injury he had suffered. In 2014, Iowa attorney general Tom Miller announced a $7.25 million settle-ment with Ashford University. Miller accused the school of violating Iowa’s Consumer Fraud Act after the Iowa at-torney general received multiple com-plaints filed by current and former Ashford students. This included com-plaints that this for-profit school mis-led students to believe that an online Ashford education degree would allow students to become classroom teachers with no further certification. I remember Ashford because our former colleague, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, held a hearing and talked about how Ashford bought what was a small Catholic college, took on their accreditation, and started peddling the for-profit education that was worth-less. Do you know what the faculty of Ashford University consisted of at that time? One faculty member for every 500 students. Do you know what the people who were running this scam operation were paid? Millions—millions of dollars of taxpayers’ money. The investigation found that Ashford recruiters, in addi-tion, misled prospective students, used high-pressure sales tactics, and failed to disclose information about the cost and likelihood of obtaining a degree. In 2015, Ashford announced it was going to close its Clinton, IA, campus— thank goodness and good riddance. It is for the students who could have been exploited by these companies that I say this: It is time for us to stand up as a Congress and Federal Government and put an end to this insidious scam of students, their families, and the tax-payers. Thousands of students in Illinois and all across the Nation have been lured into attending these for-profit schools with lies or deception. Don’t take this Senator’s word for it. Take a look at the litany of schools that are under in-vestigation by State and local authori-ties for fraud. Many students, such as Hannah, have so much debt that their lives and futures are compromised. Over the last year, I have joined sev-eral of my Senate colleagues to push the Department of Education to pro-vide Federal student loan debt relief to students who have been taken advan-tage of by the for-profit colleges. We have an obligation here. To think that we are shoveling $25 billion into these for-profit schools every single year without asking the hard questions about whether taxpayers’ dollars and student debt is justified by the results. Shame on us—we can do so much bet-ter. The numbers tell the story. Ten percent, or 1 out of 10, of college stu-dents in this country attend for-profit colleges and universities, and 20 per-cent of all the Federal aid to edu-cation, or $25 billion, goes to these for- profit colleges and universities. In spite of it only accounting for 10 per-cent of college students, these for-prof-it colleges and universities account for over 40 percent of student loan de-faults. They charge too much, their di-plomas are worth too little, and these students suffer as a result. What is our obligation here? Is this a ‘‘buyer beware’’ situation when it

comes to the students and their fami-lies or is it a situation where ‘‘Con-gress beware’’ if we aren’t more sen-sitive to the fact that we are propping up an industry that is exploiting these students and taxpayers. With the closure of these campuses in Illinois and several of these companies moving out of the State all together, the educational landscape is a little safer for the thousands of Illinoisans trying to do the right thing—to get an education for themselves and their families. There is a sensible alternative in virtually every city and town in America—community colleges, city colleges. They are affordable, and in most cases the credits are transferrable to major universities and students don’t incur the kind of debt that can compromise their lives for years and years to come. I have spoken on the floor many times about these for-profit colleges and universities. In one respect it is a fairly easy issue and easy topic. They need to be held accountable, as DeVry is being held accountable by the De-partment of Education and the Federal Trade Commission for their mis-conduct. Now the question is this: Will the Congress step up to its responsibility to clean up this situation? Mr. President, the Senate is cur-rently considering a bipartisan energy bill that will help put our country on a pathway to build a 21st century econ-omy. It contains several important provisions to develop domestic clean energy resources, and I look forward to working with my colleagues through the amendment process to strengthen it. I wish to congratulate Senator L
ISA M
URKOWSKI , a Republican from Alaska, and Senator M
ARIA CANTWELL , a Demo-crat from the State of Washington—the chair and ranking member of the En-ergy and Natural Resources Com-mittee—and applaud them for their ef-fort and thank them for bringing this bipartisan measure to the floor. The Energy Policy Modernization Act is a result of the committee’s mul-tiple hearings on over 100 individual bills. If passed, it will be the first major energy bill approved by Congress in 9 years. A lot has changed in 9 years. The United States has dramatically in-creased natural gas and oil production. Renewable energy production has sky-rocketed and the cost of this has de-creased. More Americans are using it. We are also finding new and better ways to address our most pressing en-ergy and climate change challenges. The bill before us takes those new de-velopments into account and updates our policies. The act strengthens en-ergy efficiency measures for Federal buildings and multifamily homes and reauthorizes important programs such as weatherization and energy. In Illi-nois, that means tens of thousands low- income and elderly households will be able to receive critical upgrades that will make their homes more efficient, allowing them to spend less money to keep their homes cool and warm. It will also help maintain Illinois’ leader-ship as the top State for LEED-cer-tified buildings as ranked by the U.S. Green Building Council. The bill encourages the development of new energy resources such as geo-thermal and hydropower and better ways to store carbon dioxide, which will help us address the challenge of climate change. Most importantly, the bill makes a substantial commitment to supporting basic science research and innovation at universities and the Department of Energy’s laboratories. The Energy Policy Modernization Act authorizes 4-percent annual budget in-creases for the DOE Office of Science and the Advanced Research Projects Agency. As cochair of the Senate National Laboratory Caucus, I strongly support these increases at DOE’s Office of Science because I know it will lead to new breakthrough scientific discov-eries that will keep America competi-tive. Since their creation in the 1940s, the national labs have really done some amazing things on energy innovation, scientific discovery, and national secu-rity. In Illinois, both Argonne and Fermi serve as a meeting place for the world’s best researchers. The work con-ducted at their labs leads to advances in alternative-fuel vehicles and im-provements in energy efficiency. Uni-versities from across the country use the labs to conduct research and train others. That is why earlier this year I introduced a bill, the American Innova-tion Act, to provide 5-percent real growth to DOE’s Office of Science. I hope to offer an amendment on the floor. A 4-percent annual increase when it comes to the Office of Science in the Department of Energy, for example, is good, but that is not 4 percent over in-flation. If inflation is running at 2 per-cent, it is merely a 2-percent real in-crease in research. I think we ought to err on the side of investing more into research. I think we should have 5-per-cent real growth in investment in the National Institutes of Health, the Cen-ters for Disease Control and Preven-tion, the Department of Defense med-ical research, and the Veterans Admin-istration medical research. Then when it comes to this side of the ledger, such as innovations, let’s include the Office of Science and many other key agen-cies. I visited the Department of Energy a few months ago, and I had breakfast with Ernest Moniz, who is the Sec-retary. I talked to him about bio-medical research, and he said: There is something I need to share with you. The Office of Science in the Depart-ment of Energy is developing the tech-nology for imaging the brain so we can detect early indications of Alzheimer’s. Currently, unfortunately, the only way to really say that a person is suffering from Alzheimer’s with any objective assurance is through an autopsy. If we can—through imaging devices, while a person is still alive and before they have really started to decline—detect and work on stopping the progress of Alzheimer’s, it would be an amazing achievement. Once every 67 seconds in America someone is diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. I challenged my staff when they told me that, and they were right. Almost every single minute a person is diag-nosed with Alzheimer’s. Last year, in Federal funds, we spent in Medicare and Medicaid $200 billion on Alzheimer’s patients. Imagine what was spent in the private sector, and imagine the kind of sacrifices and the spending that were made by families trying to maintain the care of a family member stricken with Alzheimer’s. So putting a little extra money into biomedical research, or in this case re-search at the Office of Science, is money well invested. If we can slow down the progress of Alzheimer’s and find a way to delay it—even months— it will pay back this investment over and over. God willing, if we find a cure, it will justify every penny we put into this research. I will offer an amendment, and what I am asking is basic. I am asking for authorization for 5-percent real growth that is over inflation. I think that is the least we can do, but I think it will be a significant commitment and sub-stantially more than is currently in the bill. The work at these labs has led to amazing advances, and I think there is more ahead of us. In addition to sup-porting basic science research, the act before us directs the Department of Education to build a research program to develop the next generation of com-puters—1,000 times faster than our cur-rent supercomputers. Is it possible? I believe it is. I am not an expert in this field, but you have to step back and say that it is amazing when they tell us that the cellphones we carry around have more computing power than the early computers that Steve Jobs and others brought to market. Currently, companies around the world use supercomputers to solve problems and answer important ques-tions. Boeing and Cummins have both used DOE supercomputers to design better airplanes and trucks and use less energy so that they burn fuel more efficiently. This has led China, South Korea, and Europe to get into the com-petition. They are in the race, too, for the next generation of supercomputers. I want America to win that race. The bill before us, with its investment and research, can make a difference. The government should invest in these labs and in research to create jobs and com-petitive businesses. This bipartisan en-ergy bill can achieve that and lead this country to a brighter future with greater energy resources that have a lighter impact on the environment and build a stronger economy. Because the energy choices we make now will deter-mine the future of our children and

NORTH KOREA SANCTIONS AND POLICY  
ENHANCEMENT ACT  
Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, we just left the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as the Presiding Officer knows as a member of the Foreign Re-lation Committee, where we passed, with overwhelming bipartisan support, legislation to increase our sanctions against the rogue regime in North Korea. About a year ago I had a conversa-tion with Senator C
ORKER , the chair-man of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, about the need for the leg-islation. We both agreed that North Korea poses a serious and growing threat to its neighbors, to the U.S. homeland, and to global security. We agreed we could not continue to ignore the forgotten maniac—the forgotten maniac who is Kim Jong Un. This past August I had an oppor-tunity to visit with South Korea per-sonally to meet with the President of South Korea, Mr. Park, and we agreed that the status quo with regard to North Korea was no longer sustainable and no longer responsible. That is why this past October I introduced S. 2144, the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act. I thank the spon-sors of that bill—Senators R
UBIO, R
ISCH, PERDUE , and I SAKSON —for co-sponsoring the legislation and the chairman and his staff for their encour-agement and invaluable support to make that bill a reality today, along with Senators C
ARDIN and M ENENDEZ , who worked so hard, and the work Sen-ator M
ENENDEZ has been leading over the past year as well. This is a bipar-tisan product that came out of the committee. As the chairman an-nounced today, we will most likely see floor time in just a couple of weeks. On January 6, 2016, our worst fears were realized when North Korea con-ducted its fourth nuclear test. More-over, North Korea has claimed this test was a hydrogen bomb, which is a vastly more powerful weapon. Even if the re-ports out of North Korea are not true that it is not such a weapon, it still represents a significant advancement in North Korea’s nuclear weapons capa-bility. We also know North Korea con-tinues to advance its ballistic missile program. News reports recently out of both Japan and in the United States talk about the equipment being moved for a possible additional missile launch. ADM Bill Gortney, the head of U.S. Northern Command based at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, CO, has publicly stated on several occa-sions that North Korea may have al-ready developed the ability to minia-turize a nuclear warhead, to mount it on their own intercontinental ballistic missile called the KN–08, and to ‘‘shoot it at the homeland.’’ Admiral Gortney reiterated those fears to me privately in our conversations numerous times as well, including his feeling—his con-cern—that the condition of the penin-sula is perhaps at its most unstable point that it has been since the armi-stice. North Korea continues to grossly abuse the rights of their own people. There are up to 200,000 men, women, and children in North Korea’s vast prison systems. In fact, the United Na-tions Commission of Inquiry in 2014 found that North Korea’s actions con-stituted a crime against humanity. We have seen North Korea’s cyber ca-pabilities grow into an asymmetrical threat that they have utilized against its neighbors, South Korea and Japan, as well as the United States, as we all recall after the Sony Pictures hack in November of 2014. According to a No-vember 2015 report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, North Korea is emerging as a signifi-cant actor in cyber space with both its military and clandestine organizations gaining the ability to conduct cyber operations. All of these developments represent a failure of U.S. policy of strategic pa-tience toward North Korea. That is why this bill out of committee, with the strong bipartisan support that it received today, represents a final change in that failed policy. It allows us to change course and, in just a cou-ple of weeks, we can put that legisla-tion into effect. The House of Representatives, as we know, passed 418-to-2 their own version of a bill sanctioning North Korea just a few weeks ago, and I thank the chair-man for moving forward on our very strong substitute amendment today. The Gardner-Menendez substitute be-fore us today represents a slightly modified version of S. 2144. In par-ticular, this legislation mandates—not simply authorizes, it mandates—the President to impose sanctions against persons who materially contribute to North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile development; import luxury goods into North Korea; enable its cen-sorship and human rights abuses; en-gage in money laundering or manufac-turing of counterfeit goods and nar-cotics trafficking; engaging in activi-ties undermining cyber security; have sold, supplied or transferred to or from North Korea precious metals or raw metals, including aluminum, steel, and coal for the benefit of North Korea’s re-gime and its illicit activities. These are mandatory sanctions. It is a dramatic new direction from the dis-cretionary sanctions of today. I would note that these mandatory sanctions on North Korea’s cyber activities and mandatory sanctions on the minerals are unique to the Senate legislation. This bill also codifies Executive Order Nos. 13687 and 13694, regarding cyber security as they apply to North Korea, which were enacted last year in the wake of the Sony Pictures hack and other cyber incidents. This is also a unique feature of the Senate bill, the Gardner-Menendez substitute amend-ment. Lastly, the mandatory sanctions on cyber violators will break new ground for Congress if enacted and signed into law, perhaps providing precedent for future cyber violations around the globe. We need to look for every way to de-prive Pyongyang of income to build its weapons program, strengthen its cyber capabilities, and continue the abuse of its own people. We must stop this re-gime’s abuse, and we must also send a strong message to China, North Ko-rea’s diplomatic protector and largest trading partner, that the United States will use every economic tool at its dis-posal to stop the forgotten maniac. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation when it moves to the floor. I congratulate Senator CORKER and Senator M
ENENDEZ for coming together with a bipartisan solution today so this body and the House of Representatives can pass this legislation and put it on the President’s desk to be signed into law. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Colorado. Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I con-gratulate the Senator from Colorado for moving his amendment forward. I am here on a different subject, which is to discuss an amendment that I submitted with Senator I
SAKSON con-cerning residential energy efficiency. The so-called SAVE Act has always been thoroughly bipartisan, drawing the support of Senators I
SAKSON , T
OOMEY , MORAN , PORTMAN , BOXER , and others, and attracted support from groups all across the political spectrum from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce all the way to the Sierra Club. Our amendment would allow for a home’s energy efficiency to be consid-ered when a borrower is applying for a loan by making a simple change to home underwriting and appraisal standards. Specifically, when you apply for a mortgage, you can request under this legislation an energy audit, and if you have a loan that is backed by the FHA, the energy efficiency of your home and your energy bills will be taken into account by your mortgage

lender. Without this change, even though homeowners spend more on en-ergy costs than taxes or home insur-ance, the amount you pay each month for energy is not taken into account. This amendment isn’t a mandate. It doesn’t require anything. It simply al-lows mortgage lenders to account for energy costs in the same way they ac-count for taxes and insurance. It makes no sense that cosmetic improve-ments like new countertops increase a house’s value, but an energy-efficient furnace, which will actually save homeowners thousands of dollars, does not. This amendment will create thou-sands of jobs in manufacturing, con-struction, and energy efficiency. It will save homeowners money on their en-ergy bills, and it will decrease fore-closure risk. It will increase the energy efficiency of our homes. It does all this by giving consumers a choice they don’t today have. I have heard from builders all across Colorado who support this amend-ment—people like Gene Myers, who is the CEO and founder of Thrive Home Builders. He has built more than 1,000 energy-efficient homes in the Denver area, but he understands we will not fully attain the benefits of efficiency in the market until we properly value it. For these reasons, a large and diverse coalition supports this amendment, in-cluding the National Association of Manufacturers, the National Associa-tion of Home Builders, the U.S. Cham-ber of Commerce, and the U.S. Defense Council, among others. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan and commonsense amend-ment to improve energy efficiency and create American jobs. I thank the Sen-ator from Georgia, Mr. I
SAKSON , for his leadership and his sponsorship of this legislation. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from North Dakota. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Energy Policy Mod-ernization Act of 2015—legislation that has been advanced by our Energy and Natural Resources Committee chair-man, Senator M
URKOWSKI , along with the ranking member, Senator C
ANT-
WELL . As a member of the committee, I appreciate their leadership on this im-portant issue and this legislation we are now considering on the floor. I think Chairwoman M
URKOWSKI is right when she speaks to the need to update our Nation’s energy policy and, in that spirit, I filed several amend-ments designed to advance our Na-tion’s energy policy in key areas. Today I wish to speak briefly about these three amendments. These amend-ments would help provide regulatory certainty for cross-border infrastruc-ture projects, the regulation and recy-cling of coal ash, and reaffirm State primacy for energy development, par-ticularly when it comes to hydraulic fracturing or fracking. First, let me talk about the North American energy infrastructure amendment. One of the necessary com-ponents to leveraging our abundant en-ergy resources and strengthening our energy security involves building the infrastructure to take energy from where it is produced to where it is con-sumed. Whether it is transporting crude oil or natural gas or modernizing and connecting our electric grid, these projects require long-term planning and investment, as well as a regulatory environment that promotes certainty and transparency, as well as impartial review. That is why I have submitted an amendment which is identical to the North American Energy Infrastructure Act—S. 1228—that would modernize the existing Department of Energy Presi-dential permitting process for cross- border infrastructure projects. This amendment, which is cospon-sored by Senator DONNELLY of Indi-ana—it is a bipartisan measure—re-moves the need for a Presidential per-mit for the construction, operation or maintenance of a new oil or natural gas pipeline or electric transmission facility with Canada or Mexico and in-stead places the process in the proper Federal agencies. While it does not alter the NEPA— again, I will repeat this. While it does not alter NEPA’s—the National Envi-ronmental Policy Act—environmental review process, our amendment sets time limits for Federal agencies to make a decision on projects once those necessary reviews are completed. This will add greater certainty to the per-mitting process, and that certainty will help attract the long-term invest-ment necessary to help us build the en-ergy infrastructure we need. These projects are too important to our economy and to our national secu-rity to be dragged out virtually for years, such as in the case of the Key-stone XL Pipeline—more than 7 years. We need a process that is fact-based, transparent, consistent, and non-partisan, that will help support the im-portant energy relationship between the United States and our closest friend and ally—Canada. The Energy Department publicly states that it requires approximately 6 to 18 months to issue a Presidential permit. However, there are numerous examples of pipelines and electric transmission applications languishing far beyond that timeline. The many in-consistencies involving these applica-tions speak to the need to update this permitting process. So let’s start with crude oil pipelines. Take, for example, the bureaucratic delays for the Plains All American Pipeline, which secured a Presidential permit from the U.S. State Department for its crude oil pipeline in 2007. In Feb-ruary of 2013, the company sought a name change permit from the State Department. However, it took until August of 2015—2
1⁄2years—before a name change was approved. The State Department informed the company that its application for a name change required a new National Environmental Policy Act—or NEPA— review because a separate pipeline, the Bakken North, based wholly within the United States, would connect to it. So to change the name, they had to do a NEPA review for 21⁄2years. Electric transmission lines. There have also been many delays in siting electric transmission lines between the United States and Canada, and in a lot of cases that is for renewable energy. One example is the New England Clean Power Link, a 1,000-megawatt project delivering renewable energy spanning 154 miles between Vermont and Quebec. The company filed its application for a Presidential permit in May of 2014. Yet its application has been pending for over 20 months for a renewable energy electric transmission line. Another example is the Great North-ern Transmission Line, a 220-mile project that would connect Minnesota and Manitoba, bringing hydroelectric-ity and wind power across the border. The project’s Presidential application was filed in April of 2014. While the re-view is ongoing and we hope an out-come will come soon, this application has been pending for almost 2 years. The third example is the Champlain Hudson Power Express project, a 333- mile underground and underwater project. It will bring 1,000 megawatts of hydroelectric power from Quebec to the New York City area. The application for a Presidential permit was initially filed in January 2010; yet it took al-most 5 years—until October 2014—for the Presidential permit to be issued. Inconsistent delays in the Federal re-view timelines, which last longer than the Energy Department’s 6- to 18- month target—the target is 6 to 18 months, not 5 to 7 years—inject uncer-tainty, risk, and costs into all of these vital projects. Commonsense reforms are needed so the project proponents and consumers can benefit. This is exactly what this legislation does. Specifically, this amendment would eliminate the Presi-dential permit requirement for con-struction or modification of new oil and natural gas pipelines, as well as electric transmission facilities, that cross the national boundary of the United States. Instead, it places the process in the proper agencies. It would require that the certificate of crossing will be issued by the Sec-retary of State for oil pipelines, the Energy Department for electric trans-mission lines, and FERC and the En-ergy Department for cross-border nat-ural gas pipelines, as currently config-ured. It requires the State Department to issue a certificate of crossing on a cross-border pipeline permit within 120 days upon completion of a NEPA envi-ronmental review process. There is the NEPA environmental review process, but then 120 days after that, they have to make a decision and they have to issue a certificate of crossing unless

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES308 January 28, 2016 
the agency finds that construction of the cross-border segment is not in the public interest of the United States. It would retain the NEPA review of the potential environmental impacts of a new project at a border crossing and leaves unchanged all other environ-mental, land, or wildlife reviews cur-rently applying to any other pipeline constructed in the country. In other words, the States would still oversee the NEPA and permitting processes, as they do now. It would provide for an open and transparent rulemaking process to de-termine the definition of ‘‘cross-border segment,’’ which would be used to help determine the scope of the NEPA re-view process. That is because requiring a NEPA review for the entire pipeline project duplicates the multiple Fed-eral, State, and local agencies’ regula-tions, processes, and authorities al-ready in place. There are numerous existing State and Federal laws and regulations for the review and approval of siting, land acquisition, design, and construction of projects. Those remain unaffected by this amendment. For example—and this is important—State laws and regu-lations governing pipeline siting re-main unchanged by this amendment. Federal laws and regulations governing design, construction, safety, and envi-ronmental review of the pipelines re-main unchanged. State and local laws and regulations regarding land and rights-of-way acquisition for infra-structure projects, such as pipelines, would remain unchanged. Construction and operation of a pipeline in the United States must comply with the safety regulations of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Adminis-tration. This is a separate process from the NEPA process and is also un-changed by this amendment. The measure would provide appro-priate authority and scope to the State Department for examination of border- crossing impacts of projects. Other re-views by the Department of Interior, Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for issues such as environmental, land, and wildlife im-pacts are appropriate and remain un-changed. The amendment would require FERC to approve natural gas cross-border pipelines consistent with current pol-icy. It also requires the Energy Depart-ment to issue a permit within 30 days of the receipt of the FERC action. Again, these are rational timelines, so there is some consistency and depend-ability in the process. Finally, the amendment also speci-fies that existing projects do not need further approvals for new or revised Presidential permits for certain modi-fications. These include alterations such as volume expansion, adjustments to maintain flow, or changes in owner-ship. This is commonsense legislation that can help us build the vital energy in-frastructure we need for this country. At this point, Mr. President, I would ask how much time I have remaining. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator has 6 minutes remaining. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, the next amendment I would like to review that I will be offering is identical to a bill introduced by Senator M
ANCHIN  and myself. It is the Improving Coal Combustion Residuals Regulation Act of 2016, S. 2446. This legislation, which builds on our past efforts to find a bi-cameral, bipartisan approach to coal ash, ensures that there is safe disposal of coal ash and provides greater cer-tainty for its recycling. This is a win from the industry standpoint of more energy, it is more cost-effective, but it is also an environmental win in terms of recycling coal ash, as well as making sure that when it is disposed of, it is done safely. Coal ash is a byproduct of coal-based electricity generation that has been safely recycled for buildings, roads, bridges, and other infrastructure for years. In fact, I think it is important to take note of the environmental and financial benefits of coal ash recycling. Over 60 million tons of coal ash were beneficially used in 2014, including over 14 million tons in concrete. It has been calculated that taxpayers save $5.2 bil-lion dollars per year thanks to the use of coal ash in federally funded road and bridge construction. Products made with coal ash are often stronger and more durable, and coal ash reduces the need to manufacture cement, which re-sulted in greenhouse gas emission re-ductions of 13 million tons in 2014. In December of 2014, the EPA put forth new regulations for the manage-ment of coal ash. The regulations made clear—at least for the time being—that coal ash would continue to be treated and regulated as a nonhazardous waste consistent with EPA’s earlier findings. However, the regulation has a major flaw: It relies solely on citizen lawsuits for enforcement. What this means is that neither the EPA nor the States can directly enforce the rules through a permit program with which owners and operators of coal ash disposal fa-cilities must comply. Think about it. That means the regulation does not create the constructive regulatory guidance and oversight necessary to ensure the proper management of coal ash. Instead, the EPA regulation has created a situation whereby the only enforcement mechanism for the rule is that an operator of a coal ash site can be sued for not meeting the EPA’s new Federal regulatory standards. Those subject to this regulation whose re-sponsibility it is for keeping the lights on for our electricity consumers are themselves left in the dark about how the EPA standards will be defined in court cases across the Nation. Instead of direct oversight, we will have law-suits brought by those who want to shut down coal production. Imagine building an addition to your house and there being no building per-mit process to go through with your local government. Let’s just take this as an analogy. You want to build a house, but there is no building permit process to go through with the local government. You call the city or the county, and they say: Well, you should just read the rules, and if you violate the rules, know that you can be sued at any time by anyone who thinks that maybe you didn’t build that addition according to the law. This process would leave you without any sort of as-surances that you actually built your addition in accordance with the law. Worse, you would have the threat of litigation hanging over your head. Does that make any sense? Think about it. You build a house, a nice, beautiful house, in Phoenix, where it is nice and warm in the win-ter. You can’t get a building permit. You build that house according to your interpretation of the regulations, but anybody—it might be your neighbor; it might be somebody who comes down from the great State of North Dakota to enjoy your lovely winter—anybody may decide to sue you, and they would be able to do it. That is how the regula-tion of coal ash is set up. Come on. It makes no sense at all. That is how it has been done, and that is why we need to fix it. Our amendment will directly address this problem by taking the best parts of our EPA rule—the standards for coal ash disposal—and incorporating all of them in EPA-approved State permit programs for both recycling and dis-posal. The States will have direct over-sight over disposal sites’ design and op-eration, including inspections, air cri-teria, run-on and run-off control, clo-sure and postclosure care, and financial assurance. Meanwhile, we offer State regulators the same flexibility for im-plementing the groundwater moni-toring and corrective action standards that are currently provided under ex-isting municipal solid waste and haz-ardous waste regulations, allowing State regulators to make tailored, site- specific adjustments. We have been listening to the issues the EPA has brought up about our pre-vious versions of this legislation. In fact, we changed the legislation to in-clude a more traditional EPA applica-tion process for the State permit pro-grams. If the EPA finds that a State permit program is deficient—— The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator’s time has expired. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes to finish my remarks, with the indulgence of the Senator from Massachusetts. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HOEVEN. If the EPA finds a State permit program deficient, then the EPA can take direct control over the State’s permit program in that State. If a State doesn’t want to have its own permit program, the EPA runs the permit program for the State. Mr. President, our amendment is about responsible regulation. It is

about certainty for recyclers and for the American public, who will know that State and Federal regulators are actually working with energy pro-ducers to ensure safe disposal of coal ash. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense, bipartisan approach by voting for the Hoeven-Manchin amend-ment. I do have another amendment to speak on, but at this time, due to time constraints, I will defer to the Senator from Massachusetts, and I thank him for his courtesy. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Massachusetts. 
REMEMBERING CHRISTA MCAULIFFE  
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the life of Massachusetts’ Christa McAuliffe. She lost her life, along with six other crewmembers, 30 years ago today when the space shuttle Chal-lenger exploded. She was an extraor-dinary teacher and was selected out of a pool of 11,000 applicants to lead the ultimate field trip as the first teacher in space. Her legacy lives on in many ways but especially at the Christa McAuliffe Center for Education and Teaching Excellence at her alma mater, Framingham State University. 
AMENDMENT NO . 2982 
Mr. President, the omnibus spending bill that was enacted into law in De-cember lifted the 40-year-old restric-tion on exporting U.S. oil overseas. During that debate, concerns were raised regarding the impact that ex-porting American oil abroad could have on U.S. consumers and refining fuel prices, independent refineries, and other sectors of the U.S. economy, such as shipbuilding. However, the final language that be-came law did not include any require-ment for analyzing and reporting on any potential impacts that exports could have on the industry or on U.S. consumers. The Markey amendment No. 2982 to the Energy bill would create such a review. The amendment would require the GAO to review and report back annually for 3 years on the im-pacts of crude oil exports on U.S. con-sumers, independent refineries, ship-builders, and energy production. The language of my amendment is language that is bipartisan. The lan-guage of my amendment is identical to language included in legislation spon-sored by Chairman M
URKOWSKI . It is also identical to language included in legislation introduced by other Sen-ators. Exporting American crude oil could be a disaster for independent refineries in regions such as the east coast. Up-wards of 55 percent of our refining ca-pacity on the east coast could poten-tially close as a result of oil exports. The Energy Department has said that exports could lead to as much as $9 billion less investment and 1.6 mil-lion barrels less refining capacity in 10 years. It could lead to up to $200 billion less revenue for the U.S. refining sector over the next decade. It could raise prices for consumers, who are currently saving $700 a year at the pump and $500 a year on home heating oil this winter because of low prices. It could harm U.S. shipbuilders. We have been having a shipbuilding renais-sance in this country. We are currently seeing the biggest shipbuilding boom in 20 years, and it has been because of our increasing oil production and the Jones Act, which requires shipments between U.S. ports to be on U.S.-built, U.S.- flagged, and U.S.-crewed ships. This means that producing more oil is lead-ing to investment in U.S.-built ships to move that oil around the country. Right now, U.S. shipbuilders have or-ders to expand our domestic tanker fleet capable of transporting crude oil by 40 percent. Each oil tanker can rep-resent an investment of $100 to $200 million. Five years ago there were zero orders. Now one company alone in Pennsylvania—Aker ASA—has nearly $1 billion in back orders and has tripled employment over the last 3 years. Exports could stop all of this in its tracks, so that GAO report is very im-portant. I also want to compliment Chairman MURKOWSKI and Ranking Member C
ANTWELL for their excellent work in partnering to produce the leg-islation which we are considering here on the floor. It represents bipartisan-ship in the way it is meant to operate. Toward that goal, I have an amend-ment that I am going to speak to right now, which is one that Senator C
AS-
SIDY from Louisiana and I have intro-duced. It is an amendment to improve the way we are going to be selling oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Our Nation’s oil stockpile is supposed to be there to protect American con-sumers and our security in the event of an emergency. We should not be using it as a piggy bank to pay for other pri-orities. But if we are going to sell oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, we should at least make sure that we do so strategically, to get the best deal for taxpayers and American consumers. Last year, Senator C
ASSIDY and I of-fered a nearly identical amendment to the Transportation bill, which was adopted on the Senate floor and ulti-mately became law. That amendment protects taxpayers by improving the way the sales required under the bill— sales of oil from the Strategic Petro-leum Reserve—are, in fact, conducted. The Cassidy-Markey fix gives the Sec-retary of Energy more flexibility to sell oil when prices are high and directs the Department to stop selling oil when the revenue targets required by the bill are reached. This fix should allow us to sell fewer overall barrels from the Strategic Pe-troleum Reserve and get a better re-turn on those sales. However, the roughly $5 million worth of SPRO that was required to be sold as part of the Budget Act that passed in November did not include this commonsense fix. The current Cassidy-Markey amend-ment that is pending to the Energy bill contains language virtually identical to the amendment to the Transpor-tation bill that was adopted on the Senate floor. It would apply the same fix to the sales required by the Budget Act in order to protect taxpayers. Too often our policy with respect to SPRO has been to buy high and sell low. Taxpayers have paid an inflation- adjusted average of roughly $75 a barrel for the oil that is in our Nation’s stockpile. We should ensure that we get the best return for our taxpayers in those SPRO sales. That is what our amendment would do. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Oregon. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, did my colleague from Alaska wish to in-tervene for a moment? Ms. MURKOWSKI. Just an inquiry, Mr. President, into how much time the Senator is seeking at this moment. Mr. MERKLEY. Yes, 10 minutes. Ms. MURKOWSKI. I also understand that Senator WHITEHOUSE wishes to speak to an amendment that is pend-ing. Is that correct? Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I only wish for a moment to speak in favor of the Crapo-Whitehouse amend-ment. I could do that for a minute or for 10 seconds later on. I don’t need the time now. We can get to the vote as the chairman wishes. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Thank you. I am trying to make sure that we are going to commence the vote beginning at noon. Thank you. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Oregon is recognized. 
OUR‘‘WE THE PEOPLE ’’ DEMOCRACY  
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, the most important words in the crafting of our Constitution are the first three words. Those words are ‘‘We the Peo-ple.’’ As President Lincoln so elo-quently put it, this is the notion that we would create a system of govern-ance that would be governance of the people, by the people, and for the peo-ple. I will be rising periodically to ad-dress issues that affect American citi-zens across our Nation, that are impor-tant, that are urgent, and that this body should be addressing. This week I am using my ‘‘We the People’’ speech to highlight excerpts from an article written by NASA sci-entist Piers Sellers. Piers Sellers was an astronaut. He has been a NASA sci-entist, and he shared this article from which I am taking portions. He says: 
I’m a climate scientist who has just been told I have Stage 4 pancreatic cancer. 
He continues: 
This diagnosis puts me in an interesting position. I’ve spent much of my professional life thinking about the science of climate change, which is best viewed through a multidecadal lens. At some level I was sure that, even at my present age of 60, I would live to see the most critical part of the prob-lem, and its possible solutions, play out in my lifetime. Now that my personal horizon has been steeply foreshortened, I was forced

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES310 January 28, 2016 
to decide how to spend my remaining time. Was continuing to think about climate change worth the bother? 
He goes on to note that he examined his bucket list and he found only two things that really mattered: spending time with his family—as he put it, ‘‘with the people I know and love’’— and then getting back to his office ‘‘as quickly as possible’’ to continue the work on climate science and addressing climate change. He notes: 
On the science side, there has been a steady accumulation of evidence from the last 15 years that climate change is real and that its trajectory could lead us to a very uncomfortable, if not dangerous, place. On the policy side, the just-concluded climate conference in Paris set a goal of holding the increase in global average temperature to 2 degrees Celsius . . . above preindustrial lev-els. 
He continues: 
It’s doubtful that we’ll hold the line at 2 degrees . . . but we need to give it our best shot. With scenarios that exceed that target, we are talking about enormous changes in global precipitation and temperature pat-terns, huge impacts on water and food secu-rity, and significant sea level rise. 
He continues, saying that ‘‘Pope Francis and a think tank of retired military officers have drawn roughly the same conclusion . . . The worst im-pacts will be felt by the world’s poor-est.’’ He continues to examine this and notes that while heavy lifting will have to be done by policymakers—and he is speaking to all of us—scientists can add a great deal, and scientists at NASA can help by keeping track of the changes in the Earth’s system and using their powerful computer models to explore which approaches to ad-dressing this problem are practical, trading off near-term impacts against longer term impacts. He observes that engineers and indus-trialists must come up with new tech-nologies to address the challenges of clean energy generation, storage, and distribution, and that they must be solved within a few decades. Later in the article, he says: 
History is replete with examples of us hu-mans getting out of tight spots. The winners tend to be realistic, pragmatic, and flexible; the losers are often in denial of the threat. 
He closes by saying this: 
As for me, I have no complaints. I am very grateful for the experiences I have had on this planet. As an astronaut, I space-walked 220 miles above the Earth, floating alongside the International Space Station. I watched hurricanes cartwheel across the ocean, the Amazon snake its way through a sea of bril-liant green carpeted forest, and gigantic nighttime thunderstorms flash and flare for hundreds of miles along the Ecuador. From this God’s-eye-view, I saw how fragile and in-finitely precious the Earth is, and I am hope-ful for its future. 
‘‘And so,’’ he concludes, ‘‘I am going to work tomorrow.’’ I simply want to thank Piers for his lifetime of commitment to science, his service as an astronaut, his continuing to work on this major challenge of ad-dressing the planet, and that he would see—even in these days where he is fighting a battle against a forceful, powerful disease, he is dedicating his efforts to this challenge. Is that not a call for all of us to see how important it is for us to dedicate our efforts to take on this challenge and to recognize, as he points out, that major strategies must be developed in a short period of time to avoid cata-strophic consequences. Thank you, Mr. President. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the Crapo amend-ment, the Senate then vote on the Mar-key amendment with no second-degree amendments in order to the Markey amendment prior to the vote.

Mr. President, in a few minutes we will vote on the adoption of the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capa-bilities Act, which we are seeking to add as an amendment to this impor-tant Energy bill. This amendment will do a number of very critical things to help the United States increase and maintain and keep its lead in nuclear energy development globally. It will establish a modeling and sim-ulation program that aids in the devel-opment of new reactor technologies, es-tablish a user facility for a versatile re-actor-based fast neutron source, and establish a national innovation center to help share this vital information be-tween the government and the private sector. It will allow the NRC to apprise the Department of Energy of regulatory challenges early in the development process and would require a report by the NRC on the licensing of non-light water reactors. This bill is a strong sig-nal to the rest of the world that we in-tend to maintain U.S. leadership in nu-clear technology. This bill will enable the private sec-tor and national labs to work together to create even greater achievement in nuclear science than in the last cen-tury. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator’s time has expired. The Senator from Rhode Island. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, as the lead Democratic cosponsor of Sen-ator CRAPO ’s amendment, I want to commend and salute him for his leader-ship. Senators D
URBIN and B OOKER and I have all joined from our side. Senator C
RAPO , Senator R ISCH, Senator H ATCH , and Senator K
IRKare on the Repub-lican side. This is truly a bipartisan amendment. I hope it will get a strong and positive vote. It is very important that America continue its innovation in the area of advanced nuclear technologies. They continue to confer immense promise. We are seeing the promise of American innovation realized overseas, for in-stance, where the first traveling wave technologies are being constructed in China, not here. We need to make sure we continue our investment. We need to make sure we are doing good regulation so that innovation can proceed to the market. We hope this amendment will help move that forward. Once again, Senator C
RAPO has shown great leadership with this. I am pleased to support him. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3021. Ms. MURKOWSKI. I ask for the yeas and nays.

REMEMBERING THE CREWMEMBERS OF THE  
SPACE SHUTTLE ‘‘CHALLENGER ’’ 
Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, today is the 30th anniversary of the tremendous loss of the Space Shuttle Challenger and of New Hampshire teacher in space Christa McAuliffe of Concord, NH. Today I rise to honor the legacy of the Challenger. On this day 30 years ago, America was saddened by the trag-ic loss of seven brave crewmembers of the Space Shuttle Challenger: Com-mander Francis R. Scobee, Pilot Mi-chael Smith, Mission Specialist Ellison S. Onizuka, Mission Specialist Ronald E. McNair, Mission Specialist Judith A. Resnik, Payload Specialist Gregory B. Jarvis, and, of course, our own New Hampshire teacher in space and pay-load specialist, S. Christa McAuliffe. Each of the members of the Chal-lenger crew conducted themselves with such bravery, heroism, and a desire to reach beyond and into the stars that it inspired me. As a high school student, I remember where I was that day. We were all watching as the Challenger was lifting off into the stars. I was a student at Nashua High School and Christa McAuliffe inspired all of us. She cap-tured the Nation’s imagination as she looked to be the first teacher in space. That tragic day touched the lives of every man, woman, and child in New Hampshire. It was one of those days in history when time stopped and every-one remembers what they were doing at that moment. I know I certainly do. You see, Christa was a role model, someone who lived among us and was able to achieve extraordinary things. She inspired young people across New Hampshire and the Nation to ‘‘touch the future.’’ She was a gifted educator and had such an infectious enthusiasm for teaching. She taught social studies at Concord High School and was selected from 11,000 applicants to be the first teacher in space. When asked about the mission on na-tional television, she said: ‘‘If you’re offered a seat on a rocket ship, don’t ask what seat. Just get on.’’ It really shows her dedication to teaching, her bravery, and her commitment to in-spiring the next generation of leaders, scientists, dreamers, and explorers, all of whom have made our Nation great. Today, the McAuliffe-Shepard Dis-covery Center in Concord, NH, is named in her honor. This state-of-the- art facility not only provides a lasting tribute to the courage and bravery of Christa McAuliffe and all of the mem-bers of the Challenger crew, but it also helps educate visitors about the con-tributions of these extraordinary New Hampshire citizens—not just Christa McAuliffe but other New Hampshire citizens who have braved and explored space. The McAuliffe planetarium is doing amazing work by showing the next generation of scientists and lead-ers how exciting it is to study science, technology, engineering, and mathe-matics. It is a tremendous legacy to Christa McAuliffe and all who have traveled in space and explored the edges of the universe on our behalf so we can learn more about ourselves and new developments. President Ronald Reagan eloquently said that frightful day 30 years ago: 
The crew of the Space Shuttle Challenger honored us by the manner in which they lived their lives. We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and ‘‘slipped the surly bonds of earth’’ to ‘‘touch the face of God.’’ 
Today we remember and honor the legacy of a great Granite Stater and great American, Christa McAuliffe, and all of the brave crewmembers of the Space Shuttle Challenger that day be-cause their legacy continues to live on in our children and in our continuous focus on improving in science, tech-nology, mathematics, and our contin-uous reach for the stars. I thank the Presiding Officer. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. S
ASSE). Without objection, it is so or-dered. HONORING NEBRASKA ’S SOLDIERS WHO LOST  
THEIR LIVES IN COMBAT  
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the great men and women of Nebraska who have served and are serving in the U.S. military. Our State has a rich and powerful history of answering the call to serve. For nearly 150 years, we have witnessed this bravery in each of America’s wars. Over the past decade, the men and women of Nebraska have risen to de-fend our precious freedom against Is-lamic terrorists, primarily in Iraq and Afghanistan. This year marks the 15th anniversary of the horrific terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, DC. These events changed the lives of Nebraskans and our Nation forever. Nebraskans stepped up, ready to fight. Those serv-ing in uniform, be it Active Duty, the National Guard or the Reserves, knew they would likely wind up on the bat-tlefield at some point in the future. Many other Nebraskans enlisted after high school. ROTC units in Ne-braska had no problem filling their ranks, and applications for military academy nominations poured in at record numbers. We should all be so thankful to this generation for answer-ing the call and standing up to defend freedom across the globe. Today, I begin a new initiative to honor this generation of Nebraska’s he-roes on the Senate floor, and I will focus on those who lost their lives in combat. All of our fallen Nebraskans have a special story. According to the Nebraska Department of Veterans Af-fairs, there are 77 Nebraskans who lost their lives to combat-related incidents in Iraq and Afghanistan. Throughout this year and beyond, I intend to de-vote time on the Senate floor to re-member each of these heroes. Telling their stories keeps their service and their sacrifice alive in our hearts, while reminding us of the principles they fought and died for. Time after time, Nebraska’s Gold Star families tell me the same thing. They hope and pray that the supreme sacrifices of their loved ones will al-ways be remembered. It is my hope that these presentations will allow us to pause and reflect on these brave Ne-braskans. The freedoms they secured are personified by the courage they em-body. 
SPECIALIST JOSHUA A . FORD  
Mr. President, today I wish to begin with SPC Josh Ford from Pender, NE. Joshua A. Ford was killed in Iraq on July 31, 2006. His parents, relatives, and high school classmates look back lov-ingly on the boy who quickly grew to be a courageous soldier. As a young teenager, Josh was de-scribed as a couch potato who liked video games, painting, and watching horror movies, but deep inside there grew a strong desire to serve his coun-try in military uniform. He joined the Nebraska Army Na-tional Guard between his junior and senior year at Pender High School in

2003. That same year he began basic training at Fort Jackson. He was just 17 years old, and it was a tough transi-tion. His dad Lonnie remembers Josh talk-ing about being placed in ‘‘fat man’s camp’’ at Fort Jackson. Josh was over-weight by 35 pounds at the time. Lon-nie and his wife Linda, along with classmates and friends, noticed how dramatically Josh had changed when he returned from basic training. A year later, after graduating from Pender High School, Josh attended the Army’s heavy vehicle driver school at Fort Leonard Wood. He was assigned to the 189th Transportation Company, De-tachment No. 1, in Wayne, NE. A senior sergeant remembers that Josh ‘‘grew up from a kid to a soldier almost overnight.’’ The 189th had just been recognized as a unit in April of 2003. Two years later, the 189th received orders to deploy to Iraq. Following training at Fort Riley, the unit arrived at Tallil, Iraq, in October of 2005. For the next year they traveled over 2.5 million miles throughout the country. Specialist Ford became known as an energetic and reliable bat-tle buddy. He was eager to tackle extra missions. Josh came home on leave in April of 2006. He had a number of things on his mind. At the top of his list was his girlfriend Michelle, whom he proposed to that spring, and she happily accept-ed. He also kept things in order, leav-ing behind an audio will for his friends. According to Josh’s father Lonnie, ‘‘he just wanted everyone to celebrate his life after he was gone.’’ Josh returned to Iraq with just 6 months to go in the deployment. In the early evening of July 31, 2006, the heat was unbearable but typical for a sum-mer day in Iraq. Specialist Ford and his battle buddy, SPC Ben Marksmeier, were part of a 189th convoy that was driving through an area they had pa-trolled many times. Out of nowhere, an IED blast obliterated their vehicle. Unit members reached their truck im-mediately. Specialist Marksmeier was seriously injured, but Specialist Ford died at the scene. Lonnie, Josh’s dad, will never forget the day he heard the knock at the door. Three members of the Nebraska Army National Guard had arrived at his home in Pender, and he knew before he opened the door why they had come. The next day, Lonnie and his wife Linda traveled over 250 miles to tell Josh’s grandmother and his three sis-ters of his death. One can only imagine the pain, sorrow, and agony they felt every step of the way. SPC Josh Ford was buried in Pender, NE, on August 10, 2006. Pictures show the road from the church to the ceme-tery lined with people as the Patriot Guard veteran motorcycle group es-corted Josh to his final resting place. For his service to his country, SPC Josh Ford earned the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, and the Combat Action Badge. He was promoted posthumously to the rank of sergeant. His father Lonnie later retired from teaching, and he joined the Patriot Guard. Today, Lonnie ensures those who served and died are never forgot-ten. He attends funerals and events with his fellow Patriot Guard riders all across Nebraska. Josh’s photo and his service information are proudly dis-played on his rider’s vest. He recalls Josh saying to him, when he was home on leave in April before his death: 
Old man, I now understand why you were so tough on me while I was growing up. You only wanted me to become the best person I could possibly be. 
During his limited time on Earth, Josh did just that. Our Nation and all Nebraskans are forever indebted to his service and sac-rifice. SGT Josh Ford was a hero, and I am honored to tell his story lest we forget his life and the freedom he fought to defend. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
REMEMBERING THE CREWMEMBERS OF THE  
SPACE SHUTTLE ‘‘CHALLENGER ’’ 
Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, 30 years ago today millions of Americans gathered around their television sets in homes and classrooms all across the country to watch the Space Shuttle Challenger launch toward the stars. Seventy-three seconds later everything changed. We stared at our television sets, stunned and brokenhearted. Today, on the 30th anniversary of that terrible tragedy, we remember the heros we lost: Francis Scobee, Michael Smith, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka, Judith Resnik, Gregory Jar-vis; and we remember one more hero, the special person that so many little boys and girls tuned in that day to see, the very first U.S. civilian in space, Christa Corrigan McAuliffe. Christa was born in Boston, MA, and grew up in nearby Framingham. She attended Marian High School and at-tended Framingham State University. She married her high school sweet-heart, Steve. They had two children, Scott and Caroline. She eventually be-came a high school social studies teacher in Concord, NH. In 1984, Ronald Reagan announced that NASA would send its first private citizen into space, and that person would be a teacher. A few months later, Christa beat out over 11,000 other applicants to become the first teacher in space. Christa was thrilled. It was like a dream come true. She reportedly told Johnny Carson: ‘‘If you’re offered a seat on a rocket ship, don’t ask what seat. Just get on.’’ Mr. President, 30 years ago today Senator Ted Kennedy entered an ex-cerpt of Christa McAuliffe’s NASA ap-plication into the public record, and I would like to reenter it for the RECORD  and read it again today. When asked why she wanted to be the first private citizen in space, Christa McAuliffe wrote: 
I remember the excitement in my home when the first satellites were launched. My parents were amazed and I was caught up in their wonder. In school my classes would gather around the TV and try to follow the rocket as it seemed to jump all over the screen. I remember when Alan Shepard made his historic flight—not even an orbit—and I was thrilled. John Kennedy inspired me with his words about placing a man on the moon and I still remember a cloudy, rainy night driving through Pennsylvania and hearing the news that the astronauts had landed safely. As a woman, I have been envious of those men who could participate in the space pro-gram and who were encouraged to excel in areas of math and science. I felt that women had indeed been left outside of one of the most exciting careers available. When Sally Ride and other women began to train as as-tronauts, I could look among my students and see ahead of them an ever-increasing list of opportunities. I cannot join the space program and re-start my life as an astronaut, but this oppor-tunity to connect my abilities as an educa-tor with my interests in history and space is a unique opportunity to fulfill my early fan-tasies. I watched the space age being born and I would like to participate. 
Mr. President, Christa McAuliffe never made it into orbit on January 28, 1986. She never got the chance to write in her journal about what it was like inside the space shuttle, how it feels to float around, and all the other sorts of things that people who are not astro-nauts have wondered about. She never got to go back to her classroom to tell her children about her magnificent journey. But Christa McAuliffe still teaches. Since 1994, the Christa McAuliffe Cen-ter at Framingham State University has provided truly remarkable, innova-tive, integrated STEM education re-sources to 12,000 Massachusetts stu-dents each year. Christa McAuliffe’s story of a little girl from Framingham who became a schoolteacher and got the chance to take the ‘‘ultimate field trip’’ into outer space keeps inspiring little boys and girls in Massachusetts and around the country, telling them all to reach for the stars. Today, we remember Christa McAuliffe and the six others we lost on the Space Shuttle Challenger. We re-member that day as our country stared at our television sets, stunned and bro-kenhearted. We honor their memory by continuing, as Christa McAuliffe said, ‘‘to touch the future,’’ to teach our children and our grandchildren ‘‘where we have been, where we are going, [and] why.’’ Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Michigan. Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the Stabe-now-Peters amendment package that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES314 January 28, 2016 
will provide much needed assistance to Flint, MI. For decades Flint was known as the birthplace of General Motors and for playing a key role in the forma-tion of the United Auto Workers. Now national attention is trained on Flint not for its role in the creation of America’s middle class but for the utter abandonment by the State gov-ernment of a city where 40 percent of the population lives below the poverty line. Nearly 2 years ago, an unelected emergency manager appointed by Michigan’s Governor changed the city of Flint’s water source to the Flint River in an attempt to save money while the city prepared to transition to a new regional water authority. The ul-timate cost of this misguided, dan-gerous decision will not be known for decades. After switching away from clean water sourced from the Detroit Water Authority, Flint residents began to re-ceive improperly treated Flint River water, long known to be contaminated and potentially very corrosive. Water poured from Flint faucets and tasted and smelled terrible. It was discol-ored—brown or yellow in many cases. In fact, General Motors stopped using this water source for their Flint engine operations because the high chloride levels were corroding parts used during the manufacturing process. The result of the State government decision was—and continues to be—cat-astrophic. Flint families were exposed to lead and other toxins that will have a lasting effect for generations. The water crisis in Flint is an im-mense failure on the part of Michigan’s State government to ensure the health and safety of the people of Flint and to provide the basic human right of clean water for drinking, bathing, and cook-ing. It is a failure that will cause Flint’s children to suffer from the ad-verse health effects of lead exposure for years to come—a failure that has cre-ated the enormous challenge of fixing a water system that has had corrosive water flowing through its pipes for months. Even after Flint has transitioned back to distributing water from De-troit that should be safe, unfortunately the potentially irreversible damage to the waterlines will still require the use of filters. This ongoing crisis has left the city of 100,000 people drinking bot-tled water donated from across the Na-tion. In light of the State government’s failure, I am disappointed State gov-ernment still has not sufficiently stepped up to provide the necessary re-sources to deal with the short and long term effects of water contamination in Flint. While the cause of this crisis and the ultimate responsibility to fix it lies with State government, we need to bring resources from all levels of gov-ernment to bear to address this unprec-edented emergency. Along with my Michigan colleagues Senator S
TABENOW  and Representative KILDEE , I have been working tirelessly to leverage all avail-able resources for the people of Flint. The effects of lead exposure on chil-dren are insidious, causing long-term developmental problems, nervous sys-tem damage, and decreased bone and muscle growth. There is no cure, but we can mitigate these problems with a commitment to delivering nutrition, education, health care, and other wrap- around services that a generation of Flint children now need more than ever. My colleagues and I have requested that the U.S. Department of Agri-culture allow existing programs to pro-vide ready-to-feed infant formula that does not need to be mixed with water to all infants in Flint. We have urged the Department of Health and Human Services to make Head Start available for every eligible child in the city of Flint. We are working to make sure every Flint resident has access to af-fordable health care and are encour-aging residents to purchase coverage through the open enrollment at healthcare.gov before the January 31 deadline or sign up for Medicaid if they are eligible. I will continue to work with Con-gress, the administration, and leaders on the ground in Flint to secure any Federal support possible for Flint fami-lies and small businesses that have been harmed. As part of our efforts to support the people of Flint, Senator S
TABENOW and I are offering an amend-ment that will help begin the process to make Flint whole with substantial investments in fixing this problem in both the short and long term. Our amendment will assist the city of Flint in four ways. First, the amendment would include my bill, the Improving Notification for Clean and Safe Drinking Water Act, or the INCASE Act, which would require the EPA to directly notify the public of dangerously high lead levels in drink-ing water if the local and State govern-ments fail to do so within 15 days. The EPA repeatedly made recommenda-tions to the State government, urging them to take steps to improve the water and protect the people. Unfortu-nately, the State of Michigan failed to take action and failed to properly no-tify Flint residents of the health risks in the water system for months. The primary responsibility for notifying residents lies with the State govern-ment, but when you have a situation like Flint where the State was sitting on critical information, there has to be another level of accountability. Second, our amendment will author-ize EPA to issue direct grants to the State of Michigan and the city of Flint to hire new personnel, provide tech-nical assistance, and, most impor-tantly, replace and repair water service lines—the only long-term solution. These aging service lines were cer-tainly a concern before the crisis, but now there is an urgent need to repair and to replace them. For nearly 2 years corrosive water flowed through the pipes leaching lead and other toxins. This provision will fund the repairs for the service lines that were severely and potentially permanently damaged as a result. Third, our amendment includes a technical fix that will allow current Drinking Water State Revolving Funds to be used for loan forgiveness. This will provide upwards of $20 million in relief to Flint and allow them to direct new funds for investment in water in-frastructure and not interest pay-ments. Earlier this year the EPA ac-knowledged that the State did not have the authority to forgive these loans. That is why this amendment includes a temporary technical fix to allow States to use the EPA’s Drinking Water State Revolving Fund resources for loan for-giveness and debt relief on debt in-curred before the current fiscal year. Finally, our amendment will direct the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to establish a Center Of Excellence on lead exposure in Flint, which will bring together local universities, hospitals, medical profes-sionals, and the State and county pub-lic health departments in an effort to address the short and long-term health effects of lead exposure in the city. Mr. President, it is important to re-member that the children of Flint have been impacted the most by this crisis through no fault of their own. Whether in Flint or elsewhere in America, we have a responsibility to care for our children. We must repair the trust Flint residents have lost in the ability of government officials to protect them and to provide the most basic services. I strongly urge my colleagues to join us in our effort to help Flint recover from this unnecessary manmade dis-aster. Standing up for children is not a Republican or a Democratic issue. I hope we all come together. This is com-mon ground on which we can stand to-gether and stand up for the people and the children of Flint. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Arizona. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of a bipar-tisan amendment I have submitted with the senior Senator from Cali-fornia. It would enable Arizona, Cali-fornia, and other drought-stricken States to store more water in hydro-electric dams. As everyone knows, water is a con-troversial issue in the West. Arizona and California have long been at odds on a number of water-related issues, particularly the very long-running Su-preme Court case on the Colorado River. However, recognizing the impor-tance of wisely managing water in the West is something on which we can all agree and look for ways to cooperate. Today I am pleased to submit, along with Senator F
EINSTEIN of California, one of these helpful management provi-sions to better use existing dams in our drought-stricken States. These dams

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S315 January 28, 2016 
are critical to water management in the West. We have to store water, obvi-ously, in dry times. The Western United States relies on dams to produce clean, renewable hydropower, to deliver drinking water to growing cities, and to irrigate fields. Because these dams are large and expensive and increasingly difficult to have built, it is imperative that we make the most of those we have already. In a bill introduced last year, Sen-ator F
EINSTEIN included a pilot pro-gram to allow the updating of how flood control operations are conducted at many dams. This very helpful provi-sion allows the use of modern fore-casting tools and better records of hy-drology to reevaluate the flood control operations in order to create additional water storage space. Increased storage space would allow more water to be kept behind the dams, allowing more hydropower to be produced exactly when it is needed. This amendment simply expands on Senator F
EINSTEIN ’s proposal broadening the scope to all drought-stricken States—not just Cali-fornia—increasing the number of projects in the pilot program, and al-lowing more types of facilities to opt into this pilot program. This is a commonsense amendment. It will help us make the most of the ca-pacity we have to store water and to produce hydropower. I urge its adop-tion. I yield back the remainder of my time.

S. 2452 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, there are a lot of things that go on here in our Nation’s capital, Washington, DC, that don’t make sense to me. One of those things occurred about 10 days ago when the Obama administration announced it would pay $1.7 billion to Iran in set-tlement of a financial dispute dating back to the days of the Shah of Iran. That $1.7 billion was a payment to Iran for $400 million that was held in escrow after the Shah’s demise and fall from power, and the remaining $1.3 billion was to pay interest on that $400 mil-lion. I think there are a number of reasons that this makes no sense. I will high-light the one that seems to me to be the least controversial or at least makes the most sense. We have Amer-ican citizens who have claims against Iran. There are actual judgments en-tered by a court of law which deter-mines that the country of Iran owes money to American citizens. The num-ber that I was told that they owe is nearly $10 billion in judgments. What makes no sense to me is that the Obama administration would agree to pay the Iranian Government $1.7 bil-lion without concurrently resolving the issues of what Iran should pay U.S. citizens. It makes no sense to me that we are not withholding the payment of that $1.7 billion until Iran pays Amer-ican citizens the judgment amounts owed to them for their country’s ter-rorist attacks. Why would we unilaterally pay Iran money that we may or may not owe them without resolving the issue of money that we know Iran owes to U.S. citizens? This makes no sense. We could at least have a broader conversa-tion and discussion about this issue, al-though I don’t know that it is nec-essary to go further with a discussion to reach the conclusion that the Obama administration should not be doing this. We could also have a con-versation about whether this payment of $1.7 billion is ransom money. Was it paid because Americans were released from Iranian captivity on the same day? As the largest supporter and funder of terrorism and terrorist activ-ity around the globe, we should have a discussion about whether we should be giving Iran any money at all. We know that part of the Iranian agreement related to nuclear weapons has the United States releasing money to Iran, and we know—in fact, adminis-tration officials have admitted to it— that we expect that money, in part, to be used to sponsor additional terrorist acts. Well, in addition to the flawed, mistaken agreement with Iran related to nuclear capabilities, we are now pro-viding Iran with another $1.7 billion to use as they see fit, presumably with the admitted ability to use that money to further terrorist acts around the globe, including against U.S. citizens. We could discuss whether this is ran-som or whether we should be giving any money to Iran. But on the surface, you don’t need to go further than, in my view, what ought to be easily agreed upon, which is that no money should go to Iran until the claims of American citizens are paid by Iran. I am on the Senate floor to highlight to my colleagues that I have intro-duced legislation exactly to that effect: no money to Iran until the claims are paid to U.S. citizens by Iran. I encour-age my colleagues to consider this leg-islation and join me in its sponsorship. It is S. 2452. I am grateful for the opportunity to bring this issue to the attention of the Senate—one more instance of some-thing that makes no sense to me that could be resolved with a firm state-ment by the U.S. Congress: Mr. Presi-dent, you can’t pay Iran until Iran meets its obligations to pay what it owes U.S. citizens.

UNACCOMPANIED MINORS ENTERING THE UNITED  
STATES  
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, if this sounds like a case of deja vu, it is be-cause we have been here before. I am talking specifically about the flow of unaccompanied minor children coming across our southwestern border, pri-marily through my State—the State of Texas—which shares a 1,200-mile com-mon border with Mexico. As the Presiding Officer knows, these children are coming not from Mexico but from Central America. This is a situation that about a year or so ago the President and his administration called a humanitarian crisis because we had this flow of unaccompanied children and some with their mothers, but mostly without, who came flooding across our border, and we were just simply struggling to keep up with them to deal with their safety, their health needs, and their security needs. At that time we had a discussion about what we should do to protect these children to make sure they weren’t victimized by human traf-fickers and other predators who might prey on their vulnerability when they get to the United States. Indeed, this morning, under the leadership of Chair-man P
ORTMAN from Ohio, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Inves-tigations held a hearing to explore a disturbing and tragic problem related to this flow of unaccompanied children coming across our Nation’s southern border. After these children are apprehended by the Border Patrol, they are placed in the hands of the Department of Health and Human Services to ensure they receive proper care. Many of these children are recovering from abuse, ex-ploitation, exhaustion, exposure from this incredible trip they would make from their country in Central America through Mexico into the United States, many on the back of a train system known colloquially as The Beast. Many of us have seen pictures of this train with people on top of it, not nec-essarily inside of it, and falling off, being injured, people being assaulted. It is a terrible experience. So many of these children come to the United States recovering from abuse and exploitation after traveling more than 1,000 miles. This is a very important point: These are not good people who are bringing them here. They are part of a transnational crimi-nal organization—the cartels in Mex-ico, the gangs who help distribute drugs, traffic in human beings, help fa-cilitate illegal immigration. This has become a huge international business. If you ask almost anybody who has had any experience in this area, it is not like the old days when coyotes, as we call them in Texas and elsewhere, smuggled people across in onesies and twosies. These are people who smuggle a lot of people for the money they are able to generate. They, frankly, don’t care about the individuals, but they do care about the money, and that is why they are in the business of smuggling these children from Central America across Mexico and into the United States. Here is the immediate problem that Senator PORTMAN ’s Subcommittee on Investigations revealed: Because the U.S. Government—the Department of Health and Human Services—does not adequately vet the sponsors with whom these children are placed once they come into the United States—we know, for example, they admit these sponsors do not have to be American citizens. They don’t even have to be family members. Shockingly, Health and Human Services is releasing many of these children to sponsors who have been convicted of serious crimes, in-cluding human trafficking, sexual ex-ploitation, and violent offenses. Instead of using commonsense proce-dures as we see in place, for example, in international adoptions, including extensive background checks, thorough interviews, and multiple home visits to make sure a child is being placed in a safe and secure situation, the place-ment process for these migrant chil-dren is riddled with loopholes for those who want to exploit it, and unfortu-nately there are evil people who want to exploit it and take advantage of these innocent children. Some who may not have been fol-lowing this issue may wonder: Why are we taking these children who are ille-gally entering the country and actu-ally placing them with nonfamily member sponsors who haven’t been vet-ted? The problem is that under current law, the Border Patrol cannot turn back people who enter the country ille-gally from noncontiguous countries. We can from Mexico, we can from Can-ada, but we can’t if they come from a Central American country. So that is why they have to process them and get a placement for them as they issue a summons to them and say: You have a court date in front of an immigration judge in 3 months or 6 months or a year that is going to determine whether you have a legal basis upon which to stay in the United States. Lo and behold, this should come as a surprise to no one. The vast majority of these people who illegally enter the country in this way never show up for their immigration hearing in front of a judge to determine whether they have a legal basis to stay. Indeed, because the Obama administration and ICE— Immigration and Customs Enforcement that is responsible for enforcing our immigration laws—because they sim-ply have quit enforcing our laws once people enter the country, unless of course you have been arrested for some serious crime, this is actually a way to thread the needle and to beat the sys-tem and to succeed in illegally stay-ing—immigrating and then staying in the United States. Here again today I wish to focus on once these children are here, and I would think every person with a heart would want to say: Well, we have a re-sponsibility to take care of them, at least until we can return them back home. So I am grateful to the junior Sen-ator from Ohio, Mr. PORTMAN , for dedi-cating his time and energy into inves-tigating such an important issue. I commend him for his leadership in doing so in a bipartisan way. I think most of us can agree with the main point that he raised this morning, which is that the administration has a duty to ensure the safety of these chil-dren once they are in the country. I would hope all people of good will would agree, whether they have a legal duty or not, they have a moral obliga-tion to make sure these children are safe and not place them, because of negligence or inadvertence or just recklessness, in the hands of people who will exploit them and abuse them. The subcommittee also released an important report in conjunction with this morning’s hearing after a months- long investigation. The report confirms that HHS placement policies are—sur-prise—wholly insufficient and fail to adequately screen sponsors. They know they have a problem. They just don’t have the will to do anything about it. This is unacceptable. This is unac-ceptable that Health and Human Serv-ices knows its own placement process does not even come close to foster care or international adoption standards. For the safety and protection of these children, the status quo cannot con-tinue. I hope somebody will ask the Presi-dent of the United States about this, because when we tried to pass a piece of legislation called the HUMANE Act to deal explicitly with this issue to raise the screening standards for spon-sors here in the United States for these unaccompanied children, the adminis-tration and the President of the United States opposed it, and this is what they get. This is what they get—certainly not what they deserve. This is some-thing anybody could have predicted and indeed did predict at the time if we did nothing to address it. So what these children need now, as Senator P
ORTMAN ’s report suggests, is certainly a more transparent process with robust oversight. That sounds kind of bureaucratic, but what we need is somebody who can make sure that no child is placed with somebody who is going to abuse them, exploit them or make their life a living hell while they are here. We also need to make sure they are given an opportunity to ap-pear in front of an immigration judge because maybe they have some legal

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S317 January 28, 2016 
basis upon which to claim a right to stay in the United States under current law—but maybe not—and maybe the proper recourse is for these children to be returned to their home country. We have had this experience before, where there is no enforcement of our immi-gration laws when people know they can penetrate our border and come here and successfully stay, even though they don’t comply with the law. Our laws lose all deterrent value; in other words, where there is deterrence, peo-ple don’t come in the first place be-cause they realize the likelihood is that they will be unsuccessful. That is an important goal of law enforcement. It is not necessarily to deal with every case once it is on our doorstep, but ac-tually we want to deter people from breaking the law in the first place. That is why enforcement is so impor-tant. So I wanted to come to the floor and express my appreciation to Senator P
ORTMAN and his subcommittee for highlighting this issue but even more importantly to make sure that some-how, some way, somebody in the press, in the media is going to keep writing about this and exposing the facts. I hope we can reawaken the conscience of the Congress and the U.S. Govern-ment and say that this is simply unac-ceptable and we can work together to address it. We must do more to protect these children who are vulnerable to exploi-tation. Back in November I joined the chairman of the Judiciary Committee in a letter to the Secretary of Home-land Security and Health and Human Services. This was in response to a whistleblower who indicated those De-partments were releasing unaccom-panied children to criminal sponsors, many with ties to sex trafficking and human smuggling enterprises. Unfortunately, recent news reports have just reinforced how broken the system is. Earlier this week, the Wash-ington Post published an indepth ac-count of several young Guatemalan children who were smuggled to a farm in Ohio to be used as slave labor after authorities released them from human traffickers. So these children from Guatemala went from being trafficked to being basically indentured servants for slave labor in Ohio. Instead of keep-ing them in protective custody in an HHS shelter or placing them in a suit-able safe environment, these children were reportedly forced to live in roach- infested trailers and their lives were threatened if they attempted to escape. This is a gut-wrenching story, but it is only one story. This Senator dares to say that the U.S. Government, Health and Human Services, and the Obama administration can’t tell us how many other children have been exposed to such terrible abuse and mistreatment. We are now learning that these stories are not uncommon. Of course, given the process by which Health and Human Services and the administra-tion place these children—not with American citizens, not with even fam-ily members without vetting them— what else would be expected? The Associated Press recently re-ported similar stories from across the country, including accounts of teens forced to work around the clock just to stay in a safe place to live. One young girl was reportedly locked inside her house, basically kept in a prison, and there are reports of some unaccom-panied children who had been sexually assaulted by their sponsors. With more than 95,000 unaccom-panied children crossing our southern border illegally over the last 2 years, these reports likely only scratch the surface of the horrors these children are enduring. And it is not over. There are more coming every day. Indeed, we have seen that the peaks and valleys of the flow of unaccompanied children across the border are seasonal. As we get out of the winter and into the warmer months, we will continue to see these children flow across at higher levels than they are now. But there were 95,000 in the past 2 years. This surge of children coming across our border has exposed our Nation’s vulnerability to human smugglers and these transnational criminal organiza-tions. It has shown that inadequate border security can contribute to a hu-manitarian crisis that endangers the lives of the children who are turned over by their parents to dangerous predators and smuggled into the United States. Let’s be clear on this point. Once these children arrive in the United States, our government has a duty to protect them and ensure they are no longer preyed upon by criminals and traffickers. But then we have a respon-sibility to make sure that if they can’t legally stay in the United States be-cause they have no valid claim to asy-lum or refugee status—our laws need to be enforced until those laws are changed by Congress. The United States could see a new surge of these children pouring across our southern border in the coming months. In fact, I will predict here today that we will. We know from his-torical trends that these types of surges are not likely until the spring or summer months. We shouldn’t just stand around here or sit on our hands and ignore this growing crisis. There is a legislative response that I would recommend to my colleagues. I was proud to sponsor a piece of legisla-tion last Congress called the Helping Unaccompanied Alien Minors and Alle-viating National Emergency Act, or the HUMANE Act in short. This legis-lation would require all potential spon-sors of unaccompanied children to un-dergo a rigorous biometric criminal history check. Let’s check to make sure the government is not placing these kids with known criminals. There are records we could easily dis-cover if we just bothered to check those records and to make sure we don’t inadvertently place these chil-dren in the hands of sex offenders or people who will merely traffic them to someone else. Given the clear threat these children face and the anecdotes which I have de-scribed here and which are described in horrific fashion in Senator PORTMAN ’s report, it is irresponsible for us not to do something about this while we can. There is more we can do and should do to ensure that these children are treat-ed safely and securely while they are with us. I believe the provisions of my legislation would be a good start. If anybody has a better idea, I am cer-tainly willing to hear and work with them. Before we see another humanitarian crisis of huge proportion of young chil-dren coming across our borders, I hope the Senate will take a look at the con-cerns exposed in the Permanent Sub-committee on Investigations report led by Senator P
ORTMAN . I look forward to reintroducing the HUMANE Act soon as a way to at least in part begin the process of addressing this new humanitarian crisis in the making. Mr. President, I see no one wishing to speak, so I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. C
AS-
SIDY). Without objection, it is so or-dered. Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, this morning I discussed two amendments that I have submitted in regard to the current energy legislation, the Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2015. I would like to talk about a third amendment that I submitted as well. The amendment actually follows legis-lation that I introduced earlier entitled the ‘‘empower States amendment.’’ Essentially what the ‘‘empower States’’ legislation does is it ensures that States retain the right to manage oil and gas production in their respec-tive State. It gives them the ability to develop hydraulic fracturing rules and to respond first to any violation that might occur, rather than having a Fed-eral one-size-fits-all approach. This is very important, because how we produce oil and gas in States such as North Dakota is very different than how we might produce oil and gas in a State like Louisiana, for example, or some other State. So States have to have the flexibility to respond to their industry to provide regulatory cer-tainty and to empower that investment that will help us produce more energy and do it with good environmental stewardship. This amendment also allows States to regulate oil and gas development on Bureau of Land Management lands if the State has laws and regulations in place to protect both public health and the environment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES318 January 28, 2016 
As I said, it takes a States-first ap-proach because individual States are the first and best responders to oil and gas issues. They know their land, their geology, their water resources, and they have a primary stake in pro-tecting their environment and their citizens. States such as North Dakota have been successful in developing oil and gas production with good environ-mental stewardship. Right now our State produces about 1.2 million bar-rels of oil a day, second only to the State of Texas. With that growth in development, our industry has had to work very closely with the State of North Dakota on a whole gamut of issues that are vi-tally important—not only, as I said a minute ago, in terms of producing more energy but doing it with good en-vironmental stewardship. So that is what this legislation is all about. At the same time, this amendment provides a safety net that allows the Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, to step in if there is a danger to health or the environment. Again, it is about making sure that States have the primary role, but it still recognizes the EPA’s role as well in terms of pro-tecting the environment and good stewardship. States would still be subject to the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act. These Federal laws have minimum standards for all States, and those minimum standards ensure con-sistent protection between and among the States for both the public and the environment. Surface water is protected under the EPA’s Clean Water Act surface water quality standards. Drinking water is protected by the Safe Drinking Water Act, which allows the EPA to act if a contaminant is present or likely will enter an underground drinking water source. Hydraulic fracturing wastewater is regulated by the EPA’s underground injection program, which is designated to the States to implement and en-force. That is what we are talking about, again—the State having the pri-mary role in regulation of hydraulic fracturing. The EPA requires a State to have a minimum requirement in terms of pro-tecting underground injection from en-dangering drinking water sources. This concludes inspection, monitoring, rec-ordkeeping, and reporting require-ments. None of those requirements would change under this amendment. Instead, this amendment gives the States and tribes more certainty about under what circumstances the EPA may withdraw or amend a State’s regu-lation. Again, it is about making sure we have the regulatory certainty out there that actually empowers the very investment that helps us produce more energy and do it with good environ-mental stewardship. It ensures that if the EPA does decide to intervene, it must show that its action is necessary and that the decision takes into ac-count factors such as job loss and en-ergy supplies. It will help States retain the right to regulate hydraulic fracturing within their borders. That makes sense, as I say, because States are the first and best responders to oil and gas issues and have been successful in developing oil and gas production regulations. It would also allow a State to regu-late hydraulic fracturing on Federal lands, such as BLM lands, as I men-tioned earlier. In addition, though, the amendment would prohibit new bur-densome Federal rules if a State or tribe already has those rules in place. Again, the effort here is to make sure that we are empowering States to work with their industry and then, in turn, empowering those industries, through regulatory certainty, to help develop our energy future in this country and do it with good, consistent, common-sense regulation that empowers the kind of investment that we want to see for job creation and economic growth. Finally, the amendment allows for judicial review. It allows a State or tribe to seek redress for an agency’s ac-tions in a Federal court located within the State or the District of Columbia. Judicial review is very important in case there is a dispute in terms of what the EPA may require, what the State may require or what the industry feels is fair treatment. In conclusion, the legislation recog-nizes that States have a long record of effectively regulating oil and gas devel-opment, including hydraulic frac-turing, with good environmental stew-ardship. The measure works to ensure that the rules for hydraulic fracturing are certain, fair, effective, and environ-mentally sound. These are qualities we expect in good regulation. As I said at the outset this morning in introducing a number of these amendments, to build the kind of en-ergy plan for the future that we need we have to reduce the regulatory bur-den and at the same time empower the investment that will help us build the energy infrastructure we need to move energy safely and cost-effectively from where it is produced to where it is con-sumed in this country. With that, I look forward to working with both the chairman of our Energy and Natural Resources Committee, who is bringing this legislation forward, and the ranking member in offering these amendments, voting on these and other amendments, and trying to get to the best product we can in terms of strengthening the energy plan for this country. With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. REMEMBERING SUSAN JORDAN  
Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I come here during a sad time for Hoosiers. The beloved principal of Amy Beverland Elementary School in Law-rence Township, in the Indianapolis area, was seeing her students off after a day of school. A bus came around the corner to pick up the kids and acciden-tally lost control. The principal of Amy Beverland Elementary School, Susan Jordan, saw the bus coming, saw that it was going to hit the students, and put herself in front of them, and saved the lives of her young students. Two were injured seriously but will re-cover, but Principal Susan Jordan lost her life in doing this. The situation is still under investigation, but all ele-ments and indications point to this as simply a tragic accident. This story is not just one of tragedy, it is also one of heroism. As I said be-fore, the bus struck her as Principal Jordan pushed several of her students out of harm’s way. The principal, who came out of her office at school every day to help the students safely board the buses, lost her life in doing so. Those who knew her well—said that was not a surprising act. ‘‘It didn’t sur-prise any of us Susan would sacrifice herself,’’ said the district adminis-trator for Lawrence Township. Shawn Smith, superintendent of the Lawrence Township schools, called Principal Jor-dan ‘‘a legend’’ and said that ‘‘we lost a great educator.’’ Susan Jordan served as principal of the school for 22 years. She was known for her cheery disposition and wel-comed each classroom every morning. The Gospel of John tells us that ‘‘greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.’’ The love that Susan Jordan had for her students should be an inspiration to us all. We offer our deepest condolences to Principal Jordan’s family and friends, to the students who were injured and their parents, and to all parents and students of the school. I know I join with all Hoosiers in mourning her loss and celebrating the life and impact of this talented, compassionate educator who paid the ultimate price for the stu-dents she loved so dearly. 
WASTEFUL SPENDING  
Mr. President, I rise to address some-thing I have been doing on a weekly basis called ‘‘Waste of the Week.’’ This is No. 31 of my visits down here to the floor to talk about the egregious waste, fraud, and abuse in spending by the Federal Government. We hear so often that we just can’t cut another penny, we just can’t cut another dime out of this program be-cause they have been subject to freezes or they have been subject to sequester, and, besides, we don’t have the money to pay for it. Well, I have been high-lighting small steps—because we haven’t been able to achieve the big steps—small steps of ways that we can save taxpayer money and address Fed-eral spending. So I have come down

every week, and put up the board ‘‘Waste of the Week,’’ and this week deals with a situation, once again, where we don’t need to be in a position to spend taxpayers’ dollars on what was already being done. The Amtrak Police Department and the Drug Enforcement Administration participate in a joint task force that works to interdict passengers who are trafficking contraband on Amtrak trains. Amtrak information is avail-able to the Drug Enforcement Agency at no cost from the Amtrak Police De-partment—two agencies that are work-ing together. But despite this agree-ment, the DEA wasted hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars paying just two Amtrak employees to do ex-actly what this task force was formed to do. So we have a task force of paid employees who are there for a specific purpose—providing information to DEA. The DEA says this is important information, but the task force also uses informants. These are people who work for Amtrak on the trains, and some of the information they provide is valuable. According to an investigation by the Justice Department’s inspector gen-eral, the DEA paid two Amtrak em-ployees a total of—are you ready for this? Are you sitting down? Two paid Amtrak employees are getting a sal-ary, they work for Amtrak, The DEA paid them a total of $864,161 for infor-mation they have been providing to Amtrak and then giving to the DEA. The information probably was impor-tant, but over a period of 20 years, these payments went out to just two employees, this $864,000-plus. The IG’s investigation concluded that when DEA officials sought ap-proval to register these Amtrak em-ployees as informants in the DEA’s Confidential Source Program, the re-quired documents did not indicate that these informants would be paid. Let me stop for a minute and say that confidential sources are an impor-tant tool for our law enforcement agen-cies. Officials at the DEA actively use confidential informants to obtain in-formation regarding drug trafficking or investigations. Some DEA officials have said they consider the informa-tion the confidential sources provide as the ‘‘bread and butter’’ of the agency. My point today is not to question the use of confidential sources but to point out that Federal agencies like the DEA don’t need to pay for information they already have access to. This is a waste of taxpayer dollars and poor steward-ship of limited resources that fall in the category of ‘‘waste of the week.’’ Twenty years of the DEA paying for information that they were already supposed to receive at no cost without a second thought indicates a serious, systemic spending problem that spans multiple parties and Presidents. We must pull the plug on this type of waste. So today I add an additional $864,161 to the taxpayer price tag for this already free information from Am-trak employees. We continue to add more, our gauge continues to rise, and we now are well over $130 billion of waste, fraud, and abuse. So let no one come down to this floor and say we can’t take a penny away from this program or come down to the floor and say we don’t have the money to pay for things that we ought to do or to return to the taxpayer. I am try-ing to show that government can be run much more efficiently and effec-tively. I applaud the inspectors general and others who are looking into this waste, but I want to bring to my colleagues’ attention the fact that we have a lot of work to do, chipping away at this spending and waste and also looking at long-term, major financial fixes to our ever-careening plunge into debt and deficit.

REMEMBERING THE CREWMEMBERS OF THE  
SPACE SHUTTLE ‘‘CHALLENGER ’’, THE SPACE  
SHUTTLE ‘‘COLUMBIA ’’, AND‘‘APOLLO 1 ’’ 
Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, 30 years ago today, it was very cold in Florida at the Kennedy Space Center. Both pads had been readied for the first time—a space shuttle on 39A and 39B— since the Space Shuttle Columbia, which was the 24th flight, was so late getting off the ground—indeed, for the better part of the month, from the first start and four scrubs starting Decem-ber 19 but finally launching after the fifth try into a flawless 6-day mission on January 12, to return to Earth on January 18. In the meantime, on the other space shuttle launch pad, Chal-lenger—the 25th flight—is being read-ied. The night before the day of the launch, which is 30 years ago today, it was exceptionally cold in Florida. It got down to 25 degrees. Indeed, there were actually icicles hanging on the launch tower. As the crew arrived in the early morning hours—and there were holds all the way up until a little bit past 11 o’clock. At this point, the temperature had improved to 36 de-grees. The icicles were still there, but it was above freezing. There was con-siderable consternation throughout the entire apparatus of NASA and its con-tractors—particularly the top man-agers, as well as the managers of the company that made the solid rocket boosters—as to whether there should be a launch, and the go was given. Seventy-three seconds high into the sky above Florida, Challenger disinte-grated. To a nation that had come to think that climbing in the space shut-tle was like getting in your car and taking a Sunday afternoon drive, in-deed this was quite a shock because the entire technological prowess of the country 30 years ago was summed up in this magnificent flying machine that would go to orbit and would come back and would take 45,000 pounds of pay-load to orbit and would come back and land like an airplane, albeit without an engine. But that morning, it was to be different. The only other astronauts we had lost were in getting ready for the Apol-lo program to go to the Moon. On the pad, in just a countdown test of the Apollo capsule—and the environment was an oxygen-rich environment. One of the three astronauts doing the prac-tice countdown happened to kick a part of the spacecraft that had a wire that set an ignition, and in that oxy-gen-enriched environment, fire en-gulfed and claimed the lives of Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chafee. All those years when we did not even know what was going to happen when we went into space—when we launched John Glenn on that Atlas rocket that we knew had a 20-percent chance of failure—we didn’t know enough about the human body in zero gravity and at those speeds to know what was going to happen to the human body. In all those years of experimentation and going to the Moon many times—even on the ill-fated Apollo 13 where we thought we had three dead men in the Apollo capsule when that explosion oc-curred en route to the Moon, and yet miraculously this space industry and NASA apparatus came together and figured out real-time how to get them back and get them back safely, a crew headed by Jim Lovell. But it was not to be on the morning of January 28, 1986. I have a scale model of 1 to 100 of the space shuttle, and I want to explain what happened that morning. As Chal-lenger launched, it went through its se-quence where they had to throttle back on the main engines as they went through part of the atmosphere getting maximum dynamic pressure, and then those famous words that came back from the crew that they were acknowl-edging: Go at throttle up. The three main engines ignited a burning in the tail of the space shuttle, fueled by liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen contained in the external fuel tank.

solid fuel. It has the consistency of the eraser on this pencil. Those ignite at T minus zero, each with about 3 million pounds of thrust. You definitely know you are going somewhere. But the cold weather had dealt us a devil’s brew that day. These joints where they put together the solid rocket booster are sealed with a rubberized gasket, and those rubber O-rings, because of the cold weather, had gotten stiff and brit-tle to the point at which it just so hap-pened that at a point close to the ex-ternal tank, the hot gases of thrust, in-stead of coming out the nozzle in the tail of the solid rocket booster, are coming out because the joint is not sealed because of that rubberized O- ring that has now become stiff and brittle from the cold weather, and the hot gases burned into the external tank, and that caused the explosion that all of us remember. That was played over and over on our television screens. That was what was such a shock to the American people. Those seven souls—led by Dick Scobee as the mission commander, a test pilot; and by Mike Smith, the pilot in NASA terminology, the copilot, a test pilot; Christa McAuliffe, the schoolteacher from New Hampshire; Greg Jarvis, a payload specialist; Judy Resnik, a mission specialist; Ron McNair, a mission specialist; and Elli-son Onizuka, a mission specialist— those seven souls perished as all of the explosion fell miles and miles down to the surface waters of the ocean and eventually the debris on the floor of the ocean. There is a dramatic presentation at the Kennedy Space Center in the Atlantis exhibit showing a part of the Challenger, and I would urge anybody who goes to the Kennedy Space Center to go and see that. It is a very moving exhibit. It is an exhibit about the crew. That exhibit is not only about the Challenger, which was 30 years ago, that exhibit is about the next space shuttle that we lost. That was some 16, 17 years later, and it was on February 1, 2003. It was the Space Shuttle Colum-bia, the one that had launched just pre-vious to the Challenger and the one on which this Senator was privileged to be a part of the crew, but this time it was destroyed for a different reason. It had launched a couple of weeks earlier and everything was fine, or so we thought, but it was not to be. During the launch, the external fuel tank that was car-rying the very cold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen—in order to keep that cold, it is surrounded with insulation— had part of its insulation break off. It is about the size of an insulated Styrofoam tub. It is about this big, and that small piece of insulation broke off right here as Columbia was on ascent. As it accelerated and the speeds be-came very high, that piece of foam fell with high velocity right at the leading edge of the left wing. That is a carbon- carbon fiber very light in weight but very resistant to heat. Upon reentry, the front engines of the wing and the tip of the nose, all carbon-carbon fiber, get up to 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Of course everything was fine at that mo-ment, even though there was a hole in the left leading edge of the wing during Columbia’s 8
1⁄2-minute ascent into orbit. When it was time to go home on Feb-ruary 1, this crew of seven was about to meet their fate. As they were doing their deorbit burn, falling through space for half an hour and encoun-tering the upper reaches of the atmos-phere, the hot gases got in the leading edge of the wing—the orbiter had sepa-rated and was flying more like an air-plane on descent—and heated it up, causing Columbia to burn up upon re-entry. As a result, debris fell for miles and miles high over Texas. Rick Husband, the commander; Willie McCool, the pilot; Mike Ander-son, payload commander; David Brown, mission specialist; Kalpana Chawla, mission specialist; Laurel Clark, mis-sion specialist; and Ilan Ramon, pay-load specialist. As the test pilot and hero of the Israeli Air Force that led the strike on Saddam Hussein’s nuclear plant outside of Baghdad, Ilan Ramon had been chosen to fly on the space shuttle. I remember when I met with the former President of Israel, Shimon Peres, the day before the reentry. He knew of my background, and he said: I want you to see this telecommuni-cation that I got from Ilan Ramon. It said: Mr. President, on behalf of the Israeli people, I want to thank you for giving me this opportunity. The fact that you and then President Clinton have enabled me to be able to start in this astronaut program and fly in this mission is just incredible. President Peres shared how that was so meaningful to him only a few hours before Columbia did its deorbit burn and went into the pages of history. So it is with a heavy heart that I come to the Senate floor on the 30th anniversary of the Challenger tragedy to pay tribute to the Challenger crew and also to the Columbia crew. It is sol-emn, but what they and the Apollo 1 as-tronauts sacrificed—and what so many other astronauts in training have sac-rificed through training mishaps—is not forgotten and it is not in vain be-cause we are going to Mars. It is not going to look like this be-cause we learned our lesson. This was a fantastic flying machine, but it was an inherently risky design because the crew in the orbiter is on the same side as the stack of explosives, which re-sulted in two terrible tragedies that oc-curred. The new American rockets that will fly in September of 2017—in less than 2 years—to and from the Inter-national Space Station look like they have gone back to the old Apollo de-sign, but, in fact, the new rockets have updated crew compartments in the spacecraft that will sit on the top of the rocket so that in the event of an explosion, even on the pad or all the way into orbit, you can save the lives of the crew by detaching the explosive rockets from the spacecraft and get-ting them safely away from the explo-sion. It will save the crew either by landing under its own power or having parachutes that will let it down gently. The fact is that by our nature we are explorers and adventurers, and we never want to give that up. It is a part of our DNA, it is a part of our char-acter, and it is a part of our vision. We used to go westward as we developed this country into that new frontier. Now we will continue to go upward. We are going to Mars in the 2030s, and that is going to be a great day in that dec-ade. You will see us build on that in 2 years. Americans will have launches on new spacecrafts which will be on the top of rockets and in 3 years a full-up test of the largest rocket ever put to-gether by mankind on the face of this planet, the space launch system and its spacecraft, Orion. It will have its first up test flight in 2018. So in the memory of the Challenger crew, the Columbia crew, and the Apollo 1 crew, we stand on their shoulders as we continue to explore the heavens. We thank them for their courage, their sacrifice, and their pioneering spirit. That is what I wanted to share on this 30th anniversary of the tragedy of the Space Shuttle Challenger. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Wisconsin. Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks, Senator B

STUDENT DEBT CRISIS  
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today because I think that higher education should be a path to prosperity, not a path to suffocating debt; however, today in America we have a student debt crisis that de-mands action from Washington because it is holding back an entire generation and creating an economic drag on the growth of our country. Unfortunately, the Republican ma-jority here in the Senate continues to ignore this crisis at a time when we really should be working across the party aisle to put in reforms that make college more affordable for students and their families who are struggling and in desperate need of action. That is why last week Senate Democrats offi-cially launched our ‘‘In the Red’’ cam-paign in order to confront the student debt crisis and address college afford-ability. Our legislative reform package in-cludes three commonsense initiatives that deserve to be debated and deserve a vote. First, we are calling for action to address the significant loss in value of Pell grants by adjusting them for in-flation; second, we are pushing to allow borrowers to refinance their existing student loans at lower rates; and third, we are making 2 years of community college or technical school free for stu-dents who are willing to work for it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S321 January 28, 2016 
In his State of the Union Address— not the one he gave a couple of weeks ago but the one he gave last January in 2015—President Obama called on us here in Congress to make a bold invest-ment in our Nation’s students, in our Nation’s workforce, and in the future of our economy by making 2 years of community college free. In July, I answered that call and in-troduced legislation, the America’s College Promise Act, aimed at pro-viding students with a stronger and more affordable opportunity to gain the skills they need to compete, suc-ceed, and prosper by making an invest-ment in our workforce readiness, our economy, and our future. I am proud that this legislation is a pillar of the Senate Democrats’ effort to reduce stu-dent debt in 2016 and to put our coun-try on a path toward debt-free college. Learning from successes in States such as Tennessee and Oregon, the Amer-ica’s College Promise Act will create a new partnership between the Federal Government and States to help them waive resident tuition for 2 years of community or technical college pro-grams for eligible students. This new partnership will provide a Federal match of $3 for every $1 invested by the State to waive community college tui-tion and fees for eligible students. With this legislation, a full-time community college student could save an average of around $3,800 in tuition per year. As cochair of the Senate’s career and technical education caucus, I am espe-cially proud that this reform takes a critical step to strengthen workforce readiness at a time when America needs to out educate and compete with the rest of the world in a 21st century skills-based economy. The idea that the next generation will be able to go further and do better than the last is at the heart of the American dream, and the solutions that we are offering today deserve a vote in this Congress. It is my hope that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will join us in confronting the student debt crisis and supporting these commonsense re-forms that not only make higher edu-cation affordable but can help give more Americans a fair shot at pursuing their dreams. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield back my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Ohio. Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank Senator B
ALDWIN , especially for her terrific work on higher education. She knows the value of higher education to the residents of Wisconsin, Louisiana, and Ohio. I ask unanimous consent that after my remarks, the next speaker be Sen-ator R
EEDof Rhode Island. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AWARENESS DAY  
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, tomor-row is Earned Income Tax Credit Awareness Day—a day, as we approach the tax season, for getting the word out about this tax credit that is a lifeline for working families. The EITC provides an incentive to work. It puts thousands of dollars back into the pockets of low-wage and mod-erate-wage workers every year. Presi-dent Reagan called it ‘‘the best anti- poverty measure to come out of Con-gress.’’ The work that Senator REEDand oth-ers and I did on the earned-income tax credit this year to permanently expand it was called by some organizations the most important anti-poverty initia-tive, except for the Affordable Care Act, in the last 20 years that Congress has done. Last year 27 million American house-holds—950,000 households just in my State alone, in Ohio—claimed the EITC and received an average refund of $2,400. So for somebody making $15,000 or $20,000 or $30,000 a year, when they file their taxes in February or March, they literally can get a check from the Federal Government, on average—I am not promising everybody specific amounts because each situation is dif-ferent—on average, they will get a check for $2,400. One of the best things this body did last year was to permanently expand the earned-income tax credit, but there is still more we need to do. There is one glaring hole in the program we need to fix. Under current law—back up a little bit. The earned-income tax credit was aimed primarily at families with chil-dren but not entirely. Under current law, workers without children, some-body making $15,000 a year or some-body making $11 an hour, making $22,000, $23,000 a year but having no children—no spouse, no children—those workers making minimum wage barely receive any earned-income tax credit. Childless workers under 25 don’t qual-ify for these credits at all. That means that a young worker—somebody mak-ing $9 or $10 an hour without children— can actually be taxed deeper into pov-erty. Why is that? Well, if a worker is making $9 an hour working full time— doing their best, not getting paid much—they are paying the payroll tax, the Social Security tax. The taxes they pay actually push them down below the poverty line. Why would we possibly in this country—we say in this body we value work. We say we care about peo-ple who are working hard and playing by the rules and we want them to get ahead, but then we fail to provide that earned-income tax credit and we tax them back below the poverty line. Why would we do that? Part of the reason is that last year when we were successful in expanding the earned-income tax credit permanently, there was resist-ance from some sort of ultraconserva-tives in this body—some tea party Re-publicans—there was resistance to ex-panding it to these workers who are working hard but don’t have children. How are they going to plan families or plan for the future if they are always struggling paycheck to paycheck and get no help? We need to do more to ensure that families who are currently eligible know about the EITC. Right now, even with the discussion—I appreciate the Presiding Officer from Louisiana and his interest in this. I know people in Louisiana, like people in Ohio—not ev-erybody knows about it. One-fifth of families in this country who are eligi-ble, who can claim the earned-income tax credit when they file their taxes, 20 percent of them don’t know and don’t file for it. That means those 20 percent are leaving about $2,000 on the table that they could use to fix their car or pay off a payday loan, buy their kids shoes or maybe occasionally go out to a restaurant once a month and get a nice dinner. With Federal tax filing season open-ing last week, we need to make sure that every American gets as much of her hard-earned money back into her pocket as possible; that every Amer-ican gets as much of his hard-earned money back in his pocket as possible. We need to get the word out about tax credits that working families can claim and the services available to help them get their maximum refund. Fil-ing taxes is complicated, and it can be particularly challenging for families claiming the earned-income tax credit, but getting help doesn’t need to be ex-pensive. Here is how. One tool that is available is the IRS Free File Program. If you go to the irs.gov Web site or, if you live in Ohio, go to the brown.senate.gov Web site and type in your ZIP Code, the com-mercial partners of the IRS offer free brand-name software to individuals and to families with incomes of $62,000 or less. For families claiming the EITC, they can visit what is called the Voluntary Income Tax Assistance—the VITA site—the Voluntary Income Tax Assist-ance site. Go into brown.senate.gov if you live in Ohio or go to irs.gov, type in your ZIP Code, and you can see what VITA sites are available. Someone just told me yesterday they entered their ZIP Code and found out that a VITA site—the Voluntary In-come Tax Assistance site—was within walking distance from her home. Ohio-ans, as I said, can go to my Web site, brown.senate.gov, type in their ZIP Code, and they will find a map and the nearest site. VITA sites are not only free, they are more reliable. The majority of EITC er-rors result from returns filed by paid tax preparers. All VITA volunteers are trained by an organization partnering with the IRS. So if you make less than $60,000 a year, you can go to one of these VITA sites, the Voluntary Income Tax As-sistance sites, and you will find out— they will do your taxes with you for free, and they will find out if you are eligible for the earned-income tax cred-it. If you are eligible for the earned-in-come tax credit this year and you didn’t file, it is possible you can claim your tax credit from calendar year or

tax year 2014 also. So you may get a $3,000 credit this year—a check. You may get another $2,000 for last year. It is money you earned. It is money you earned because you worked hard, you did your best, you maybe only made $25,000 a year, but you are eligible for this tax credit. Millionaires and billionaires and Members of Congress and people who are doing pretty well financially in life, most people like that have an army of lawyers and accountants and people who do their taxes for them, and they claim every possible tax credit, every possible tax deduction, every possible tax advantage they can get. People who fill out their own earned- income tax credit—their own taxes, if they are making $20,000 or $30,000 a year, don’t have that sophistication and don’t have the money to hire those lawyers and accountants, so oftentimes they are not getting every tax credit or every tax deduction they can get. That is why it is so important for people to visit these VITA sites and it is why it is so important that people have that opportunity. We need to ensure that working fami-lies know about the resources available to help them claim their refunds, in-cluding the earned-income tax credit and the child tax credit—refunds that, I repeat, they have earned. We reward work. We give people a little help when they are working hard for low wages. We should raise the minimum wage. We should do some other things. We should push the Department of Labor to move a little faster on its overtime rule so people who are working more than 40 hours are getting time and a half that they have earned. As much as wages have been stagnant in this country, I want to see people who are working hard be able to get ahead and get every advantage they possibly can. This body took a strong stand in De-cember in support of an expanded per-manent earned-income tax credit and a permanent child tax credit. I hope on EITC Awareness Day we will recommit ourselves to doing the same thing this year. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Rhode Island. Mr. REED. Mr. President, first let me commend Senator B
ROWN for his very thoughtful and articulate comments on the earned-income tax credit. Mr. President, I am very glad that the Senate is taking up the issue of en-ergy this week. The bill we are debat-ing takes positive steps forward to en-courage energy efficiency in Federal and commercial buildings, modernize the electric grid, and boost renewable sources of energy. I am particularly pleased that provi-sions I have worked on, on a bipartisan basis with Senators C
OONS and C OL-
LINS, to enhance the Weatherization Assistance Program and the State En-ergy Program are included. These pro-visions improve these programs that help low-income Americans reduce their energy bills by making their homes more energy efficient, and many of these individuals are senior citizens who are day-by-day struggling on fixed incomes, trying to pay not just a heat-ing bill but the grocery bill and many other bills. I have long championed these cost-effective programs that are helping families across my State and across the Nation to provide a warm and safe home while also increasing en-ergy efficiency. Indeed, weatherization to me is one of the most sensible steps. It is in some respects the low-hanging fruit. If we can reduce demand, then we can go a long way not only in terms of our en-ergy situation but also our environ-mental situation. We are here today because of the great work of the Chairwoman, Sen-ator MURKOWSKI , and the Ranking Member, Senator C
ANTWELL . They have done an extraordinary job. I am not surprised, as they are extraordinary Members of this body. I want to per-sonally thank them and commend them for what they have done not just in this effort but in many other efforts. Indeed, I have joined Senator C
ANT-
WELL as a cosponsor of her bill that goes so much further than the current bill on the Senate floor to modernize our current electrical infrastructure and promote greater use of domestic energy and renewable energy. I would like to extend my thanks and com-mendations to both Senators. One area that I believe needs further focus as we move forward is the issue of energy storage. I am glad to be working with my colleague from Ne-vada, Senator H
ELLER , on amendments that support more efficient use of Fed-eral funding for energy storage re-search at the Department of Energy and encourage energy storage usage in public utilities. Advances in energy storage, advances in batteries—and sometimes it is the same thing—can help improve the reli-ability, resiliency, and flexibility of the grid as well as reduce the potential for future rate increases, saving us all money on our utility bills. Senator H
ELLER and I have sub-mitted two amendments that we hope will spur action in this area. One amendment would give the Secretary of Energy the ability to coordinate en-ergy storage research and development projects among the existing programs at DOE to maximize the amount of funding that goes toward research and minimize administrative costs. We feel it does not have that flexibility at the moment. I also joined Senator H
ELLER in offer-ing another amendment, in which he is indeed the lead sponsor, which amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act so industry and State regulators must consider energy storage when making their energy efficiency plans. I also, in addition to these proposals, would like to use this opportunity to encourage greater attention to the fi-nancial impacts of climate change caused by energy consumption. It is clear not only that the SEC needs to do more when it comes to critically re-viewing disclosures being filed by pub-licly traded companies, but also that the SEC’s disclosure industry guides for mining companies and oil and gas companies should be updated to reflect the growing risk of climate change to these companies and, in effect, to their shareholders. That is why I am offering an addi-tional amendment that directs the SEC to update these industry guides as well as to consider and incorporate appro-priate suggestions from the United Na-tions Environment Programme Fi-nance Initiative’s report entitled ‘‘Cli-mate Strategies and Metrics: Exploring Options for Institutional Investors,’’ which was published in 2015. These disclosures are important to institutional investors such as Allianz Global Investors, for example, which is a global diversified active investment manager with $477 billion in assets under management, which has specifi-cally called for ‘‘achieving better dis-closure of the effects of carbon costs on the oil and gas companies.’’ What we are trying to do is respond to the grow-ing demand of investors and share-holders so they can make better judg-ments about their investments. It is also important for us to con-tinue to invest in our energy infra-structure and support cutting-edge technological advancements while ef-fectively monitoring the effects of our energy consumption on our economy and our environment. One way of doing this is once again to have assurances that investors have the knowledge they need to make wise decisions about their investments. All told, this is very responsible and appropriate legislation. We can make improvements. I hope the amendments I have proposed, along with Senator HELLER , can get favorable consider-ation as we move forward. Once again, let me thank Senators M
URKOWSKI and C ANTWELL for extraor-dinary leadership. With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, modern-izing our Nation’s energy policy is vital to protecting our national secu-rity. The bill that we are discussing today advances our Nation’s energy independence and provides for new measures to defend our critical infra-structure. Specifically, cyber threats challenge the security of our Nation and the integrity of our energy infra-structure. This bill will formally intro-duce the foundational principles of cyber security into our Nation’s energy security calculus. However, challenging the Depart-ment of Energy to enhance the cyber security of our Nation’s electric grid is not enough if the Department of En-ergy does not have the requisite cyber experts to fulfill the mission. The amendment I submitted today, amend-ment 3119, will address the gap between the Department of Energy’s mission to

keep our Nation’s energy infrastruc-ture safe from cyber attacks and the Department of Energy’s ability to ac-tually do it. Currently, the bill provides for a 21st Century Energy Workforce Advisory Board composed of nine members. The purpose of this board is to anticipate the needs of the future energy work-force. While the bill requires that the board members be representative of disciplines such as labor organizations, education, and minority parties, no-where does the bill require that a sin-gle member of the board have any background on cyber. My amendment requires the member-ship of the 21st Century Energy Work-force Advisory Board to include rep-resentation from the cyber security discipline. This amendment better po-sitions the advisory board to integrate cyber security into the energy sector’s workforce development strategy for the 21st Century and ultimately pro-vides a mechanism to bring cyber secu-rity expertise to the energy sector. Hardening the electric grid and the Nation’s energy supply chains against cyber security threats is a critical component to protecting our national energy infrastructure. This amendment lays the foundation to ensure that the Department of Energy has the right cyber security experts to defend these vital national security assets. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important amendment. Mr. REED. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
AMBASSADOR NOMINATIONS TO NORWAY AND  
SWEDEN  
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I came to the Senate floor earlier this month to talk about the importance of moving forward on the nominations of the Ambassadors to two important al-lies to the United States of America, and that is Norway and Sweden. These are countries that have been our true friends through many wars. They have been our true friends economically— some of the top investors in America— and they have been countries that are good examples of democracy and good examples of countries that believe in human rights. Yet we have not been able to confirm an ambassador to ei-ther country. I do want to, first of all, say that in the case of Sweden, it has been 462 days since the President nominated Azita Raji to be Ambassador, and in the case of Norway, it has been 853 days since that country has had a U.S. Ambas-sador. I will get to those details. In this case, the nominee is Sam Heins from the State of Minnesota, where, by the way, we have over 1 million people of Scandinavian descent—1.5 million people who do not understand why every major nation in Europe has an ambassador but not these two Scan-dinavian countries. I thank Senator MCCONNELL , the ma-jority leader, and Senator R
EID for their work in trying to advance these nominees to the floor. They have nego-tiated. Senator C
ORKER and Senator C
ARDIN are both supportive of these nominees. I think it is important to note that this is not a typical story of delay. These nominees went through the com-mittee without any objection. They were not controversial, nor are they controversial today. It is a fact that Senator C
RUZhas some issues that are completely unrelated to these nomi-nees but also completely unrelated to Norway and Sweden. The issue is that while Senators do from time to time put temporary holds on nominees, this has gone on too long, and I am hope-ful—in an article today in the Min-neapolis Star Tribune about irked Scandinavians in our State, Senator C
RUZ’s staff has said that they are en-gaged in good-faith discussions with other Senators and have made clear there have been no issues raised with these particular nominees in this story. I think that is very important, and we hope we are going to move for-ward. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent to have printed in the R
ECORD the article from the Minneapolis Star Trib-une. There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows: 
[From the Star Tribune, Jan. 27, 2016] M
INNESOTAN SCANDINAVIANS IRKED AS TED C
RUZBLOCKS AMBASSADOR NOMINEES  (By Allison Sherry) 
NORWAY HAS BEEN WITHOUT AN AMBASSADOR  
FOR MORE THAN 800 DAYS AND SWEDEN TOPS  
400 DAYS WITHOUT A U .S. REPRESENTATIVE  W
ASHINGTON .—Presidential hopeful Sen. Ted Cruz is blocking a vote in the U.S. Sen-ate to confirm the Norwegian and Swedish ambassador nominations. The move by the Texas Republican has an-gered some members of Minnesota’s sizable Scandinavian communities, as Norway has been without an ambassador for more than 800 days and Sweden tops 400 days without a U.S. representative. Staffers from Cruz’s office didn’t say any-thing negative about the people appointed by President Obama to the posts, including Nor-way ambassador nominee Sam Heins from Minnesota. Cruz has continued to block the nominees as he has worked to build support for another initiative that is putting him at odds with the White House. Cruz, who is critical of the Chinese govern-ment, has lobbied his Senate colleagues to rename a street in Washington, D.C., after a polarizing Chinese dissident—an idea that has been thwarted by fears of crippling diplo-matic efforts between the two countries. ‘‘Senator Cruz remains engaged in good- faith discussions with his colleagues regard-ing the holds he announced because of his se-rious concerns about the Obama administra-tion’s foreign policy,’’ said Cruz spokesman Phil Novack. The White House renewed its calls for a swift vote on the ambassador nominees. ‘‘The president has nominated two unques-tionably qualified individuals to be the U.S. ambassadors to Sweden and Norway,’’ said White House press secretary Eric Schultz. ‘‘We urge the Senate to act.’’ Minnesotans closely watching the issue are angered by the delay, saying it is souring re-lations with two staunch U.S. allies. ‘‘There’s a crisis in a relationship between our two countries,’’ said Bruce Karstadt, president and CEO of the Minneapolis-based American Swedish Institute. ‘‘I don’t really quite understand that any statement is being made other than we’re ignoring you.’’ Cruz’s office says he remains in negotia-tions about lifting the procedural blocks on the nominations, citing a July 2015 letter to the Obama administration outlining con-cerns about the Iran nuclear deal as one of the reasons he is objecting to political ap-pointments. Since that letter, though, two political ap-pointments—state appointees to Barbados and the U.N. Economic Council—have passed the Senate without Cruz’s hold. Temporary holds are relatively common and are also used by Democrats to protest administration policy. Earlier this week, for example, Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Ed-ward Markey placed a hold on Obama’s nominee to head the Food and Drug Admin-istration unless the administration agrees to reform its process for approving painkiller medications. Cruz’s protests delaying votes on the Scan-dinavian ambassador nominations irks Democratic U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who points out that Minnesota is home to the second-largest number of Norwegians in the world, outside of Norway. The two nominees passed through the GOP-controlled Senate Foreign Relations Committee, so Klobuchar wants a vote on the Senate floor even if Cruz votes against them. Klobuchar points out the business relation-ships between the countries and that Norway and Sweden have shouldered much of the burden of the European refugee crisis in re-cent years. ‘‘It’s no way to treat your friends,’’ she said. ‘‘The point is all these other European nations have ambassadors. Why would you put a hold on two of our best allies from having ambassadors?’’ Democratic U.S. Sen. Al Franken said he also would increase pressure for a vote. ‘‘We need to move on ambassador openings for both Norway—where there’s a highly quali-fied Minnesota nominee who has yet to be confirmed—and Sweden,’’ Franken said. ‘‘I’m going to continue pressing to get these posi-tions filled.’’ Norway and Sweden are two of the largest investors in the U.S. economy. Norway is in-vested in more than 2,100 American compa-nies, which amounts to about $175 billion. It also has about $94 billion in U.S. bonds and $5 billion worth of U.S. real estate. Mean-while, the U.S. exports $9 billion in goods and services to Sweden, a country that sup-ports about 330,000 American jobs annually, embassy officials said. Leif Trana, a minister counselor at the Norwegian Embassy in Washington, pointed out that his country just committed to 52 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin—all of them made at a Lockheed plant in Cruz’s home state of Texas. ‘‘Norwegians have long had a great affinity for the United States,’’ Trana said. ‘‘After the E.U., this is our place where most Nor-wegians both travel to [and] study.’’ The Norwegian post has been a beleaguered one for years. President Obama first nominated business-man George Tsunis, a New York contributor who had raised more than $1 million in cam-paign cash for him. Tsunis quickly proved unqualified for the job. During an appear-ance before the Senate Foreign Relations

Committee, Tsunis referred to Norway’s prime minister as ‘‘president’’ and could not identify potential U.S. trade opportunities with Norway. One member of the Norwegian parliament was so offended by Tsunis that he demanded an apology from Obama. Minnesota’s delegation, led by the Demo-crats, urged Obama to withdraw the nomina-tion. He did, and in May 2015 he nominated Heins, a Minnesota lawyer and human rights advocate. Heins, too, was a major contrib-utor and bundler for the president’s election campaigns. For the Sweden post, Obama nominated Azita Raji, an Iranian-born former Wall Street executive. Her nomination has been mostly uncontroversial and passed out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last summer. Jon Pederson, board chairman of the Min-neapolis-based Norway House, said it’s shameful to play politics with the ambas-sador posts. ‘‘This position is important,’’ Pederson said. ‘‘Left unfilled like this is a slap in the face to Norway.’’ 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. There are just a few quotes from people who are not in politics at all. 
‘‘There’s a crisis in a relationship between our two countries,’’ said Bruce Karstadt, president and CEO of the Minneapolis-based American Swedish Institute. ‘‘I don’t really quite understand that any statement is being made other than we’re ignoring you.’’ 
I will give another example. Leif Trana, a Minister Counselor at the Norwegian Embassy in Washington, pointed out that his country just com-mitted to 52 fighter jets. I believe each one is over $200 million. Norway is pur-chasing these jets from Lockheed Mar-tin, a U.S. company, and all of them are going to be made in a Lockheed Martin plant in the State of Texas. Imagine how many jobs this provides and that we would consider not sending an ambassador to a country that not only sees us as an ally—and is allied, by the way, in our issues we have in our conflict with Russia. The Minister Counselor at the Nor-wegian Embassy goes on to say: 
Norwegians have long had a great affinity for the United States. After the E.U., this is our place where most Norwegians travel to and study. 
This is the last quote I will give you from this article today: 
Jon Pederson, board chairman of the Min-neapolis-based Norway House, said it’s shameful to play politics with the ambas-sador posts. ‘‘This position is important,’’ Pederson said. ‘‘Left unfilled like this is a slap in the face to Norway.’’ 
Let’s go through what has been going on—853 days in the case of Norway. The first nominee who was nominated, as explained in this article, did not go well. There were issues on both sides of the aisle. That person withdrew his name. That is part of the delay, and we will acknowledge that, but a big chunk of the recent delay is because there has been a hold—not at the committee level—that went through quickly with Senator C
ORKER and Senator C ARDIN ’s guidance—but on the floor. In the case of Sweden, it has been a delay of 462 days for a noncontroversial nominee. At the same time, in the last few months, Ambassadors have been con-firmed for 38 countries. Two of those were actually political appointees. They were not career, as the rumor is; two were considered political ap-pointees. Barbados, Ecuador, Poland, and Thailand all have Ambassadors. There is an ambassador from the United States in France, of course. There is an ambassador in England, of course. There is an ambassador in Italy. There is an ambassador in Ger-many. There is an ambassador in Bul-garia but not in Sweden and Norway. We, in fact, have an ambassador in nearly every European nation but not in these two Scandinavian countries. There have been no questions about the qualifications of these two nomi-nees. I will put those qualification on the record, but I wanted to focus more on the actual countries, Norway and Sweden. They are incredibly important allies and trading partners. They de-serve to be treated like other European nations. They deserve to have an am-bassador from the United States of America, and it is time to get this done. Diplomatic relations between the United States, Norway, and Sweden are almost 200 years old. For 200 years we have had Ambassadors in these coun-tries. Holding a vote to confirm front-line Ambassadors hostage is not in the best interest of our country. Let’s start with Norway. Norway was a founding member of the NATO alli-ance, and its military has participated in operations with the United States in the Balkans and in Afghanistan. Nor-wegians work alongside Americans in standing up to Russia’s provocations in Ukraine, in countering ISIS and the spread of violent extremism, and in strengthening regional cooperation in the Arctic. Norway has been especially strong on working to check Russian aggression against Ukraine. Norway has also played an important role in the Syrian refugee crisis. Nor-way has a proud history of providing support to those fleeing conflict. It ex-pects to take in as many as 25,000 refu-gees this year. It has already provided more than $6 million to Greece to help respond to the influx of refugees seek-ing a way to enter Europe. All of us on both sides of the aisle have talked about the importance of a strong Europe during these trying times. Yet now we have no Ambas-sadors in two of the countries that are on the frontlines of combatting extre-mism and addressing the refugee crisis. Sweden, like Norway, plays an im-portant role in national security and on the international stage. Sweden is a strong partner and close friend of the United States, helping in our fight against ISIS, promoting democracy and human rights, and cooperating on global initiatives related to clean en-ergy and the environment. Sweden is a partner in NATO and is an active global leader, from its long- term investment in Afghanistan, to its role as an international peacemaker. Sweden has supported Ukraine against Russian aggression, has made signifi-cant contributions in Afghanistan, and has aided in the fight against terrorism in Syria, Iraq, Kosovo, and the current fight against ISIS. Sweden is a member of the counter- ISIL coalition and is on the frontlines of the Syrian refugee crisis. More than 1,200 refugees seek asylum in Sweden every day, and Sweden accepts more refugees per capita than any other country in the EU. That is what is hap-pening right now. They are accepting more refugees per capita than any other country in the EU. Yet we don’t have an ambassador to that country. We have an ambassador to Germany. We certainly know they are playing a role in this refugee crisis. We have an ambassador, of course, to Greece. But we don’t have an ambassador to this country. The United States has collaborated with Sweden to strengthen human rights, democracy, and freedom in countries emerging from oppressive and autocratic regimes. Sweden’s com-mitment to promoting human democ-racy, human rights, gender equality, and international development and sus-tainability make it a respected leader in international affairs. Now let’s look at economic partner-ships. I do hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have all been very supportive of this will talk to Senator CRUZthe next time they see him. I plan on asking for unanimous consent to get these nominees through repeatedly in the next month. I am hoping Senator C
RUZwill be here to explain this, and I am hoping we can find some agreement on this because, again, this is not a typical case where these nominees have been criticized or questioned, including by his own office. This is a case of sim-ply some other issues that are not re-lated to the nominees or to the coun-tries, and these countries should not be held hostage. Norway is an important economic partner. According to the American Chamber of Commerce, Norway rep-resented the fifth fastest growing source of foreign direct investment in the United States between 2009 and 2013. Of course, visiting Senator H
OEVEN ’s and Senator H EITKAMP ’s State of North Dakota, I have seen the investments in oil and in drilling in North Dakota from the Scandinavian countries because of their history in that industry. Norway is the 12th largest source of foreign direct investment in the United States. Think about that. There are over 300 American companies with a presence in Norway, including 3M of Minnesota, Eli Lilly, General Electric, IBM, McDonald’s, and others. By not having an ambassador to Norway, we are sending a message to some of the top investors in our own country. The Ambassadors in these countries, as we know, are our trading partners and help businesses in America do business

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S325 January 28, 2016 
in that country. While there are na-tional security issues, there is also an economic purpose of having an ambas-sador. In October, Norway reiterated its commitment to invest in American businesses by purchasing an additional 22 F–35s from Lockheed Martin. That is a total of 52 fighter jets Norway is committing to buy from Lockheed Martin. The first will arrive in 2018. This is the biggest investment Norway has ever made in the country’s history, and they are investing in a company in our country, in the State of Texas. These are warplanes that will be built at Lockheed’s facility in Fort Worth. I called attention to this fact. I know it is a cost of almost $200 million per plane. This country is investing in American jobs—$200 million per plane— and they are buying 22 more. You can do the math. Lockheed Martin and other American companies that do business with Nor-way would like to see an ambassador there to help facilitate relations. Now let’s get to Sweden. Sweden, like Norway, is also one of the biggest investors in the United States. Sweden is actually the 11th largest direct in-vestor in the United States, while Nor-way is 12th. I would think some people might be surprised by that fact that these two Scandinavian countries are that high on the list when you look in the world, but, in fact, it is true. They are the 11th and 12th investors in the United States. Sweden’s foreign direct investment in the U.S. amounts to roughly $56 billion and creates nearly 330,700 U.S. jobs. U.S. companies are the most rep-resented foreign companies in Sweden. Swedish-Americans have contributed to the fabric of our great Nation and built successful companies such as Walgreens, Greyhound, and Nordstrom. Economically, Sweden is highly de-pendent upon exports and is one of the most internationally integrated econo-mies in the world. The United States is Sweden’s fourth largest export market, with Swedish exports valued at an esti-mated $10.2 billion. Now, does this sound like a country where we just de-cide we are not going to have an am-bassador, yet we give ambassadors to all these other nations all across the world? That just doesn’t seem right. Sweden is a significant export mar-ket for my State of Minnesota, with $131.5 million in sales through Novem-ber of last year. Sweden, like Norway, deserves to have an ambassador. Speaking of the Minnesota ties here, the economic and cultural influence of Norway and Sweden is strongly felt throughout the United States. I will say that Minnesota has a special one. In fact, one of the most notable attrac-tions in Madison, MN, is a giant 25- foot-long fiberglass cod named ‘‘Mr. Lou T. Fisk.’’ That is a little Scandina-vian joke here late in the afternoon. That is a lutefisk—‘‘Mr. Lou T. Fisk.’’ Anyone from Norway or Sweden knows that lutefisk is a traditional Nor-wegian food. Madison, MN, is so proud of its Nordic heritage that they once took Lou, the giant fish, on a national tour in the back of a truck. That was many, many years ago, but the fiber-glass cod—the largest fiberglass cod in the world—is still displayed in our State. We have about 100,000 people of Nor-wegian heritage in Minnesota, second only to Norway itself. We have 500,000 Swedish Minnesotans. Think of how many. That is a good chunk of our pop-ulation. So we are very proud of our Nordic heritage. That is my State. I think you could go around any State in the United States and there you would find proud Norwegians and Swedes. They may not always be the loudest voices, and maybe that is part of the problem. Maybe they have been too nice. But I can tell you that these two countries are the 11th and 12th biggest investors in the United States of America. One of them has been willing to buy 52 fighter planes valued at nearly $200 million each from our Nation. They certainly deserve an ambas-sador. They have been very clear to me—the representatives of these com-panies—that they would like to see an ambassador. At some point this looks like a ‘‘dis’’ from our Nation—that we are ‘‘dissing’’ them because we allow every other Nation to have an ambas-sador. We look forward to working with Senator C
RUZ. Again, I thank Senator M
CCONNELL and Senator C ORKER for their support. We haven’t seen any other concerns that people have that have not been taken care of. So I am hopeful we can get Sam Heins and Azita Raji immediately confirmed. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Sen-ate now vote on these amendments en bloc. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Washington. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, re-serving the right to object. I will not object. I just want to thank my col-league from Alaska for her hard work in working on both sides of the aisle today on these amendments: the Bar-rasso amendment about energy re-ported out of the Indian Affairs Com-mittee, the Baldwin amendment about water treatment, the Wyden amend-ment on U.S. geothermal, the Capito amendment on ethane storage facili-ties, the Daines amendment on hydro license issues, and the Hirono amend-ment on removing offensive language in the DOE Organization Act. Members have worked very hard throughout the day on these issues, and I just want to make this point, as my colleague and I try to finish work-ing through the rest of this week and into next week to wrap up this bill, and thank all our colleagues for helping us on this. I will not object and am glad we got to this point. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I know of no further debate on these amendments. The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is on agreeing to the amendments en bloc. The amendments (Nos. 3029, 2984, 3001, 3063, 3020, and 3067) were agreed to en bloc. f

ENERGY POLICY MODERNIZATION BILL Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I want to follow up on the comments of the Senator from Washington and thank her for her willingness as we have worked through several of these matters throughout the morning, into the afternoon, and now here at the 5 o’clock hour. You do not get to a place where you can voice vote six amend-ments without a level of cooperation, and I thank her for that. I thank our Members, but I also want to do a specific shout-out to our staffs, who have been working through some of the language, some of the issues, and coming together to provide us with a path forward. I think we are optimistic that given the pace and the trajectory that we are on, we will be able to come in on Mon-day and hopefully be able to alert Members to a longer queue of votes that we will have identified so they can come prepared when we take up votes on Tuesday. We will again be asking Members to spend good, constructive time. If you want to speak to your amendments, we will be in session on Monday for at least a few hours, and that would not be a bad time to come and speak to any of the issues that are of importance to you. We really do hope to put in place a more defined schedule for next week so that colleagues know the trajectory that we are on. I think it is the intention of both Senator C
ANTWELL and myself that we move aggressively so that we can com-plete this very important bill by the end of next week. I know that we have Members who are scheduled to come to the floor and speak to the Energy Pol-icy Modernization Act. With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

THANKING THE SENATE PAGES Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as I was turning to go into the cloakroom, I saw the pages here in the corner. I have had an opportunity to visit with several of them an hour or so ago. To-morrow is the last day of the session for these young pages who have come to us from all around the country to be with us for a 5-month period. It is a long time to be away from your home, your family, your school, your commu-nity, to be here in a strange place with other strange people, to be living in a dormitory situation, to have a very ag-gressive academic schedule and, by the way, at 16 years old, you are working. You are told what you can wear. You are told you cannot have your cell phone. There are a lot of rules. Being a page is not an easy thing. We have some of the brightest young men and young women who come to us through the Senate page program. I want each of you to know how proud we are of the job you do. You do it with a smile. You do it with an en-thusiasm that I think helps us. I think it helps remind us that this place is a special place, that it is a privilege to be serving in the Senate, whether it is as an elected Member or whether it is as a page or as those who are doing the transcription of Senators’ comments or as staff. The fact that these men and women come here and help with the ef-ficient operation of the day-to-day ac-tivities needs to be recognized. Our page class of 2015–2016 certainly de-serves a shout-out. I want to thank you for your work that you have given us, making us look a little more efficient and a little bet-ter at our job. Thank you for what you do and best wishes to you all. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S327 January 28, 2016 
this week. On Monday, the Congres-sional Budget Office, or the CBO, re-leased its biannual ‘‘Budget and Eco-nomic Outlook’’ report and the projec-tions for the next decade are very so-bering. The nonpartisan study found that over the next decade our country will grow to nearly $30 trillion in debt. Folks, that is $30 trillion. This is unbe-lievable. It is unmanageable. A number this large is nearly impos-sible to comprehend. Maybe that is why this seems to have gone unnoticed, buried under headlines about Presi-dential politics, Super Bowl 50, Snowzilla, and Apple’s latest earnings statement. But what we can com-prehend is who is responsible for pay-ing off this debt eventually. We are— the American people. With nearly $19 trillion in debt today and over $100 trillion in future un-funded liabilities, we are well past the tipping point. This means each Amer-ican family is responsible today for nearly $1 million of this debt. In addi-tion, the Social Security and Medicare trust funds are expected to go to zero in roughly 15 short years. According to an AEI analysis of this CBO report, spending on Social Secu-rity, Medicare, and other health care programs will grow at an average an-nual rate of 5
1⁄2percent from 2016 to 2026, pushing spending on Social Secu-rity and health care alone to upwards of $4.1 trillion in 2026—just 10 short years from now. This is more than we spent last year on the entire Federal Government. This is not 20 years from now. This is in the immediate future. We will be spending more on these items than we did last year on the entire Govern-ment. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle recognize that we have a cri-sis. We all agree. However, their solu-tion is simply to tax the working peo-ple of America more. That is exactly what we have been doing. It is not working. In the last 15 years, our Federal Gov-ernment spending has grown from $2.4 trillion in the year 2000 to $3.7 trillion in constant 2015 dollars last year. Be-cause of that, over this same period— from 2000 to 2015—our Federal debt has grown from $6 trillion in 2000 to $19 trillion today. It is unbelievable. However, last year the Federal Gov-ernment collected $3.2 trillion in taxes. This is the largest amount ever in our history. We have a spending problem, not a revenue problem. Furthermore, our country’s debt is not interest-free. Taxpayers are already paying im-mensely for Washington’s fiscal mal-feasance. Last month, interest rates increased one-quarter of a point—only one-quar-ter of a point. But this equates to al-most $50 billion of new interest expense every single year. Our country must borrow even more money to pay this additional interest expense. That is a true measure of total insolvency. This interest rate increase is widely sus-pected to be followed by another in-crease later this year. Imagine if interest rates go up to just their 50-year average of 51⁄2percent, taxpayers would be paying almost $1 trillion in interest. This is more than twice what we spent on our military. It is more than twice what we spend on our discretionary nonmilitary spend-ing. It is unmanageable, and we have to deal with it right now. Having been in the business world for over 40 years, there are four words that I used to hear often and we used them frequently: ‘‘We cannot afford it.’’ I personally have not heard these words once in Washington over this past year, my first year in the Senate. We simply cannot afford all we are spending today, and CBO says it will only get much worse. Just look at Washington’s grand bar-gain this past year. I voted against this bad policy because it significantly added to the national debt and eradi-cated the conservative budget we put in place last year, which did cut $7 tril-lion out of the President’s budget re-quest of last year. Additionally, President Obama’s eco-nomic failures and disastrous health care law have dangerously set our debt up to soar even higher after he leaves office. CBO projects ObamaCare will enroll 40 percent less participants than expected in 2016. This will result in the Federal Government spending more money to support the failed market-place exchange so it does not collapse. The Hill reports that ‘‘spending on the marketplace is expected to rise to $56 billion next year, up from $38 billion this year. Within a decade, that total is expected to double to more than $109 billion.’’ Plus, spending on health care programs has already jumped from $671 billion in 2008 to over $1.1 trillion this year. CBO projects that health care spending will nearly double in the next 10 years, reaching $2 trillion in 2026. This is a train wreck, and it is here. Clearly, Washington cannot continue spending like this, and we have to make the changes necessary today. We have already reached the point where our Federal debt has become the great-est threat to our national and global security. At this point, we cannot pay for the tools needed to defend our coun-try. Last year we spent nearly 3.2 percent of GDP on defense—less than the 30- year average of 4.2 percent of GDP. This is the lowest level in over a dec-ade. We have been at war for more than a decade, and in the process we have totally worn out our military equip-ment and desperately need to recapi-talize and update it. More concerning, we are wearing out our people and can-not fully support our women and men on the frontlines. This crisis is here right now. It is real, and it is dangerous and threatens our very way of life. These are eco-nomic realities we must come to grips with quickly in order to turn things around and change the direction of our country. We can solve our national debt crisis, but Washington’s business- as-usual approach must change and lawmakers must start saying: We can-not afford it. Solving the debt crisis starts with to-tally reinventing the failed budget process, which has only worked four times in the past 40 years. We have to also reduce the size of our Federal bu-reaucracy and start with redundant agencies. Washington already has 256 government programs running on auto-pilot, costing taxpayers $310 billion a year, and there are hundreds of billions of dollars in duplicate programs and more opportunities to reduce waste. It goes without saying that we need to get our economy growing again. We can do it by changing our archaic tax laws, by eliminating unnecessary regu-lations stifling our free enterprise sys-tem, and by finally unleashing the full potential of our energy resources here in America responsibly. We will not solve this debt crisis until we save So-cial Security and Medicare and address our spiraling health care costs. The solutions to these will take dec-ades, but we have to start now. The CBO report reveals a stark reality: We are simply out of time. This debt crisis can no longer be ignored. It is here now. Washington must face up to that stark reality. We simply must start making the tough decisions required to put a plan in place to reduce this out-rageous debt. We must do this right now for our future, for our children, and for our children’s children. I yield my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Delaware.

DEFICIT REDUCTION Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to talk a bit about developments that involve our Nation, Iran, and the other five nations that joined us in negotiating the joint agreement. And we are encouraged that it will reduce—maybe substan-tially—the likelihood that Iran will build a nuclear weapon in the near fu-ture or even a good deal beyond that. I came to the floor to talk about that subject, but after hearing the previous speaker, I felt compelled to say a few things. I am a recovering Governor. I was the Governor of Delaware for 8 years, and we balanced our budget 8 years in a row, cut taxes. I have been told that more jobs were created dur-ing those 8 years than at any other time in Delaware history. I chaired the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. We worked closely with GAO. We actually worked very closely with the Bowles-Simpson folks about 5 or 6 years ago. They came up with three ideas for deficit reduction and to make sure that we do it for the long haul. The Bowles-Simpson Commission was formed at a time when deficit was $1.4 trillion. For those who are following it, the deficit is still too high, but it has

been reduced by more than two- thirds—I think it may have even been close to three-quarters—and that is good. There are things we need to do for further deficit reduction. No. 1, we need to really consider what we do with our entitlement pro-grams. The Bowles-Simpson Commis-sion suggested that we make some changes and that we make them in ways which do not harm older people and which will save these programs for our children and grandchildren. I think that is very important, and that is one thing we need to do. No. 2, we need some additional reve-nues. We actually had four balanced budgets in a row during the last 4 years of the Clinton administration. If you look at revenues as a percentage of GDP in those 4 years, it was 20 percent. Revenues as a percentage of GDP for the 4 years we had a balanced budget was 20 percent. When you look at spending as a percentage of GDP dur-ing those 4 years, the last 4 years of the Clinton administration, it was 20 per-cent. During that time we had a bal-anced budget. In fact, we had a little surplus. But all of that got away from us in the 8 years that followed. After we had a change in administrations, the deficit piled up to $1.4 trillion. Well, we have been ratcheting it down, and now we are recovering from the worst recession since the Great Depres-sion. Can we do better than that? Sure we can do better than that. In terms of deficit reduction, entitle-ment reform actually saves money, save these programs for our kids and our grandchildren, and doesn’t harm old people and poor people. The third thing we need is tax reform that generates revenues and hopefully reduces some rates, especially on the corporate side, where we are out of step with the rest of the world. The fourth thing we need to do is look at everything we do in order to find ways to save money. I will always remember a woman who came to one of my townhall meetings early in my time as a Congressman years ago, and her message to me, which I have never forgotten, was ‘‘Congressman Carper, I don’t mind paying for additional taxes; I just don’t want you to waste my money.’’ That is what she said. ‘‘I don’t mind paying for additional taxes; I just don’t want you to waste my money.’’ I think most people in this country feel that way. As it turns out, one of the jobs of GAO—the Government Accountability Office—as a watchdog on spending for us is every 2 years they provide to the Congress a high-risk list of ways we are wasting money. When Tom Coburn and I led the Homeland Security and Gov-ernmental Affairs Committee, we used that as kind of our shopping list that we used to offer changes in spending and changes in revenues—especially in government collection—that would ac-tually further reduce the deficit. We have taken action on a bunch of the ideas from GAO, and we need to find additional steps to take that provide part of the blueprint. Every major agency has inspectors general, and many of them regularly give us rec-ommendations on how to save more money. Those reports should not just go up on a shelf somewhere but should be an action plan for us. So there is work for all of us to do. The last thing I will say is that health care costs as a percentage of GDP in my time as Governor—actu-ally, after I stepped down as Governor in 2001—which was pretty flat during the mid-to-late 1990s, started to rise again and continued to rise until right around 2010, 2011. At that time health care costs as a percentage of GDP in this country had risen to 18 percent. When I ask a friend of mine how he is doing, he says: Compared to what? Well, how about comparing it to Japan? In Japan health care costs as a percentage of GDP are about 8 percent. We were 18 percent and they are at 8 percent. They get better results, longer life expectancies, and lower rates of in-fant mortality. They cover everybody. Four or 5 years ago, we had 40 mil-lion people going to bed without health care coverage at all, and we didn’t get better results and we were spending 18 percent of GDP. The good news is that since the Affordable Care Act—I wrote parts of it, and I am proud of the part I worked on. But there are things we need to change, and my hope is that some day we get to a point in time where Democrats and Republicans, in-stead of just trying to kill and get rid of it, will say that there are some good things in this legislation and some good things that will be coming, and one of the good things that is coming is that health care costs as a percentage of GDP are not 18 percent anymore. They are coming down. The impact on deficit reduction is actually quite posi-tive because of this legislation. 
f 
NUCLEAR AGREEMENT WITH IRAN Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, those are some things I didn’t plan to say but I felt compelled to say as a warmup to what I really wanted to say, and that is to talk about the agreement we struck with Iran and some of the things that have been happening since then with us, the United States, and five other nations. Over the past couple of weeks, the Obama administration’s decision to en-gage with Iran, along with these other five nations, through diplomacy in-stead of military action has faced key tests. The results are in, and the agree-ment that we struck—the United States, the Brits, the Germans, the French, the Chinese, the Russians, and the Iranians—appears to be working thus far, and, God willing, we may ac-tually be on our way to being safe as a result. This test began on the high seas 2 weeks ago when the United States and Iran faced a crisis that could have ended tragically. Two U.S. Navy ves-sels carrying a total of 10 crewmembers strayed into Iran’s territorial waters. They were detained by Iran, and as many of us know, they appeared on Ira-nian television. The American vessels were somewhere they should not have been. It was a mistake. As a former naval flight officer who served 5 years in a hot war in South-east Asia and another 18 years—right up to end of the Cold War—as a P3 air-craft mission commander, I know this is a mistake we never want to make. Defense Secretary Ash Carter acknowl-edged that the error had been made, and the sailors were released unharmed within 24 hours of being detained. Flashbacks of past hostage crises and destabilizing tensions were on all of our minds as we watched this story un-fold. However, thanks to a more coop-erative and productive diplomatic rela-tionship with Iran, the sailors were re-leased within 24 hours. As the week came to a close, we saw additional encouraging validations that the administration’s Iran strategy is beginning to bear fruit. Following months of the most intrusive nuclear inspections in history, international weapons inspectors concluded that Iran had indeed followed through on its pledge in the nuclear deal to dismantle the parts of its nuclear program that were clearly not intended for peaceful purposes. The International Atomic Energy Agency certified that Iran had reduced its stockpile of enriched uranium by 98 percent and that the remaining ura-nium was only enriched to levels con-sistent with peaceful energy uses. The inspectors certified that nearly 15,000 centrifuges for enriching uranium have been dismantled. That leaves Iran with only its least sophisticated centrifuges, which can be used solely for peaceful purposes. The inspectors revealed that a special reactor for producing the kind of plutonium needed for a nuclear bomb in Iran will produce no more. It has been filled with concrete instead. Finally, the nuclear watchdogs cer-tified that the inspections and moni-toring systems of Iran’s nuclear facil-ity and nuclear supply chain have been stood up to ensure Iran’s compliance with the nuclear deal. All of this happened much faster than most of us would have expected. It certainly happened faster than I ex-pected it would. In fact, some critics of the nuclear deal said that Iran would never live up to the promises it had made—never. Yet, despite that skep-ticism, today we see an Iran that has taken irreversible steps to dismantle its nuclear weapons program in order to make good on its pledges. Amid the nuclear deal’s implementa-tion, the United States achieved an-other diplomatic breakthrough with Iran—one that I and a number of my colleagues had a hand in. The Iranians released five individ-uals—all dual U.S.-Iranian citizens— that they had been detaining in Iran

for some years. Their release was the result of intense diplomatic negotia-tions. Secretary Kerry and his team of negotiators worked overtime to secure their freedom. They deserve our appre-ciation and our thanks. I had never forgotten about these Americans, and neither had my col-leagues. Whenever we spoke or met with senior Iranian officials in recent years, we consistently called on them to release our unjustly detained citi-zens. The end result is that these Americans are free to rejoin their fam-ilies in America instead of rotting in an Iranian prison. The events and achievements that occurred during these 6 days were a re-markable validation that the Obama administration and those of us in Con-gress who voted to support the nuclear deal had made the right choice. But our challenges with Iran have not van-ished—not by a long shot. Iran con-tinues to support terrorist organiza-tions like Hezbollah. Iraq props up the Assad regime in Syria. Iran tests and develops ballistic missiles in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. Another American, former FBI agent Bob Levinson, disappeared 8 years ago in Iran, and the Iranian government needs to do all it can to help return him to his family or, if they can’t do that—if he is no longer alive—at least help find out what happened to this American. Also, of course, Iran refuses to recognize Israel’s right to even exist. Addressing these problems with Iran will not be easy. They will require the same kind of intense negotiations and pressure that helped to bring about an end to Iran’s nuclear weapons program and the release of the detained Ameri-cans. That means our relationship with Iran will not always be composed of carrots. There may very well be times when sticks are needed to try to con-vince that Nation’s regime to change its behavior toward us and our allies, including Israel. Perhaps no action better illustrates these dynamics than the United States’ recent move to increase sanctions on Iran for its illegal testing of ballistic missiles—something that is a clear vio-lation of the sanctions. At the same time that the U.S. was lifting nuclear sanctions on Iran as part of the nuclear deal, the Obama administration was leveling sanctions against 11 entities for their role in supporting Iran’s bal-listic missile program. Addressing our challenges with Iran over the long term will also require this administration, along with future administrations and Congress, to adopt a forward-thinking foreign policy that looks beyond the rhetoric of Iran’s cur-rent regime. I have a chart here that I want to share with everyone tonight. It is a collage of photographs. I believe these photographs were taken in the after-math of the decision to approve the agreement—a decision reached by the United States and our five negotiating partners and the government of Iran. This is a collage of photographs that indicates the measure of joy the Ira-nian people are reacting to this suc-cessful negotiation with. I just want to say Iran is little under-stood by most Americans. They have 78 million people there today. The aver-age age of those people is under the age of 25—a lot like the young people we see in these photographs. For the most part, they are all educated. The lion’s share of them don’t remember the Ira-nian revolution of 1979 and the taking of American hostages at our embassy or the cruel Shah whom we supported until his ouster. This is a population, reflected in these photographs, that ap-pears more focused on building Iran’s troubled economy than pursuing an-tagonizing military activities favored by the Supreme Leader and by many of the Revolutionary Guard. In the weeks ahead, this new genera-tion of young Iranians will head to the polls—sometime in the month of Feb-ruary—to choose the country’s next parliament, as well as an entity called its Council of Experts, which I believe is the body that will help to choose the next Supreme Leader of Iran. At stake for these Iranians is the choice between the policies of engagement and eco-nomic revival being vigorously pursued by President Rouhani, Foreign Min-ister Zarif, and their supporters, as op-posed to the politics of antagonism and destabilization that are apparently fa-vored by the Supreme Leader and many in the Revolutionary Guard. We have seen photographs this week of President Rouhani meeting not just with Pope Francis—the first meeting between the leader of Iran and the Pope in close to 20 years—but also of his meetings throughout Europe, call-ing on countries, calling on businesses in order to try to solicit and pave the way for investments not in weaponry, not in aid to Hezbollah, but invest-ments in roads, highways, and bridges—things that we need, but they need them a whole lot worse. Their roads, their highways and bridges, their airports and trains make ours look like the 21st century. They need to invest in those things. They have a lot of oil. They have the ability to pump a lot more. I think they pump about 300,000 barrels a day. By the end of this year, they will have the ability to pump as much as 1 mil-lion barrels of oil a day, and they are not going to do that without enormous investments in their oil infrastructure. They have a great need to do that. These young people know that. That is where they would like to spend that money. We should help make the upcoming parliamentary elections in February for these voters and others an easy choice. We should continue to show the people of Iran that their cooperation and their commitment to peace will be rewarded. How? With economic oppor-tunity and the shedding of Iran’s status as a pariah in the international com-munity. We ought to listen to these people. They are not much older than the pages who are sitting here in front of us this evening. They are interested in their country changing for the better. They are interested in reform. A num-ber of them have relatives who live over here in our country, and there are a lot of Iranian Americans who live here. For the most part, they are very valued citizens, and people would be proud to call them Americans. We need to listen to these young peo-ple who are calling for reform and who want to reconnect Iran to the inter-national community. Frankly, it would be wise of us to do so for the sake of our security and for the sake of the se-curity of our allies and for stability in the Middle East.

OVERREGULATION OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of an amendment that I am hoping will be part of the Energy bill currently being debated on the floor and being shepherded through the Sen-ate by my colleague from the great State of Alaska, Senator M
URKOWSKI . I commend Senator M
URKOWSKI , the chair of the Energy and Natural Re-sources Committee, for the bill she has worked on for months—incredible hard work. It is great to have her as the chair of the committee, certainly for Alaska but for the entire country. States such as the Presiding Officer’s recognize how important American en-ergy is for all our citizens. One of the many positive aspects of the bill we have been debating is that it is focused on cleaning up old regula-tions, cleaning up outdated programs, getting rid of some of the things we don’t need. The amendment that this Senator would like to offer as part of the En-ergy bill is based on a bill I recently in-troduced called the RED Tape Act of 2015. The R-E-D in RED Tape Act stands for Regulations Endanger De-mocracy Act, and this Senator believes that is the case. The onslaught of regu-lations are not only threatening our economy but are actually threatening our form of government. That is why I am proposing a simple one-in, one-out bill that will cap Federal regulations— a simple commonsense approach to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES330 January 28, 2016 
Federal regulations that will begin to address what I think the vast majority of Americans recognize as a monu-mental problem. What is that problem? Economists around the country and many Members of this body believe that the overregulation of the Amer-ican economy is why we can’t grow this economy. This Senator thinks it is often looked at as a partisan issue. It is not a partisan issue. To the contrary, it is a consensus issue about the im-pact of regulations on the American economy. To give a couple of examples, here is how The Economist put it in a 2012 cover story titled ‘‘Over-Regulated America.’’ The redtape is right here. This lead article in The Economist said a couple of years ago that ‘‘America needs a smarter approach to regula-tions’’ that will ‘‘mitigate a real dan-ger: that regulations may crush the life out of America’s economy.’’ There is a real danger that regula-tions will crush the life out of the American economy. I think that is al-ready happening. Again, this is not a partisan issue. Many Democrats in this body have called for a smarter ap-proach to Federal regulations. Governors, particularly Democratic Governors across the country, have also decried the overregulation of our economy. For example, the two-term Massachusetts Governor, Deval Pat-rick, made regulatory reform a hall-mark of his administration’s approach to growing their economy, and it is not just Democratic Governors. It is actu-ally Democratic Presidents. In 2011, Newsweek featured a cover story with President Clinton’s face on the cover that highlighted his 14 ideas to grow the economy and create jobs. In the ar-ticle, President Clinton lamented the long wait time for permanent approv-als for infrastructure projects through-out the country due to overregulation. One of President Clinton’s top rec-ommendations to put hardworking Americans back to work was to speed up the regulatory approval process and grant States waivers on burdensome Federal environmental rules to hasten the time that construction projects can begin and real hardworking Americans can work. Even President Obama in his recent State of the Union Address focused on regulations. The President of the United States said: 
I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed. There is red tape that needs to be cut. 
President Obama stated this just a few weeks ago. As a matter of fact, it was the biggest applause line of the en-tire evening. Democrats and Repub-licans roared at this. The President recognized what redtape is doing to this great economy. So I took the liberty to write the President after his State of the Union Address, commending him for his focus on regulations, and asked him to get his administration to back my RED Tape Act and to follow through on his promise to reach across the aisle for good ideas to grow the economy. This is one that would strengthen our econ-omy, create jobs for hard-working mid-dle-class Americans, union workers, and pave the path for what we haven’t seen in over a decade, a private sector that is thriving. That is the heart of the American dream. Before I get into details, let me spend a few minutes on the economy and why I believe we must pass this amend-ment. Our debt is approaching $20 tril-lion. The national debt of the United States has increased more under Presi-dent Obama’s two terms than it has under all previous administrations in U.S. history. Of course, one of the rea-sons is we are spending too much, but this Senator believes the biggest rea-son is that we cannot grow this econ-omy. The U.S. average economic growth rate for almost our entire history as a country, from 1790 to 2014, has averaged about 3.7 percent GDP growth. That is real American growth. For over 200 years there has been ups and downs, but the average has been about 4 per-cent GDP growth. This is what has made us great as a nation. The Obama administration’s average GDP growth is about 1.5 percent—dramatically less than the traditional levels of American growth that we need. As a matter of fact, officially this recovery has been the weakest in over 70 years. While the American people might not have all these specific numbers at hand, they know something is wrong. They know they are not finding the good jobs, that they are not getting the raises in the jobs they have. They know their family’s budget isn’t stretching as far as it used to stretch. This should not be the case. We live in the greatest Nation in the world. We have so many advantages over other countries. Our high-tech sector is still the most innovative in the world, an efficient agriculture sec-tor feeds the world, and our univer-sities are the best universities in the world by far. We are in a renaissance in energy production with renewables, oil, and gas that have once again made us a superpower in the world, one of the best managed, highly productive fish-eries in the world from my State in Alaska, and we certainly have the most professional, lethal military in the world. We have so many advantages over every other country in the world. So why aren’t we growing our econ-omy? Why can’t our economy expand at traditional levels of American growth? Look at this chart behind me. This clearly to me and to many others is one of the reasons: new regulation on top of old regulation on top of old regu-lation—a steady increase year after year, starting here in 1976 with no end in sight, an explosion that is going to keep going until we do something about it. Through these regulations the Federal Government is looking to regu-late every aspect of the American economy, and that is one of the main reasons why we can’t grow. When it was first published in 1936, the Federal Register, which contained a daily digest of proposed regulations from agencies and final rules and no-tices, was about 2,500 pages. By the end of 2014, the Federal Register had ballooned to close to 78,000 pages. What we are seeing is an explosion of regula-tions. This chart relates directly to why I believe we can’t grow our economy. Re-member regulations are taxes. They cost American families, American con-sumers, and American small busi-nesses. There are huge costs to this ex-plosion, particularly when they accu-mulate like this. President Obama’s Small Business Administration puts the number of the annual cost of regulation that impacts the U.S. economy at about $1.8 trillion per year. That is a number that would make it one of the largest economies in the world. That is about $15,000 per American household, about 29 percent of the average American family budg-et. That is what we are doing to our families and our economy. I believe a huge part of the problem of what is keeping our economy back and the opportunities for middle-class families is right here in this town. The Federal Government, with agencies and the alphabet soup of agencies—the IRS, the BLM, the EPA—are constantly pro-mulgating new regulations. What they don’t do is they never remove old regu-lations. From across the country, whether it is Alaska or Maine, our businesses, our citizens, and particu-larly the most vulnerable, our families, are being impacted by the explosion of regulations from the Federal Govern-ment right here in Washington, DC. Let me give you a few examples. On the North Slope of Alaska they can’t get small portable incinerators that comply with the upcoming EPA regula-tions, so the trash in these amazing communities in my State piles up until it is actually taken out by airplane. This is polar bear country. This is dan-gerous—trash everywhere. It is cer-tainly harmful to the environment be-cause regulations don’t allow inciner-ators. Because of the Federal roadless rule in Southeast Alaska, we can’t even build new alternative energy plants for the citizens of my State who des-perately need energy because we pay some of the highest costs of any State in the country with regard to energy. Nationally, bridges are crumbling, and we cannot get them built, in large part because of the overburdensome Federal regulations. On average, it takes over 5 years to permit a bridge in the United States— not to build a bridge, just to get the Federal Government’s permission to build a bridge. Right now there are 61,000 bridges in our country in need of repair, but burdensome regulations delay commonsense repairs. These bridges are being crossed by our

trucks, carrying the Nation’s com-merce, our children, schoolbuses, and parents trying to get home for dinner. Thousands of communities across the country are simply keeping their fin-gers crossed, hoping their current bridges last another year. Let me provide one more example in terms of what is happening with regard to the overregulation of our economy. This involves one of the most impor-tant sectors of the U.S. economy— small community banks. Over 1,300 small community banks have dis-appeared since 2010, and only 2 new banks in the United States have been chartered in the last 5 years. If you ask any small community banker what is driving this, they will point to this chart. Regulations from Washington, DC, are driving our small community banks out of existence. Even during the Great Depression, we had on average 19 new banks a year. In the last 5 years, the United States has seen two new banks chartered in our country. So what do we do? Well, the good news is that many colleagues in the Senate on both sides of the aisle have offered suggestions and introduced bills to stop the redtape, to stop this trajectory of Federal regulations from strangling our economy and our future. But we need something that is simple, something that hard-working Ameri-cans understand, and something that is bold to take on this challenge. I believe the amendment I have offered to the Energy bill, the RED Tape Act, is both simple and bold enough to take on this challenge. It is only 5 pages long. Using a simple one-in, one-out method, it caps Federal regulations. New regula-tions that cause a financial or adminis-trative burden on the economy, on hard-working American, on middle- class families, on union workers would need to be offset by repealing an exist-ing regulation. Simple—you issue a new regulation, you repeal an old regu-lation. People understand that and it makes sense. This is not a radical idea. This is not some kind of poison pill that we want to attach to the Energy bill, because I think that is a good bill. It is an idea that is gaining consensus not only throughout the country but through-out the world. Other countries have ac-tually taken up this idea to fix their regulatory problems as well. In Can-ada, they recently put an administra-tive fix to their regulations that was one-in, one-out. In Great Britain they have done this to the point where it is viewed as so successful that they are not talking about one-in, one-out any-more, they are talking about maybe one-in, two-out. So I think this is an idea that both parties of the Senate, Members from both sides of the aisle, can get behind. Even National Public Radio did a re-cent story about how well this one-in, one-out rule is working in Canada. It has freed up hundreds of thousands of hours of paperwork for small busi-nesses in particular. Even the Canadian Socialists have backed this idea. I cer-tainly hope Senator S
ANDERS is listen-ing, and I hope I can get him and other Members of this body to support this amendment. To be clear, I am certainly not against all regulations or permitting requirements. When I served as the commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources in Alaska, we worked with our bipartisan legislature to overhaul our permitting and regu-latory system and to bring what we have seen on the Federal Government side—a huge backlog of permits—to get projects moving. We brought that backlog down by over 50 percent through regulatory and permitting re-form, and we did so with the absolute understanding that protecting our en-vironment and keeping our citizens safe was a fundamental precondition to any of our actions. But we can do both. We can bring down this huge burden and still make sure we have a clean en-vironment and a strong, healthy econ-omy. There are simply too many Federal regulations out there, and the Amer-ican people know it. It is time this body stops increasing this number of regulations and puts a cap on it. Finally, if we do this, we will make sure that all of the comparative advan-tages we have in this country—so many that we have over so many other countries—will enable us to unleash the might of the U.S. economy, create better jobs, and create a brighter fu-ture for our children and their chil-dren.

f 
SENATE DEBATE Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, one of the fundamental purposes of this body is to debate some of the biggest issues fac-ing this Nation and to do so in an hon-orable way. The Senate is for debate but not as an abstraction. It is to be addressing and ultimately solving the meatiest challenges the Constitution demands that we tackle. Unfortu-nately, a great deal of our debate is weak and embarrassing. Much of it falls off the trivial side of the cliff or the shrill side of the cliff. During my time serving Nebraskans in this place, I hope to be aligned with those who want fighting and debating in this place, but it needs to be mean-ingful fighting. It needs to be honor-able, honest debating. To that end, there is a terrific col-umn this week by Pete Wehner in Com-mentary magazine. Partly because the column is about Daniel Patrick Moy-nihan, at whose desk I intentionally sit, partly because it is about C.S. Lewis, a man whose writings have changed my life, and partly because it is just darn good exhortation to us, I would like to read a portion of this col-umn into the Senate RECORD today. Wehner begins: 
While reading Gregory Weiner’s fas-cinating book ‘‘American Burke,’’ I came across this comment: ‘‘(Daniel Patrick) Moy-nihan’s intellectual curiosity was such that he gravitated toward thinkers with whom he disagreed precisely because he disagreed with them and could consequently learn from them. This observation reminded me of an inci-dent in 1948 involving C.S. Lewis and Eliza-beth Anscombe, a Catholic convert who was considered one of the most brilliant moral philosophers of her generation. Lewis was president of the Oxford Socratic Club, an open forum that met every Monday evening and whose purpose was to discuss the intellectual difficulties connected with religion, and with Christianity in particular. ‘‘In any fairly large and talkative commu-nity such as a university— 
And, I would add, such as a Senate— 
there is always the danger that those who think alike should gather together into ‘coteries’ where they will henceforth encoun-ter opposition only in the emasculated form of rumor that the outsiders say thus and thus,’’. . . . The absent are easily refuted, complacent dogmatism thrives, and differences of opin-ion are embittered by group hostility. Each group hears not the best, but the worst, that the other groups can say. . . . On February 2, 1948, Anscombe and Lewis debated a portion of Lewis’s book ‘‘Mir-acles,’’ with Anscombe reading a paper pointing out ‘‘a fatal flaw in Lewis’s argu-ment,’’. . . (It was a complicated critique having to do with the conflation of irrational and nonrational factors in belief-formation.) The result of the debate, which Lewis him-self felt he lost, was revisions to his book. Anscombe, while not convinced by the changes made by Lewis, did say ‘‘the fact that Lewis rewrote that chapter, and rewrote it so that it now has these qualities, shows his honesty and seriousness.’’ That’s not all. When Lewis was asked to nominate speakers for the 1951 Socratic Club season, Anscombe was his first choice. ‘‘That lady is quite right to refute what she thinks bad theistic arguments, but does this not al-most oblige her as a Christian to find good ones in their place: having obliterated me as an Apologist ought she not to succeed me?’’ There is something impressive in the quali-ties demonstrated by Moynihan and Lewis: a willingness to learn from others, including those with whom we disagree. There is in this an admirable blend of intellectual hu-mility and self-confidence—the humility to know that at best we possess only a partial understanding of the truth, which can al-ways be enlarged; and the self-confidence that allows for refinement and amendment of our views in light of new arguments, new circumstances, new insights. Beyond that, it’s a useful reminder that the quality we ought to strive for isn’t cer-titude but to be a seeker of truth. That is, I think, what separates ideologues from true intellectuals. The former is determined to defend a pre-existing position come what may, interpreting facts to fit a worldview that is already well beyond challenge. The latter seeks genuine enlightenment and is eager to discard false notions they may

hold—and values rather than resents those who help them on that journey. The purpose of debating, then, isn’t so much just to win an argument as it is to deepen our understanding of how things real-ly and truly are. It isn’t to out-shout an op-ponent but, at least now and then, to listen to them, to weight their arguments with care, and even to learn from them. It’s worth noting that Lewis warned about simply sur-rounding ourselves with like-minded people who reinforce our own biases and how de-bates conducted properly ‘‘helped to civilize one another.’’ What a quaint notion. In saying all this, I’m not insisting that everyone you disagree with is someone you can learn from, nor that everyone’s views contain an equal measure of wisdom. Some people really don’t know what they’re talk-ing about, some people really do hold per-nicious and false views, and some people really do deserve harsh criticisms. My point is simply that because the pull is so strong the other way—most of us use de-bates as a way to amplify pre-existing views rather than refine them; try to crush oppo-nents rather than engage and understand them; and focus on the weakest rather than the strongest arguments found in opposing views—the Moynihan-Lewis model is a good one to strive for. 
Wehner continues: 
I understand that talking about such things can sound hopelessly high-minded and, for some, signal a mushy lack of convic-tion. When you’re in a political death match with the other side, after all, the idea of learning from it seems either ridiculously naive or slightly treasonous. But of course, this reaction highlights just how much things have gone off track. To be sure, American politics has always been a raucous affair. As Madison put it in Federalist #55, ‘‘Had every Athenian citizen been a Socrates, every Athenian assembly would still have been a mob.’’ The question is whether one stokes the passions of the mob or appeals to reason. As someone who doesn’t do nearly well enough in this regard, I rather admire the Lewis model. He was a better man, and Mir-acles was a better book, for having recog-nized he lost his debate with Ms. Anscombe. For Lewis to then promote her despite hav-ing been bested by her was doubly impres-sive, yet in some respects not surprising. After all, Lewis was a man who cared more about striving after truth than in attending to his pride. He cared more about learning from arguments than winning them. So should we. 
Again, this was Pete Wehner, Com-mentary Magazine, with some instruc-tive words for all of us laboring here in this body. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.

f 
ENERGY POLICY MODERNIZATION BILL Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we are winding down the day here. We have had a good opportunity for good discussion and debate about the Energy Policy Modernization Act. We took votes on three amendments, and we just concluded voice votes on six addi-tional ones on top of the two voice votes that we had. So we are moving through some of the amendments, and I think that bodes well for us. As I mentioned earlier, we will hope-fully have an opportunity to line up a series of votes in advance so that when Members come back next week we all know where we will be going and the direction. I wish to take just a few minutes tonight, before we wrap things up, to talk about a section in the bill that I believe is very important—not only important to the Energy Policy Modernization Act but really very im-portant to our Nation as a whole. The Presiding Officer and I hail from a State that has been an oil producer for decades now. It is oil that sustains us, fills our coffers, and allows for us to have an economy that is thriving and strong. It is struggling right now as we look at low production combined with low cost, but we also are a State that enjoys great resources when it comes to our minerals. We have long talked in this body over the course of years about the vulnera-bility that we have as a nation when we have to rely on others for our en-ergy resources. We talk about energy independence, we talk about energy se-curity, and, I think we recognize that when we can produce more on our own without others, it makes us less vul-nerable. Energy security translates to na-tional security. I think we pretty much got that message around here, and we are doing more within this Energy Pol-icy Modernization Act to make sure that we are less reliant on others for our energy sources, whether it is what we are doing to produce more fossil fuels or being able to leverage tech-nologies that will allow us to access our renewable resources in a way that is stronger and more robust, again to ensure we have greater energy secu-rity. When we think about energy secu-rity, we should not forget mineral se-curity—the minerals that also help to make us a great nation, and a nation that is less vulnerable when we are able to produce more of our own. For several Congresses—this is actu-ally the third consecutive Congress—I have introduced legislation on this sub-ject. It is a bill that I have titled the ‘‘American Mineral Security Act.’’ What we have done within the energy bill is take much of that legislation and include it as part of a subtitle on critical minerals. Maybe it is because I authored it, but I feel pretty strongly that this is a pretty good version. This is a pretty good title that is contained in the EPMA, and I think that passage of not only the critical minerals piece as part of EPMA is key for our eco-nomic security, energy security, and our national security. It is just the right thing for us to be doing. We take for granted that our min-erals and metals that we have available to us are going to continue to be avail-able. Unfortunately, most of us do not really pay attention to the fact that so many of the things that we rely on for so much of what we need in our every-day world come from minerals. We just do not think about it. We assume that stuff just gets here. We do not think about where it comes from. We should not ever take for granted our mineral security. We should not ever take for granted what it is that we need. People talk about rare earth ele-ments, rare earth minerals. When we think ‘‘rare,’’ what is ‘‘rare’’? What ex-actly does that mean? Why do we need them? What do we use them in? Rare earth elements make many aspects of our modern life possible. We talk a lot about how we are going to move to more renewable energy sources. You are going to need rare earth elements for wind turbines. You are going to need it for your solar pan-els. You are going to need it for your rechargeable batteries. You are going to need it for your hard drives, your smartphones, and the screens on your computer. You are going to need it for your digital cameras, for your defense applications, for audio amplification. That is just what we put on this par-ticular chart. It is important to recognize that so much of what allows us to do the good things that we do—to communicate, to help defend, to help power our coun-try—comes to us because we have ac-cess to certain minerals. According to the National Research Council, more than 25,000 pounds of new minerals are needed per person per year in the United States to make the items that we use for basic human needs, infrastructure, energy, transpor-tation, communication, and defense. You might say: Whoa, 25,000 pounds per person per year—I cannot possibly need all that stuff. But, Mr. President, you and I fly back and forth to Alaska. Those air-planes we fly on need these minerals. Every one of these young people, as well as us sitting in here, all have a smartphone or some way we are com-municating, and we all need this. All of the staff who are working on their computers need that screen to look at, and we all need this. When you think about it, it is like OK, maybe that number is right. Bill Gates put it quite memorably last year. He wrote a blog post entitled: ‘‘Have You Hugged a Concrete Pillar Today?’’ It is really a very interesting read, and it reminds us that you take for granted the things that we need, the things that we use on a daily basis, the things that are under our feet as we are walking here to work. Minerals and metals are really the foundation of our modern society. Our access to them enables a range of prod-ucts and technologies that greatly add to our quality of life. Yet many of the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S333 January 28, 2016 
trends are going in the wrong direc-tion, which creates vulnerabilities for our country. We have a real problem on our hands right now as a result of this reliance on minerals and the fact that so many of our minerals that we need today we must import. You are thinking: 25,000 pounds per person per year is a lot; where are we getting it from? How much of it are we relying on other countries, asking their permission to bring it in? It is not just rare earth elements. The reality is that the United States now depends on many, many other na-tions for a vast array of minerals and metals. We have the numbers to back that up. In 1978 the U.S. Geological Survey reported that the United States was importing at least 50 percent of our supply of 25 minerals, and 100 per-cent of 7. We recently got the latest figures from the USGS. Our foreign mineral dependence is now far deeper. In 2015, last year, we imported at least 50 per-cent of 47 different minerals, including 100 percent of 19 of them. On this list you have the minerals for which we are 100-percent reliant on foreign nations, whether it is bauxite, cesium—which we have in Alaska—graphite—which we have in Alaska—indium, iodine, man-ganese, mica, niobium, quartz, crystal. I am going to stop now because they get more difficult to pronounce. These are the minerals that we are 100-percent reliant on other nations for. What do we use them in? We use them in transistors, electrical compo-nents, mirrors, rubber, vacuum tubes, photo cells, bicycles, fishing rods, golf iron shafts, baseball bats, defense ap-plications, medical equipment, atomic clocks, aluminum, glass, enamel, bat-teries, gaskets, brake lining, fire re-tardant, magnets. Again, that is just what we can put on the charts. We are 100-percent reliant on other countries for some of the things that are basic everyday products that we do not think about. Again, we take for granted that these things are going to continue to be readily available—that it is always going to be there for us. For example, look at the cell phone. Let us look at the elements that it takes to make a smartphone. When you look at what goes into the smartphone, for your screen, indium is part of the screen. Alumina and silica are part of the screen. It is a variety of rare earth. All of these rare earths that we are looking at are 100-percent reliant on other nations for what goes into the screen. For the battery for your smartphone, we have lithium, graphite, and man-ganese. Manganese and graphite are 100-percent reliant on foreign sources. We are 50-percent reliant on lithium. You have tantalum, and we are 100- percent reliant on that. There is tin, lead, copper, silver. We are 70-percent reliant on tin. It goes to show that the things that we take for granted, the things that we are all using all the time to communicate, to send mes-sages home, to do our business, we can-not have them unless we get this from somebody else, from some other coun-try. There are options for us though, just as there are options for us with en-ergy sources. We can find ways to help us produce more when it comes to min-erals and mineral capacity so that we are less reliant. We had a hearing before our energy committee, and we had a witness by the name of Dan McGroarty, who leads the American Resources Policy Net-work. He provided some pretty good ex-amples of our Nation’s foreign mineral dependence. He pointed out that the minerals needed for clean energy tech-nologies often come from abroad, threatening our ability to manufacture those technologies here at home. This is what he wrote in his prepared testi-mony: 
Graphite is key to [electric vehicle] bat-teries and energy storage. The U.S. produces zero natural graphite—we are 100 percent im-port dependent. Indium is needed for flat-screen TVs and solar photovoltaic panels. Most indium is de-rived from zinc mining—the U.S. is 81 per-cent dependent for the zinc we use, and we produce zero indium. Thin-film solar panels are made of C-I-G-S materials—those letters stand for Copper, In-dium, Gallium, and Selenium. We have a 600,000 metric ton copper gap at present—de-mand exceeding supply. Selenium is recov-ered from copper processing. Gallium comes from aluminum proc-essing—we are 99% import-dependent—and we are closing American aluminum smelters at a record pace. 
Mr. McGroarty also highlighted the national security implications of our foreign mineral dependence, explain-ing: 
We need rhenium for high-strength alloy in the jet turbines in the F–35 and other fighter aircraft. Rhenium is dependent on copper processing—and we are 83% import-depend-ent. Congress has directed the Defense De-partment to purchase electrolytic man-ganese, used in key super-alloys, for the [de-fense stockpile]—the U.S. produces zero manganese. We need rare earths in too many applications to list: Wind turbines, lasers for medical and national security applications, smart phones and smart bombs. We produce zero rare earths—and we are once again 100% dependent on China. 
You may recall not too many years ago now when there was a little bit of an issue going on between Japan and China. China withheld delivery of cer-tain rare earth elements that Japan needed for its manufacturing. China was holding the keys. China is holding the keys with many of these minerals. Our foreign dependence is dangerous enough. You know that full well, Mr. President. The concentration of our foreign supply presents additional challenges. Our minerals often come from a handful of countries that are less than stable or that might be will-ing to cut off the supply to us to serve their own purposes or to meet their own needs. They are going to take care of themselves first. If they do not have much supply, they are going to help themselves first. When I look at our foreign mineral dependence and where those minerals are coming from, I see reason after rea-son to be concerned. It is not hard to see the prospect of a day of reckoning when this will become real to all of us, when we simply cannot acquire a min-eral or when the market for a mineral changes so dramatically that entire in-dustries are affected. To put it even more bluntly, our for-eign mineral dependence is a mounting threat to our economy, to our national security, and to our international com-petitiveness. We cannot lose sight of that international competitiveness. The absence of just one critical min-eral or metal could disrupt entire tech-nologies, entire industries, and create a ripple effect throughout our entire economy. I think it is well past time for us to be taking this seriously. We have seen some good signs from the administra-tion. However, the reality is that our executive agencies are not as coordi-nated about this as they really should be. They do not have all of the statu-tory authorities needed to make the necessary progress on this issue. There is just no substitute for legis-lation, and that is why I am very pleased that the members of the En-ergy and Natural Resources Committee accepted my language in our bill to re-build this mineral supply chain. We did this in committee with almost no sub-stantive changes. When it comes to permitting delays for new mines—you have heard me say this before—our Nation is among the worst in the world. We are almost dead last. We are stumbling right out of the gate, right out of the very start of the supply chain, and then we do not ever seem to be able to catch up. Where do you place the blame? The fall begins with us here. When we de-cide that a mineral is critical, we need to understand what we have. We need to survey our lands. We need to deter-mine the extent of our resource base so we know what we can produce right here at home. If we do not know, it makes it pretty difficult to get any-body interested in production. We should keep working on alternatives, on efficiency, and recycling options. That is not what this is about. We need to keep doing that, especially for those minerals where our Nation does not and will not ever have significant abundance there. We should build out a forecasting ca-pability so that we can gain a better understanding of mineral-related trends and also an early warning when we see that there might be issues aris-ing. We also need to have a qualified workforce. We need to make sure that we have those that can access this min-eral resource, this mineral wealth. The United States right now is down to a handful of mining schools. A large share of their faculty will be eligible to retire in the near future. We need some smart, young people who are interested and want to go into these fields.

Provisions to tackle all of these chal-lenges are contained within the bill. They have good support. The Director of the United States Geological Sur-vey, the CEOs of the Alliance of Auto-mobile Manufacturers, and the Na-tional Electrical Manufacturers Asso-ciation are among some. State wit-nesses, former military officials, and many others have endorsed this ap-proach. We have a good opportunity to bring our mineral policies into the 21st century, and the mineral subtitle in this bipartisan Energy bill offers us that chance. I want to note the other members of the energy committee who have been very helpful in helping to advance this legislation. Senator R
ISCH was very helpful as was Senator C
RAPO of Idaho and Senator H
ELLER . They were all co-sponsors of the original bill with me. There were many other cosponsors from both sides of the aisle in recent Congresses, and we also thank the Pre-siding Officer for his support as well. I also wish to acknowledge Secretary Moniz, the Secretary of Energy, and his team over there at DOE, and Direc-tor Kimball, who is the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey. They helped us a lot when it came to drafting this bill, and I thank them for that. I have consumed more time than I should, but I hope everyone can hear the enthusiasm I have in ensuring that as we modernize our energy policies, we do not take a step forward to help address what we need to do on the en-ergy front and fail to bring along the growing concerns that we have in need-ing to modernize and understand our mineral resources and how we can en-sure that there is that level of true en-ergy security that helps us with our economic security and certainly our national security. With that, I see that my colleague from Alabama is here, so I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Alabama. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Alaska for her leadership and comments on this bill, and I will have thoughts on that subject as we go forward. We have had some good things happen in en-ergy, and we need to keep having that happen. Energy serves the American people. A low cost of energy is a bless-ing, a high cost of energy is a det-riment to working families. I truly believe we need to make clear to the American people that those of us, like the Senator from Alaska who fought to increase production of en-ergy, have done so not to provide a profit to private companies but to have created a situation in which the price of energy would decline. We have had a large surge in energy, and sure enough the prices have declined. I think that is a good thing. TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to share some thoughts tonight, before we go out, about the trade issue this Nation is facing, and it is a highly sig-nificant issue. The President is ex-pected to sign the Trans-Pacific Part-nership on February 4. It is a historic event. It cannot become law of the United States of America. It is detri-mental to this economy. It is particu-larly detrimental to people who go to work every day and would like more jobs. They would like higher paying jobs and better benefits. It is detri-mental to that, and we are going to es-tablish that point. We have a Presi-dential campaign going on today and people need to talk about it. The Amer-ican people need to know where their candidates stand on it. Well, let me share a few thoughts to-night and begin this discussion. The President is expected to sign the agree-ment on February 4. He negotiated this agreement with 11 different countries in the Pacific region. At some point he will implement legislation and then Congress will vote on whether to go forward. The legislation is part of the fast-track process, so it will not be fili-bustered. The bill will come up on a simple majority vote. No amendments will be allowed. It will simply be an up- or-down vote. What is happening in the world trade market today? On Monday, January 25 of this week, Ford announced that they were leaving the Japanese and Indo-nesian markets. Indonesia and Japan are good friends of ours. They are good countries, but they are tough trading partners. Why did Ford leave Japan? They sell automobiles all over the world. They sell them in Europe, Mex-ico, and South America. Why are they not able to compete in Japan? What did Ford say? They said that nontariff barriers have prevented them from selling cars in the market. In 2015, Ford sold less than 5,000 cars in Japan, representing six-tenths of 1 per-cent of the Japanese automobile mar-ket. In fact, only 6 percent of the auto-mobiles sold in Japan are manufac-tured outside of Japan. It is not a ques-tion of tariffs. That is not the problem in dealing with Japan and importing cars into Japan. The Japanese have erected substantial nontariff barriers. In fact, Hyundai, a very fine South Ko-rean automobile company in my state, attempted to sell in Japan for some time, and they recently gave up. What is the policy of Japan? The truth is Japan talks about free trade, but like most of our Asian allies and trading competitors, they are mer-cantile. The essence of having a suc-cessful mercantile economy is to ex-port more and import less. This is the reality we are dealing with. The people who are and have been negotiating our trade agreements don’t seem to under-stand this or don’t care. In fact, they basically say: Well, if someone sells a product cheaper here, we don’t care. We will buy it. They don’t worry if we can’t sell products in their country. A trading agreement is a contract be-tween two nations—we were all taught that in law school—and it should serve the interests of both parties. When a contract ceases to advantage both par-ties, you abandon the contract. It shouldn’t be signed or it should end. What else about this agreement? It creates an international commission— a commission of the 11 or 12 countries, including the United States. The lan-guage, by definition of our own admin-istration, is that the agreement is a living agreement. The Presiding Officer is a fine law-yer. He has worked at the court of ap-peals. I know a living agreement makes the hair on the back of his neck stand up. It makes you nervous. A living agreement is no agreement at all. It can just be changed. They acknowledge and repeatedly say in the fast-track documents that nations can meet and change the agreement anytime they want. They can update it for changed circumstances, which is what activist judges say when they redefine the meaning of the U.S. Constitution. They like to say that they are updating it for changed circumstances. Well, Congress is supposed to do that, it seems to me, but anyway this agree-ment is a living agreement. It contains 5,554 pages. It is twice the length of the Holy Scriptures. It includes section 27, which sets up an international commis-sion with nearly unregulated power. In fact, our own U.S. Trade Representa-tives—our own Web site—states that the Commission is formed ‘‘to enable the updating of the agreement as ap-propriate to address trade issues that emerge in the future as well as new issues that arise with the expansion of the agreement to include new coun-tries.’’ Congress would be launching such an event into the future. Well, what is our problem? Well, what is one of the major prob-lems that we have today? It is our sub-stantial trade deficit. One report, which I think is probably conservative, says that one-half of 1 percent of the GDP has been lost in the United States as a result of our trade deficit. That is probably an acceptable economic esti-mate, and that is significant. When you have 2 percent GDP, you are losing 25 percent based on the trade deficit. We have to have growth in this country, more GDP, more Americans working, more people with better jobs and better pay, and part of that is manufacturing. The final figures for 2015 are expected to show that the bilateral trade deficit with China is increased to 8 percent to a record of around $365 billion. China is not a part of these 12 nations, but it has openly been said that they could be made a part of it in the future if coun-tries vote them in. According to the Economic Policy In-stitute, growing U.S. trade deficits with China through 2013 eliminated 3.2 million jobs. Is that an accurate fig-ure? I don’t know for sure, but no one

disputes that trade deficits with China have cost more than 1 million jobs. When you lose 1 million jobs, people go on welfare, need unemployment com-pensation or retire early. All of these are damaging events to the American economy. The White House claims that this Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement— this trade agreement—is critical to limit China’s economic influence. We are going to hear about that a lot. We are going to hear the national security argument. However, a new study just released this month by the World Bank shows that China will actually see an increase in export potential if the TPP is approved by Congress. It is not going to constrict China. The World Bank says it is going to increase China’s ability to export. The report by the World Bank stated that the overall impact on China would be ‘‘really negligible.’’ It is not a good argument to state that it is somehow going to boost other economies in the United States as it relates to China. China is not going to be hurt by this agreement. The World Bank study further re-ports that Japan would see an extra economic growth of 2.7 percent by 2030 while the United States could expect only nominal growth of perhaps four- tenths of 1 percent. Robert Scott of the Economic Policy Institute states that the TPP could slow the reshoring of American jobs, especially in the automobile sector. We have had a nice development in recent years. My State has benefited so tremendously from foreign automobile investments. Instead of making auto-mobiles in Korea, Germany, and Japan, they built plants around the country, and some were built in my home State of Alabama, and make the automobiles there. I don’t think there is any doubt that this agreement could reduce job re-shoring because there is a small tariff on imported automobiles and that would be eliminated so that little ad-vantage in moving a plant to the United States would be lost. Get this. The Fact Checker at the Washington Post gave the President’s claim that the Trans-Pacific Partner-ship would create 650,000 jobs four Pinocchios. That is a pretty bad false-hood. They ought to give it five Pinocchios. Let’s talk about reality. I have talked about trade agreements. Repub-licans favor trade agreements. I favor trade agreements, but they have to be good agreements. You have to be care-ful. What about this Korea trade agree-ment with our friends in South Korea. They are smart negotiators. Last year our trade deficit with South Korea from January to November—we don’t have the numbers for December yet— was $26 billion. Maybe the rest of the year will be about $28 to $29 billion. That would be about 15 percent higher than last year’s trade deficit with South Korea. President Obama signed the agree-ment in 2010. When he signed it, Presi-dent Obama promised that the South Korea trade deal would increase Amer-ican exports to South Korea by $11 bil-lion a year. All right. I want to be co-operative. We like our allies in South Korea, and I voted for the agreement. But what happened? Over 11 months of last year the United States exported 1.2 billion more than we did when the deal was signed in 2010—not $10 or $11 bil-lion more, $1.2 billion. The year before that it was $0.8 billion. We haven’t seen a surge of exports to South Korea. Didn’t the negotiators know that? They told us differently. What about South Korea’s imports to the United States—their exports to the United States; what about them? They have risen not $1 billion but instead $20 billion. Since 2010 our trade deficit with South Korea has risen nearly 260 percent, from $10 billion in 2010 to about $28 billion last year. That is a stunning development. So we are going to have to vote on this. And we have been told and we have beliefs that things are going to be better than that. It is not happening in that way. I urge us to study the facts and figures to be realistic. Trade is a good thing, and I have been a sup-porter. But it is not a religion with me. It is a contract. It is a deal, and deals are to serve the interests of the Amer-ican people. It has not been doing so. Even the Peterson Institute, which supports these trade agreements, said there would be 120,000 fewer manufac-turing jobs over the next 9 years if this agreement takes place in the United States. Mr. President, I see our leader. He has had a busy week. I appreciate the opportunity to share these remarks. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-jority leader is recognized.

FAREWELL TO MIKE BRUMAS Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, be-fore the Senator from Alabama leaves the floor, we had an opportunity this afternoon to say goodbye to a good man, Mike Brumas, who worked for both of us here in the Senate. It was a really good chance to thank an old friend of both of ours; didn’t the Sen-ator from Alabama think so? Mr. SESSIONS. I think so. People wonder about whom we get to work for us up here and who is helping to run this government. But Mike Brumas—14 years at the Birmingham News. I don’t think there is any doubt he was the most popular reporter in the State of Alabama for me and other people, and he was a great asset to me and to the majority leader. Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, I particularly enjoyed the observation of the Senator from Alabama of taking the chance of bringing somebody over from the dark side and had some doubts about whether he could make the transition, but he obviously did it very well. Mr. SESSIONS. He really did. He was loyal to me, and I know he was loyal to you, and he shared the visions we have tried to execute. I think the size of the crowd and the enthusiastic well wishes he got were a testament to the quality of his contribution. I thank the majority leader for hosting that event. f 
TRIBUTE TO DR. JOHN CHOWNING Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a good friend of mine and a friend to the Common-wealth of Kentucky. Dr. John Chowning, who served as the vice presi-dent for church and external relations and executive assistant to the presi-dent at Campbellsville University, has recently retired from that post after more than a quarter century with that institution. I know he is going to be greatly missed by his colleagues, by the higher education community across the State, and by all of us who work on and care about education issues. Dr. Chowning first became involved in fundraising for Campbellsville Uni-versity in 1989. He became a member of the university’s board of trustees in 1992. He served on that board for 7 years, including service as board chair. Then he became a full-time employee in 1998. He taught at the school for sev-eral years as an adjunct in the political science department and served as chair of the university’s diversity com-mittee, strategic planning, and univer-sity council. In his various roles throughout the years, Dr. Chowning has taken the lead or been a major influence on several important issues. He established a dia-logue on race to foster racial reconcili-ation. He led Greater Campbellsville United, an organization that strives to create opportunity for all residents of the Campbellsville-Taylor County re-gion. He helped found the Campbells-ville-Taylor County Economic Develop-ment Authority and served as its chair-man. Working with the Economic Develop-ment Authority, he led the way to cre-ate a dislocated worker program in Campbellsville when a factory in the region closed and caused jobs to leave the area. And I am proud of the work he and I did together to help create the university’s Technology Training Cen-ter, a partnership with local govern-ments and Campbellsville University to provide training to the local work-force. The list of people who are congratu-lating Dr. Chowning on a remarkable career of service is long, and I am proud to add my name to that list. I am pleased by the fact that Dr. Chowning will remain on in a part-time capacity so Campbellsville University and the Commonwealth can continue to reap the benefit of his knowledge, wisdom, and experience. I want to wish him and his family the very best as he begins this new chapter.

SJOHNCHOWNING ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT  
AS OF JAN. 1 (By Joan McKinney) Dr. John Chowning, vice president for church and external relations and executive assistant to the president at Campbellsville University and a former chair and board member of the Campbellsville University Board of Trustees, has announced his retire-ment effective Jan. 1, 2016. Dr. Michael V. Carter, president of Camp-bellsville University, with whom Chowning worked for 17 years, said, ‘‘John Chowning is one of the most gifted individuals I have ever met. He is a great thinker, and he is wise in his approach to topics across a broad spec-trum. ‘‘John is a very good writer, an accom-plished speaker, teacher and preacher. He is detailed and is a well-read public policy ana-lyst on a broad array of topics. ‘‘We will miss him on a day-to-day basis, but we are so fortunate he is serving in a new part-time role for the university.’’ Chowning is retiring after 26 years of serv-ice to Campbellsville University. However, he will continue to work part time as execu-tive assistant to the president for govern-ment, community and constituent relations beginning in January 2016. Chowning became involved in fundraising with Campbellsville University in 1989 and became a member of the university’s Board of Trustees in 1992. He continued on the board for the next seven years, serving as chair in 1996 and 1997. He became a full-time employee in February 1998. Dr. Joseph L. Owens, who is serving his fifth term as chair of the Campbellsville Uni-versity Board of Trustees, said, ‘‘Dr. John Chowning is a shining example of selfless service that has made a difference in many lives at Campbellsville University. He is highly motivated, personable and a spirit- filled man of God. ‘‘His love for the Lord is exemplified in his Christ-like character, as well as his concern for excelling in diversity, diplomacy and the development of bridge-building relation-ships.’’ Serving as executive vice president for church and external relations and executive assistant to the president has been ‘‘a very humbling and rewarding career path in which God’s divine guidance has been evi-dent in the progress CU has seen,’’ Chowning said. He taught as an adjunct for several years in Campbellsville University’s political science department. He has served as chair of the university’s diversity committee, stra-tegic planning and University Council. Chowning founded and has directed the Kentucky Heartland Institute on Public Pol-icy at Campbellsville University which has hosted a wide array of speakers and forums on a host of public policy issues. Chowning has been involved in many en-deavors at Campbellsville University includ-ing race reconciliation, and establishing Dia-logue on Race, a project dear to his heart. He has served as a leader of Greater Campbells-ville United, the focus of which is to help create an environment of equality and oppor-tunity for all residents of Campbellsville- Taylor County and the heartland region of Kentucky. Chowning was one of the founding mem-bers of Team Taylor County (Campbellsville- Taylor County Economic Development Au-thority) and served for several years as chair and continues as a member of the board. He received the Governor’s Development Leadership Award in 1999 and was named Cit-izen of the Year for Campbellsville-Taylor County two separate years by the Campbells-ville-Taylor County Chamber of Commerce. Chowning was founding member of the Center for Rural Development and former chair; founding member of the Southern Kentucky Economic Development Corpora-tion and former chair; and founding member and former board member and secretary of Forward in the Fifth education reform group. With his work with the Economic Develop-ment Authority in Campbellsville, he was in-strumental in organizing a dislocated worker program at Campbellsville when Fruit of the Loom closed in Campbellsville in 1997–98. With the support of CU presidents Dr. Ken Winters and Carter, Chowning proposed the university’s Technology Training Center and coordinated efforts to secure funding for the project by working with U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell. Chowning has left his mark on Campbells-ville University with the naming of the Pence-Chowning Art Gallery, the Chowning Art Shop, the Chowning Executive Dining Room and the Chowning Patio. He and his wife, Cathy Pence Chowning, have established an endowed scholarship fund at Campbellsville University that pro-vides annual scholarship awards to quali-fying minority students. In his role as a pastor, Chowning is an ac-tive member and former secretary of Taylor County Ministerial Association and is a member of the executive boards of Taylor County Baptist Association and Zion Dis-trict Association of Baptists. He has led his church, Saloma Baptist Church of which he has served as senior pas-tor since 1994, to become a member of the General Association of Baptists in Kentucky, the state’s historic black Baptist state con-vention—one of two historically Anglo Bap-tist churches to join the GABKY. He has been active in the life of the GABKY for the past several years. Chowning has a master’s of public adminis-tration (planning emphasis) from Eastern Kentucky University; a bachelor of arts in political science from Transylvania Univer-sity, and an associate of arts from Lindsey Wilson College. ‘‘From serving as trustee chair and vice chair and two terms as a board member to the past 18 years in my current role, my as-sociation with Campbellsville University has been one of the most rewarding and mean-ingful affiliations of my career,’’ Chowning said. f

HOLD ON S. 2415 Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to inform my colleagues that I have placed a hold on S. 2415, the EB– 5 Integrity Act of 2015. I have been working for years to reform the EB–5 immigrant investor program, which is run by the U.S. Citizenship and Immi-gration Services, and have introduced legislation with Senator L
EAHY to overhaul the program. Our bill, S. 1501, is a comprehensive approach to dealing with the fraud, abuse, and national security vulnera-bilities. Our bill also restores the pro-gram back to its original intent to en-sure that rural and high unemploy-ment areas have access to this source of capital. S. 2415 is a bill that is modeled al-most identically after S. 1501; yet it is weaker and leaves behind many provi-sions that would in fact bring integrity back into the program. Late last year, I objected to bringing S. 2415 up by unanimous consent and have placed a hold on the bill because I hoped we could consider more effective measures to root out fraud and abuse and create real jobs and do it in a comprehensive manner that ensures the program is able to work for every part of the coun-try for years to come. As I stated previously on this floor, the failure to include needed reforms last year means the program continues to pose risks to the homeland. I am not so sure reforms are possible anymore. It may be time to do away with it com-pletely. Nevertheless, if we pass legislation to extend the EB–5 program beyond this fiscal year, I hope to work with my col-leagues to achieve true reform.

HONORING CHRISTA M CAULIFFE AND THE ENTIRE ‘‘CHAL-LENGER’’ CREW Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I wish to salute the memory of the seven brave crewmembers of Space Shuttle Challenger, who perished on a mission of exploration and discovery 30 years ago today, on January 28, 1986. I honor the memory of all seven Challenger crewmembers: Gregory Jarvis, Judith Resnik, Francis Scobee, Ronald McNair, Michael Smith, Ellison Onizuka, and Christa McAuliffe. Indeed, Congress permanently honors the Challenger crew with a painted lu-nette medallion of the crew promi-nently placed in the Brumidi Corridor of the Capitol Building, one floor below this Chamber. In that painting, six of the crewmembers are depicted holding their helmets in their arms, but one crewmember, Christa McAuliffe, is holding in her arms not her helmet but a globe. For Granite Staters and for teachers and educators all across America and the world, there is a very special place in our hearts for Christa McAuliffe, a social studies teacher at Concord High School who was selected from more than 11,000 applicants to become the first NASA teacher in space. During a year of extensive training at NASA before the mission, Christa created science lessons that she planned to teach from space while on board Challenger, broadcasting her les-sons and observations to students all across Earth. As a former teacher, I witnessed the impact that Christa’s participation had on students and teachers. The Chal-lenger was integrated into the class-room curriculum, allowing students to discover a passion for science. We con-tinue to see the contributions of the Challenger’s crew in the students who pursue careers in the sciences and in the success of recent NASA missions. I am especially pleased to witness Christa McAuliffe’s continuing impact in advancing education in the STEM fields—science, technology, engineer-ing, and math—and encouraging young people—especially young women—to pursue careers in STEM fields. A few months after the accident, the families of the Challenger’s crew cre-ated the first Challenger Center for Space Science Education, a nonprofit that engages students and teachers in hands-on education in science, tech-nology, engineering, and mathematics. Since then, 40 Challenger learning cen-ters have opened their doors in the U.S. and other countries, and they are ex-panding opportunities for innovative programs and activities in STEM . We all appreciate that this is a very difficult day for the many outstanding professionals at NASA. On that day, they lost seven wonderful colleagues. Our heart goes out to the NASA family and the families of all seven crew-members on this day of remembrance. As an astronaut, Christa McAuliffe was on a mission to outer space. But, as a teacher, she was also on a personal mission to educate and enlighten. She opened the eyes of young people around the world to the wonders of our planet and universe. Today, we remember and honor her bravery, her passion for teaching, and her tremendous legacy.

HONORING OFFICER DOUG BARNEY Mr. LEE. Mr. President, on Sunday, January 17, 2016, this country lost an American hero—Officer Doug Barney of the Unified Police Department in Salt Lake County, Utah, was shot and killed in the line of duty. He died hon-orably, doing what he loved to do: serv-ing and protecting his community. Every day of his 18 years on the force, Officer Barney made his commu-nity not just safer but better. I know this not from personal experience—I was not one of those fortunate enough to have met Officer Barney—but from the community’s response to his un-timely death. When the tragic news spread across Utah and the Nation, those who knew him or knew of him—and it was hard to live in Salt Lake County without knowing Officer Barney—sprung into action to support his family and to commemorate his life of service. The most important step was taken first: to surround Officer Barney’s wife and three teenage children with love, comfort, and assistance. The out-pouring of support came not just from friends, family, and neighbors, but from strangers, too. Nanette Wride and Shante Johnson didn’t know Officer Barney, but they were among the first to join his wife, Erika, on her long journey of healing. Indeed, Wride and Johnson came as fellow travelers on that journey—they, too, had suffered the loss of a husband serving on the front lines of law enforcement—know-ing all too well the unique challenges facing the Barney family during this trying time. Then there was the candlelight vigil honoring Officer Barney, hosted by the Salt Lake Valley Law Enforcement As-sociation and the city of Holladay, UT. Despite bitterly cold temperatures, hundreds of friends and neighbors huddled to pay their respects to the man who had meant so much to so many. That same night, another ceremony took place at the Utah State capitol, as firefighters, first responders, and po-lice officers gathered to receive the U.S. honor flag at the end of its thou-sand-mile journey from Fort Worth, TX. The flag has flown over battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as Ground Zero in New York City, and now, it is escorted by State troopers to communities across America that are mourning the loss and honoring the sacrifice of those who have been killed in the line of duty. It stayed with Offi-cer Barney’s body until his funeral, which brought together thousands from across the country. This was not the first time Doug Bar-ney galvanized his community. In 2010, the students, teachers, and administra-tors of Eisenhower Junior High School rallied behind Officer Barney who was in the middle of what would become a 12-year battle with cancer. To the stu-dents, Officer Barney, the school’s re-source officer, was ‘‘one of the good guys,’’ so they organized a dodge-ball tournament—they called it the Battle for Barney—that raised over $1,000 to help him pay for his medical treat-ment. All of this stands as a testament to the profound impact Officer Barney had on the people and the community he dedicated his life to serve. Standing 6 feet, 5 inches tall, he had the physical attributes to be a good police officer, but as someone who genuinely re-spected and cared about everyone he

met, he had the character to be a good person. And that is how Officer Barney will forever be remembered. His death serves as a stark reminder of the dangers our law enforcement personnel face every single day. Living with the hazards of the job takes a tre-mendous amount of courage. And Offi-cer Barney was as brave as they come. Whenever he had to take time off from work for his cancer treatments, he was always eager to return. In fact, he had not been scheduled to work on January 17—that fateful Sunday when he gave the ultimate sacrifice. But with med-ical bills to pay and a family to feed, he volunteered to work overtime— which is exactly what you would ex-pect from a man like Officer Barney, who chose to enter the police force 18 years ago for just one reason, to help people. Doug Barney was taken from this life tragically early, but he did more good in his 44 years on this Earth than most of us can hope to accomplish in a life-time. May he rest in peace, and may God bless his family and the commu-nity he served. It will never be the same without him.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO MASTER SERGEANT RAYMOND E. KELLEY ∑Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the exceptionally meri-torious career of one of this Nation’s finest, MSG Raymond E. Kelley, on his retirement after 26 years of sacrifice and selfless service to the United States of America and the State of West Virginia. Master Sergeant Kelley’s career began on February 12, 1983, and ended upon his retirement on December 28, 2015. He first enlisted in Parkersburg, WV, as a heavy equipment operator with Company C, 463rd Engineer Bat-talion in the U.S. Army Reserve. In 1985, Master Sergeant Kelley trans-ferred to the Navy, serving as a Seabee, completing deployments to Somalia and Bahrain through October 1993. After a break in service, Master Ser-geant Kelley returned to the Navy Re-serves in 1996 and later joined the West Virginia Army National Guard in Feb-ruary 2000 as a staff sergeant and was assigned as a combat engineer section leader. In 2003, Master Sergeant Kelley deployed to Iraq with the Headquarters and Support Company 1092nd Engineer Battalion as a construction foreman. Following the deployment, Master Sergeant Kelley was promoted and served as a platoon sergeant for the 119th Engineer Support Company, Clarksburg, WV, and the 1st Detach-ment of the 1092nd, Headquarters and Support Company, Point Pleasant, WV. In 2006, Master Sergeant Kelley was assigned to the 193rd Equipment Sup-port Platoon in Moundsville, WV, where he served as the senior non-commissioned officer for the unit and the unit full-time readiness non-commissioned officer. In 2011, Master Sergeant Kelley was transferred to the 1092nd Engineer Bat-talion, Headquarters and Support Com-pany as the assistant operations ser-geant and was promoted in September 2012 as the battalion operations ser-geant. His awards and decorations include a Meritorious Service Medal, second award; Army Commendation Medal, third award; Army Reserve Component Achievement Medal, third award; Army Achievement Medal, third award; Na-tional Defense Service Medal, second award; Global War on Terrorism Expe-ditionary Medal; Global War on Ter-rorism Service Medal; Iraq Campaign Medal with Campaign Star; Armed Forces Reserve Medal with Mobiliza-tion Device; Army Service Ribbon; Non-Commissioned Officer Ribbon, third award; Overseas Service Ribbon; Combat Action Badge; Joint Meri-torious Unit Award; Army Good Con-duct Medal, second award; Army Meri-torious Unit Commendation; United States Navy Presidential Unit Com-mendation; Navy Presidential Unit Ci-tation; Navy Achievement Medal, third award; United States Navy Overseas Service Ribbon; Navy Good Conduct Award, second award; West Virginia Emergency Service Medal, third award; WV State Service Ribbon, third award; West Virginia Achievement Ribbon; and West Virginia National Guard Min-uteman Ribbon, third award. Master Sergeant Kelley made signifi-cant contributions to all of the units to which he has been assigned throughout his 26 years of service. As the platoon sergeant for the 193rd Equipment Sup-port Platoon, his unit consistently maintained strength in excess of 100 percent and had the highest morale of any unit in the 1092nd Engineer Bat-talion. As the battalion operations ser-geant, Master Sergeant Kelley man-aged all training events and training requirements, ensuring subordinate units were prepared for all potential missions. Master Sergeant Kelley resides with his wife, Rhonda, in Parkersburg, WV. They have three children: Seth, Hanna, and Chance. Master Sergeant Kelley is a fellow runner, as well as an avid out-doorsman. I wish him a fond farewell and the best of luck in the next phase of his life. He has shown leadership and wisdom throughout his numerous as-signments. He has made a difference in the readiness of the West Virginia Na-tional Guard, in the morale of his units, and most importantly, in the lives of thousands of servicemembers. He has been an asset and a treasure; his presence will be missed by many and by the West Virginia National Guard as a whole. Master Sergeant Kelley, I am hon-ored to call you a fellow West Vir-ginian; but most of all, thankful for your endless dedication that has meant so much, to so many.∑ TRIBUTE TO JUDGE JOHN J. DRISCOLL ∑Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the distinguished ca-reer of the Honorable John J. Driscoll who retired on December 31, 2015, as a senior judge from the Westmoreland County Court of Common Pleas. His distinctive career as an elected public official spans more than three decades and is marked by excellence, dedication, hard work, and a genuine love for serving others. Improving the lives of others has been of paramount importance throughout his career. In 1984, Judge Driscoll served as the Westmoreland County district attor-ney. As a district attorney, Judge Dris-coll was one of the first in Pennsyl-vania to have a victim witness coordi-nator, whose duties included informing victims of the case status, assisting eli-gible victims with obtaining funds under the Pennsylvania Victim Com-pensation Assistance Fund, and helping victims to receive restitution from de-fendants found guilty. A decade later, he was appointed to an open seat on the Westmoreland County Court of Common Pleas and was elected in 1995 to continue his serv-ice. After a brief stint in criminal court, Judge Driscoll returned to fam-ily court because he believed it was the best way to help children, not only in custody cases, but also in other cases affecting juveniles. His work with juve-nile offenders and exchanges with their parents played an important role in making lasting changes in their lives and reducing crime in the community. Furthermore, Judge Driscoll has been a strong advocate for offender rehabilita-tion as an effective way to reduce re-cidivism. His commitment to the community has also been a constant throughout his career, including his work as a trustee on the Board of Excela Health, a Paul Harris Fellow from the Greens-burg Rotary Club, and as a past chair of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s criminal procedural rules committee. Judge Driscoll has received many re-wards for his service including the Fred Funari Mental Health Association Award of Distinction from the Mental Health Association of Westmoreland County. Judge Driscoll has also had a most distinguished career in the Navy and received several awards for service to his country. They include the Naval Achievement Medal, the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal, the Presi-dential Unit Citation, and the National Defense Service Medal for exception-ally meritorious service as part of U.S. naval support activity in Danang, Re-public of Vietnam. Although he officially retired on De-cember 31, 2012, Judge Driscoll contin-ued to serve the court during the past 3 years. Despite being paid for only 10 days of service each month, I under-stand he generally arrived to work early and often left well after closing time. I know his colleagues in the

RECOGNIZING THE LOUISIANA MUNICIPAL ASSOCIATION ∑Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, today I am honored to have the opportunity to acknowledge and express gratitude to the Louisiana Municipal Association, LMA, in recognition of their 90th anni-versary. Founded in 1926, the Louisiana Con-ference of Mayors was created with the purpose of providing a forum for mu-tual consultation and discussion of var-ious topics affecting municipal govern-ment. The organization also aided the growth and development of each mu-nicipality through education about best practices problem solving. Shortly after the Louisiana Conference of May-ors was created, the Great Depression swept the Nation. In 1937, a handful of resilient mayors met to revive the or-ganization, giving it new life as the Louisiana Municipal Association. They may not have foreseen that their te-nacity in overcoming adversity during the Great Depression and taking proactive steps to keep Louisiana mu-nicipalities united and strong would form the basis for the core values to which the LMA still adheres today. From its inception, the LMA has fo-cused on helping local elected leaders create and maintain efficient and effec-tive municipal governments. In 1987, the nonprofit, nonpartisan LMA cre-ated Risk Management, Inc., RMI, to address the insurance and liability de-mands of member municipalities through its inter-local risk pool. In 1999, the Louisiana Municipal Advisory and Technical Services Bureau, Inc., LaMATS, was created with the purpose of providing essential services to assist municipalities in their day-to-day op-erations. In addition to these wholly owned subsidiaries, the LMA has three polit-ical subdivisions—Louisiana Municipal Gas Authority, Unemployment Com-pensation Fund, and Louisiana Com-munity Development Authority; four advisory organizations—Louisiana As-sociation of Chiefs of Police, Louisiana Rural Water Association, Louisiana Conference of Mayors, and Louisiana Municipal Black Caucus Association; and nine affiliate organizations—Mu-nicipal Employees Retirement System, Louisiana City Attorneys Association, Louisiana Association of Municipal Secretaries and Assistants, Louisiana Recreation and Parks Association, Louisiana Association of Tax Adminis-trators, Louisiana Municipal Clerks Association, Building Officials Associa-tion of Louisiana, Louisiana Airport Managers and Associates, and Lou-isiana Fire Chiefs Association. For decades, the LMA has had tre-mendous success engaging with its State and Federal partners. In the Lou-isiana Legislature, the LMA has been a strong voice in the efforts to fight blight, promote law enforcement, and enhance economic growth. On the Fed-eral level, the LMA joined forces with the National League of Cities and other coastal State municipal leagues to lead the charge in petitioning Congress to enact the Homeowners Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014, which en-acted critical reforms to the Biggert Waters Act of 2012. I was proud to work with the LMA on the inclusion of the Grimm-Cassidy amendment to this leg-islation, thereby facilitating affordable homeowner flood insurance in Lou-isiana and across the country. For 90 years, the LMA has worked to strengthen Louisiana through support and empowerment of municipal govern-ment. The organization has launched a yearlong celebration of this anniver-sary by naming 2016 the ‘‘Year of Edu-cation.’’ Opening festivities for this theme will commence in February under the auspices of the 2016 LMA ex-ecutive board officers—President Mayor Carroll Breaux of Springhill, First Vice President Mayor Barney Arceneaux of Gonzales, Second Vice President Mayor Lawrence Henagan of DeQuincy, Immediate Past President Mayor David Camardelle of Grand Isle, and District A Vice President Mayor Jimmy Williams of Sibley. The execu-tive director of LMA is Ronnie Harris, former 28-year mayor of Gretna. What started out as a collection of 29 forward-thinking mayors seeking to empower their communities has evolved into a praiseworthy organiza-tion that has earned the esteem and trust of local, State, and Federal elect-ed officials, as well as fellow municipal leagues. I would like to congratulate the LMA on its 90th anniversary and wish them many more years of strength and excel-lence.∑

REMEMBERING JACK REED, SR. ∑Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the State of Mississippi and the city of Tupelo lost a leader and model citizen with the passing of Jack Reed, Sr., on January 27. He led a remarkable life and earned an enviable reputation as a businessman, community leader, civil rights advocate, and education re-former. His tireless work in these roles was felt throughout Mississippi and set an example for embracing our better nature in facing all challenges. It has been a great privilege to have known Jack Reed. He was the epitome of a goodhearted man and my friend. I join a grateful State in expressing our appreciation for a life well lived that benefited us all. I ask that a January 28, 2016, article titled ‘‘Tupelo Spirit loses a star: Reed remembered as one of Tupelo’s best’’ from the Daily Journal newspaper be printed in the RECORD . The material follows: 
[From the Daily Journal, Jan. 28, 2016] T
UPELO SPIRT LOSES A STAR: REED R
EMEMBERED AS ONE OF TUPELO ’SBEST T
UPELO .—Jack Raymond Reed, 91, Tupelo’s pre-eminent civic leader, died Wednesday at his residence. Reed was among the last of a Greatest Generation cadre of Tupelo’s business and professional leadership who, after World War II, transformed a pleasant county-seat town into a thriving city which became a regional magnet for economic growth, employment, strong public education and a vigorous arts and cultural community. Reed earned a national reputation as an el-oquent advocate for racial fairness and rec-onciliation in Mississippi. He had served as a member of the United Methodist Church’s Commission on Religion and Race, through which he became friends with key leaders in the national Civil Rights Movement. ‘‘Of all the people I have known in our state of Mississippi, none has been more in-spiring than Jack Reed. He was a leader in every way his whole lifetime,’’ said former Mississippi Gov. William Winter. ‘‘He was right and generous and fair in his personal, private and public views. He was an inspira-tion to me in both political and personal re-lationships. Jack commanded respect. He did nothing that was detrimental to our state or the principles for which he stood. He was a Christian man, an active member of his be-loved Methodist church. He has made a mark in Mississippi that will live forever.’’ Reed was chairman of R.W. Reed Co., the retail store founded by his father in the early 20th century, and he led Reed Manufac-turing, which was a major force among Mis-sissippi garment industry employers in its heyday. Funeral services will be 11 a.m. Saturday at First United Methodist Church. Visitation will be from 4 to 7 p.m. Friday at the church. Reed, born May 19, 1924, in Tupelo, was the son of Robert W. Reed Sr. and Hoyt Ray-mond Reed, herself a descendant of an early, influential Lee County family. Reed and his brothers, R.W. Reed Jr. and William Reed, were high-profile leaders in the region’s business and manufacturing community for more than 50 years. Reed graduated from Tupelo High School with honors, attended Vanderbilt University and graduated with a bachelor’s degree with honors in 1947, following an interruption of his college days for service in the South Pa-cific during World War II in the Signal Intel-ligence Service, U.S. Army of Occupation. Following the war, Reed earned a master’s degree in retailing from New York Univer-sity and returned to Tupelo, where he joined the businesses founded by his father and his father’s brothers. ‘‘Since the 1950s, Jack was considered to be in the upper leadership tier of the Tupelo area and from that platform, he really helped thousands of people by supporting nu-merous programs and initiatives,’’ said Lewis Whitfield, senior vice president of the CREATE Foundation. ‘‘He cared deeply about all people everywhere, and he was of course a tremendous advocate for education. He saw education as not only the key to community and economic development, but as a way for people to improve themselves. Jack was a great man and he left his mark on virtually every good thing in this commu-nity.’’ Reed was a director emeritus of the Daily Journal’s corporate board of directors, a po-sition in which he served for a half century.

Reed had been a close friend, confidant and community builder with the late George McLean, the Daily Journal’s executive edi-tor, publisher and the founder of CREATE, the not-for-profit foundation which owns all stock in Journal Inc. ‘‘Jack Reed lived a remarkable life, a life marked by love for his family, love for his community and really a love for all man-kind,’’ said former Daily Journal publisher Billy Crews, now a development officer at the University of Mississippi. ‘‘He is among the best businessmen I have ever known, in part because his trade was only a portion of his total business interest. His combination of intellect, humor and optimism influenced thousands of others and the very culture of Tupelo and Northeast Mississippi. He was a pioneering leader in education and race rela-tions.’’ Reed was no stranger to community in-volvement. He was active in his whole career in the Mississippi Economic Council, of which he served as president in 1964; presi-dent of the Mississippi Retail Merchants in 1967; chair of the Tupelo Community Devel-opment Foundation in 1968; president of the Yocona Council of the Boy Scouts of Amer-ica; national president of the Vanderbilt Alumni Association in 1972 and 1973; chair of the administrative board of the First United Methodist Church; chair of the Governor’s Special Committee of Public Education in 1980 and 1981; chair of the State Board of Education; a member of the board of trustees of Millsaps College; a founding member of the executive committee of Lee United Neighbors; chair of the board of CREATE; founding director of LIFT Inc. and chair of the National Advisory Council on Education Research and Improvement from 1991 through 1994. In addition, he received Tupelo’s Outstanding Citizen Award in 1971 and Lifetime Achievement Award in 2000. ‘‘He was a very compassionate man, always willing to help those in troubling situations and people in every kind of life situation,’’ said Guy Mitchell III, an attorney and con-fidant of Reed’s. ‘‘He was a giant as far as our city is concerned.’’ He was married to Frances Purvis Reed, and they were the parents of four children, all of whom returned to Tupelo after college, three of them working for R.W. Reed Co. The fourth owns an investment firm in Tupelo. Jack Reed Jr. served as Tupelo mayor for one term, from 2009–13. Reed was well known statewide and worked with other leaders of many political persuasions for causes held in common. ‘‘He was a strong leader, not only on the local level but on the state level. A very open minded and fair thinking person,’’ said Tupelo City Council member Nettie Davis, the longest serving council member and life-long Tupelo resident. ‘‘He’s one that stood out as far as providing unity and good lead-ership. I think it’s going to be a great loss to our city, our area and the state of Mis-sissippi.’’ Reed chaired Mississippi’s first lay State Board of Education from 1982–87, and later was tapped by President George H.W. Bush to head up the National Advisory Committee on Education Research and Improvement. Reed’s stance on public education was a dominating portion of his campaign as the Republican nominee for governor in 1987. Reed eventually lost that race to Democrat Ray Mabus. Reed, in a 1999 archived interview for the University of Southern Mississippi, described his early years in Tupelo. ‘‘Well, it was different. It was a good time for me,’’ Reed said in the interview. ‘‘My fa-ther was a merchant here, and my mother was also a native of this area. I had two brothers; we had a nice home. And of course, in this area, if you had anything at all, serv-ants were plentiful in those days. So, we al-ways had a cook, and it was in the Depres-sion. We were aware of the Depression, but my father, fortunately, sold his business at the . . . appropriate time, and just before the Depression hit its bottom. And he bought it back within a year for considerably less than he sold it for, and it gave him enough inven-tory to keep things going. So, we weathered the Depression better than most.’’ Reed also was an adolescent when the 1936 tornado—a deadly, devastating storm— struck, and he recalls its impact on the city. ‘‘Our home was literally destroyed by the tornado,’’ Reed said. ‘‘People were killed across the street, and next door and behind us, but we survived that. Interestingly, dur-ing that time of the tornado, the store was not damaged. So, [my father] opened the store, told his friends to take what they needed, pay him when they could. I don’t think he lost any money on the basis of that.’’ But above all his civic, business and other contributions to Tupelo, Northeast Mis-sissippi and the state, Reed said he always placed family as a top priority. ‘‘The conclusion is family has been the most important thing in my life; remains so; has always been,’’ Reed said. ‘‘I’m a privi-leged person. All four of my children, went away, out of this state to college. All four of them are living here, now. I see my four chil-dren and my grandchildren every day unless something exceptional [happens]. We work together. My brothers and I were business partners for 50 years. ‘‘I’ve been in one church all of my life. All of my children went to Tupelo public schools. I know some people would think that that’s pretty provincial, but there’s a stability to it that I have found has been very satisfying to me. So, that’s the conclu-sion to my memoir.’’∑ f 
TRIBUTE TO GIL CARMICHAEL ∑Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this weekend, Disney Pictures will release ‘‘The Finest Hours,’’ a cinematic re-telling of a 1952 Coast Guard rescue mission off the New England coast. I am pleased to use its release as an op-portunity to commend Mr. Gil Car-michael of Meridian, MS, an important participant in this mission, for his bravery during that storm and for a lifetime of service to the State of Mis-sissippi and the Nation. Mr. Car-michael, an ensign in the U.S. Coast Guard at the time, was awarded the Silver Life-Saving Medal for his heroic actions during that rescue mission. A 1952 Coast Guard news release de-scribed the rescue: 
FOR RELEASE AT 10 : 30 A.M., MAY 14 , 1952 Twenty-one Coast Guardsmen were deco-rated today by Edward H. Foley, Under Sec-retary of the Treasury, and Vice Admiral Merlin O’Neill, Coast Guard Commandant, for the rescue of 70 men in a heavy storm at sea Feb. 18–19. The rescued men were crew members of the tankers SS FORT MERCER and SS PEN-DLETON which broke in two in 70-knot winds and 60-foot seas off the coast of Cape Cod, Mass. The group ceremony was held in the Treas-ury before members of Congress and high ranking Coast Guard officers. Members of Congress from the homes of each man deco-rated, and members of committees which handle Coast Guard legislation, also were in-vited. Also present were William B. St. John of the National Bulk Carriers, Inc., owner of the PENDELTON, and C.A. Thomas, W.G. Johnson and P.J. Clausen of the Trinidad Corp., owner of the FORT MERCER. Admiral O’Neill described the Cape Cod rescue operations as unique in Coast Guard history. With each tanker broken in two forty miles apart, four hulks with survivors aboard were left adrift in the mountainous seas. He said all types of rescue equipment were used including large Coast Guard cutters, an airplane, an ocean-going tug, motor life-boats, radar, rubber liferafts, scramble nets, lifelines and exposure suits. ″But most of all,’’ said Admiral O’Neill, ‘‘the situation called for raw courage and skill of the highest order—backed by Coast Guard teamwork.’’ Five of the men received the Treasury’s Gold Life-saving Medal for ‘‘extreme and he-roic daring.’’ Four others received the Treas-ury’s Silver Life-saving Medal for ‘‘heroic action.’’ Fifteen were cited for ‘‘courage, ini-tiative and unswerving devotion to duty’’ and authorized to wear the Coast Guard Commendation ribbon. Those decorated were: Gold Life-Saving Medal: Andrew J. Fitzgerald, Engineman 2nd class; Ervin E. Maske, Seaman; Bernard C. Webber, Boatswain’s Mate 1st class; Richard P. Livesey, Seaman; Ensign William R. Kiely, Jr. Silver Life-Saving Medal: Paul R. Black, Engineman 2nd class; En-sign Gilbert E. Carmichael; Edward A. Mason, Jr., Apprentice Seaman; Webster G. Terwilliger, Seaman Coast Guard Commendation Ribbon: Antonio F. Ballerini, Boatswain’s Mate 3rd class provisional; Donald H. Bangs, Boat-swain’s Mate Chief; Richard J. Ciccone, Sea-man; John J. Courtney, Boatswain’s Mate 3rd class; John F. Dunn, Engineman 1st class; Philip M. Griebel, Radioman 1st class; Emory H. Haynes, Engineman 1st class; Ro-land W. Hoffert, Gunner’s Mate 3rd class; Eu-gene W. Korpusik, Seaman Apprentice; Ralph L. Ormsby, Boatswain’s Mate Chief; Dennis J. Perry, Seaman; Donald E. Pitts, Seaman; Alfred J. Roy, Boatswain’s Mate 1st class; Herman M. Rubinsky, Seaman Appren-tice; LCDR John N. Joseph A nor’easter is a remarkable event in any era. The 1952 winter storm spawned hurricane-force winds and waves as tall as most of the office buildings at the time. The brave members of our Coast Guard raced into this dangerous situa-tion to locate two large tankers that had broken in two and to rescue 70 men facing nearly certain death. When asked about the rescue, a self-less Mr. Carmichael, who was in charge of a rescue boat that rescued two men from the bow of the SS Fort Mercer that day, said, ‘‘I learned early in life how I would behave in crisis. I knew when we put the boat over we could be killed but all of us were just thinking about trying to save lives rather than of our own safety.’’ Gil Carmichael took the remarkable experience he gained in the Coast Guard and continued on the path of public service, later for statewide of-fice in Mississippi in the 1960s, as a candidate for the U.S. Senate in 1972, twice for Governor in 1975 and 1979, and once for Lieutenant Governor in 1983. He also served as a delegate from Mis-sissippi to the Republican National

Convention. In 1973, he was appointed to the National Highway Safety Advi-sory Committee and became chairman of the advisory committee until 1976. From 1976 to 1979, he was a Federal commissioner for the National Trans-portation Policy Study Commission. He became Administrator of the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Fed-eral Railroad Administration in 1989 and served until 1993. He later served as chairman of the Amtrak Reform Coun-cil. It is a pleasure to acknowledge Mr. Carmichael whose selfless personal qualities reflect a great deal of credit on my State and this Nation. ∑

TRIBUTE TO BRIGADIER GENERAL BRUCE BRAMLETTE ∑Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize former BG Bruce Bramlette of Fort Benton, MT, on be-half of his lifetime of dedication to our Nation and his selfless service on con-gressional U.S. Military Academy nom-ination boards. Bruce has tirelessly served on nomination boards for 25 years, both as a member and board chairman, and has interviewed more than 1,000 young Montana students seeking a nomination to one of our Na-tion’s service academies. Throughout his years of conducting interviews, he has had numerous opportunities to meet and interact with incredible stu-dents from all over Montana. Bruce said it was his pleasure to help these students pursue their dreams of becom-ing an officer in one of our Nation’s military branches. In addition to Bruce’s tremendous volunteer hours for the nomination boards, he proudly served in the Mon-tana Air National Guard for 34 years. He retired in 1994 as the assistant adju-tant general for air for the State of Montana. As a National Guard fighter pilot, Bruce successfully flew over 2,000 hours in the F106 Dart, F102 Dagger, and F89 Scorpion. A graduate of Montana State Univer-sity, Bruce has also been an active member in his community. He has served on the Highwood School Board for 9 years, is a lifelong member of the Air Force Association, and is an active member of Representative R
YAN Z
INKE’s Veterans Advisory Board. Bruce and his wife of 43 years, Miriam, have three daughters and nine grand-children. Bruce recognizes the great value in supporting our next generation of lead-ers—especially those who will be de-fending and protecting our country. I am deeply thankful for Bruce’s years of service to our State and Nation and his tireless work on behalf of Montana stu-dents.∑

REMEMBERING BIG ED SMITH ∑Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I would like to honor Edward B. Smith—a man of great character and a dedicated pub-lic servant who was called home on January 25, 2016, at the age of 95. ‘‘Big Ed’’ was born in Dagmar, MT, in 1920. He and his wife, Juliet, raised four children near the family homestead, where Ed helped manage the family farm and ranch. He was an avid hunter and sportsman and earned his nick-name ‘‘Big Ed’’ while playing in the Big Muddy Baseball league. Ed was an active member of the Sheridan County community, serving as a member of the Sheridan County Stockman Associa-tion, Wool Growers, and the Sheridan County Fair board, as well as a 4–H leader. Ed’s heart for service led him to run for the Montana State Legislature in 1966, where he served for 20 years. In 1972, Ed ran as Montana’s Republican candidate for Governor. He went on to serve on Montana’s Highway Commis-sion for several years after retiring from the State legislature. Big Ed was a commonsense and inde-pendent leader and a man of great in-tegrity. He made a lasting impact on Montana and will be truly missed. Cindy and I will keep his wife, Juliet; his four children; and his many grand-children and great-grandchildren in our thoughts and prayers.∑ f 
TRIBUTE TO RANNA DAUD ∑Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Ranna Daud, execu-tive director for the After-School All- Stars Las Vegas, ASASLV, for her tire-less efforts in helping Las Vegas’s youth achieve prosperous futures. Ms. Daud has contributed greatly to her community by working to make ASASLV the best it can be. ASASLV was initially organized in 2003 to provide Las Vegas’s youth with a variety of free academic, athletic, and cultural afterschool programs, en-couraging Nevada’s students to main-tain a successful and healthy lifestyle during afterschool hours. These pro-grams are offered to students in pre-kindergarten through 8th grade at 13 different schools across the Clark County School District. To help stu-dents academically, ASASLV offers homework assistance, test preparation, and tutoring from certified teachers. It also offers classes in art, music leader-ship, cooking, business, and dance. Aside from educational aid, the orga-nization also emphasizes health and fitness. Activities such as soccer, volleyball, basketball, martial arts, yoga, and hiking are offered to stu-dents. Our State is fortunate to have someone such as Mrs. Daud leading this organization, which is critical in helping students across Las Vegas maintain a positive lifestyle. Ms. Daud began working for ASASLV in 2004 as a program manager. She later returned to the organization in 2009 and served for 4 years before being selected as the executive director. In this role, Ms. Daud leads the organiza-tion in pursuit of its mission to help Nevada’s youth. She also serves as the main voice in the community, working to build recognition for the program. Ms. Daud’s work with ASASLV has contributed greatly in making the or-ganization an invaluable resource to Las Vegas’s youth. She has gone above and beyond to build a positive base for Nevada’s future generations. I extend my deepest gratitude to Ms. Daud for all of her hard work in en-couraging our youth to have successful and active futures. She is a shining ex-ample of someone who strives for the betterment of her community and dis-plays true selflessness in her work. I am thankful to have Ms. Daud serving as an ally to Las Vegas’s students, pro-viding them a safe, healthy, and ambi-tious environment. I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in recognizing Ms. Daud and her work for ASASLV, a program that is so important for Nevada’s youth. I wish Ms. Daud the best of luck in all of her future endeavors working to help students across southern Nevada. ∑ f 
RECOGNIZING WESTERN GOVERNORS UNIVERSITY NEVADA ∑Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Western Governors University, WGU Nevada. I am proud to honor this institution that offers Nevadans a unique opportunity to learn and achieve successful and posi-tive futures. Established in 1997, WGU Nevada is an online institution designed to offer greater access and flexibility to higher education. This university provides 50 accredited bachelor’s and master’s de-grees in business, information tech-nology, K–12 teacher education, and health professions, along with a vari-ety of other tracks. WGU Nevada’s mis-sion to provide Silver State citizens with an opportunity to obtain an aca-demic degree at their own pace will help enhance the lives of thousands of students, while also ensuring the needs of Nevada’s employers are met. WGU Nevada has gone above and be-yond to help Nevadans obtain the tools they need to succeed. Recently, this in-stitution provided 10 students in Ne-vada with the financial support needed to earn a degree that will advance their careers. I am grateful that WGU Ne-vada is working to create a brighter fu-ture for many across the Silver State. As the husband of a teacher, I under-stand the important role academic in-stitutions play in enriching the lives of Nevadans. Ensuring that students throughout Nevada are prepared to compete in the 21st century is critical for the future of our country. The State of Nevada is fortunate to be home to WGU Nevada. I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in recognizing WGU Nevada. This institution is truly dedicated to enriching the lives of Nevadans, and I am honored to recognize its efforts. ∑

his past year of exemplary dedication to duty and service as an Army con-gressional liaison for the Chief of Army Reserve. In that role, he managed the operations and readiness portfolio for the Army Reserve. I am grateful that he will continue to serve the Army and Congress in his new assignment as commander, 361st Civil Affairs Brigade, in Kaiserslautern, Germany. We wish him well in his new position. A native of Ohio, Colonel Novak en-listed in the Army as a psychological operations specialist in the 21st Psy-chological Operations Company, Cleve-land, OH. He graduated with honors from John Carroll University, magna cum laude, and the Reserve Officer Training Corps Program, distinguished military graduate, in 1991 and was com-missioned into the infantry. Through-out his career, he also earned a mas-ter’s degree in business and organiza-tional security management from Web-ster University; a master’s degree in legislative affairs from the George Washington University; a master’s de-gree in strategic intelligence from the National Intelligence University, De-fense Intelligence Agency; a master’s degree in strategic studies from the U.S. Army War College; and associate of arts degrees in Russian studies and law enforcement. As an officer in the U.S. Army Re-serve, Colonel Novak served with mili-tary intelligence, logistics, psycho-logical operations, and civil affairs units at the platoon, detachment, com-pany, battalion, group, and major com-mand level as an executive officer, pla-toon leader, detachment commander, psychological operations officer, Prod-uct Development Center chief, logistics officer, assistant operations officer, S3, company commander, plans officer, op-erations officer, aide-de-camp, assist-ant chief of staff, and battalion com-mander. His service in the Army Reserve is highlighted by his selection in 2009 to serve as an Army congressional fellow. While assigned to the Office, Chief of the Army Reserve from 2010 to 2012, Colonel Novak spent a year rep-resenting the Army to the Congress by working in the office of Senator Saxby Chambliss. Following the completion of battalion command, he returned once again to the Office, Chief Army Reserve to serve as a legislative liaison officer. As with all our citizen soldiers, it is important that we acknowledge his service in the civilian sector. Colonel Novak has extensive law enforcement experience, serving as both a municipal police officer in Ohio and as a Federal civilian special agent with the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations. It is because of their cooperation and understanding during his many tours on Active Duty that he is able to make such a positive impact on the Army Reserve. John is accustomed to working long hours in all of his positions in the Army and civilian sector, so it is only fair and proper to acknowledge the tireless support of his wife Stacey and his children—Patrick John Novak and Caitlin Lynn Novak. I thank them for their sacrifices and wish them all the best for continued success in the fu-ture. Throughout his 30-year career, COL John Novak has made positive impacts on the careers and lives of his soldiers, peers, and superiors; and I am grateful that he has chosen to serve as an Army leader. I join my colleagues today in honoring his dedication to our Nation and invaluable service to the U.S. Con-gress as an Army congressional liai-son.∑

TRIBUTE TO DAVID W. SCHEIBLE ∑Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I wish to honor a great Georgian, David W. Scheible, chairman and CEO of Graphic Packaging International, Inc. David is retiring from Graphic Packaging after a decade of transforming the company. Under David’s leadership, Graphic Packaging has grown to become a For-tune 500 company with over 12,000 em-ployees globally and a highly respected leader in the paper and packaging in-dustry. Last year, David was the recipient of the Executive Papermaker of the Year award, which is based on corporate vi-sion, strategic objectives, and strong leadership within the individual’s com-pany and the paper industry. David is also a pillar in our commu-nity with a passion for education, sus-tainability, and feeding the hungry. He serves on the board of directors of Benchmark Electronics, the board of Cancer Treatment Centers of America, and the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, where he was chairman of the education committee for the last 5 years. As the immediate past chairman of the American Forest & Paper Associa-tion, David was a powerful and vision-ary advocate working with Federal, State, and local officials on issues crit-ical to the pulp and paper industry. Da-vid’s charisma, focus, and quick intel-lect earned the respect of many legisla-tors, including myself. It is with great pleasure that I recog-nize David Scheible, a man who con-tinues to make a difference, and I wish him well in his future endeavors. ∑

VERMONT ESSAY FINALISTS ∑Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the R
ECORD copies of some of the finalist essays written by Vermont High School students as part of the sixth annual ‘‘What is the State of the Union’’ essay contest conducted by my office. These finalists were se-lected from nearly 800 entries. The material follows: 
ADAM FLEISCHMAN , SOUTH BURLINGTON HIGH  
SCHOOL (FINALIST)  The state of the union is strong. Ameri-cans are working hard, unemployment is down, the stock market is up, and the reces-sion of 2008 feels like ancient history. Still, we face problems. Climate change is one of those issues, particularly because of the de-nial by politicians in our government that refuse to do anything, because their re-elec-tion campaigns rely on oil and gas compa-nies’ contributions. In the 114th congress, 170 members deny that global warming is real. Many represent-atives receive huge donations, as much as $63 million from big oil and gas companies, and in return, they support deregulation initia-tives in Congress to protect the corpora-tions. In other words, they prevent progress and obstruct a move away from non-renew-able energy sources. In this way, they are not representing their constituents—they’re representing the interests of the very wealthy corporations—and it’s undermining the political system we have. In a legislative body that is constantly blinded by the goal of staying in office, rath-er than passing comprehensive reforms to save our planet, the denial is rampant. Even though 97% of scientists agree that climate change is real, and manmade, these elected officials with no background in science choose to ignore it, and instead put trillions of taxpayer money into a defense budget that is bloated and unnecessary. For climate change to be properly addressed, it starts with Congress. If we invest money into clean energy—solar panels, wind turbines, natural gas—we will slowly be able to move away from non-renewable, dirty sources. We also must take a stand against the cor-porations profiting off of non-renewable sources, making it clear that their campaign contributions should not be the difference between whether or not we leave a healthier planet for future generations. If we wait long enough, it will be too late to do anything. It’s not part of a ‘‘liberal agenda’’ that some in Congress like to criticize. It’s a common problem that is hurting our common home, and it’s up to all of humankind to deal with it. That can’t happen if the political cha-rades are continued in Washington, D.C. ELLERY HARKNESS , CHAMPLAIN VALLEY UNION  
HIGH SCHOOL (FINALIST)  My fellow Americans, there are many im-portant issues burdening our world today; in order to fix these problems, we need an edu-cation system that produces well educated leaders to solve these issues. Our education system as it stands today needs to be modi-fied and socioeconomic factors hindering education need to be addressed. Education should be an equalizer, so that anyone, no matter their circumstances, can realize their potential; this isn’t the reality though. The truth is that kids from dis-advantaged families have a far lower chance for success. Inequality due to wealth and race are huge problems; the disturbing school to prison pipeline is one outcome of this. Only 1 in 12 children in poverty will graduate from college today and almost half won’t graduate from high school. Studies have also found that African American and Hispanic high school graduation rates are 10% lower than the U.S. average. Education can raise people out of poverty, while ignor-ing these problems only continues to per-petrate a horrific cycle of poverty and create more economic problems. Consider that by 2020, 65% of U.S. jobs will require a postsecondary education, according to Georgetown Public Policy Institute. Yet only 1 of 4 students are ready for college in the 4 core subjects when graduating high school, according to U.S. news. Regrettably, the education system not only isn’t pre-paring students for college, it also forces stu-dents to bear an unreasonable financial bur-den in order to go to college. With free or re-duced tuition programs, college education would be more accessible.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S343 January 28, 2016 
There is no single fix for the educational problems plaguing our country yet it is clear that major reforms need to take place. Po-tential solutions are policies that provide family support so that students grow up in places that encourage learning. Since teach-ers are the most important aspect of edu-cation, more resources could be put into teacher programs and salaries that incentivize job growth. Congress could also work towards bipartisan policies that ensure schools around the U.S have equal quality and access to resources through more fund-ing. In 2015, 55% of government funding went to the military, while only 6% went to edu-cation. An increase in education funding is a justifiable change that could dramatically help broken systems. With a better educated workforce, people will have better jobs and rely on government less, benefiting the U.S. economy. Oppor-tunity gaps in education would also decrease and the U.S. would become more competitive as a result. This is another incentive for making education a priority to those in Washington. Our combined futures are dependent on the youth of today; but our nation’s children are only as good as the education they are pro-vided with. As Nelson Mandela said, ‘‘Edu-cation is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.’’ Let’s take advantage of it. 
MEGAN HUGHES , CANAAN MEMORIAL HIGH  
SCHOOL (FINALIST)  As many Americans know, we are very blessed to have colleges available in our country. College allows a young adult to fur-ther his or her knowledge of the world around them so they can be ready to enter the workforce. College tuition used to be af-fordable, so that everyone could further their education. This is important because more educated people means a stronger growing economy. At the same time, the cost of tuition rises dramatically each year, and families with more than one child find themselves in tough financial situations. Most of the time people use loans, and end up paying back student debt for years. Every American deserves to have a college edu-cation, which is why state colleges should be tuition free. Elementary and high school is mandatory for all American citizens. Parents who refuse to send their children to school have to pay large fines or even serve jail time. If early education is this important to Americans, why is college not? Why should the emphasis just be on getting a primary or secondary education? More and more jobs today are re-quiring higher than just a high school di-ploma. In an article by Adam Davidson, he says that ‘‘Workers with more education are more productive, which makes companies more profitable and the overall economy grow faster.’’ This is true, more educated people means more jobs are being done cor-rectly and efficiently, and as a result boost-ing the economy. In an article by Steven Goodman he said ‘‘Two-thirds of American undergraduates are in debt. This year, student loan debt will grow to more than a trillion dollars, out-pacing credit card debt for the first time.’’ This article was written in 2011, meaning only four years ago student debt was already in the trillions. When young adults leave home and enter the work force, they have to deal with adult responsibilities for the first time. On top of that, they usually need to pay off student debt. If college were to be tuition free these people would not have large debts. The money they make could go towards paying bills, and saving money for their future or retirement. It would also help attract those who were never thinking about going to college because of the high costs. All this leads to more people buying and sell-ing goods which is important for a country to prosper. State colleges should be free because the economy will grow faster with more edu-cated people, and young adults will not be paying college debt for half their life. How exactly this would be done is simple, put higher taxes on the wealthy. With the top class distributing their money towards edu-cation, everyone can have the opportunity to further their education. People can use their hard working money on other things, like purchasing a house or providing for a child. That is why it is important to have free col-lege tuition because it creates an educated population, less debt, and saving for other necessities. TORI JARVIS , MISSISQUOI VALLEY UNION HIGH  
SCHOOL (FINALIST)  Since the recent crimes committed by the terror group ISIS, hate crimes against Mus-lims have skyrocketed. Recently, ‘‘an Arab- American man was brutally attacked by two white men . . . (who) also taunted his daugh-ter, who wears a hijab, making references to ISIS . . . The attackers called (them) ‘r— head’ and said, ‘Go back to your country.’’’ Wrote Tom Carter for an article on the World Socialist Website. Obviously, these men attacked the man and his daughter for their race and religion, equating the fact that they were Muslim with terrorism even though there was no sensible reason to. Peo-ple are so scared of terrorism that they lash out at anything they can associate with it. People in power or who wish to be in power are using this fear to convince them that Muslims are the ones to be feared. The most recent—and most dangerous—example is Donald Trump, who wants to ban Muslims from coming into the country. This move has not only heightened the fear of ISIS, but made people believe the Muslims currently in our country are associated with terrorism, creating more violence. Encouraged by Pres-idential candidates like Donald Trump, some Americans blame the entire religion of Islam, and anyone who follows it, for all of our country’s problems. They believe that because these terrorists are following a dis-torted version of the Qu’ran and the religion of Islam, that anyone else who worships the peaceful religion is a terrorist as well. Unfor-tunately, people don’t realize that Muslims are not terrorists. Muslim athlete Muham-mad Ali once said; ‘‘Terrorists are not fol-lowing Islam. Killing people and blowing up people and dropping bombs in places and all this is not the way to spread the word of Islam. So people realize now that all Mus-lims are not terrorists.’’ Muslims are too often oppressed, even violently attacked by Americans who blame them for terrorism. Muslims in America today are now experi-encing racism the way black people used to, and are violently and verbally abused by white people who are looking for someone to blame. Jermaine Jackson, one of Michael Jack-son’s siblings, has pointed out ‘‘Muslims have become the new Negroes in America. They are being mistreated at airports, by the Immigration—everywhere. Islam is a reli-gion of peace. They are wrong.’’ People who wear hijabs seem to have a target placed on them. Muslims are ‘‘randomly selected’’ for full body searches at airports, forced to prove they’re in this country legally, and at-tacked by people who have different reli-gious opinions. The violence against Mus-lims must end, whether it physical or men-tal. As the civil war in the Middle East is creating unlivable conditions for its inhab-itants, they’re counting on us to take them in and keep them safe. America is trying to divide and conquer— focusing on conquering Muslims as a whole rather than just ISIS. Rather than attacking the Muslims in our country, we should be fo-cusing on the actual members of ISIS, and not people who have no association with the organization. ALEXIS MANCHESTER , GREEN MOUNTAIN  
TECHNOLOGY AND CAREER CENTER (FINALIST)  Today in America, people are going to pris-on wasting countless economic resources and potentially ruining the lives of people all be-cause of the recreational use of marijuana. While people often say marijuana is a gate-way drug, I strongly disagree. There are more people that drink a glass of milk per day and become addicted to more serious drugs, than those who use marijuana. It is not uncommon to hear echoes of this senti-ment in other contexts as well, particularly, the media and Presidential candidates. In fact, Senator Sanders himself suggests that marijuana should be legalized: ‘‘I suspect I would vote yes. And I would vote yes because I am seeing in this country too many lives being destroyed for non-violent offenses. We have a criminal justice system that lets CEOs on Wall Street walk away, and yet we are imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana. I think we have to think through this war on drugs which has done an enormous amount of damage.’’ I strongly agree with this state-ment because there is not one reported death from an overdose of marijuana. In fact, 88,000 people have died from alcohol use. I person-ally have never heard of somebody mur-dering someone because they were under the influence of marijuana. Alcohol on the other hand, has been proven to impact our culture negatively. Facts don’t lie. 58% of Americans think marijuana should be legalized, including me. Around 40% of Americans admit to already using marijuana. If marijuana was legalized, we could tax it and allow citizens who choose to use it to benefit our communities in more effective ways than keeping it illegal. Mari-juana is a safer drug than others and there is a very low risk of abuse. Marijuana can be safe and useful for instance. Legalizing mari-juana will bring the nation’s largest cash crop under the rule of law, creating jobs, and economic opportunities in the formal econ-omy instead of the illicit market. Wash-ington, Alaska, Oregon and Colorado haven’t had any major issues with their legalization. Washington State raked in more than $70 million in taxes its first year of legal regu-lated marijuana sales. In Colorado the total of marijuana tax and license cash funds is the total of $11,290,012 annually. Alaska stands to make between $5.1 million and $19.2 million in tax revenue from commercial marijuana in 2016, according to the prelimi-nary estimate by the Alaska Department of Revenue. Oregon’s first week of recreational use of marijuana sales top $11 million dol-lars. Clearly, the taxes incurred would posi-tively benefit our state and country should we choose to jump on board. In closing, I hope you can appreciate my ideas, although I am just one voice. America is a progressive kind of people and we must do what we can to continue to demonstrate the values that make us great. Thank you for your time.∑ f

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES344 January 28, 2016 
Association, LMA, in recognition of their 90th anniversary. Founded in 1926, the Louisiana Con-ference of Mayors was created with the purpose of providing a forum for mu-tual consultation and discussion of var-ious topics affecting municipal govern-ment. The organization also aided the growth and development of each mu-nicipality through education about best practices and problem solving. Shortly after the Louisiana Conference of Mayors was created, the Great De-pression swept the Nation. In 1937, a handful of resilient mayors met to re-vive the organization, giving it new life as the Louisiana Municipal Associa-tion. They may not have foreseen that their tenacity in overcoming adversity during the Great Depression and tak-ing proactive steps to keep Louisiana municipalities united and strong would form the basis for the core values to which the LMA still adheres today. From its inception, the LMA has fo-cused on helping local elected leaders create and maintain efficient and effec-tive municipal governments. In 1987, the nonprofit, nonpartisan LMA cre-ated Risk Management, Inc., RMI, to address the insurance and liability de-mands of member municipalities through its inter-local risk pool. In 1999, the Louisiana Municipal Advisory and Technical Services Bureau, Inc., LaMATS, was created with the purpose of providing essential services to assist municipalities in their day-to-day op-erations. In addition to these wholly owned subsidiaries, the LMA has three polit-ical subdivisions—Louisiana Municipal Gas Authority, Unemployment Com-pensation Fund, and Louisiana Com-munity Development Authority; four advisory organizations—Louisiana As-sociation of Chiefs of Police, Louisiana Rural Water Association, Louisiana Conference of Mayors, and Louisiana Municipal Black Caucus Association; and nine affiliate organizations—Mu-nicipal Employees Retirement System, Louisiana City Attorneys Association, Louisiana Association of Municipal Secretaries and Assistants, Louisiana Recreation and Parks Association, Louisiana Association of Tax Adminis-trators, Louisiana Municipal Clerks Association, Building Officials Associa-tion of Louisiana, Louisiana Airport Managers and Associates, and Lou-isiana Fire Chiefs Association. To fulfill its mission of educating its membership and providing a forum for discussion about common issues, solu-tions, and problem solving, the LMA holds an annual convention, a mid-winter conference, 10 district meetings, a municipal day during the State’s leg-islative session, and 15 or more webinars. For decades, the LMA has had tre-mendous legislative success on both State and Federal levels. In the Lou-isiana Legislature, the LMA has been a strong voice for Louisiana municipali-ties in efforts to fight blight, promote law enforcement, maintain funding, and enhance economic growth. On the Federal level, the LMA joined forces with the National League of Cities and other coastal State municipal leagues to lead the charge in lobbying Congress to enact the Homeowners Flood Insur-ance Affordability Act of 2014, which enacted critical reforms to the Biggert Waters Act of 2012, thereby facilitating affordable homeowner flood insurance in Louisiana and across the country. For 90 years, the LMA has worked to strengthen the backbone of Louisiana through support and empowerment of municipal government. The organiza-tion has launched a yearlong celebra-tion of this anniversary by naming 2016 the Year of Education. Opening festivi-ties for this theme will commence at the midwinter conference in February under the auspices of the 2016 LMA Ex-ecutive Board officers—President Mayor Carroll Breaux of Springhill, First Vice President Mayor Barney Arceneaux of Gonzales, Second Vice President Mayor Lawrence Henagan of DeQuincy, Immediate Past President Mayor David Camardelle of Grand Isle, and District A Vice President Mayor Jimmy Williams of Sibley. The execu-tive director is Ronnie Harris, former 28-year mayor of Gretna. What started out as a collection of 29 forward-thinking mayors seeking to empower their communities has evolved into a praiseworthy organiza-tion that has earned the esteem and trust of local, State, and Federal elect-ed officials, as well as fellow municipal leagues. We would like to congratulate the LMA on its 90th anniversary and wish them many more years of strength and excellence.∑

Christa McAuliffe, were killed in a tragic ex-plosion shortly after liftoff; Whereas, for as long as there has been human consciousness, human beings have looked to the stars in curiosity, delight, and awe; Whereas, throughout the course of human history, humankind was Earth-bound, yet spoke of visiting the celestial bodies; Whereas the foundation and development of the United States were driven by a pio-neering spirit; Whereas reaching out into space exhibits the strength of the human capacity to engi-neer and persevere; Whereas the people of the United States who have journeyed into space have personi-fied the national pride of the United States; Whereas, in 1986, a crew of individuals rep-resenting the best of the United States stepped forward to ride a rocket into space, knowing that explorers throughout the ages have put the need for knowledge above their own welfare; Whereas, on January 28, 1986, the United States cried out in grief at the loss of those 7 most brave voyagers; Whereas Christa McAuliffe, a teacher with an infectious spirit and tremendous bravery, not content to make the world her class-room, prepared to expand her schoolroom to the stars; Whereas Christa McAuliffe, through her educational endeavor, sought to inspire adults and children alike by pushing the bounds of the human experience and by rous-ing all people to imagine the most of human potential; Whereas the McAuliffe-Shepard Discovery Center in Concord, New Hampshire is a liv-ing memorial to embody the legacy of this intrepid woman; and Whereas January 28, 2016, is a day on which the people of the United States should pause

URKOWSKI to the bill S. 2012, to pro-vide for the modernization of the en-ergy policy of the United States, and for other purposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows: 
At the end, add the following: TITLE VI—PUERTO RICO EMERGENCY FINANCIAL STABILITY 
SEC. 6001. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Puerto Rico Emergency Financial Stability Act of 2016’’. 
SEC. 6002. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress finds the fol-lowing: (1) The Commonwealth Government is con-fronted with a dire fiscal emergency and li-quidity crisis that imminently threatens the welfare of the people of the Commonwealth, affecting the provision of essential public services including public safety, health care, and education that are needed both to sus-tain the welfare of the people and the eco-nomic ability of the Commonwealth to ad-dress any future resolution of debts and legal obligations. (2) A temporary stay on litigation with re-spect to debt holders for the Commonwealth is essential to provide breathing space to the Commonwealth, creditors, and the Congress to determine an orderly process for the Com-monwealth to address any future resolution of legal obligations and to provide the Com-monwealth a path to sustainable growth; and thereby, protect the lives of more than 3,500,000 citizens of the United States living in the Commonwealth. (3) The Commonwealth is in a state of fis-cal emergency brought on by, among other things, a combination of accumulated oper-ating deficits, cash shortages, management inefficiencies, and excessive borrowing. (4) The Commonwealth Government’s debt is unusually complex, with 18 different but inter-related issuers. (A) There is an even larger number of cred-itor groups, each of which may have diver-gent interests. (B) The debt’s unusual complexity will sub-stantially complicate any potential consen-sual restructuring in the absence of Federal legislation to facilitate the negotiations. (5) This legislation, which includes a stay on litigation by debt holders, can protect es-sential government services and help the Commonwealth address its liabilities in an orderly fashion, benefitting all stakeholders. (A) A temporary stay on litigation is es-sential to facilitate an orderly process for stabilizing, evaluating, and comprehensively resolving the Commonwealth’s fiscal crisis. (B) Avoiding a disorderly race to the court-house will benefit creditors as well as other stakeholders. (C) Furthermore, the stay is only tem-porary. (b) PURPOSES .—The purposes of this title are to— (1) provide a limited period of time to per-mit Congress to enact comprehensive relief for the Commonwealth, providing it the nec-essary tools to address its economic and fis-cal crisis; and (2) provide the Commonwealth Govern-ment with a tool it needs to address an im-mediate and imminent crisis that is unprece-dented in the history of the United States. 
SEC. 6003. EFFECTIVE DATE. 
This title shall take effect as though en-acted on December 18, 2015. 
SEC. 6004. SEVERABILITY. 
If any provision of this title or the applica-tion thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of this title, or the application of that provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid, is not affected there-by. 
SEC. 6005. DEFINITIONS.

(b) The enactment of this title does not op-erate as a stay under subsection (a) of this section of the continuation of, including the issuance or employment of process, a judi-cial, administrative, or other action or pro-ceeding against the Commonwealth Govern-ment that was commenced on or before the date of enactment of this Act. (c) Except as provided in subsection (d), (e), or (f), a stay of an act under subsection (a) shall cease to have effect as of April 1, 2016.

(g) No order, judgment, or decree entered in violation of this section shall have any force or effect. (h) In any hearing under subsection (d) or (e) concerning relief from a stay— (1) the party requesting such relief has the burden of proof on the issue of the debtor’s equity in property; and (2) the party opposing such relief has the burden of proof on all other issues.

CCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Sen-ate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 351, submitted earlier today. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A resolution (S. Res. 351) designating the week of January 24 through January 30, 2016, as ‘‘National School Choice Week.’’ 
There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the resolution. Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, this week is an opportunity to highlight the im-portance of parental choice in edu-cation, and the success that children find when they are able to choose an educational pathway that suits their individual needs. Be it through public, charter, private, or home schools, as well as other forms of educational serv-ices that may be tailored to the edu-cational needs of our kids, we should continue our work to provide students with a viable and proven route to a bet-ter education. In particular, I want to recognize my home State of South Carolina for our continuous work in expanding school choice initiatives. Since 2013, when South Carolina’s general assembly en-acted the Educational Credit for Ex-ceptional Needs Children, which helps children with disabilities gain an edu-cation personalized to their own unique needs, South Carolina has been on the forefront of the school choice move-ment. That is clearly on display this week, as South Carolina’s National School Choice Rally will feature its largest rates of participation yet, with over 3,000 parents, advocates, and stu-dents lending their voice and support to school choice. On the Federal level, I have sub-mitted legislation to free up access to educational resources for America’s least fortunate students. I have spon-sored legislation that would make IDEA funds portable and create a school choice pilot program for mili-tary families, as well as bipartisan leg-islation with Senators F
EINSTEIN , J
OHNSON , and B OOKER to reauthorize and improve the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program, the Nation’s only federally supported school choice program. I believe we must continue this work to promote parental choice. Reforms to our educational system should em-power parents and students, not bu-reaucrats, to choose the educational option that best meets their unique needs. Because when parents have bet-ter choices, their kids have a better chance. Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reso-lution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to recon-sider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The resolution (S. Res. 351) was agreed to. The preamble was agreed to. (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today’s R
ECORD under ‘‘Sub-mitted Resolutions.’’)

HONORING KOREAN AMERICAN DAY 
HON. MIKE KELLY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 28, 2016 Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, one hundred thirteen years ago this month, pioneers from Korea first journeyed to our shores in search of opportunity, prosperity, and freedom. These early Korean Americans worked hard in our growing country, started families, and established strong communities. Over the past century, Korean Americans have made strong contributions to our fields of medicine, engineering, research, and innova-tion, and have become respected community leaders and elected officials. The United States shares a special relation-ship with the Republic of Korea forged during the Korean War and solidified by the greater global struggle for freedom in the 20th cen-tury. In response to the invasion of North Ko-rean and communist forces in 1950, the United States led a global coalition to defend Korean sovereignty. Millions of American and Korean soldiers fought side by side and formed friendships during the conflict. Guided by desire to foster trust and mutual coopera-tion in the region, the U.S.-Korea alliance has stabilized a region subjected to terror by North Korea. Last November, I had the privilege of vis-iting the Republic. Over the course of my three-day visit, I enjoyed robust policy discus-sions with Korean leaders on numerous top-ics, deepening old friendships while forging new ones. It was evident to me that the U.S.- Korea alliance has never been stronger. The U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS) has brought economic growth to both of our countries, and American exports to Korea reached a record level last year. As I continue to reflect on my visit to the Republic, I am re-minded of the deep and abiding responsibility all American leaders should feel towards pre-serving the U.S.-Korea alliance. The vigor and vitality of the Korean people and their commit-ment to democracy, a free market economy, and the rule of law—our common values—is simply inspirational. We owe that commitment to our esteemed Korean War veterans—the 1.8 million Americans who fought and sac-rificed so much in that awful conflict to help birth one of the greatest democracies and alli-ances in the history of civilization. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate Korean American Day. As the co-chairman of the Congressional Caucus on Korea, I am proud to recognize our nations’ special relationship and the powerful contributions that Korean Americans have made to the United States, especially those who have served with distinc-tion in our Armed Forces. In the years to come, the U.S.-Korea alliance will surely be tested but our faith and determination will never falter or waiver. TRIBUTE TO LAUREN SMITH HON. MICHAEL M. HONDA

AXINE WATERS . Lauren Smith, a beloved daughter, sister, friend, Congressional staffer, and coworker, died on December 26, 2015 in her home in Washington, D.C. at the age of 37. Lauren was born on August 18, 1978, in Illi-nois. At the age of four, she attended her first Chicago White Sox baseball game—thus launching a lifelong love of the sport. Lauren was also a professional ballroom dancer and instructor. A self-proclaimed ‘‘foodie,’’ Lauren was an inspirational chef, who had her own website: ‘‘One if By Food.’’ She believed peo-ple should not have to compromise taste, fla-vor, and health—just because they were only cooking for one. Lauren thrived on following her passions, despite the sacrifices. That characteristic fueled her journey across the country multiple times, from the campaign trail to Capitol Hill. Her unabating dedication to progressive ideals was second only to her independent spirit. Her keen communications skills and doggedness served her well, bringing exciting opportunities and necessitating many a quick decision to say ‘‘yes’’ to pack up everything to go on to the next challenge. Lauren got her feet wet fresh from grad-uating from Cal State Fullerton with the All America PAC during the 2006 midterm elec-tions, and worked her way up to become the Democratic National Committee’s statewide communications director for Indiana during the 2008 presidential election. Lauren proved her-self time and again, handling tough situations and high pressure through a decade on the Hill as Press Secretary for Rep. C
UELLAR (D– Texas), Communications Director for Rep. M
ATSUI (D–Calif.), and Communications Direc-tor/Deputy Chief of Staff for Rep. M
CNERNEY  (D–Calif.). After serving as Communications Consultant for John Walsh’s bid for Montana’s vacant Senate seat, Lauren served as the Deputy Communications Director for Sen. Walsh (D–Mont.) as well. In 2015, Lauren joined Rep. H
ONDA ’s (D– Calif.) team. Lauren swiftly settled in, becom-ing a major asset to the entire staff—teaming with each staff member to increase effective-ness of all communication. She thoughtfully served as the Member’s voice and ambas-sador to the media. Lauren was a media liai-son extraordinaire, easily developing positive professional relationships with reporters. Lauren loved her job, and everyone knew it from her positive impact. Lauren changed the lives of everyone with whom she worked. A common denominator for all the offices where Lauren worked is that Lauren was viewed as dedicated, passionate, incredibly hard-working, and most of all, beloved. She would brighten up any office with her quick wit and cheery na-ture. She was also deeply caring and consid-erate. She was the first to ask how someone was doing and offer assistance. To her, rela-tionships mattered most of all. Lauren always put herself last. Mr. Speaker, sometimes, we are simply lucky enough to be gifted with an amazing employee and colleague. Lauren had an infec-tious laugh, and an inspiring spirit that matched her drive to make the world a better and happier place. No doubt, Lauren is still giggling somewhere, and looking out for her loved ones. Lauren—you are beyond com-pare. You made it so easy to fall into love with you. We miss you so very dearly. f 
RECOGNIZING THE 26TH ANNIVER-SARY OF ‘‘BLACK JANUARY’’ 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 28, 2016 Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 26th anniversary of ‘‘Black Jan-uary’’ in Azerbaijan. Imbedded in the memory of all Azerbaijanis regardless of where they live, Black January commemorates Azer-baijan’s stand against Soviet soldiers for inde-pendence, sovereignty, territorial integrity over all lands under Azerbaijani jurisdiction, and freedom from communism and dictatorship. On the evening of January 19, 1990, the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet Presidium backed by then-President Mikhail Gorbachev, declared a state of emergency in response to the grow-ing national independence movement in Azer-baijan, which led to Russian troops storming the Azerbaijani capital city of Baku. In an at-tempt to suppress the movement and ‘‘restore order,’’ Soviet invaders indiscriminately fired on peaceful demonstrators, including women and children. That night, more than 130 peo-ple died, over 700 people were injured, 841 were arrested and 5 went missing. The invasion, however, focused not just on peaceful protestors but also on critical infra-structure and workers. According to a report by Human Rights Watch entitled Black Janu-ary in Azerbaijan, ‘‘among the most heinous violations of human rights during the Baku in-cursion were the numerous attacks on medical personnel, ambulances and even hospitals.’’ Additionally, the attack was an act of intimida-tion for all then-Soviet countries with inde-pendence ambitions. The Human Rights

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE60 January 28, 2016 
Watch report concluded that, ‘‘indeed the vio-lence used by the Soviet Army on the night of January 19–20 constitutes an exercise in col-lective punishment. The punishment inflicted on Baku by Soviet soldiers may have been in-tended as a warning to nationalists, not only in Azerbaijan, but in other Republics of the So-viet Union.’’ Azerbaijani citizens, however, refused to succumb to Soviet aggression. Instead, the in-vasion inflamed Azerbaijani nationalism. In the days after the invasion, thousands of Azerbaijanis surrounded Communist Party headquarters demanding the resignation of the republic’s leadership, the Baku City Council demanded that Soviet troops be withdrawn and the Soviet legislature in Azerbaijan threat-ened to call a referendum on secession unless Soviet troops were withdrawn within 48 hours. Soviet troops were eventually withdrawn and January 20th became known as ‘‘the Day of the Nationwide Sorrow.’’ It would not be for nearly two years, however, before Azerbaijan gained political control from the Soviet Union. In October 1991, Azerbaijan’s parliament—the National Assembly—declared its independ-ence. Today, Azerbaijan has developed into a thriving country with double digit growth, in large part due to a freely elected president and parliament, free market reforms led by the energy sector, and, most importantly, no for-eign troops on its soil. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the tragic events of Black January that precipitated the inde-pendent Republic of Azerbaijan and the fall of the USSR.

TRIBUTE TO MRS. NEVA BELL 
HON. TODD ROKITA 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 28, 2016 Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a wonderful Hoosier, Mrs. Neva Bell. Today Neva Bell of Indianapolis, a true daugh-ter of the State of Indiana attains the century mark of 100 years of age. Born in Monroe, Indiana in 1916, to Mr. and Mrs. E.F. Fricke, Neva attended Purdue Uni-versity where she met her future husband Simeon Bell of Portland, the son of a Jay County, Indiana pioneer family. Neva and Simeon Bell both graduated from Purdue, married, and raised three children in Indiana. Neva now has 6 grandchildren and 7 great grandchildren. Over the years, Neva and Simeon Bell spent countless volunteer hours helping many Indiana institutions like the Indiana State Mu-seum, the Eitlejorg Museum, the 500 Festival, and the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Neva and Simeon also maintained and improved the Bell family pioneer farm in Jay County, Indiana which is still in the family to this day. Neva lost her husband in 2005, but that hasn’t stopped her from supporting her loved Indiana organizations. Over a lifetime Neva Bell has epitomized the strong, independent citizen that makes Indiana great. Let us join together today and wish Neva Bell a very Happy Birthday and a joyful and healthy year. RECOGNIZING THE ANNIVERSARY OF DWAYNE AND CAROL CHESNUT HON. DINA TITUS 
OF NEVADA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 28, 2016 Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-ognize the sixtieth wedding anniversary of Dwayne and Carol Chesnut, two dear friends, respected community leaders, generous phi-lanthropists, and loyal Democrats. They have three children, Kay, Michelle, and Mark, and two grandchildren, Darrel and Danielle Jobe. Carol and Dwayne met as teenagers in high school when, coming out of class, he held the door open for her. Carol responded, ‘‘It is good to know that there are still gentlemen and scholars left.’’ Dwayne was smitten and holds the door for Carol still today. When Carol and Dwayne were courting in Texas in the early fifties, their favorite song was ‘‘Too Young’’ by Nat King Cole. Its words were prophetic: ‘‘This love will last though years may go.’’ The joy they find in each other spills over into the numerous lives, including my own, which they have touched over the 60 years they have been together. Congratulations. Here’s to many more good times and sweet memories to come.

HONORING DR. WILLIAM B. BYNUM, JR. 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 28, 2016 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to honor Dr. William B. Bynum, Jr., a 25-year higher education professional, who was unanimously selected to be the 7th President of Mississippi Valley State University (MVSU) by the Mississippi Institutions of High-er Learning Board on October 8, 2013 and he began his presidency at ‘‘The Valley’’ on No-vember 6, 2013. A native of Rocky Mount, NC, Dr. Bynum earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in Soci-ology from Davidson College while on a stu-dent-athlete scholarship. While at Davidson, he also minored in Education and passed the National Teachers Exam. He was subse-quently licensed and certified to teach Social Studies and Math in North Carolina and Geor-gia. Dr. Bynum went on to earn his masters and Ph.D. in Sociology from Duke University while serving as a Duke Endowment Fellow. Dr. Bynum was also a member of the inau-gural class of the NAFEO-Kellogg Leadership Fellows Program, a yearlong program specifi-cally designed to train the next generation of presidents/chancellors for minority serving in-stitutions, which was led by then NAFEO president—Dr. Frederick Humphries; NAFEO chairman—Dr. Joe Johnson, and executive di-rector—Dr. Arthur Thomas. As part of the pro-gram, Dr. Bynum ‘‘shadowed’’ Dr. Harold Mar-tin, then chancellor of Winston-Salem State University and now chancellor of NC A&T State University. As the 7th President, Dr. Bynum’s vision for the University is to uplift 6 powerful words that are already deeply rooted in ‘‘The Valley’’ cul-ture. The vision is: ONE GOAL. ONE TEAM. ONE VALLEY. The ONE GOAL is Student Success (increased enrollment, retention and graduation; holistic student development and career advancement); The ONE TEAM is Uni-versity and Community Stakeholders Working Together; And the ONE VALLEY is students, faculty, staff, alumni and friends actively dem-onstrating School Pride and Spirituality that is second to none! Prior to his appointment at MVSU, Dr. Bynum served as the Vice President for En-rollment Management and Student Services at Morehouse College (2009–2013), where he was mentored by Morehouse’s 10th president, Dr. Robert Michael Franklin. While serving at Morehouse, Dr. Bynum significantly enhanced student-administration relations, improved the efficiency and effectiveness of student serv-ices, started, envisioned and led the initiative which established the Parents Council and im-plemented the nationally acclaimed More-house ‘‘Appropriate Attire Policy.’’ Prior to Morehouse, Dr. Bynum served as the Vice President for Student Affairs and En-rollment Management (2000–2009) at The Lin-coln University (PA). During his nine years of service, he was successful in nearly doubling Lincoln’s enrollment and recruited the 4 larg-est new student classes (900+) in the Univer-sity’s 150-year history. Dr. Bynum also led the Board-approved Student Enhancement Initia-tive, which entailed elevating Lincoln from NCAA Division III to NCAA Division II ath-letics, reactivated Lincoln’s membership in the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA) conference, returned football to the campus after a 40-year absence and started the University’s first marching band program: ‘‘The Orange Crush.’’ At Lincoln, Dr. Bynum was mentored by Dr. Ivory Nelson, the Univer-sity’s 12th president, who garnered over $200 million in capital construction to transform the campus physical plant. Prior to LU, Dr. Bynum served as the Asso-ciate Vice President and Dean of Students at Clark Atlanta University (1993–2000), and he was the number 2 person in the division that recruited the 4 largest classes (1500+) in the then 125-year history of CAU. While at CAU, Dr. Bynum was mentored by and developed strong strategic planning and assessment skills from Dr. Doris Walker Weathers. During his CAU days, Dr. Bynum was nicknamed ‘‘Bye-Bye Bynum’’ for his no-nonsense ap-proach to judicial affairs and enhancing the campus culture and environment. In addition to his enrollment management and student affairs work, Dr. Bynum has lec-tured and/or taught as well. He served as the Covington Distinguished Professor of Soci-ology at Davidson and at Morehouse, he was an adjunct professor in the Leadership Studies program and Sociology department. Dr. Bynum’s other professional experience in-cludes research and teaching positions at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), Duke University and Durham and Edgecombe Community Colleges. He started his educational career as a teacher, football and wrestling coach in the Rocky Mount (NC) City School System (1984–87) and the Dekalb County (GA) School System (1987–88). Dr. Bynum has represented his institutions in nu-merous external programs and at professional conferences, while serving as a presenter or moderator. He has authored refereed articles in professional journals and presented papers with academic and social themes. Trained as

a Quantitative Sociologist, Dr. Bynum still re-mains active in research and teaching. His re-search and teaching interests center around: (1) Black Church Studies; (2) Race, Gender and Ethnicity; and (3) Organizations, Markets and Work. His publications include: A co-authored arti-cle with Duke colleagues in the sociology jour-nal Social Forces entitled ‘‘Race and Formal Volunteering’’; A chapter entitled ‘‘The Black Church in America: Demography and Current Trends’’ in the book: Exploring The African American Experience (3rd edition); and a short story entitled ‘‘For the Love of J-Ski’’ in the NASPA produced book: Stories of Inspiration: Lessons and Laughter in Student Affairs. Dr. Bynum is a member of Omicron Delta Kappa, Chi Alpha Epsilon and Omega Psi Phi Frater-nity, Inc. A God-loving, God-fearing man, he is mar-ried to Deborah Elaine Bynum, a manager and 34-year employee with AT&T Mobility Serv-ices, and they are the proud parents of six children—Tyrone (a student at Georgia State University), Tyler (a student-athlete graduate of Truett-McConnell College), Chelsea (a stu-dent at Clark Atlanta University and Army Re-servist), Zack (a student at Morehouse Col-lege), and Jordan and Jazz (both of whom are Atlanta public high school students). Dr. Bynum’s personal and professional motto is ‘‘Look back and thank God. Look for-ward and trust God. Look around and serve God. Look within and find God.’’ Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Dr. William B. Bynum, Jr., a teacher, professional and educator for his con-tribution to serving others and giving back to the African American community.

IN RECOGNITION OF MRS. SUE BAUCH 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 28, 2016 Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mrs. Sue Bauch on her retire-ment after twenty eight years of dedicated service to the City of Kingsburg. Mrs. Bauch was born in Auberry, California. During her childhood, she attended local schools and later graduated from Sierra Union High School. Mrs. Bauch and her husband Guy have four children, Shannon, DJ, Chad, and Michelle. On January 28, 1988, Mrs. Bauch began working as a part-time Utilities Clerk for the City of Kingsburg. Exactly one year later she was hired on as full time and has since served in multiple positions, including Business Li-cense Clerk, Building Secretary, Planning Sec-retary, and Deputy City Clerk. In 1998, she was promoted to City Clerk and has held that position ever since. In 2013, Mrs. Bauch also served as the Acting City Manager of Kingsburg. Mrs. Bauch’s hard work and dedication to the City of Kingsburg is without question. She is known in the community for her knowledge of all things Kingsburg and for her invaluable guidance to fellow co-workers and residents. After twenty eight years with the City of Kingsburg, Mrs. Bauch retired on January 6, 2016. During her time with the City of Kingsburg Mrs. Bauch was known as the ‘‘face’’ of city hall. There is no doubt that the city has benefited from her guidance through-out her years of service. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives to join me in commending Sue Bauch for her years of dedicated public service and wishing her well as she begins her retirement. f 
HONORING MILTON GASTON 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 28, 2016 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to honor a remarkable civil servant, Mr. Milton Gaston. Born in Hollandale, Mississippi, Milton Gas-ton was nurtured and reared by his parents, the late James and Luella Gaston, in Glen Allen, Mississippi. He is the seventh born of eleven children to his parents. Gaston proudly admits that his parents reared them to be a close-knit family and his siblings and he re-main so today. Milton Gaston was educated in the Glen Allen Public Schools. Understanding the meaning of family as so taught by his parents, Mr. Gaston met and married Ms. Alice Watts. To their union, six (6) children and ten (10) grandchildren are being shaped for this most extraordinary world. To support his family, Mr. Gaston began work with the Washington County Sheriff De-partment on January 20, 1986 under the lead-ership of the late Sheriff Harvey Tackett, Sr. In July of that same year, Milton Gaston, Sr., be-came the only civilian sent to the Jackson Po-lice Academy in Jackson, Mississippi to be certified and deputized under Sheriff Tackett’s administration. Because of his work ethics, Greenville Optimist Club named him as Dep-uty Sheriff of the year in 1989. On November 3, 2003, Washington County elected Milton Gaston, Sr. as Sheriff of Wash-ington County, Mississippi. At the age of 42, he was the first African American in this coun-ty to hold this distinguished position. County Court Chancellor Vernita King-Johnson swore him in on January 5, 2004 to uphold this posi-tion to serve and protect the citizens of Wash-ington County, Mississippi. Currently, Sheriff Gaston is in his third term, serving more than twenty-nine (29) years in law enforcement with a plethora of training on the state and federal level. Additionally, he has initiated and over-seen a Juvenile Justice Intervention/Preven-tion Program that was developed to rebuild at risk youth between the ages of 12–15.

RECOGNIZING DR. WILLIE BRYANT 
HON. NITA M. LOWEY 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 28, 2016 Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Willie Bryant, of Spring Valley, NY, a dentist and Hudson Valley civil rights activist for nearly a half-century, who passed away December 28, 2015, at the age of 77. A lifelong NAACP member, Dr. Bryant was active with the Rockland Human Rights Com-mission and helped create the Spring Valley NAACP Life Membership Program. Dr. Bryant also helped form the Rockland Employees Federal Credit Union, a non-profit group that provided low-interest loans to people who worked at the Rockland Psychiatric Center and in county government. Dr. Bryant also spearheaded the successful effort to have a statue of United States Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall placed on the front lawn of the former Hillburn Main School, which was in-tegrated following then-NAACP attorney Mar-shall’s appeal to the New York State Commis-sioner of Education in 1943. Dr. Bryant attended Florida A&M University, graduating in 1961, and then Howard Univer-sity School of Dentistry. He remained active in both universities’ alumni associations, serving as President of the Florida A&M Ossining (NY) alumni branch, where he started a sickle-cell anemia screening project that reached more than 1,200 people. Dr. Bryant interned at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Philadel-phia and joined the dental staff of the FDR Veterans Administration Hospital in Montrose, NY, in 1969. In 1982, Dr. Bryant began serv-ing as the Director of Dental Services at Letchworth Village, a residential facility for people with physical and mental disabilities in Thiells, NY. Dr. Bryant often said providing dental care for the developmentally disabled population was his biggest achievement and his most rewarding experience. Dr. Bryant was honored many times throughout his career. He received the 2003 ‘‘Volunteer Beyond Excellence’’ Award from the New York Organ Donor Network for pro-moting organ and tissue donation. He was named Rockland’s Alpha Man of the Year in 2004 and was awarded the Rockland Buffalo Soldiers’ Award in 2006. Dr. Bryant was a 2008 inductee into the Rockland County Human Rights/Civil Rights Hall of Fame for his efforts to help people attain justice and equal treatment under the law. In 2012 he was named one of Florida A&M’s Outstanding Alumni of the Quasquicentennial and was hon-ored by the Howard University Alumni Club of Westchester and Rockland. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize my constituent, Dr. Willie Bryant. I urge my col-leagues to join me in honoring his exceptional life of service. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF INTER-NATIONAL HOLOCAUST REMEM-BRANCE DAY AND 71ST ANNI-VERSARY OF THE LIBERATION OF AUSCHWITZ 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 28, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate International Holocaust Re-membrance Day and the 71st anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp. It is fitting today to remember to those who experienced the depth of human cruelty in that camp and all other Nazi concentration camps. It is estimated that over one million pris-oners perished at the Auschwitz concentration camp over the five years that it was oper-ational. I grieve for those lost souls, but I give thanks for the 7,500 prisoners who were liber-ated 71 years ago today. The stories of those survivors ensure that we will never forget this crime against human-ity and remain vigilant and dedicated to com-bating hatred and oppression in all its forms. For that reason, I would also like to bring at-tention to the ongoing massacres and human rights violations being carried out by the mili-tant terrorist organization Boko Haram in Nige-ria. Just like the actions of the Nazis during World War II, the actions of Boko Haram today are an affront to human life and dignity. From their first violent uprising in 2009, to the massacre in Baga less than one month ago, Boko Haram has been waging a war that has cost an estimated 10,000 lives, and dis-placed more than one million people. I thank President Obama and Secretary Kerry for their active engagement in sup-porting the Nigerians in their efforts to combat Boko Haram. I also thank the United States military, for providing the Nigerian military with trainers and specialists to aid them. But there needs to be more. These atrocities must not be permitted to continue, and we must do everything within our power to stop the kidnapping and killing of innocent men, women, and children across Ni-geria. So on this 71st anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, let us remember and honor those who perished in the Holocaust by re-dedicating ourselves to combating genocide and the oppression of people by regimes and entities motivated by hatred, religious bigotry, megalomania, or false ideologies. HONORING MOTHER MATTIE MAE AMOS-MARSHALL HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 28, 2016 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to honor Mrs. Mattie Mae Amos-Marshall, who was born in a small com-munity in Florence, Mississippi called Steen Creek on October 15, 1915 to the late Mr. Ben and Salle White-Amos. Mrs. Marshall married her childhood sweet-heart, the late Mr. Jessie Marshall, at the age of 18 and moved to Flora, Mississippi where she began a family of her own. Mrs. Marshall was baptized at a young age at Stokes Chapel M.B. Church and later moved her membership to Jones Chapel M.B. Church where she is a member of the Moth-er’s Board. Mrs. Marshall moved to Canton, Mississippi as a child and was educated in the Madison County School. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Mother Mattie Mae Amos-Mar-shall.

CONGRATULATING CARL SWINDELL ON HIS RETIREMENT FROM THE EULESS POLICE DE-PARTMENT 
HON. KENNY MARCHANT 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 28, 2016 Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Carl Swindell on his well- earned retirement from the City of Euless Po-lice Department in Euless, Texas, after thirty- two years of dedicated service. Carl is a hardworking and highly respected officer of the Euless Police Department. He has honorably served his community since be-ginning his distinguished career with the de-partment in 1983. Throughout his time in Eu-less, Carl has received over 42 police com-mendations as evidence of his outstanding service and professionalism. Whether he was investigating criminal activity as a detective, sharing his knowledge and experiences as a field training officer, or protecting the children of Euless as a school police resource officer, Carl always provided an outstanding service to his community. Carl’s contributions to the law enforcement operations in the City of Euless have helped to ensure countless officers have been ade-quately trained and prepared for the chal-lenges they face in their everyday duties as police. His legacy will leave a lasting mark on the City of Euless and the Euless Police De-partment for many years to come. Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to recognize the exhaustive efforts Carl has contributed to the City of Euless. I ask all of my distin-guished colleagues to join me in recognizing Carl Swindell and his many years of service.

IN HONOR OF GALIYA UMAROVA 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 28, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I inform this House that on January 4, 2016, Galiya Umarova, wife of Am-bassador Kairat Umarov of Kazakhstan passed away. The Ambassador and Galiya were married for thirty years. Their son, Gaini, currently works for an international consulting group in Astana, Kazakhstan. Galiya and her husband have known each other much longer than the beginning of his diplomatic career. The two met in English class, where he en-tertained her with his funny stories. Galiya grew up in Almaty, Kazakhstan’s largest city and the country’s foremost histor-ical, financial and cultural center. She dedicated her life to the promotion of the importance of education and was a pas-sionate supporter of building progress in her home country, including her husband’s work on behalf of his country. For example, the Ambassador and Galiya were posted to the United States capitol three different times in the span of 15 years. Known as the land of peace and prosperity, the beautiful country of Kazakhstan sits on 3,000 years of extraordinary history. The country’s development has been influ-enced by legends such as Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan. For centuries, the Silk Road through Kazakhstan served as one of the world’s old-est and most historically significant trade routes. All of this has contributed to the richness of the Kazakh culture and its capacity to adapt and develop. Much like her home country, Galiya Umarova adapted and developed as she ac-companied her husband throughout his diplo-matic service for his country. In fact, Galiya adapted to the DC life by driving herself around town, navigating the hectic DC traffic. Galiya and the Ambassador traveled the world over, spreading the imperative of cul-tural tourism, the beautiful culture of Kazakhstan and its over 140 different ethnic groups, while working to promote peace at home and in bilateral relations such as its re-lationship with the United States. The couple embodied what former UN Sec-retary General Kofi Annan declared about their country: ‘‘Kazakhstan may serve as an exam-ple of a peaceful multiethnic country where ethnic diversity is a blessing, but not a curse.’’ Kazakhstan is located in the central part of Eurasia, almost equidistant from the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. Indeed, throughout history, Kazakhstan was an arena for brisk commercial and political re-lations and it now plays an important role as a link between Europe, Central Asia and the rapidly developing Asian-Pacific region. Notwithstanding her husband’s busy diplo-matic schedule over the past 2 decades, Galiya worked hard to bring balance into her family life. For example, she always found time to enjoy comedy films with her family. She also enjoyed a variety of hobbies such as tennis, golf, practicing yoga, growing her own natural fruits and vegetables in her gar-den. Today, I hope my colleagues will join me in sending prayers and condolences to Ambas-sador Umarov and his family. I also ask for a moment of silence in Galiya Umarova’s honor and memory.

HONORING VETERAN EDISON THOMAS BROWN, JR. 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 28, 2016 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to honor a remarkable veteran, Mr. Edison Thomas Brown, Jr. U.S. Army Veteran Edison Thomas Brown, Jr. is a Mississippi native who was born and reared in the hills of Holmes County within the U.S. Second Congressional District. Born in the very late 1950’s, Mr. Brown, and other youth like him, grew up during the heat of oppression, segregation and poverty of the Holmes County 1960s civil rights movement. Yet, Mr. Brown says, he nor his family ever viewed themselves as underclass. Although poor by economic standards and conditions, he and his siblings learned early of the importance of working hard to make a de-cent living by two nurturing parents, who were farmers themselves and who also worked for white farmers as well, picking cotton and such. His parents were Edison Thomas Brown, Sr. and Ednora Randle Brown (both now de-ceased). His father was also a U.S. Army veteran who served in World War II. In fact, Mr. Brown says he was inspired to volunteer to serve his country in the military by his father and eldest brother James, a U.S. Army Vietnam veteran. After graduating from high school at what is formerly known as Tchula Attendance Center (TAC) in Tchula. MS, he began his military ca-reer in July, 1975 at Fort Knox, Ky. During his tour of duty, he was trained and served as a Track Vehicle Mechanic, special-izing in diesel repairs. His U.S. military career also included service in Gelnhausen, Ger-many. While in the military, he earned the rank of Specialist 4th Class (SPEC 4). Proud to serve his country, Mr. Brown is grateful that his mili-tary career afforded him many travels that he would not have afforded to make and opportu-nities he possibly would not have had. Mr. Brown’s tour of duty concluded at Fort Stewart, GA in 1979; however, he remained in reserve status until 1981, when he received an Honorable Discharge. After the military, Mr. Brown took advantage of the GI Bill and began to educate himself (part-time) in Electronic Service Technology coursework. Over the years, he has served in several employment capacities in the Metro Jackson area. His longest stint was with McRaes Distribution and its merging oper-ations, 1985–2001. Today, a Clinton, Miss. resident in the Sec-ond Congressional District, Mr. Brown spends most of his time actively serving in Holy Tem-ple Baptist Church of West Jackson, pastored by the history-making Rev. Audrey Lynne Hall. At Holy Temple as a deacon, he is Chairman and also serves as Sunday School Super-intendent and teacher. He, his wife, Gail, and son, Edison, III, have also participated in the church’s ongoing Homeless Outreach Ministry in which the church gives toiletries, snacks and other needful items to the homeless once a month at Poindexter Park near Downtown Jackson. Mr. Brown’s favorite scripture of the Bible in which he tries to live by is Proverbs 3:5–6— ‘‘Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.’’ Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing a special Veteran, Mr. Edison Thomas Brown, Jr., for his dedication and support to the Holmes County Community.

Growing up in Montgomery, Alabama in the 1930s, Patricia Spencer followed in her moth-er and grandmother’s footsteps becoming a member of the NAACP at the age of seven, a group which she was still a member of 72 years later. At the age of nineteen, while serv-ing as Secretary of the local NAACP branch, Ms. Spencer received the news that her men-tor on the NAACP Youth Council, Rosa Parks, was arrested while riding the Montgomery bus. Ms. Spencer immediately started churning out fliers urging others to boycott the bus. During this time Ms. Spencer also babysat Yolanda King, the first eldest child of Martin Luther King, Jr. Ms. Spencer graduated from Alabama State University and then moved to Orlando, FL to take a position as an operator with Southern Bell, the first African American to hold this po-sition. From there she moved to Detroit and served 13 years on the local school board. In recognition of her service to the Detroit area, the Martin Luther King, Jr. High School Audito-rium and the swimming facility at Charles Ket-tering High School bear her name. In the mid 1990s she moved to Tampa, FL. Once settled in, she immediately started to volunteer with the Hillsborough NAACP branch, where she used her vast knowledge of the organization’s rules to mentor members and secure funding for the branch. She served as Membership Chair and Area Director for the NAACP’s state conference as well as Secretary of the Hillsborough County chapter. She will forever be remembered for her constant efforts to boost NAACP membership. In addition to her work with the NAACP, Ms. Spencer also co-chaired the Afro-Academic, Cultural, Technologic and Scientific Olympics. This program recruits high school students to compete in science and visual arts competi-tions. In 2007, Governor Charlie Crist ap-pointed her as a member of the Hillsborough County Civil Service Board. Ms. Spencer will be forever remembered as a leader in the Tampa Bay community for her unequivocal support of justice and fairness. On December 15th, 2015, she passed away two days after her 79th birthday. Mr. Speaker, I join the Tampa Bay community in honoring Ms. Patricia Spencer for her lifelong commit-ment to service.

HONORING BARBARA CLARK 
HON. MICHAEL G. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 28, 2016 Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, congratula-tions to Barbara Clark for a job well done on the occasion of her retirement. This is a mile-stone for the executive director who led the Network of Victim Assistance for 25 years. NOVA, which serves Bucks County and the Philadelphia area is recognized for its high quality services for the most vulnerable in the community. Under her direction, NOVA evolved from a small victims services organi-zation to a large, financially sound, nationally recognized organization with high standards of services available to crime victims, including— children, the elderly and people with disabil-ities. As executive director, Barbara Clark led the way and was widely recognized and hon-ored for her ability to create problem-solving groups and find solutions and funding to ac-complish the work—the creation of a commu-nity free from violence and harm. Among her many accomplishments is the ability to fund the agency and its projects. Under her guid-ance, the budget and the capacity of NOVA rose from $235,000 in 1991 to more than $3.3 million today. Another initiative that defined her management ability was the NOVA com-prehensive capital campaign she launched in 2008, called Voices Against Violence. The goal was set at $1.9 million, but at the end of the campaign $2.1 million was raised. Once again, her knowledge, dedication and her out-standing management abilities led the way. Barbara has the appreciation and gratitude of her colleagues, those she mentored, and the community she served. In so doing, she has set an example for others to follow. f 
JARVIS GLOVER 
HON. KATHY CASTOR 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 28, 2016 Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the service and dedication of an extraordinary community servant, Mr. Jarvis Glover. Born and raised in Port Tampa, Mr. Glover has been fondly known as its unofficial Mayor. Mr. Glover started his career with Hillsborough County in 1975, at a time when our nation, and our own community, was progressing and on the cusp of tremendous growth. Beginning as a groundskeeper, Jarvis served to improve the lives of the citizens of Hillsborough Coun-ty, Florida in many capacities throughout the following four decades of his tenure. Mr. Jarvis recently retired from Hillsborough County, after serving with unwavering discipline and integ-rity and inspiring future generations of public servants. Mr. Glover’s outstanding work ethic and stalwart dedication have made an indelible mark on day-to-day County business and rep-resents the values that this community up-holds. Mr. Glover has had a big heart for pub-lic service, which has perhaps made him Hillsborough County’s greatest ambassador and he is revered by everyone. Mr. Glover’s commitment and devotion be-gins with his family. He is quick to credit his loving wife, Clara, as a driving force in his life. His own children, La’Daishia and Jarvis Jr., have supported and followed in their father’s lofty footsteps into public service. Mr. Glover’s praise and admiration by every-one he meets has not happened overnight. He has earned it by demonstrating a daily pledge to serve his colleagues and neighbors with re-spect and hard work. His example of genuine enthusiasm for public service should serve to motivate so many answering the call to join our public agencies, which have a profound impact on millions in almost every aspect of their lives. Hillsborough County is a better place because of Mr. Glover. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join the Hillsborough County com-munity in thanking Jarvis Glover for his dec-ades of exceptional service. HONORING REV. ROBERT L. MILLER HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 28, 2016 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to honor a God-fearing and im-pressionistic man, Rev. Robert L. Miller. Rev. Miller has shown what can be done through tenacity, dedication and a desire to serve God. Rev. Miller has done many things through-out his life, but inside he has always been a preacher. At 89 years old, he can’t see himself ever hanging it up, because it’s his calling. Some of the members of the church have said their church will close its doors if he leaves. He is currently serving five churches on a rotation schedule where he will do two serv-ices a Sunday except one Sunday a month, he only does one service. Forty years ago in July is when he first took the pulpit at New Mount Zion M.B. Church. Eleven years later in June 1986, he began serving his fifth church, Locust Grove M.B. Church. He also preached at Providence M.B. Church from 1971 until 1986. He has served as vice moderator of the Sharkey County Bap-tist Association and is currently the moderator of the Warren County Baptist Association. He was ordained in December 1968 and started serving his first church just weeks later. The profession is so much a part of his soul; oftentimes he slides into preacher mode mid-conversation. The only job Rev. Miller has ever had besides being a preacher was a let-ter carrier for 25 years. At 18, Miller was drafted and left high school to join World War II. He spent time in France, England, Belgium and Germany as a medic. Once the war was over, he returned to Vicksburg to finish his high school degree at Bowman High School. Rev. Miller married two years later and had eight children with his wife of almost 30 years. She passed away in 1979. He was remarried in August 2013 to Elease Fisher Miller. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Rev. Robert L. Miller for 40 years of service to New Mount Zion M.B. Church.

10TH ANNIVERSARY OF CBP’S AIR AND MARINE OPERATIONS—OR AMO 
HON. CANDICE S. MILLER 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 28, 2016 Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 10th anniversary of the merger of U.S. Customs and Border Pro-tection’s (CBP) air and marine assets, which today are known as CBP’s Air and Marine Op-erations—or AMO. This valuable component of CBP provides critical aviation and maritime capabilities that support security along the na-tion’s land and maritime borders. Prior to the establishment of DHS in 2003, the assets and personnel that comprise AMO were divided amongst multiple agencies, in-cluding the U.S. Customs Service and the U.S. Border Patrol. These resources were consolidated under DHS and integrated into CBP to better coordinate and align our na-tion’s border and maritime security resources and increase the effectiveness of those re-sources. Today, AMO helps secure our nation from transnational threats, including terrorism; weapons and drug smuggling; and other illicit transnational activities. With 1,800 federal agents and specialists, a fleet of aircraft and marine vessels, and an array of advanced surveillance and domain awareness technologies, AMO conducts its mission along our land borders and coastlines, and within the nation’s interior. Based out of more than 90 locations throughout the United States, AMO performed approximately 30,000 missions, which sup-ported 51,000 apprehensions and made 4,500 arrests ensuring the safety and security of our nation. As one of the nation’s largest and most ca-pable aviation and maritime law enforcement organization, AMO leverages its capabilities by forging crucial partnerships with international, federal, state, local and tribal agencies in sup-port of national security, law enforcement, dis-aster relief, and humanitarian operations. On behalf of a grateful nation, I want to commend the men and women of the CBP’s Air and Marine Operations for their years of service and wish them a happy 10th anniver-sary.

HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 28, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I have taken to this floor too many times to mourn tragic deaths caused by senseless acts of gun violence. I rise today to remember Mr. Carroll Patrick Oliver of Houston, Texas, a well-loved and re-spected businessman and community leader of my 18th district. Mr. Oliver was tragically murdered on Mon-day, January 11, 2016, when he was shot and killed in a robbery as he left his place of busi-ness to do a morning bank run. A former Chicago police officer and lawful gun owner, Mr. Oliver attempted to defend himself when approached by the robbers but was ruthlessly shot by one of the thieves as they attempted to steal his briefcase. As a McDonalds franchise owner for nearly 37 years, Mr. Oliver was well known through-out Houston as a kind-hearted and giving man, who helped open many doors for those in his community. He often fed the homeless and neighbor-hood children simply in need of a warm meal. He did not hesitate to help those he knew or those he came across in need of a helping hand. Laudably, Mr. Oliver was most recognized for providing employment opportunities to help individuals succeed in his community, includ-ing hiring teenagers from a local high school and working with several programs to hire in-dividuals with criminal records looking for a second chance. Mr. Oliver also served as a volunteer Chap-lain for the Fort Bend County Precinct Two Constable’s office, where he led the commu-nity in prayer at school events and nursing homes. Giving back to his community in more ways than one, Mr. Oliver had a servant’s heart and a lifelong calling to help the poor and under-privileged. He is survived by his wife of 49 years, Jolene Oliver and their two children Cedric Oli-ver and Stephanie Oliver, as well as a host of relatives, friends and his McDonald’s family. The loss of this great man will run deep throughout Houston. We will miss him and his beautiful acts of kindness and generosity. I hope Houston can find peace and comfort in the legacy of greatness he leaves with us, and that others continue to follow in his foot-steps. I also hope that we continue to fight gun vi-olence and find ways to prevent these awful acts of violence. This tragic event sadly demonstrates the clear and present dangers of gun violence in our society, despite individuals being a lawful gun owner themselves. As my colleagues and I continue to push for gun safety legislation, we must come together and acknowledge that we are all at risk, and that none of us are immune from the dangers of gun violence. In solemn remembrance of this beloved and remarkable community leader, I ask that a mo-ment of silence be observed in his memory. f

HON. STENY H. HOYER 
OF MARYLAND  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 28, 2016 Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker. I rise today to recognize the Charles County Chamber of Commerce on the occasion of its sixtieth anni-versary. Since its establishment in 1956, with Reed McDonagh as its first President, the Chamber has provided a boost to the local business community through educational sem-inars, public forums business development strategies, and a strong voice for the needs of its members. Working in partnership with the county government, the public school system, and local community leaders, the Chamber continues to contribute to the goal of ensuring that Charles County grows and remains a great place to do business. With each passing decade, the Charles County Chamber of Commerce has taken cre-ative steps to fulfill its mission to support its members and advance the county as a leader for economic growth and private sector job creation in Southern Maryland through its ef-fective advocacy, high level networking and timely communications. The Chamber has always dedicated itself to the mission of making Charles County a great place to invest, work, and grow a business. In its first years the Chamber gave rise to the Committee of 100, which later became the county’s Economic Development Commission. In the 1970’s, it established the Annual Trade Show to introduce local businesses, large and small, to county residents and to promote available services. In the decade that followed, it launched a scholarship program in memory of U.S. Navy Seabee diver, Robert D. Stethem, a Charles County resident and an early victim of the War on Terrorism, an exam-ple of the many ways it has worked to strengthen the local community over the years. The Chamber created a memorial ‘‘Business of the Year’’ Award honoring Reed McDonagh in the 1990’s to recognize a business that pro-vides exceptional leadership in advancing the mission of the Chamber and its core prin-ciples. Around that time as well. the Chamber played a vital role in advocating for the impor-tance of the Naval Surface Warfare Center.

county, and forging a new international part-nership through the Sister City program. The Chamber has also been an active member of the Tri-County Council of Southern Maryland. Now located in La Plata, its services are easily accessible to residents and businesses across Charles County, and it has broadened its ef-forts to take advantage of new developments in the region through its Young Professionals Group and Military Alliance Council.

IN TRIBUTE TO DAVID BOWIE, LEGENDARY PERFORMING AND RECORDING ARTIST WHO NEVER LACKED THE COURAGE OR CON-FIDENCE TO CHANGE 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 28, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, it is with a deep sadness and a heavy heart that I rise today to pay tribute to David Bowie, a true trailblazer of the music and film industry. David Bowie died on January 10, 2016 in New York City, from cancer; he was only 69 years old. David Bowie was born David Robert Jones in Brixton, South London, England, on January 8, 1947. David showed a strong interest in music from an early age and began playing the sax-ophone at the age of 13. After graduating from Bromley Technical High School at the age of 16, David started working as a commercial artist. David Bowie was also a stand-in with a number of bands and the leader of his own group, Davy Jones and the Lower Third. David Bowie changed his last name to Bowie to avoid confusion with Davy Jones of The Monkees, a name which was inspired by the knife developed by Jim Bowie, the 19th century American frontiersman. The first solo album David Bowie recorded was unsuccessful and soon thereafter he de-cided to take a hiatus from the music world. But by early 1969, David Bowie had re-turned full time to the music industry, releasing the hit single ‘‘Space Oddity.’’ The song resonated with the public, sparked in large part by the BBC’s use of the single during its coverage of the Apollo 11 moon landing. His next work, 1971’s Hunky Dory, featured two blockbuster hits: the title track that was a tribute to Andy Warhol, the Velvet Under-ground and Bob Dylan; and ‘‘Changes,’’ which came to embody Bowie himself. As David Bowie’s celebrity profile increased, so did his desire to keep fans and critics guessing, first by claiming he was gay, and then introducing Ziggy Stardust, Bowie’s imag-ining of a doomed rock star. His 1972 album, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, made him a bona fide superstar. By the mid-1970s David Bowie had contin-ued his chameleon style by jettisoning the out-rageous costumes and garish sets. Then in two short years released the al-bums David Live in 1974 and Young Ameri-cans in 1975. In 1980 David Bowie, while living in New York, released Scary Monsters, a much- lauded album that featured the single ‘‘Ashes to Ashes,’’ an updated version of his earlier ‘‘Space Oddity.’’ David Bowie’s creative interests were not limited to music. In 1980, David Bowie performed on Broad-way in The Elephant Man and his passion for film helped land him the title role in The Man Who Fell to Earth in 1976 and a starring role in the film Labyrinth in 1986. Over the next decade, David Bowie bounced back and forth between acting and music. The most popular of David Bowie creations of late has been Bowie Bonds, financial secu-rities the artist himself backed with royalties from his pre-1990 work. David Bowie was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, and was a 2006 recipient of the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. He kept a low profile for several years until the release of his 2013 album, The Next Day, which skyrocketed to #2 on the Billboard charts. He released Blackstar, his final album, on his 69th birthday, January 8, 2016. New York Times critic Jon Pareles noted that it was a ‘‘strange, daring and ultimately rewarding’’ work ‘‘with a mood darkened by bitter awareness of mortality.’’ The world would soon learn that the album had been produced under truly difficult cir-cumstances when the music icon died on Jan-uary 10, 2016, in New York City, two days after its release. Mr. Speaker, David Bowie famously said of himself, ‘‘I’m not a prophet or a stone aged man, just a mortal with potential of a super-man. I’m living on.’’ Yes, David Bowie truly possessed the ability of an artistic superhuman and will live on in the hearts of his dedicated fans, admirers, and the present and future artists he has inspired around the world. I ask the House to observe a moment of si-lence in memory of David Bowie, the Man Who Fell to Earth and gave the world Ziggy Stardust and who never lacked the courage or confidence to change.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF WILKES BASHFORD 
HON. NANCY PELOSI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, January 28, 2016 Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, it is with great personal sadness that I rise to pay tribute to a legendary, beloved San Francisco figure, Wilkes Bashford, who died on January 16. His world-renowned establishment—the eponymous ‘Wilkes Bashford’—delighted San Franciscans and visitors alike for half a cen-tury. Wilkes Bashford was long celebrated as the man who gave San Francisco its elegance. His life’s greatest pleasure was educating gen-erations of customers about style and about giving back to the community. Wilkes Bashford paired his fashion success with civic leadership, serving as Board Presi-dent of the San Francisco War Memorial and Performing Arts Center, home to San Fran-cisco’s Symphony, Opera, Ballet and Veterans Building. He guided the renovation of the spectacular Veterans Building and co-chaired the committee to create the new, permanent memorial to our nation’s veterans in the court-yard. His philanthropic works included support for Partners Ending Domestic Abuse, the Mu-seum of the African Diaspora and Muttville Senior Dog Rescue. Wilkes had a special love for dachshunds and always had one as his faithful companion. Wilkes arrived in San Francisco in 1959 and opened his original store in 1966. ‘Wilkes Bashford’ became the focus of the San Fran-cisco fashion world. His exquisite taste, vast knowledge of the retail industry and foresight in predicting emerging fashion trends gave his store an international reputation. He intro-duced designer labels long before others and helped launch fashion careers. His legendary Friday lunches at Le Central restaurant spanned forty years. Here Wilkes dined and conversed about politics and local goings-on with good friends, Mayor Willie Brown, San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen, Matthew Kelly, Sandy Walker and Harry de Wildt. This long-time group of friends epitomized elegance, sophistication and charm. They enjoyed a special camaraderie and shared not only a love of the good life but a great passion for their city of San Francisco. Mayor Willie Brown called Wilkes Bashford part of the heart of the city. As we mourn Wilkes’ passing, we remember his committed civic leadership, his career as a luxury cloth-ier, and his life as a very well respected and gentle man. May it bring comfort to all who loved Wilkes that so many cherish his memory as a warm, loving, kind friend and employer— a quintessential gentleman.

Each year this day is set aside for Ameri-cans to celebrate the life and legacy of a man who brought hope and healing to America. The Martin Luther King Holiday reminds us that nothing is impossible when we are guided by the better angels of our nature. Dr. King’s inspiring words filled a great void in our nation, and answered our collective longing to become a country that truly lived by its noblest principles. Yet, Dr. King knew that it was not enough just to talk the talk, that he had to walk the walk for his words to be credible. And so we commemorate on this holiday the man of action, who put his life on the line for freedom and justice every day. We honor the courage of a man who en-dured harassment, threats and beatings, and even bombings. We commemorate the man who went to jail 29 times to achieve freedom for others, and who knew he would pay the ultimate price for his leadership, but kept on marching and pro-testing and organizing anyway. Dr. King once said that we all have to de-cide whether we ‘‘will walk in the light of cre-ative altruism or the darkness of destructive selfishness.’’ ‘‘Life’s most persistent and nagging ques-tion,’’ he said, is ‘‘what are you doing for oth-ers?’’ And when Dr. King talked about the end of his mortal life in one of his last sermons, on February 4, 1968 in the pulpit of Ebenezer Baptist Church, even then he lifted up the value of service as the hallmark of a full life: ‘‘I’d like somebody to mention on that day Martin Luther King, Jr. tried to give his life serving others,’’ he said. ‘‘I want you to say on that day, that I did try in my life . . . to love and serve humanity.’’ We should also remember that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was, above all, a per-son who was always willing to speak truth to power. There is perhaps no better example of Dr. King’s moral integrity and consistency than his criticism of the Vietnam War being waged by the Johnson Administration, an administra-tion that was otherwise a friend and champion of civil and human rights. THE LIFE OF THE REV . DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING , JR. 
Martin Luther King, Jr. was born in Atlanta, Georgia on January 15, 1929. Martin’s youth was spent in our country’s Deep South, then run by Jim Crow and the Ku Klux Klan. For young African-Americans, it was an en-vironment even more dangerous than the one they face today. A young Martin managed to find a dream, one that he pieced together from his read-ings—in the Bible, and literature, and just about any other book he could get his hands on. And not only did those books help him edu-cate himself, but they also allowed him to work through the destructive and traumatic ex-periences of blatant discrimination, and the discriminatory abuse inflicted on himself, his family, and his people. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. that we celebrate here today could have turned out to be just another African-American who would have had to learn to be happy with what he had, and what he was allowed. But he learned to use his imagination and his dreams to see right through those ‘‘White Only’’ signs—to see the reality that all men, and women, regardless of their place of origin, their gender, or their creed, are created equal. Through his studies, Dr. King learned that training his mind and broadening his intellect effectively shielded him from the demoralizing effects of segregation and discrimination. Dr. Martin Luther King was a dreamer. His dreams were a tool through which he was able to lift his mind beyond the reality of his segregated society, and into a realm where it was possible that white and black, red and brown, and all others live and work alongside each other and prosper. But Martin Luther King, Jr. was not just an idle daydreamer. He shared his visions through speeches that motivated others to join in his nonviolent effort to lift themselves from poverty and isolation by creating a new Amer-ica where equal justice and institutions were facts of life. In the Declaration of Independence in 1776, Thomas Jefferson wrote, ‘‘We hold these truths to be self evident, that all Men are Cre-ated Equal.’’ At that time and for centuries to come, Afri-can-Americans were historically, culturally, and legally excluded from inclusion in that declara-tion. Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King’s ‘‘I Have a Dream’’ Speech, delivered 50 years ago, on August 28, 1963, was a clarion call to each citizen of this great nation that we still hear today. His request was simply and eloquently con-veyed—he asked America to allow of its citi-zens to live out the words written in its Dec-laration of Independence and to have a place in this nation’s Bill of Rights. The sixties were a time of great crisis and conflict. The dreams of the people of this country were filled with troubling images that arose like lava from the nightmares of violence and the crises they had to face, both domesti-cally and internationally. It was the decade of the Cuban Missile Cri-sis, the Vietnam War, and the assassinations of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Mal-colm X, Presidential Candidate Robert Ken-nedy, and the man we honor here today. Dr. Martin Luther King’s dream helped us turn the corner on civil rights. It started with a peaceful march for suffrage that started in Selma, Alabama on March 7, 1965—a march that ended with violence at the hands of law enforcement officers as the marchers crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge. But the dream did not die there. Dr. King led the Montgomery Bus Boycott, often with Rosa Parks. The boycott lasted for 381 days, as an end result, the United States Supreme Court outlawed racial segregation on all public transportation. Dr. King used several nonviolent tactics to protest against Jim Crow Laws in the South and he organized and led demonstrations for desegregation, labor and voting rights. On April 4, 1967, at Riverside Church in New York City, he spoke out against the Viet-nam War, when he saw the devastation that his nation was causing abroad and the effect that it had on the American men and women sent overseas. He said, and I quote: 
Somehow this madness must cease. We must stop now. I speak as a child of God and brother to the suffering poor of Vietnam. I speak for those whose land is being laid waste, whose homes are being destroyed, whose culture is being subverted. I speak for the poor of America who are paying the dou-ble price of smashed hopes at home, and death and corruption in Vietnam. I speak as a citizen of the world, for the world as it stands aghast at the path we have taken. I speak as one who loves America, to the lead-ers of our own nation: The great initiative in this war is ours; the initiative to stop it must be ours. 
When the life of Dr. Martin Luther King was stolen from us, he was a very young 39 years old. People remember that Dr. King died in Memphis, but few can remember why he was there. On that fateful day in 1968 Dr. King came to Memphis to support a strike by the city’s sanitation workers. The garbage men there had recently formed a chapter of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees to demand better wages and working conditions. But the city refused to recognize their union, and when the 1,300 employees walked off their jobs the police broke up the rally with mace and billy clubs. It was then that union leaders invited Dr. King to Memphis. Despite the danger he might face entering such a volatile situation, it was an invitation he could not refuse. Not because he longed for danger, but be-cause the labor movement was intertwined

with the civil rights movement for which he had given up so many years of his life. The death of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., will never overshadow his life. That is his legacy as a dreamer and a man of ac-tion. It is a legacy of hope, tempered with peace. It is a legacy not quite yet fulfilled. I hope that Dr. King’s vision of equality under the law is never lost to us, who in the present, toil in times of unevenness in our equality. For without that vision—without that dream—we can never continue to improve on the human condition. For those who have already forgotten, or whose vision is already clouded with the fog of complacency, I would like to recite the immor-tal words of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.: ‘‘I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former shareholders will be able to sit down together at the table of brother-hood. I have a dream that one day even the State of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but for the content of their character. I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day down in Ala-bama with its vicious racists, with its Gov-ernor having his lips dripping with words of interposition and nullification—one day right there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with lit-tle white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough place will be made plain and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it to-gether.’’ 
Dr. King’s dream did not stop at racial equality, his ultimate dream was one of human equality and dignity. There is no doubt that Dr. King supported freedom and justice for every individual in America. He was in midst of planning the 1968 Poor People’s Campaign for Jobs and Justice when he struck down by the dark deed of an assas-sin on April 4, 1968. It is for us, the living, to continue that fight today and forever, in the great spirit that in-spired the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
