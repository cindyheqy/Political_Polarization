PRAYER Reverend Michael Wilker, Lutheran Church of the Reformation, Wash-ington, D.C., offered the following prayer: Mothering God, You gave us birth in the bright morning of this world. Cre-ator, source of every breath, You are our rain, our wind, our Sun. As we celebrate mothers this week, we thank You for all the people who have served as mothers. They have pro-tected and nourished us, defended and loved us by giving us their very own lives. We repent of the times we have disrespected and abused, enslaved, and imprisoned people who have been mothers. Send Your fierce love to any-one who is suffering because they care for children. Help us heal from the times mothers have hurt children. Knit us all together with creative wisdom, feed us with bold compassion, and send us forth with wild courage. When mothers call us to do justice and work for peace, mercy, and health, help us listen intently. More than lend-ing mothers a hand, let us follow their lead. Amen. f

RECOGNIZING THE GRADUATION OF THE FAIRFAX COUNTY FIRE AND RESCUE DEPARTMENT 142ND RECRUIT CLASS 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 11, 2018 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to con-gratulate the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Department and the graduates of the 142nd Recruit Class. As they prepare to join the ranks of the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Department, I encourage the 33 graduates to reflect on the history of the department and the contributions and dedication of the brave men and women who have served before them to protect our community. The Fairfax County Fire and Rescue De-partment’s Recruit School consists of an ex-tensive and demanding 24-week program. In addition to two weeks of orientation, recruits completed seven weeks of EMT training and fifteen weeks of fire suppression training. Upon graduation, these recruits will be cer-tified at the level of Firefighter I/II by the Vir-ginia Department of Fire Programs. These recruits have the distinct honor of joining one of the best Fire and Rescue De-partments in the United States. The efforts of the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Depart-ment have been recognized across this coun-try. Members from the Department serve on the elite VA Task Force 1, which is among the first units called to disaster zones to provide search and rescue support. Members of that Task Force were recognized by the Inter-national Association of Fire Chiefs with the Benjamin Franklin Award for Valor as a result of their efforts in the aftermath of the dev-astating earthquakes that struck Nepal in 2015. Recently, they have seen extensive work in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands as part of disaster relief ef-forts in the aftermaths of Hurricanes Harvey and Maria. Fairfax County is fortunate to have such excellent ambassadors for our commu-nity, and I commend them for all that they have done. As the newest members of the Fire and Rescue Department, the 142nd Re-cruit Class graduates join the department as integral parts of our community’s emergency response and public safety team. I am con-fident that this graduating class will serve the residents of Fairfax County with honor and distinction. It is my great honor to include in the RECORD the names of the 142nd Recruit Class. Evan B. Bache, Trina Y. Beall, David C. Breslin, James M. Brittenham, David A. Brown, Julian N. Butler, Manuel J. Castellon, Jesus E. Castro, Stephen M. Ching, Andrew M. Cruikshank, Nathan J.

I thank them for their service to their community and to all members of the Fire and Rescue Department, past and present, I say: ‘‘Stay safe.’’ DEVEN CESPEDES-ROSES HON. ED PERLMUTTER

Ms. Eakle was born in San Francisco, Cali-fornia and grew up in Mill Valley and St. Hel-ena, California.

ways. She was a Board Member of the North-ern California Coastal Region of the American Red Cross and served on their Disaster Action Team. She has been a project leader in 4–H and a volunteer for liturgies at St. Helena Catholic Church. . Mr. Speaker, Ms. Eakle is a passionate edu-cator who is dearly loved by her students, her colleagues and our community. It is therefore fitting and proper that we honor Susan Eakle here today.

HONORING THE CAREER OF MR. TONY COROALLES 
HON. TED LIEU 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 11, 2018 Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the career of Mr. Tony Coroalles who is retiring on May 31, 2018. Tony’s 15 years of service establishes him as the longest serving City Manager in the history of the City of Calabasas in Los Angeles Coun-ty. Tony was born in Havana, Cuba in 1952 and immigrated with his family to San Fran-cisco when he was young. Tony grew up in San Francisco and received his bachelor’s de-gree in biology from the University of San Francisco. In 1974, Tony enlisted in the United States Army and after 27 years of service earned the rank of Colonel before he retired from the military in 2001. When Tony was se-lected as the City Manager of the City of Calabasas, he described his experience in the Army as instrumental in preparing him for the job. Tony once stated about his military service, ‘‘I ran all the Army bases in Alaska—I was es-sentially the city manager for the Army in Alaska. I did that for a little over two years . . . Before that, I had done the same thing in a smaller installation . . . I had two tours in the Army in city management.’’ After Tony’s retirement from the military in 2001, he worked as the Assistant General Manager for the Department of Recreation and Parks in Los Angeles. Tony managed all of the parks and open spaces in the city of Los Angeles as well as the 1,200 full-time em-ployees and 4,000 part-time employees of the department. When Tony was hired as the City Manager of the city of Calabasas, then Mayor James Bozajian said that the city council chose Tony not only for his experience, but for his ‘‘ideas and his sense of direction’’ for the city of Calabasas. Focusing on delivering quality services to the city’s residents, Tony oversaw the installation of a new ‘smart’ irrigation sys-tem which saves money by actively respond-ing to weather conditions, as well as the con-struction of separate senior and civic centers. These new structures and systems, along with improving the city’s roadways and streetscapes, has not only improved service delivery in the Calabasas community, but brought it closer together. Tony and his wife Patty will be moving to Lake Oconee, Georgia to be closer to mem-bers of their family. I would like to thank Tony for everything he has contributed over the course of his career with the city of Calabasas. f

Colleagues, please join me in thanking these veterans and their families for their ex-emplary dedication and service to this great nation. I would also like to extend a special thank you to the local communities, all of the volunteers, and Mr. Jeremy West and Mr. John West for their extensive work in orga-nizing this Honor Flight.

HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 11, 2018 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Korean-American Association of the Washington Metropolitan Area (KAAW) and its President, Young Cheong Kim, on the occasion of the 2017 KORUS Festival. As one of the largest festivals of its kind, the KORUS festival brings together Koreans, Ko-rean-Americans, and others from our rich multicultural community to celebrate our dy-namic and harmonious relationship. The fes-tival provides not only the opportunity for us to experience the customs of the Korean culture, but also to recognize the shared history and partnership between our two nations. The need for that partnership to continue has only been made more evident in light of North Ko-rea’s continued provocative actions. As co- chair of the Congressional Caucus on Korea, I look forward to continuing my friendship with KAAW and the Korean-American community as we continue to build on the success of our alliance and work together toward the achieve-ment of our common goals. I will continue to do all that I can to ensure that the U.S.-Korea alliance remains strong and enduring. It would not be possible to hold an event of this magnitude without the support and com-mitment of volunteers from the community. It is my great honor to recognize the efforts of the following individuals and include in the R
ECORD their names: Tae Chang, Lisa Choi, Ellen Choi, Ellen Kim, Daniel Chung, Ryan Chung, Angela Song, Anna Song, Lauren Lee, Julia Hyojin Chun, Sara Han, Paul Lee, Jacob Son, Jonathon Kwak, Jonathon Yun, Hana Amber Cridlan, Denay Williams Taylor, Diane Lee Taylor, Daniel Lee, Christian Lim, Lindsey Hyun Ah Lim, Youchan Kim, Jaewoong Lee, Brandon Kim, Jeonggin Lee, Kylie Kim, Soobin Lebow, Dalit Lebow, Grace Ham Eun Chong. I would also like to give special recognition to Mr. Hosan Kim, who flew all the way from South Korea to organize and perform the role of Master of Ceremonies for this festival. Mr. Speaker, festivals like KORUS are a wonderful example of the tremendous diversity we enjoy in Northern Virginia. Such a variety of different cultures enriches the lives of our citizens and fosters greater tolerance and un-derstanding. I commend KAAW and the volun-teers listed above for helping to bring such wonderful events to fruition, and ask my col-leagues to join me in wishing them great suc-cess in their future endeavors. f

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 11, 2018 Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Mayor of Aurora, Colorado, Mr. Steve Hogan. I represented Aurora during my first six years in Congress and have worked with Steve through his years of public service on behalf of our community. Steve’s record speaks for itself. He entered public service as a State Representative and went on to serve six non-consecutive terms as an Aurora City Councilor before being elected the city’s Mayor in 2011. During his decades of service, Steve called himself both a Demo-crat and a Republican, but always put his city and his constituents first. Steve has been inte-gral to growing Aurora over the last 40 years into a major economic driver in the region and a great place to live and raise a family. Steve’s leadership in the days after the shooting at the Aurora movie theater was re-markable. He brought calm and comfort and

direction and resolve to grieving families and a heartbroken community. Steve recently encouraged people to ‘‘em-brace the honor of public service—continually seeking to enrich the lives of our fellow resi-dents. It is in this honor, in this service, where leadership and inclusive governance will flour-ish.’’ These words ring true for the City of Au-rora and they ring true for us here in Con-gress. Steve has embodied these words each and every day he’s worked on behalf of his city, and I hope all of my colleagues will take this to heart as well. It has been an honor to work with Steve through the years, and I want to thank him on behalf of the entire state of Colorado for his tireless public service.

HONORING THE DEFENSE DIS-TRIBUTION CENTER SUSQUE-HANNA, NEW CUMBERLAND, PENNSYLVANIA, ON ITS 100TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. SCOTT PERRY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 11, 2018 Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, today I’d like to honor the Defense Distribution Center Sus-quehanna, located in New Cumberland, Penn-sylvania, on its 100th Anniversary of sup-porting our Nation’s warfighting and peace-keeping forces. In 1817, the United States government pur-chased 832 acres of farmland and began the construction of the Marsh Run Storage Depot, located in a small town just outside of Harris-burg, Pennsylvania. A ribbon cutting ceremony took place at the depot in November of 1918. During that first year, the installation served as a receiving point for supplies returning from overseas. The next few years, the depot provided en-gineer and chemical warfare support and then from 1921 to 1941, the base was a quarter-master, ordnance, signal and medical inactive storage area. From 1941 to 1946, the depot served as a WWII reception center and recruit processing center. Then from 1945 to 1949, it was a German and Italian prisoner of war camp. From 1955 through 1985, Chinook heli-copters were repaired and maintained on the depot. The depot provided an air maintenance mission from 1958 through 1983. During that timeframe, in 1962, the name changed to New Cumberland Army Depot, or NCAD. In 1991, as a result of Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) actions, the depot became part of the Defense Logistics Agency and is now known as the Defense Distribution Center Susque-hanna. Since 1991, the Defense Distribution Center Susquehanna, the largest distribution center within the Department of Defense, has provided military and commercial repair parts, medical supplies and industrial and electronic components to the Department of Defense in support of the warfighter. From the beginning of its humble history, the Defense Distribution Center Susquehanna has provided unwavering support to our mili-tary—providing critical supplies needed to per-form their mission. As someone who has served in several combat theaters, the world- class support to the Warfighter provided by the Defense Distribution Center Susquehanna was greatly appreciated by my brothers-and- sisters-in-arms. The men and women of this installation, past and present, should be justifi-ably proud of their role in sustaining our Na-tion’s military readiness. It’s with great pride, on behalf of Pennsylva-nia’s Fourth Congressional District, that I con-gratulate the men and women of the Defense Distribution Center Susquehanna for 100 years of dedicated service to the United States of America. f

American Chamber of Commerce (CACCI) in celebration of his 68th birthday. Born in Grenada, West Indies, Hastick mi-grated to the United States in 1972 and worked for several years as a social services administrator, community advocate, entre-preneur and newspaper publisher. In 1985, Dr. Roy A. Hastick, Sr. founded the Caribbean American Chamber of Commerce and Indus-try, Inc. (CACCI) with 10 members. Under his leadership, the organization has become a well-recognized business entity with a mem-bership of over 1,700 in the tri-state area and in the Caribbean. Over the years, CACCI has sustained and developed its mission which is to promote economic development on behalf of Caribbean American, African American, women and other minority entrepreneurs. As President and CEO of CACCI, Hastick has been credited for his tireless efforts to put in place a structure that serves the small busi-ness community and fosters a climate of unity and harmony among diverse cultures. Hastick has convened over 800 business development seminars that bring together the CACCI mem-bership with other entrepreneurs and the wider business community to network and access business resources, to make contacts and to explore contracts. As an ardent supporter of Two-Way trade between the United States and the Caribbean region, Hastick, an elected delegate to the 1995 White House Conference on Small Busi-ness, campaigned to get Two-Way trade with the Caribbean region into the final rec-ommendations that were submitted to the United States Congress. Through his tireless efforts and visionary leadership, CACCI has undertaken and accomplished several chal-lenging initiatives including: providing weekly business clinics, business services for micro enterprises, start-ups and emerging minority and women business enterprises in areas of access to financing, certification preparation and promoting trade and investment opportu-nities in the Caribbean region. CACCI’s most recent small business programs are: MWBE and Financial Literacy seminars. In collabora-tion with the CACCI membership and the wider community, CACCI provides rapid emer-gency responses to hurricane disasters in the Caribbean region including st. Kitts Nevis, An-tigua and Barbuda, Haiti and Grenada. Hastick has led several trade missions to the Carib-bean region, and hosted numerous Caribbean Heads of State on their visits to New York. Under his leadership the organization orga-nizes and sponsors an Annual National Carib-bean American Heritage Month Conference. Under his leadership, CACCI has managed the city-owned Brooklyn-based micro enter-prise incubator, a 9,000-sq. ft. Flatbush Caton Vendors Market, for 16 years which houses 40 vendors who sell a variety of African and Car-ibbean artifacts and a small business service center. Through Hastick’s collaborative efforts, patience and persistence, his long-term goal of creating a Caribbean American Trade Cen-ter will soon come to fruition. With the recent announcement by NYC Economic Develop-ment Corporation that a MlWBE developer had been selected to create a mixed-use project, which in addition to the Caribbean American Trade Center, will have 250 units of affordable housing, an upscale Flatbush Caton Vendors Market and a cultural center. For sev-eral years Hastick has served on numerous economic development boards including Gov-ernor’s Transition Teams, Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation, JP Morgan Chase CAB Board, and New York City and Company, Inc. He has also served as a delegate to the United Nations for Grenada and has received numerous awards including: National Small Business Advocate of the Year by the United States Department of Commerce; was hon-ored at the White House at New York Day in Washington, DC. He was also the recipient of an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from City University of New York (CUNY). More recently, Hastick received the Goodwill Ambassador Award from the Jewish commu-nity for ‘‘his impressive record of achieve-ments, promoting economic development, and for working diligently to cultivate understanding and mutual respect.’’ Most recent awards were the NYS Attorney General’s (2008) African American Achievers Award for exemplary small business leadership; NYC ‘‘American Dreamer Award for service to New York City during Immigrant’s Recognition during Immi-grants Monthly in New York City and the Car-ibbean Diaspora Leadership Award presented by Caribbean Tourism Organization. Hastick was recently appointed by Brooklyn Borough President, Eric L. Adams as a Brooklyn Am-bassador. Hastick currently lives in East Flatbush with his wife, and has 4 children and 8 grandchildren. As a fellow Caribbean Brooklynite, I am beaming with pride as we honor the generous service of Dr. Roy Hastick in commemorating his 68th birthday. New York’s Caribbean com-munity has forever changed through his dec-ades of dedicated service. On behalf of New York’s 9th Congressional District, I am grateful for our hard-working and impactful community leader, Dr. Roy Hastick.

RECOGNIZING MS. TARA LYNN JONES 
HON. JOHN LEWIS 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 11, 2018 Mr. LEWIS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Ms. Tara Lynn Jones, a warm and dynamic spirit. It is hard to believe that this young woman with her beautiful smile and passion for her community is no longer with us. Born and raised in Maryland, Ms. Jones graduated from La Reine High School before attending Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia where she earned an undergraduate degree in chemistry. Tara continued her education at George Washington University and received a master’s degree in public health, epidemi-ology, and biostatistics and a certificate in public management. Mr. Speaker, throughout her career Tara seamlessly moved between the business world and public service. Many remember her work as the Director of Neighborhood Services when Ms. Jones worked to connect residents to health, economic, and social justice serv-ices and programs in Washington, D.C. She continued to apply this experience in building coalitions, developing national media cam-paigns, and coordinating effective events across the country. I, along with many of my colleagues—espe-cially those of us who serve in the Congres-sional Black Caucus—truly learned to appre-ciate and respect Tara’s unique gifts and skills when she served as the Vice President of Public Affairs for BET Networks. During a challenging and pivotal time in our nation’s history, Ms. Jones used her platform to bring together young people, corporations, media, and policy makers to address the key, core civil rights and social justice matters of the day.

At every opportunity, Ms. Jones built bridges and made new friends. She was a communi-cator and a convener whose faith inspired a deep passion for service and mentorship in the Capital City Chapter of Links, Inc., Des-tination DC, and ColorComm. In recent years, Tara continued to employ her expertise on a global scale as the founder of the Tara Jones Group, LLC, which incorporated brand mar-keting, strategic solutions, and business devel-opment with increasing diversity and inclusion. As an active, engaged member of the Na-tional Urban League, and in particular during her tenure as President of the Washington Thursday Network, Tara continued the mission of integrating the necessary pursuit of oppor-tunity, equity, equality, and justice into both her personal and professional life. Mr. Speaker, Ms. Jones truly dedicated her life to serving others—she managed to be ev-erywhere and everything to everyone she met. As one who knew and worked alongside the late and great, Whitney Young, Jr., who served as the executive director of the Na-tional Urban League during pivotal years of the Civil Rights Movement, I can say that she epitomized his spirit and continued his legacy. Tara Lynn Jones was a thoughtful, loving, and kind young woman who leaves behind a legacy of excellence as she joins her beloved brother Edward V. Jones, Jr. During this dif-ficult time, I extend my deepest condolences to Tara’s loving parents—Edward and Sharon Jones; her cherished nieces—Jasmine, Brit-tany, Amber, and Nyema Jones; and the innu-merable family, friends, colleagues, and mem-bers of the Spelman and Links sisterhoods who mourn the passing of this beautiful spirit.

RECOGNIZING THE RECIPIENTS OF THE 2017 ARTS AWARDS 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 11, 2018 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-ognize the Arts Council of Fairfax County and the recipients of its 2017 Arts Awards. These awards recognize the extraordinary contributions of those who support the arts in our community, including artists and arts orga-nizations, as well as individuals and busi-nesses in Fairfax County, the City of Fairfax, and the City of Falls Church. The economic benefit of that support cannot be overstated. During FY2015, total industry expenditures generated over $22.4 million in local and state government revenues, supported 6,952 full- time equivalent jobs, and generated $155.8 million in resident household income. Each year, the Arts Council of Fairfax Coun-ty honors a select group of individuals, compa-nies, or organizations that have made extraor-dinary contributions to the local arts commu-nity. It is my honor to include in the R
ECORD  the names of the 2017 recipients. The 2017 Jinx Hazel Arts Award is being presented to Dewberry for its ongoing support of the arts in Fairfax County. In 1982, Dew-berry was invited to design the new Filene Center at Wolf Trap after the original structure was destroyed in a fire. The new Filene Cen-ter stands today as one of the defining sym-bols of the strength of the arts in Fairfax County, enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. Additionally, Dewberry has made significant contributions to arts edu-cation at George Mason University’s School of Music, and Mr. Barry Dewberry has been a long-time supporter of the Fairfax Symphony Orchestra. The 2017 Emerging Arts Award is being presented to the Washington West Film Fes-tival (WWFF). WWFF emerged in 2011 as Fairfax’s first professional film festival organi-zation with a mission to celebrate the trans-formative power of film. Since its beginning, the WWFF has screened more than 300 films through its an-nual festival in Fairfax, drawing over 16,000 attendees in its short history. In addition, the WWFF dedicates 100% of its box office pro-ceeds to charitable causes. The 2017 Arts Achievement Award is being presented to Dr. Daniel E. Sheehy. Dr. Sheehy is a musician, musicologist, educator, historian, and author, and has devoted his life to helping the world better understand itself by

experiencing its diverse music and cultures. Additionally, Dr. Sheehy is one of the world’s most respected and honored authorities on the subject of Mexican mariachi music. Since 1978, in the basement of Daniel’s home in the Baileys Crossroads area of Falls Church, some fifty musicians have rehearsed, per-formed with Mariachi Los Amigos, and gone on to form their own bands. It is not an exag-geration to say that the proliferation of mari-achi music in Greater Washington, DC is a re-sult of Daniel Sheehy. The 2017 Arts Philanthropy Award is being presented to Mr. Todd Hitt. Born and raised in Northern Virginia, Mr. Hitt is committed to en-hancing the economic and cultural vibrancy of the region in which he was raised. In 2007, he launched Kiddar Capital, a private equity com-pany that stands at the forefront of built world technologies. Mr. Hitt’s office features art by local area artists. He believes giving back to one’s community is a core principle of citizen-ship. As a supporter of the arts and human-ities, he not only donates a significant portion of his income to local nonprofits each year, but he has also helped raise additional funds for those organizations over the last five years. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the recipients of the 2017 Arts Awards and in recognizing and thanking the visionaries, leaders, and supporters who help to make our Northern Virginia commu-nities rich with cultural opportunities.
