PRAYER The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-fered the following prayer: Let us pray. Eternal God, accept our thanks and praise for all You have done for us. Thank You for the splendor of cre-ation, for the wonder of life, and for the mystery of love. Thank You for family and friends and for the love that surrounds us on every side. Lord, thank You for work that demands our best ef-forts and for the satisfaction of a job well done. Thank You also for dis-appointments and failures that teach us to depend on You. Thank You for our lawmakers; endue them with cour-age and loyalty, inspiring them to glo-rify You in every action, both large and small. And, Lord, thank You for the influen-tial life and legacy of former First Lady Nancy Reagan. We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-jority leader is recognized. 
f 
REMEMBERING NANCY REAGAN Mr. M
CCONNELL. Madam President, Nancy Reagan was one of the most powerful First Ladies in recent mem-ory. For instance, sometimes she spoke out on issues like substance abuse, but more often Nancy wielded her power with calm confidence and quiet steel. It was an attitude that helped guide Nancy through so many challenges in her own life: getting an acting career off the ground, leaving it to raise a family, riding the ups and downs of a life in politics, watching her husband brave the bullet of a would-be assassin or face the threat of cancer, and then confront the same reality herself. Nancy Reagan may have been a star in Hollywood and a force in the rough- and-tumble of Washington, but it was the challenges to come that would re-veal her true strength. In 1994, former President Reagan ad-dressed a letter to his fellow Ameri-cans. He said: ‘‘I now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my life.’’ Nancy shared her very personal expe-rience with that cold and cruel disease, telling Americans of the ‘‘terrible pain and loneliness’’ that accompanied Alz-heimer’s ‘‘very long goodbye,’’ but she never gave in or gave up. Nancy was strong for her husband, she was a rock for her family, and she was an example for a nation that looked to her for in-spiration. One day, after many long and dif-ficult years, Ronald Reagan opened his eyes and looked at Nancy. ‘‘He hadn’t done that in well over a month,’’ she recalled. ‘‘But he looked at me and closed his eyes. And went. And that was a wonderful gift.’’ We felt Nancy’s immense pain when she leaned over his casket, kissed it, and mouthed her tearful farewell. From ‘‘Morning in America’’ to a sunset in Simi Valley, the Reagan love story was classic Hollywood, but it was also unmistakably human. Nancy said her life had only really begun after she met Ronald Reagan. Now she joins her best friend to dance together once more. We in the Senate join our Nation in mourning the loss of Nancy Reagan. We offer every condolence to the fam-ily members left behind. Let us remember the rest of what President Reagan wrote to the Nation in 1994. ‘‘I now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my life,’’ is what he wrote then, but—but— ‘‘I know that for America there will al-ways be a bright dawn ahead.’’ f 
COMPREHENSIVE ADDICTION AND RECOVERY BILL Mr. M
CCONNELL. Madam President, as I noted earlier, combating substance abuse was an issue close to Nancy Rea-gan’s heart. It is fitting that we will have an important opportunity this afternoon to address the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic sweeping our Nation. We can do so by advancing the Comprehensive Addiction and Re-covery Act. Just a few months ago, we appro-priated $400 million to opioid-specific programs. We are glad that all of those funds remain available to be spent today, and now we can pass comprehen-sive, bipartisan legislation that will help build upon the progress being made in this fight. This CARA bill would expand edu-cation and prevention. It would bolster law enforcement efforts. It would im-prove treatment initiatives. This bill has also received broad bipartisan backing and the support of nearly 130 groups dedicated to ending this crisis. We appreciate the work of the senior Senator from Iowa, Mr. G
RASSLEY , who worked to move this bill swiftly out of the Judiciary Committee. We thank Senator P
ORTMAN , Senator A YOTTE , along with the junior Senator from Rhode Island and the senior Senator from Minnesota, for all the work they have done to advance CARA. We recog-nize the continuing efforts of Senators on both sides of the aisle who have put party labels aside to build support for this much needed legislation. So let’s continue that work by voting for cloture on CARA so we can take an

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The Democratic leader is recog-nized. 
f 
REMEMBERING NANCY REAGAN Mr. REID. Madam President, I join the Republican leader in extending my sympathies to the entire Reagan fam-ily. Nancy Reagan was a wonderful First Lady. She was also an incredible individual in her own right. She was al-ways gracious and charming. The last time I saw Nancy Reagan, she was here in the Rotunda of the Capitol dedicating a statue of her hus-band, President Ronald Reagan. At that time, she was already well into her late eighties, but there she was, standing next to his statue with a big smile on her face. Her very presence brightened the entire Hall—she and Ronald Reagan standing together, he in the form of a statue, she standing next to him, together. It really was a fantastic picture. Nancy, of course, will be missed. I say, though, my mind returns to a dif-ferent time. It reminds me of the years Ronald Reagan was in the White House—a card-carrying conservative, yet a very pragmatic Republican. The Nation will miss First Lady Nancy Reagan and miss her partner, the President of the United States, Ronald Reagan.

FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY Mr. REID. Madam President, from the Des Moines Register. Two former Lieutenant Governors of the State of Iowa—and I am sure the Acting Presi-dent pro tempore knows both of them, one a Democrat and one a Republican— here is what they said, among other things: ‘‘This isn’t the C
HUCK GRASS -
LEYwe thought we knew.’’ Again, I re-peat, this is two Iowans, former Lieu-tenant Governors Joy Corning, a Re-publican, and Sally Pederson, a Demo-crat. Last week former Lieutenant Gov-ernors Corning and Pederson coau-thored an op-ed in the Des Moines Reg-ister criticizing the senior Senator from Iowa for abdicating his constitu-tional duties by blocking consideration of President Obama’s Supreme Court nomination. The op-ed reads, among other things: Iowans are known for being hard workers, and we appreciate that quality in our elected officials. We wake up every day, ready to do our part, and get the job done. We are also politically astute, understand the U.S. Con-stitution, and know when an elected official is more eager to find excuses than create so-lutions. Unfortunately, Sen. C
HUCK GRASS -
LEYis refusing to do his job as described in Article 2 of our Constitution, giving ‘‘advice and consent’’ on the president’s upcoming nomination to the Supreme Court. G
RASSLEY is threatening to use his power-ful post as chairman of the Judiciary Com-mittee to block a hearing on any nominee, regardless of how well qualified he or she is. His recent column and public statements re-garding the vacancy on the Supreme Court are troubling and harmful to our courts. Moreover, this isn’t the C
HUCK GRASSLEY we thought we knew. 
‘‘This isn’t the C HUCK GRASSLEY we thought we knew.’’ I agree with these Iowans. This isn’t the Senator I have come to know over the last three dec-ades. The Senator I knew would not cede the independence of the powerful Judiciary Committee he has served on for many decades to the Republican leader. The Senator I knew would not ignore his constitutional duties for the sake of election-year politics, but for whatever reason the Senator from Iowa made a fateful decision in the hours after Justice Antonin Scalia’s death. He is allowing himself and his com-mittee to be manipulated by the Re-publican leader for narrow, partisan warfare. He is taking his orders from the Republican leader and, sadly, Don-ald Trump. When asked about this issue, Donald Trump’s words were three: delay, delay, delay. Senator G
RASSLEY must have been listening. The people of Iowa, without question, are displeased with their Senator. The Des Moines Register quoted one of Sen-ator G
RASSLEY ’s disappointed sup-porters as follows: 
He seems to be doing what other people are saying, not what he thinks is best. That has really colored my opinion of him in the past week. 
Another Iowan who supports the Sen-ator told the newspaper: 
I think he’s making a bad mistake. . . . It’s purely a political party play, and there isn’t any space for that in this situation. 
Now, as each day passes, the senior Senator from Iowa is trying des-perately to justify his blind loyalty to the Republican leader and to Donald Trump. Senator G
RASSLEY is grasping for a rationale—any rationale—that will excuse him for not doing his job. That desperation is now taking Sen-ator G
RASSLEY down a very dark path. Last Thursday, the senior Senator from Iowa addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference, CPAC, which took place here in Washington. In his speech to them, here is what Senator GRASSLEY said: ‘‘I feel it’s about time that we have a national de-bate on the Supreme Court and how it fits in with our constitutional system of government.’’ The chairman of the Judiciary Com-mittee is suggesting that we reevaluate the Founding Fathers’ work, reevalu-ate the Constitution of the United States, and change the Constitution of the United States. Why is Senator G
RASSLEY debating what the Constitu-tion makes clear? The Senate must provide its advice and consent on nomi-nees appointed by the President to the Supreme Court. Think of the irony. Justice Scalia was a strict constitu-tionalist. Yet now, in the weeks fol-lowing his death, Senator G
RASSLEY  wants to throw out the Constitution just because President Obama gets to pick Scalia’s replacement. The former Senator from Iowa Tom Harkin said it best yesterday. This ap-peared in the Des Moines Register: ‘‘The position taken now by the major-ity leader and majority members of the Senate Judiciary Committee is simply astounding, and not in keeping with a ‘strict,’ or even ‘loose,’ construction of the Constitution.’’ The Constitution isn’t some ball you pick up and take home just because you are still mad that Barack Obama is the President. If Senator G
RASSLEY and Republicans find themselves on the wrong side of the Constitution, it is their policies that should change, not our Nation’s founding document, the Constitution of the United States. If Republicans are uncomfortable with not performing their duties, the answer isn’t to take an eraser to the Constitu-tion. No, we don’t need to take an eras-er to the Constitution. The answer is to do your job. If the Senator from Iowa wants to ex-tricate himself from the situation he created, there is a way. All he needs to do is wrest back his chairmanship from the Republican leader and give Presi-dent Obama’s nominee a meeting, a hearing, and a vote. In short, he needs to do his job. It is that easy. No changes to the Constitution are re-quired. If he does his job, the people in Iowa will not have reason to say: ‘‘This isn’t the C
HUCK GRASSLEY we thought we knew.’’

AFFORDABLE CARE ACT Mr. REID. Madam President, on an-other subject, last Thursday, the De-partment of Health and Human Serv-ices released updated statistics about the number of Americans who now have health insurance.

gained health care coverage—20 mil-lion; 6.1 million adults, ages 19 to 25, now have health insurance. Remember, it wasn’t long ago that everyone said they wouldn’t sign up. Now, 6.1 million have. Before we passed ObamaCare, some 50 million people in this Nation were without health care. Now, because of the Affordable Care Act, 91 percent of Americans are now insured. That is stunning. It is only getting better. Every day, more and more people who were previously with-out health insurance are now covered. That is true across racial and ethnic lines. Listen to these stunning statistics. The uninsured rate for African Ameri-cans has dropped by more than 50 per-cent. That is the equivalent of 3 mil-lion newly insured people. The unin-sured rate for Hispanics dropped by more than 25 percent, representing 4 million insured Americans. The evidence is clear: The Affordable Care Act is working. From Nevada to Kentucky, our constituents are getting the quality health care they were promised when Congress passed the Af-fordable Care Act. It is time for Repub-licans to stop following Donald Trump’s lead by clamoring for repeal. It is really nervy for Republicans to come down here, as they do all the time in the Senate—they have been quiet lately—and as they do on the campaign trail. This large number of Republicans, which is narrow, still all say the same thing: The American peo-ple should listen to what we are saying; we have to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. We have to get rid of it. How disappointing. It is time for Re-publicans to face the facts. ObamaCare is helping tens of millions of Ameri-cans and will continue to do so. Madam President, I ask the Chair to announce the business of the day.

Under the previous order, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 4 p.m., with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each. Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. Without objection, it is so or-dered. FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, as my colleagues in the Senate just heard, the tantrums from the other side continue, but I guess it shouldn’t surprise anybody because everyone around here knows that nothing makes the minority leader more mad than when his side is forced to play by its own rules. The American people are divided, and the divided government the American people delivered over the last several election cycles reflects those divisions. Our constitutional Republic was de-signed with a series of checks and bal-ances. As any branch gets too powerful or exceeds its authority and tries to impose policies the American people don’t want, the people express their will through the electoral process, and that is what we have witnessed during the last several election cycles. Over the last few years, our current President has engaged in a systematic and very massive overreach of his exec-utive power, way beyond what the Con-stitution has ever considered, and— thank God for checks and balances— the courts have said as much, and that is why I am here today. I am here today to tell you how the courts have interceded and curbed this massive overreach of Executive power. But as he has done so, the people have re-sponded. Since he was first sworn into office in 2009, nearly 70 additional Republicans have been elected to the People’s House. And there are 13 more Repub-lican Senators today than there were in January of 2009. In January of 2014, frustrated that the people’s representatives wouldn’t enact his liberal policies, the President famously said that he would use ‘‘a pen and a phone’’ and impose his agenda anyway even though Article One of the Constitution is very clear. It states that the legislative powers of the United States shall be vested in the Congress, not with the President of the United States. Just a few months later, in November of 2014, the people spoke and sent nine additional Republicans to the U.S. Sen-ate. This is the beauty of our system of checks and balances, and the Framers of our Constitution designed it that way. The Framers knew a thing or two about Executive overreach, because they had to deal with somebody called George III. They had firsthand experi-ence with an Executive, King George III, who imposed his will on the people unilaterally. So you wonder why our Constitution has checks and balances? The Presi-dent holds the Executive power, the Congress writes the laws, and the Su-preme Court interprets them. That is what we call separation of powers. That’s why we have checks and bal-ances. That’s why we have separation of powers. And that is why our Con-stitution is designed so that no Presi-dent can appoint a Supreme Court Jus-tice with a pen and a phone. As we continue to discuss what is at stake during this Presidential election and whether the American people want to elect a President who will appoint yet another liberal Justice, I wanted to take a few minutes to review some of this President’s efforts to expand the reach of his power and impose his will on the American people. This President has pushed the envelope at every turn. He has sought to impose his will on the American people in ways and to a de-gree that this Nation has never before witnessed. What is striking about this Presi-dent’s record before the Supreme Court is that even with a Court as liberal as ours, the Obama administration still has the lowest winning record of any President going back to at least the Truman administration. When pre-sented with this undeniable fact, the President’s apologists quickly grasp for the nearest bogus defense. Most nota-bly, they claim that the Supreme Court is more ideologically hostile to this President than previous Courts were to other Presidents. Now that is a very crafty argument, but it is what Justice Scalia would have called ‘‘pure applesauce.’’ Leading Supreme Court analysts de-clared the last term of the Supreme Court, even with Justice Scalia on that Court, as the most liberal since the 1960s. So the President’s defenders can’t blame the Court’s makeup for its rebuke of his expansive claims of power. And of course this explanation fails to account for the fact that Presi-dent Eisenhower took office and liti-gated in a Supreme Court with eight Justices who were appointed by Demo-crats or that President Nixon’s admin-istration began with an even more lib-eral Court than Eisenhower. No, this President hasn’t lost cases because the Court is ideologically hostile to this President and his policy; the Court has rejected this President’s power grabs because they are based on ideology and an unwillingness to recognize that the law constrains that power. All too often the President’s claims are supported by an Office of Legal Counsel and a Solicitor General’s Of-fice that seem unwilling to tell the President that his impulse for ex-panded power is flatly contrary to the law. I’d like to describe a few exam-ples. The President’s lawyers argued that he could ignore the Senate’s de-termination—this body’s determina-tion—of when it was in session in order to make recess appointments. No President in our history ever claimed that recess appointments were permis-sible in that situation. But the Office of Legal Counsel—once considered the crown jewel of the Department of Jus-tice—offered a tortured justification to sanction that assertion of power. If this view of Presidential power were allowed to stand, the President could bypass the Senate with ease to install individuals in powerful govern-ment positions with no check from the

Senate, as the Constitution envisions. Fortunately, the Supreme Court dis-agreed 9 to 0. That means even this President’s appointments to the Su-preme Court said that he violated the Constitution with those recess appoint-ments. The Constitution clearly says that the Senate shall determine when we are in session and in recess. That isn’t the only example. The Obama administration argued that the Equal Employment Opportunity Com-mission could resolve an employment discrimination case between a minister and the church that fired her. The Su-preme Court found the Obama adminis-tration managed to violate two dif-ferent provisions of the First Amend-ment at the same time. It violated the free exercise of religion clause because if the President’s argument carried the day, the government could interfere with a church’s doctrine. Additionally, it violated the establishment clause of the First Amendment because if this President had his way, the Federal Government could get into the busi-ness of selecting a church’s ministers. The Supreme Court rejected those claims 9 to 0. On the regulatory front, in a series of rulings, the Supreme Court rejected the President’s arguments that agen-cies can deny the ability of private citizens to seek relief against regu-latory overreach. For instance, the Court rejected the Environmental Pro-tection Agency’s powers to force a homeowner, through escalating fines, to comply with an order while at the same time denying that homeowner the ability to challenge the order in court. The Supreme Court rejected Obama’s EPA’s claims 9 to 0. In another case, the Court held—con-trary to the position advanced by the Army Corps of Engineers—that a land-owner could sue in court for just com-pensation for a taking when the gov-ernment-caused flooding of his prop-erty is temporary and recurring. Again, the Supreme Court rejected the government’s position 8 to 0. When the Internal Revenue Service attempted to enforce a taxpayer’s sum-mons while at the same time denying the taxpayer the right to question the IRS official about their reasons for the summons, the Supreme Court rebuked the administration 9 to 0. In still another case, the Court re-jected the Equal Employment Oppor-tunity Commission’s argument that its decisions aren’t subject to judicial re-view when that agency concludes by its own estimation it fulfilled its duties to attempt conciliation under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Once again, the Supreme Court rejected that claim by this administration 9 to 0. Similarly, when a veteran’s benefits were denied and the appeal wasn’t filed within a certain time period, the De-partment of Veterans Affairs turned around and denied that veteran the ability to seek judicial review. The Su-preme Court rejected the position of the Department of Veterans Affairs 8 to 0. And when the Federal Communica-tions Commission changed its policies midstream regarding isolated examples of indecent language, the Supreme Court found 8 to 0 that the FCC had violated due process. These are important rulings. Far too often, this administration imposes gov-ernment power against the people while brushing aside important proce-dural safeguards. Remember, the Con-stitution is to protect the people from its government—something we learned from George III. Justice Frankfurter spoke to this point. He once wrote: ‘‘The history of liberty has largely been the history of the observance of procedural safe-guards.’’ Consider as well areas in criminal law where the Obama administration pressed positions that erode individual freedom. This President’s lawyers ar-gued that the police could install a GPS device on a vehicle, and then use that device to monitor the car’s move-ments without a search warrant under the Fourth Amendment. I don’t know what would be left of the Fourth Amendment if the Supreme Court had upheld the President’s claim that the government could operate in that man-ner. Thankfully, the Supreme Court re-jected that argument as well. The vote tally was 9 to 0. The Court blocked the Justice De-partment’s prosecution of a person under the Chemical Weapons Conven-tion because the convention didn’t reach the defendant’s simple assault. Again, the Supreme Court rebuked the President 9 to 0. These are not the rulings of a Su-preme Court that is ideologically hos-tile to the Obama administration. Every one of these rulings was unani-mous—every one. And there are still other Supreme Court decisions reject-ing this President’s power grabs where the vote tallies were much closer. The President and his lawyers made utterly baseless arguments for execu-tive and regulatory power in case after case. In so many of these cases, the unifying thread underlying this Presi-dent’s litigating position is the notion that the people are subservient to the Federal Government and, of course, subservient to its agencies, rather than the other way around. So far the Su-preme Court has not agreed. But during this Presidential election, the American people should consider whether they want to elect a President who may nominate a Justice who will embrace such a vast expansion of exec-utive and regulatory power. This is what I’ve called for in a number of speeches, both in Iowa and here as well. This is an opportunity for the Amer-ican people to have their voices heard. Letting the people decide in the elec-tion isn’t just about who the next Jus-tice on the Supreme Court is going to be. It is about the role of the Supreme Court and the judicial branch in our constitutional process. We heard just a little while ago the floor leader of the minority party say-ing that somehow I want to rewrite the Constitution. This isn’t about rewrit-ing the Constitution. The Constitution is pretty clear: The Supreme Court in-terprets law, not makes law. And with the approval rating of the Supreme Court going down from about 50 per-cent to 28 percent in polls ever since this President took office, and the tendency for some Republican ap-pointees as well as Democrat ap-pointees to make the law the way they want it, that is just getting back to the basics—that the Supreme Court is an interpreter of the law, not a maker of the law. So I think having a basic debate similar to what people learn in high school isn’t a bad thing. Now, will an election change what the Supreme Court, the people who are on it now, decide to do? I don’t know— probably not. But it will allow for the next elected President to have the op-portunity to choose which direction they want it to go. Do they want a Jus-tice who is going to interpret the law or a Justice who is going to make the law? Before the passing of Justice Scalia, we had four conservative justices, four liberal justices, and one in the mid-dle—Justice Kennedy—who could go ei-ther way in some cases. We know what kind of judicial activists this President puts on the Supreme Court. Do you want to change the direction so that the Second Amendment rights of guns are in jeopardy or like when we saw at-tempts by this administration to say who a church can hire or not hire—and violate the freedom of religion—and other very important issues that are at stake? It is pretty fundamental what is at stake, and I think having this debate is very important. And I think letting the people decide is very important. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN.

CALLING FOR APPOINTMENT OF A SPECIAL COUNSEL Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I have come to the floor several times to talk about the ongoing investigation into the private email server of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. While serving as the top diplomat for the United States, she plainly believed she could play by her own set of rules. Instead of using a government server with all of the attendant protections from cyber attacks and intelligence gathering by our adversaries, Sec-retary Clinton paid a staffer thousands of dollars to set up a private, unsecure

email server at her home in New York. So it is pretty clear, based on published reports, that Secretary Clinton went out of her way by paying money out of her own pocket to avoid important laws that Congress has passed to guar-antee that the American people actu-ally know what their government is doing. I am talking particularly about the Freedom of Information Act. I haven’t heard of any other example of someone in the Federal Govern-ment—accountable to the people of the United States—setting up a separate private email server just to conduct of-ficial business, not to mention the Sec-retary of State. It is simply unprece-dented. Her actions also put our country at risk, as her private email server was reportedly unsecure. We have heard time and again from those in the intel-ligence community that her use of an unsecure, private email server left her emails—some highly classified—vulner-able to hacking and cyber attack from our Nation’s enemies. We may never know the full extent to which her irresponsible actions have affected our military endeavors, our diplomatic efforts, our overall national security or the lives and safety of those who serve in the intelligence commu-nity or are in harm’s way trying to keep our country safe. We don’t know to what extent her recklessness and ir-responsibility have jeopardized the lives of people who are engaged in keeping our country safe. We do know that it has jeopardized the security of our country at large. To this day, Secretary Clinton re-fuses to accept full responsibility for her actions and denies the serious na-ture of the FBI’s ongoing investiga-tion, calling it only a ‘‘security re-view.’’ Well, it is pretty clear that the Justice Department is doing an inves-tigation. Just this last week, it was re-ported that the Justice Department granted immunity to the staffer who set up Secretary Clinton’s server. So this further confirms that Secretary Clinton is misrepresenting to the pub-lic when this inquiry is dismissed as some routine ‘‘security review.’’ We don’t grant immunity from crimi-nal prosecution to someone in order to gain their cooperation to testify in a case where they otherwise would claim the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. That is why immu-nity is granted—so they no longer can claim a belief that they might be pros-ecuted for being a witness against themselves. That is why immunity is granted. So this indicates what I have said all along, which is that this is a serious in-vestigation that may determine that classified information has been mis-handled—a serious crime. The Justice Department should pursue this case as aggressively as it would any other case involving any other person where there has been concern about the mis-handling of classified information be-cause the American people deserve nothing less. Secretary Clinton is not just some random citizen or former government employee; she was a member of this President’s Cabinet and Secretary of State. In light of this extraordinary case and the unavoidable myriad of conflicts of interest, I have called re-peatedly on the Attorney General to appoint a special counsel to fully and fairly conduct the investigation. It is not just important that a thorough and independent investigation be con-ducted; it is important that the Amer-ican people have confidence and believe that a fair and independent investiga-tion is being conducted. One simply can’t reach that conclusion, given the fact that the Attorney General, who is the political appointee of this Presi-dent and who serves at his pleasure, is loathe to have this investigation pro-ceed, and I will get to that in a mo-ment. The President has inappropri-ately made comments while this inves-tigation is ongoing. I asked the Attor-ney General last fall—she is the only one who can make this decision—to ap-point a special counsel to give some semblance of independence from the political operation at the Department of Justice and the White House. Unfor-tunately, almost 6 months later, no independent counsel has been ap-pointed. I think the necessity for such a person to be appointed is even more critical than ever.

COMPREHENSIVE ADDICTION AND RECOVERY BILL Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, we will soon end the debate and vote on a bill known as the CARA Act, a piece of legislation that will help restore fami-lies and communities across America that have been harmed by addiction and drug abuse. This is a serious piece of legislation that has been done on a bipartisan basis and is a good illustra-tion of how we in the Senate ought to be doing our jobs as representatives of the American people. We identify a problem, and we work across the aisle to come up with a solution. We con-sider it on the floor of the Senate so that all 100 Members can have an op-portunity to discuss it. An essential part of getting this leg-islation considered and passed on the floor is the hard work that happens in the respective committees, and the Comprehensive Addiction and Recov-ery Act is no exception. It is not only the result of bipartisan work but also the leadership of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the senior Sen-ator from Iowa. We would not be here today considering this important legis-lation without Chairman G
RASSLEY ’s leadership. So it has been particularly disappointing for me to hear the Demo-cratic leader and some across the aisle disparage this good man and say that he and other Republicans are not doing their jobs. I think the evidence is to the contrary. It is our job to advance commonsense legislation that will ben-efit the entire country. That is exactly what this legislation does and exactly what the chairman has been diligently pursuing. I would like to remind our friends across the aisle that the legislation we will soon advance is a bill the chair-man diligently guided through the Ju-diciary Committee. I am thankful for his leadership and look forward to moving this bill along. Madam President, I see no other Sen-ator wishing to speak. f

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES1304 March 7, 2016 
were planted with the aggressive, mis-leading, and ultimately criminal mar-keting of the powerful opioid pain-killer, OxyContin by Purdue Pharma. Perdue claimed OxyContin was not ad-dictive and couldn’t be abused. Neither of those claims turned out to be true. Purdue Pharma built a massive mar-keting and sales program for OxyContin. From 1996 to 2000, Purdue Pharma’s sales force more than dou-bled from more than 300 sales rep-resentatives to almost 700 sales rep-resentatives. In 2001 alone, Purdue gave out $40 million in bonuses to its bur-geoning sales force. As a result of these sales and marketing efforts, from 1997 to 2002, OxyContin prescriptions in-creased almost tenfold, from 670,000 in 1997 to 6.2 million in 2002. Purdue’s marketing of OxyContin broke the law. In 2007, Purdue Pharma paid $600 million in fines and other payments after pleading guilty in Fed-eral court to misleading regulators, doctors, and patients about the risks of addiction to OxyContin and its poten-tial for abuse. Second, Purdue Pharma’s criminal wrongdoing did not occur in a vacuum. The Federal Government helped to en-able this epidemic. The Federal Drug Enforcement Administration is respon-sible for approving the annual produc-tion quotas for pharmaceutical compa-nies to manufacture oxycodone, the principal ingredient in OxyContin. From 1996 to 2016, the Drug Enforce-ment Administration obliged Big Pharma and increased by almost 150 percent the amount of oxycodone au-thorized for manufacture. In 1996, the DEA authorized U.S. pharmaceutical companies to make the equivalent of 6 billion 10-milligram OxyContin pills. By 2016, that figure had increased to al-most 14 billion 10-milligram pills. That is right. Today the Drug Enforcement Administration is telling Big Pharma it is OK to make 14 billion OxyContin pills to sell in the United States in 1 year. The Federal Food and Drug Adminis-tration was also complicit, approving new opioid after new opioid. In the process, the FDA, charged with ensur-ing the safety of all prescription drugs on the U.S. market, began turning a blind eye to outside experts who were warning of the dangers these drugs posed. In 2013, an expert panel established to review the powerful new opioid pain-killer Zohydro, voted 11 to 2 against recommending its approval, but the FDA approved the drug anyway, over-ruling the concerns voiced by experi-enced physicians on the panel. In 2014, in the wake of the Zohydro decision, the FDA twice skipped the advisory committee process altogether when it approved two new prescription opioids. Then, in August of 2015, the FDA did it again. This time it bypassed an advi-sory committee of outside experts on the question of a new use for OxyContin for children aged 11 to 16. The FDA even ignored its own rules that specifically call for advisory com-mittee advice when a committee of pe-diatric dosing is involved. It was clear that the FDA was intentionally choos-ing to forgo advisory committees in order to avoid another overwhelming Zohydro-like vote, recommending against approval of a prescription opioid and in order to avoid any im-pediments to new opioids being sold in the United States. Finally, the medical profession must bear its fair share of responsibility for this crisis. Doctors are prescribing opioids at an alarming rate. In 2012, America’s doctors wrote 259 million prescriptions for opioid pain relievers, enough pills for every single American adult to have a bottle of opioid pills given to them in the year 2012. And America’s doctors are dan-gerously uninformed about the drugs they are prescribing. A recent survey of 1,000 physicians nationwide found that ‘‘only two-thirds correctly re-ported that the most common route of abuse was swallowing pills whole.’’ It is unconscionable that our doctors are so ill-informed. Nearly half of the doctors surveyed also erroneously reported that so-called abuse-deterrent formula-tions of opioids were less addictive than their counterparts. Abuse-deter-rent opioids are supposed to be harder to crush, so they are harder to snort or to mix with liquid and inject, but abuse-deterrent formulations of opioids are just as addictive as non-abuse-de-terrent opioids. Whether an opioid is abuse-deterrent or not hasn’t pre-vented tens of thousands of people who have had their wisdom teeth removed or experienced lower back pain from getting addicted to these painkillers simply by swallowing them. So what is the result of the combina-tion of Big Pharma’s marketing of pre-scription opioids, the Federal Govern-ment’s repeatedly approving them in ever-increasing numbers, and our doc-tors writing millions of prescriptions for them? Today, the United States is less than 5 percent of the world’s popu-lation but we consume 80 percent of the world’s opioid painkillers. We have be-come the United States of Oxy. When prescriptions run out or the price of Oxy pills on the street become too high for those who have become ad-dicted, they turn to cheaper heroin, which shares the same molecular struc-ture as OxyContin. Eighty percent of the people suffering from heroin addic-tion started with opioid pain medica-tions approved by the FDA and pre-scribed by doctors. In 2014, nearly 33,000 people died of an opioid overdose in this country. Almost 1,300 of those deaths were in my home State of Massachusetts. I had hoped to offer amendments to CARA to address both the causes of this epidemic and to provide treatment for those suffering from the results. One of my amendments would have re-quired the FDA to convene advisory committees for all prescription opioid approval questions. After I placed a hold on the nomina-tion of Dr. Robert Califf to serve as FDA Commissioner, the agency an-nounced it would only commit to con-vene advisory committees for non- abuse-deterrent opioids. The FDA re-fused to agree to convene advisory committees to inform all of its opioid- approval decisions. We need legislation requiring the FDA to seek expert advice about the risk of addiction before it approves any and all opioids, and I will continue to fight to require advisory committees at the FDA. We also need legislation requiring doctors to get and stay educated about the dangers of the pills they are pre-scribing in record numbers. Stopping the overprescription of opioid pain-killers is a critical step. We need to ensure that all pre-scribers of these opioid painkillers are educated in the dangers of these drugs, how easily individuals can become ad-dicted, and when and how to appro-priately prescribe. The doctors say that they do not want education to be mandated, that it should be voluntary. Well, the FDA has had voluntary edu-cation for opioid prescribers in place since 2013 and has been actively en-couraging doctors to take these vol-untary education programs, but in more than 2 years, only 12 percent of prescribers have actually completed FDA’s voluntary education program. It is imperative that any provider who is applying for a Federal DEA li-cense to prescribe opioids have com-pleted mandatory education on the ba-sics of opioid prescribing and the inher-ent risk of addiction. My amendment would have done just that. It would have required basic education as a con-dition of a DEA license to prescribe these painkillers, and I will continue to fight to require prescriber education. Finally, we need to remove the bar-riers to effective treatment, including outdated Federal restrictions on medi-cation-assisted therapies such as Suboxone. Medication-assisted therapy for opioid addiction is cost effective, decreases overdose deaths, and reduces transmission of HIV and hepatitis C. Unlike other treatment regimens for any other disease, physicians are se-verely limited in the number of pa-tients they can treat with medication- assisted therapies such as Suboxone, contributing to long wait-lists and an inability of patients to get treatment for their addiction when they need it. Of approximately 2.5 million Ameri-cans who abused or were dependent on opioids, fewer than 1 million received treatment for their condition, partly because of the already existing Federal instructions.

hole in our addiction treatment sys-tem. We had hoped to offer TREAT as an amendment to CARA. We will con-tinue to fight for it and are hopeful the HELP Committee will include it in the substance abuse legislation the com-mittee will soon consider. My collaboration with Senator P
AUL shows that whether it is the Common-wealth of Massachusetts or the Com-monwealth of Kentucky, this crisis is the same. It doesn’t discriminate by geography, by age, by race, by socio-economic status, or by employment. It requires a bipartisan effort. Thirty years ago, Nancy Reagan told us to just say no to drugs. Today we have to go further. We have to say enough is enough. We have to recognize what has worked and what hasn’t worked. In the past, we believed we could incarcerate our way out of the problem. That did not work. So instead of ignoring and incarcerating, let’s avow and act. Let’s destigmatize, not criminalize. Let’s treat, not retreat. Let’s have a comprehensive plan which we put in place that deals with the pharmaceutical companies, the physi-cians, and the kinds of treatment pa-tients need across our country so that they get the help they need. That is our job. I continue to believe we can do this in a bipartisan fashion as long as we understand the magnitude of the prob-lem and what the causes of it were and continue to be and will be into the fu-ture unless and until we put these safe-guards in place. So I am looking for-ward to continuing to work with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I compliment them for the work they have done so far in bringing this bill to the floor of the Senate this week, but I do believe there is more to be done. As long as this many Americans are addicted, as long as this much OxyContin and opioids are put into our system, then we are going to find that this heroin epidemic we have in our country, which is directly related, will continue to spiral out of control. I want to work with all my col-leagues. I thank my colleagues for all the work they have done so far, but there is much work to be done in the future. Madam President, I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The Senator from Alabama. Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I would like to talk for a few minutes about the crime problem we have in America today, the dramatically in-creasing problem of heroin abuse. Over the last week, we have had a lot of dis-cussion about this crisis, which I am afraid we are just on the cusp of. I think it is going to get worse, based on my experience and my best judgment, but the effort to understand and ad-dress it has been going on for a while. In January, we had a good hearing on this issue in the Senate Judiciary Com-mittee, and I want to mention a few things I think we ought to keep in mind as we address this very important problem. Just as background, I served 15 years as a prosecutor, 12 as a U.S. attorney, a Federal prosecutor, and 21⁄2as an as-sistant U.S. attorney. So that was my background when I came here. I was very active and studied the drug and crime problem in America, and I learned some things. There are cycles in this, and people wrote about it over the years. I think we are, unfortunately, moving into an-other cycle, and we have to be very careful. It is so painful to have a large prison population. We don’t want to have that. Year after year, everybody wants to look for alternatives to pris-on, and we have tried, but if you go too far, you end up not having sufficient consequences for crime, not detaining dangerous offenders, and you end up in-creasing crime, increasing deaths of Americans from murders and other things, increasing heroin and serious drug problems that destroy families, destroy lives, destroy communities, and result in violence and death. It is a very real problem. A lot of people think, well, if you want to use heroin, so be it. Well, these people can’t function. How are they going to survive? They either steal or they get on welfare or they have to go to treatment. And who pays for it, since they do not have any money? We have proven and seen for decades that drug use can be brought down, fewer people can become addicted. In the early 1980s, Nancy Reagan, as President Reagan’s wonderful wife, formed the ‘‘Just Say No’’ program, and hundreds of thousands of volun-teers nationwide in every community in America got together in their com-munities—they got the treatment com-munity, the law enforcement commu-nity, the prevention community, the education community, and the schools—and they worked and worked and crafted policies that would create a climate of hostility for the use of dan-gerous drugs. The idea was to bring down the use. As a result, the use of il-legal drugs dropped by half. It took us 15 or more years, but it dropped by half steadily. What a tremendous victory. In 1980, half of our high school sen-iors admitted they had used an illegal drug sometime in that year. What an unbelievable number. It had been going up steadily, it peaked, and then it began to go down under this sustained effort. What I have been worried about for some time, and have warned about it, is that if you don’t maintain that but start going in the other direction, you can expect drug use to increase. It is that simple. And it is happening. Lives—and young people’s lives—will be destroyed by this, families will break up, and children will be scarred. Drug use is no fun, innocent thing. It is destructive. If this Nation is using half as much illegal drugs as before, it is a better nation. It just is. And if we double the amount of drug use in America, it will be a more dangerous Nation and not as good a nation. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over 47,000 people died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2014. In 2014, 47,000 died. That is one drug overdose death for every 12 minutes. And 61 percent of those overdoses involved opioids. The rate of all opioid overdoses in the United States has tripled since 2000. Overdoses have tripled since 2000. Heroin overdose deaths specifically have increased sixfold since 2001—600 percent—and have more than tripled in just the past 4 years alone. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, there were approximately 169,000 new heroin users in 2013. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Adminis-tration, in 2004, approximately 589,000 people in the United States had an opioid use disorder. We used to call that addiction—a problem. It is affect-ing their lives. The Drug Enforcement Administra-tion’s 2015 National Drug Threat As-sessment noted that ‘‘drug overdose deaths have become the leading cause of injury death in the United States, ahead of motor vehicle deaths and fire-arms.’’ This is a significant matter. As DEA Acting Administrator Chuck Rosen-berg, a bright, young mind appointed by President Obama, noted last July that ‘‘[a]pproximately 120 people die each day in the United States of a drug overdose.’’ Some argue that the increase in her-oin abuse is due to over-prescription of opioids from prescription drugs—you get addicted from a prescription drug, and then you move to heroin. I am sure that has some validity, but according to a January 14, 2016, study published in the New England Journal of Medi-cine, one of the premier authoritative medical journals in the world: 
In the majority of studies, the increase in the rates of heroin use preceded the change in prescription-opioid policies, and there is no consistent evidence of an association be-tween the implementation of policies related to prescription opioids and increases in the rates of heroin use or deaths, although the data are relatively sparse. Alternatively, heroin market forces— 
Please hear this, colleagues— 
Alternatively, heroin market forces, in-cluding increased accessibility, reduced price, and high purity of heroin appear to be major drivers of the recent increases in rates of heroin use. 
So it is purity, price, and accessi-bility. While treatment and account-ability are critical to breaking the cycle of addiction, it is not the whole solution. We must also reduce the availability of heroin—we simply have to do that—and other illicit opioids. In December of last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Di-rector Tom Frieden said it is impor-tant ‘‘that law enforcement’’—a lot of people don’t want to talk about this. We have police officers, sheriffs’ depu-ties, Federal agents, drug enforcement

agents, and Border Patrol agents. He said it is important ‘‘that law enforce-ment intensify efforts to reduce the availability of heroin, illegal fentanyl, and other illegal opioids.’’ Similarly, Drug Enforcement Administration Act-ing Administrator Rosenberg said in the DEA’s National Drug Threat As-sessment that, in addition to providing treatment to addicted opioid abusers, ‘‘law enforcement must continue to have the tools it needs to attack crimi-nal groups who facilitate drug addic-tion.’’ I have been there. I was part of law enforcement’s efforts. I invested a tre-mendous amount of my time in the Co-alition for a Drug Free Mobile, the Partnership for Youth, Bay Area Drug Council—groups like that—working on a volunteer basis to change the use of drugs in the community. Law enforce-ment was always a critical part of it, and law enforcement does have the ca-pability in ways that others don’t to reduce the availability, make purity levels less, and otherwise restrict, rais-ing the price of an illegal drug. The DEA’s 2015 National Drug Threat As-sessment confirms this. They studied the price of the drugs. One thing that tells us whether or not law enforce-ment and interdiction are effective is to discover if the price is going up or down. Mexican drug cartels are flooding the United States with cheap heroin and methamphetamine. When I was a young prosecutor, it was coming from Turkey, the Middle East, and that was pretty much shut off. President Carter did some good things. I was an Assist-ant U.S. Attorney and came back a few years later as a U.S. Attorney, but dur-ing that time they somehow reduced the supply of heroin from the Middle East. As a result, heroin addiction dropped all over the country, and very little heroin was in the heartland of America—mainly just in the big cities. We are also getting cheap meth-amphetamine from across the Mexican border, which is wide open. The statis-tics from the DEA Drug Threat Assess-ment confirm that, from 2010 to 2014, the amount of heroin seized every year at the southwest border has more than doubled. Well, are we catching that much more? No, we are not catching, I am sure, any substantially larger per-centage. We are just having a larger amount moving across the border. The price has fallen, so we know we have more. If prices stay low, more people will try it more often, and as the pu-rity level is higher, more people will get addicted sooner and often die quicker. These drug cartels are partnering with criminal gangs and fueling vio-lence in our cities and communities. According to DEA’s 2015 Threat Assess-ment, Mexican drug cartels ‘‘control drug trafficking across the Southwest Border and are moving to expand their presence in the United States, particu-larly in heroin markets.’’ They import, transport, and are now actually selling it in our cities instead of just bringing it in across the border. In 2013, the heads of the Chicago Crime Commission and the Chicago Of-fice of the Drug Enforcement Adminis-tration both named El Chapo Guzman, the infamous leader of the Sinaloa Car-tel, as Chicago’s ‘‘Public Enemy #1.’’ So a man in Mexico, moving heroin and methamphetamine into the United States and hammering Chicago with it—Chicago named him as their No. 1 public enemy. It cannot be a coinci-dence, as the FBI’s uniform crime sta-tistics show, that the murder rate in Chicago increased by approximately 18 percent during the first 6 months of 2015. At that rate, it is a 36 percent in-crease in murders in Chicago in 1 year. This is an unbelievably dramatic surge in murders. Another example is Atlanta. DEA’s Atlanta office reported an increase of heroin availability from a rating of ‘‘stable’’ in the first half of 2013 to ‘‘high’’ just a year later. According to the FBI’s uniform crime statistics, the murder rate in Atlanta increased by approximately 15 percent in the first 6 months of 2015. This is an unsustainable thing. The old rule is a 7-percent increase and your money doubles in 10 years. When you get 15- and 18-percent increases in 6 months— that’s 30 percent in 1 year—you are doubling the crime rate, the murder rate, in 3 years. At a November hearing of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Con-trol, I asked DEA Deputy Adminis-trator Jack Riley about these drug dis-tribution networks and the people in local communities pushing the drugs, selling the drugs, and collecting the money. This money eventually ends up back in Mexico, Colombia, and South and Central America, funding the evil, violent drug cartels that are desta-bilizing whole nations. He responded that it is ‘‘almost as big a problem as the cartels themselves.’’ When I asked him whether these drug traffickers are the ones causing the vi-olence and death on our streets, he re-sponded that ‘‘they are the ones that regulate themselves by the barrel of a gun.’’ If you want to collect a drug debt, you can’t file a lawsuit in Federal court. You collect it by the barrel of a gun. By its very nature, drug distribution networks are violent criminals. It has always been so, and it will always be so. Conducting an illegal enterprise, they have to maintain discipline, and they use threats and violence to main-tain it and collect their debts. We must not forget what became obvious in the early 1980s, when I was a U.S. Attor-ney: Drug dealers and their organiza-tions are not nonviolent criminals. These are violent crimes. Rather than enforcing the law and making it tougher on drug cartels by keeping our border secure, the Obama administration has done exactly the opposite. Our unsecured borders make it easy for the cartels to flood our country with cheap heroin, and the ad-ministration has made it clear that of-ficers are not to deviate from the President’s lawless immigration pol-icy. They are blocked from doing their job and following their oath. Just last week—and as someone who has worked closely with Federal Drug Enforcement officers and immigration officers as a Federal prosecutor—Cus-toms and Border Protection Commis-sioner Gil Kerlikowske testified before the House Committee on Appropria-tions that ‘‘if you don’t want to follow the directions of your superiors, in-cluding the president of the United States and the commissioner of Cus-toms and Border Protection, then you really do need to look for another job.’’ Do you hear what he is saying there, colleagues? What he is saying is that if you want to do your job and enforce the laws as the laws are written, which we have ordered you not to do, and you go on and do it anyway, then look for another job. It is one of the most amaz-ing things I have seen in my entire law enforcement career. ICE officers—Im-migration and Customs Enforcement officers—who enforce drug laws, along with immigration laws, these officers sued their supervisors. They sued their supervisors, alleging that they were being ordered to violate their oath to enforce the immigration laws of the United States by these restrictive poli-cies. It is hard to overestimate the de-struction the Obama administration’s policies—their Executive amnesty, their refusal to sufficiently fund and man the border—are causing to law en-forcement. A big part of this now is the openness to heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana, and other drugs that are being imported. I take that statement by the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection as a direct threat to those officers who want to follow their oath and do their duty. In August 2013, a dramatic event oc-curred that was too little appreciated. Attorney General Holder, the Attorney General of the United States, ordered Federal prosecutors not to charge cer-tain drug offenders with offenses that carry mandatory minimum sentences that are in law. If you have so much drugs, you have a minimum penalty. You can get more than that, but you at least have to serve this minimum pen-alty. He ordered them not to charge those crimes. This is directing prosecu-tors not to follow the law. It has con-tributed to a decrease in the number of traffickers being prosecuted and con-victed. According to data from the Ex-ecutive Office for United States Attor-neys, at the end of 2015—in December— the 6-month average of drug prosecu-tions was down 21 percent compared to 5 years ago. And what are we seeing? A surge in crime, particularly drugs. Ex-cluding prosecutions in magistrate courts, the 6-month average was nearly 32 percent lower at the end of 2015 than 5 years ago. We haven’t cut the number of drug prosecutors. We haven’t cut the

number of DEA agents. This is policy that softens the enforcement of drug crimes against what we have been doing for 25 years, and it is having an impact. I am afraid it is going to con-tinue. Meanwhile, State and local law en-forcement agencies are not given the tools they need to continue taking these dangerous drug traffickers off of the streets. On December 21, 2015, the Depart-ment of Justice chose to stop all equi-table sharing payments to State, local, and tribal partners under the Asset Forfeiture Program. These are seized proceeds, moneys that are seized from drug dealers, big fancy cars and boats that they seize. For the last 20 years, Federal and State officers worked to-gether. The Federal Government has a good system for forfeiting the money. Then, when the forfeiture is over, it is divided among the agencies. As a re-sult, State and local people are willing to commit law officers to participate in these local task forces because they are helping clean up drugs in their community, helping identify and pros-ecute nationally significant drug deal-ers, and they get some compensation back from it when they find a truck full of money. I personally have seen cases where $1 million, $500,000, $800,000 in cash was seized from these people. Some people think, oh, this is wrong; you shouldn’t take their cash. This is the ill-gotten gain of an illegal enterprise and they should be able to keep it? They have no proof of any lawful source of this money. Virtually every time, in addi-tion, there is evidence to prove it is connected to drugs. Half the time, they don’t even show up to contest the sei-zure because they know they have no defense to it. This stops this sharing, and it is undermining the unity of ef-fort that we really need to be success-ful. A joint letter signed by the Inter-national Association of Chiefs of Po-lice, the National Association of Police Organizations, the Major County Sher-iffs’ Association, the National Sheriffs’ Association, the National District At-torneys Association, and the Major Cit-ies Chiefs Association, pointed out that ‘‘the suspension of equitable sharing payments may cause some agencies across the country to reconsider their ability to participate in joint task forces with the Federal Government.’’ In other words, they are going to stop participating. ‘‘The effects of this decision are far reaching and not only a disservice to law enforcement, but also to the public they are sworn to protect.’’ Mr. President, if there is a limit on my time or others are waiting to speak, I will wrap up. Otherwise, I have about 5 minutes to wrap up. I see my colleague Senator L
EAHY , the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. I don’t want to block him. If my time is up, I will yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. C
OATS ). There is no time limit in place. Mr. SESSIONS. While law enforce-ment resources are being cut off, law enforcement officers are being blocked from doing their jobs, and drug pros-ecutions are being reduced, the admin-istration and some in Congress want to push and advance a criminal justice ‘‘reform’’ bill. But these proposals will have a tendency, I am afraid, to worsen the current problem by allowing for more reductions in sentences than are already occurring and early release of thousands of dangerous drug traf-fickers, and the weakening of penalties for those prosecuted under our drug trafficking laws, which have already been weakened—sending the wrong message at exactly the wrong time. I am very concerned about this. I love my colleagues, and I know their hearts are in the right place, but I am convinced we should not be heading in this direction at this time. Make no mistake, Federal prisons are not filled with low-level, nonviolent drug possessors. According to the Bu-reau of Justice Statistics, 99.7 percent of drug offenders in Federal prison at the end of fiscal year 2012 were con-victed of drug trafficking offenses, not drug possession. Drug trafficking is in-herently violent activity, and it only serves to fund the drug cartels while fueling violence in our cities. According to the FBI, violent crime overall increased across the United States during the first half of 2015, by 6.2 percent for murders and 17 percent in the larger cities for murder—the largest single-year increase since at least 1960. Already this year, homicides in Chicago are double what they were all of last year. This is a complex subject. It is too soon to know the total reason for this increase, but it cannot go unnoticed that over the last decade the Sen-tencing Commission, which sets stand-ards for sentencing in the United States—outside of the minimum mandatories that are set by our law passed by Congress—has unilaterally imposed reductions in the sentences for drug inmates currently in prison. So we reduced the sentences for those in prison and they are getting out earlier. The most recent reduction in sentences resulted in the release of more than 46,000 drug traffickers—not drug pos-sessors, drug traffickers—which has been wholeheartedly supported by the Obama administration. According to Bureau of Justice Sta-tistics, 77 percent of drug offenders re-leased were rearrested within 5 years. Hear this now: 77 percent of these drug offenders were rearrested within 5 years, with 25 percent of those re-arrested being rearrested for a violent crime—somebody hurt, maybe dead. Maybe that is part of the murder rate increase. Take Wendell Callahan, a Federal drug felon who was convicted of traf-ficking in crack cocaine and released early pursuant to the Sentencing Com-mission’s directives. Upon his early re-lease, he proceeded to brutally murder his ex-girlfriend and her two little girls, 7 and 10. He would have been deep into a 121⁄2-year Federal sentence if it had been maintained, but the Sen-tencing Commission reduced it. The judge granted his petition for early re-lease because of his ‘‘good behavior’’ in prison, and that led the judge to con-clude he did not pose a danger to the safety of the public, even though in his background—when he was convicted and got the 12 years, he had previously been convicted in connection with a shooting offense and another drug of-fense. This is why you have to have some controls on judges. I have been there, and I saw it before the sen-tencing guidelines were passed. The Federal prison population is at its lowest level since 2008. We are al-ready on a downward course of the drug Federal prison population being re-duced. There are only 160,000 inmates in Bureau of Prisons custody today, well below its peak. The Bureau of Prisons has stated that this ‘‘downward population trend is expected to con-tinue into Fiscal Year 2017,’’ bringing the Federal prisons population to the lowest level since 2005. The population is up. Crime is going up. The prison population is falling rather rapidly. Admissions to Federal prison have declined every year since 2011. You hear: We are filling our prisons. We are doing more and more. Actually, there are other things that are already happening. It is happening in State prisons, too, where larger numbers are incarcerated than in the Federal prisons. One of the reasons we are having this large decline in State prisons is not public safety but tight budgets. They are cutting back on the prison population to save money. We can be smarter. Some people can be released early. I worked with my Democratic colleague, Senator D
URBIN , 6 years ago, I believe, and we reduced the crack penalties more significantly than a lot of people know. I thought that was justified. But we are now pro-ceeding well beyond that, and it is causing me great concern. The Attorney General has ordered the prosecutors to not charge certain criminal offenses. Reducing sentences and releasing felons is equivalent to re-ducing the cost to the criminal enter-prise of their criminal activity. It re-duces the cost, the risk. Thus, crime— it is already rising—would further in-crease as a result of the criminal jus-tice ‘‘reform’’ bill that would further reduce penalties. Can we take a breath, and let’s think about this? I don’t say there aren’t some things we can do that will allow for some reduction in the Federal pris-on population. Some people probably serve more time than is absolutely nec-essary. But in truth, we have seen dra-matic improvements over nearly 30 years, 25 years, in the reduction of crime. Until this surge, murder rates were less than half what they were in 1980 when I became a Federal pros-ecutor. Drug use dropped dramatically

when Nancy Reagan started the ‘‘Just Say No’’ program, and drug use began to steadily decrease. It is now begin-ning to steadily increase. You have to have leadership from Washington. You can’t have the Presi-dent of the United States of America talking about marijuana like it is no different than taking a drink, saying I used marijuana when I was in high school and it is no different than smok-ing. It is different. And you are sending a message to young people that there is no danger in this process. It is false that marijuana use doesn’t lead people to more drug use. It is already causing a disturbance in the States that have made it legal. I think we need to be careful about this. What if this is the beginning of an-other surge in drug use like we saw in the sixties and seventies that led to massive problems in our communities? The solution? Well, we have to control the border. All the heroin and a big chunk of the methamphetamine is coming across the Mexican border. We need barriers. We need more agents. People need to be arrested. They need to be deported. They don’t get to be taken to some city in the United States they would like to go to and get released and asked to show up on bail, which they never do. That is an open invitation to illegality and illegal entry. We need to enforce our laws, and we have to make the consequences of drug trafficking a deterrent. We can do this. We have done it before, and it is all part and parcel with prevention pro-grams, education programs, and treat-ment programs. All that has to be done, but it cannot be denied, in my opinion, that law enforcement plays a critical role in it. This means sup-porting, not blocking the efforts of law enforcement to do their jobs and giving them the tools to arrest drug traf-fickers and be effective at the border, putting them in jail, not giving them early release so they can commit more crimes. In January, a woman from Ohio named Tonda DaRe testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee at a hear-ing on the heroin and prescription opioid epidemic. She shared the power-ful story of her daughter, who died from a heroin overdose. She said this: 
One of the things that I see happening in our little town that frustrates me is . . . our officers have worked so diligently to arrest people that they know are bringing this [her-oin] in. Just [to] have them go in front of our judges and our judges just slapped these peo-ple on the wrist and sent them right back out the door. . . . The boy that sold my daughter the heroin that killed her just re-cently went back in front of a judge for his fourth offense for trafficking heroin. [It was the] fourth time he’s been arrested for this and he was given five months. How [is] that possible? 
We can talk about making sure we have treatment and recovery for people who have been addicted, although many people never ever recover from addiction—except by the grave. That is the sad truth. We should make that a priority. But we cannot hope to solve these problems by only treating people on the back end of addiction without reducing the availability of those drugs and keeping the purity down and the cost up, not continuing to fall. We have to stop people from becoming addicts in the first place, and we can’t let the fact that we have a heroin abuse epi-demic cause us to forget that we have a drug trafficking epidemic too. Law enforcement is prevention. Ex-perts tell us that the price, purity, and availability of drugs, especially heroin, fuels more consumption, more addic-tion, more crime, more death, and more human and family destruction. I wish it were not true. I wish there were more options, but law enforcement is a central part of this effort, and history proves it. I thank the Chair and yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Vermont. 51ST ANNIVERSARY OF BLOODY SUNDAY  
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today is the 51st anniversary of Bloody Sun-day—a horrible abuse of American citi-zens that occurred in Selma, AL. Each year we commemorate the events of that fateful day, because it helped transform our Nation and proved to be a catalyst for the passage of the Voting Rights Act. For the last two years, this commemoration has been a sad re-minder of what five justices did to that cornerstone civil rights law. In Shelby County v. Holder a narrow majority of the Court drove a stake through the heart of the Voting Rights Act when it struck down the coverage formula for its preclearance provision in Section 5. I mentioned that because under sec-tion 5 of the Voting Rights Act, the Federal Government has the authority to examine and prevent racially dis-criminatory voting changes from going into effect before those changes dis-enfranchise voters in covered jurisdic-tions. By striking down the coverage formula that determined which States and jurisdictions were subject to Fed-eral review, the Court rendered Section 5 unenforceable. Unfortunately, even though almost every single Republican and Democrat in the House and Senate voted for the Voting Rights Act, the Supreme Court, by a 1-vote margin—notwithstanding that 535 of us had voted—drove a stake through the heart of the Voting Rights Act by striking down the coverage for-mula for its preclearance provisions in Section 5. Since then Republican Governors and State legislatures have exploited Shelby County by enacting sweeping voter suppression laws that dispropor-tionately prevent or discourage black Americans from voting. This includes the State of Alabama, which not only enacted a burdensome photo identifica-tion law after the decision, but then they made it even harder for many of its black citizens to obtain identifica-tion when the State closed more than 30 DMV offices in mostly poor, minor-ity neighborhoods last October. It is hard to fathom that in 2016, well over 100 years after the Civil War and passage of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution, and after transformative moments, such as Bloody Sunday, that States would con-tinue to pass laws and take actions that would undermine black Ameri-cans’ rights to vote. This past weekend, Congresswoman TERRI SEWELL , who represents the 7th District of Alabama—which includes Shelby County, Birmingham, and Selma—held a public forum in Bir-mingham to examine the harm caused by the Supreme Court’s Shelby County decision. Several witnesses at that forum testified that the State had made it harder for their citizens to vote, and that a disproportionate num-ber of those citizens were minorities. They also spoke about the urgent need to restore the protections of the Voting Rights Act. Congressman J
OHN LEWIS, our great civil rights hero, was in at-tendance, and it is heartbreaking to re-alize that so many of the gains that he was able to help secure through his civil rights activism are being undone today. Despite the compelling testimony about the urgent need for Congress to address voting rights, most Repub-licans in Congress continue to dis-regard the urgency of this issue. More than two and a half years since the Shelby County decision, and despite the introduction of two separate bipar-tisan bills that would restore the pro-tections of the Voting Rights Act, the Republican chairs of the Judiciary Committee from both houses of Con-gress refuse to even hold a hearing on this issue. Instead, Republican leaders have only paid lip service to the issue, supporting the award of congressional medals for brave civil rights leaders. That is not enough. Recently, the Speaker of the House stated that he was supportive of one of the bipartisan voting rights restora-tion bills. In the same statement he ex-plained that nothing could be done be-cause the Republican chair of the House Judiciary Committee refuses to take up the bill or to have a hearing. This is not leadership. The American people expect more than talk. This pattern of Republican obstruc-tion reached unprecedented heights re-cently when a few Senate Republicans declared that they would not even hold a hearing for the next Supreme Court nominee even before the President has even announced a nominee. Republicans have apparently decided that rather than be transparent and hold public hearings and votes on the most significant issues of the day—in-cluding voting rights, comprehensive immigration reform, and the next Su-preme Court nominee—they would sim-ply shut down the process. Instead they are making important and timely deci-sions affecting hundreds of millions of Americans behind closed doors. It is

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1309 March 7, 2016 
not good for our democracy and it is not good for the American people. We need hearings and a vote on the voting rights bills. And we need a hear-ing and a vote on the next Supreme Court nominee. We remember what came to be known as Bloody Sunday because the blood that was shed led to greater democratic participation and a more inclusive union. What Repub-licans are doing now undermines the hard-fought legacy of Bloody Sunday and the Civil Rights Movement. For the good of the Nation, I urge that Re-publican leaders in the Senate and the House change that shameful course. Mr. President, the Senate will soon vote to bring us one step closer to pas-sage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act or CARA. Last week I suggested that we stay in session and do our job on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday so we could finish the bill, but I understand the Republican lead-ership wanted to take a long weekend, so we did not finish it, but now we can. I am a cosponsor of this bill because it addresses the growing problem of prescription opioid and heroin addic-tion that has had devastating impacts on communities all over the country, including my home State of Vermont. This bill represents an important shift in the way we approach the issue of substance abuse and addiction. It sets a comprehensive framework to re-duce opioid deaths, prevent addiction, and improve treatment. It will also help those who suffer from opioid use disorders achieve recovery, and perhaps most importantly this bill reflects the consensus of this body that the Nation cannot arrest or jail its way out of this addiction problem. Since my first field hearing in Rut-land, VT, on this topic in 2008, I have been inspired by how my fellow Vermonters across the political spec-trum have shaped the discussion about this public health crisis and how they have served as a model for commu-nities across the Nation. I certainly feel this bill represents important progress, but we cannot be satisfied with just passing this one bill. We also need a significant commitment of targeted funding so we can carry out and implement the programs author-ized by this bill. It is one thing to say we are going to authorize these great programs even though we are not going to pay for them, but don’t you feel good that we authorized them. Now we can all go home and tell our constituents we care. We authorized it, but we will not pay for it. At least Senator S
HAHEEN stood and proposed an amendment that would have provided emergency funding to do just that. Her vital amendment had the support of a majority in this body, but Republican Senators blocked it from being considered and adopted. It is un-fortunate because Senator S
HAHEEN ’s amendment would have provided the resources to strengthen both the law enforcement and public health compo-nents that would have delivered the necessary resources to health care pro-fessionals all over the country who are overwhelmed by a need they cannot meet. I believe there is bipartisan agree-ment that we have to stop the loss of life caused by opioid abuse. There should be a bipartisan agreement to provide the money necessary to do so. There is an opportunity to make the bill better. Many Members have filed amendments to improve CARA. A num-ber of amendments were filed by both Republicans and Democrats. Unfortu-nately, the Republican leader has not allowed us to have an open amendment process, and contrary to what he said earlier, a number of Senators have been blocked from offering their amendments. I tried to work—and did in a bipartisan way with Senators GRASSLEY , W HITEHOUSE , and K LO-
BUCHAR —to consider this bill and re-port it to the Senate floor. We have continued our bipartisan effort to reach agreement on a number of amendments that could improve the bill. I hope those important bipartisan efforts will continue this week so we can consider these amendments and have final passage this week. Let us have an open process. These amendments can be voted on up or down or adopted by consent. It is one thing for us to talk about what we want to do, it is another thing to have the courage to vote for it. If we do not vote for it, we are just voting maybe. Let us vote yes or no. As we work toward Senate passage of CARA, our goal should be to make this the best bill possible. Addiction is nothing less than an epidemic and CARA treats it like one. This bill dem-onstrates that Congress now sees ad-diction for what it is—a public health crisis all over our country. We need to equip our communities with both the programs and resources they need to get ahead of addiction. CARA will save lives. It is worth put-ting the money in there to make sure it works. Mr. President, I see the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia on the floor, and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from West Virginia. Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the senior Senator from Vermont, who is a dear friend of mine. As he knows, this is a problem. It is an epidemic all over this country. No State is immune from it. It doesn’t matter whether you are a Democrat or Republican. It has no home. It attacks and literally eradicates all of us, and it causes extreme hardships for all the families. I know the Presiding Officer, who is from Indiana, is aware of this problem. Every week I have come to the floor to read letters from people who have been affected by addiction in West Virginia and other States. I have a letter from the Presiding Officer’s home State of Indiana, and I have a letter from my State too. This is something we have been fight-ing. The CARA Act is a bipartisan piece of legislation. It is not going to be a cure-all, but it starts in the right direction for us to start looking at opioid addiction and prescription drug abuse, not as much as we have in the past as a crime but as an illness, and an illness needs to have treatment. I think we are moving in that direction. Politically we are accepting this, and we are going to basically meet that need of treatment which is so few and far between. We have 51 people dying every day. In my little, beautiful State of West Vir-ginia, just last year we lost over 600 lives to prescription drug abuse, and I have a State with less than 2 million people. From 1999 to 2013 there has been an increase of over 700 percent. This is a product which has come on the market that is greater than any-thing we have ever seen. We hope the FDA gets serious about this. They are hearing us loud and clear. Dr. Califf was not someone whom I supported. I am very hopeful he will do a great job, and I will support him. He needs to step up to the plate and change the cul-ture of the FDA. The reason I say that is because the FDA has to take their role seriously and not just approve drugs because it meets a certain cri-teria but also needs to realize the im-pact it has on the well-being of the families who have been addicted and affected. They need to consider the devastating public health impacts of its repeated decisions to approve all of these drugs that don’t need to be on the market. We are very hopeful for that. The thing that brings that to mind is that it took us forever to get Vicodin and Lortab from a schedule III to a schedule II. It took us over 3 years. Once we did, it took about 1 billion pills off the market, which resulted in a 22-percent decrease in Vicodin and Lortab, which were being passed out like M&Ms. We know it can save lives. Yet they came right back with Zohydro, which was against the wishes of their advisory committee. We believe it is imperative that they have an advisory committee for every opioid they want to bring to the mar-ket. They must listen to the advisory committee. If the FDA—the Commis-sioner and his staff—wishes to go ahead and put a product on the market that is recommended not to be on the mar-ket from their advisory committee, they should come before us in Congress and tell us why they believe this po-tent drug such as Zohydro is needed when it is against the recommenda-tions of these experts and specialists. We have been flooded with these sto-ries. I will read a story from the Pre-siding Officer’s State of Indiana first.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES1310 March 7, 2016 
The girl’s name is Danielle. She says: I live in Southern Indiana and work as a server. About 2
1⁄2years ago a cus-tomer by the name of Josh Harvey left me his number. At the time, he told me he was living in Chicago for school. Little did I know he was in rehab there. Granted, I didn’t know about his addiction for over a year because we hadn’t stayed in constant contact. About a year or so ago I found out about his heroin addiction. He still told me little about it. I do know it started out with prescription pills and later went into heroin when the pills became harder to get. He served a month in jail in Michigan, for the entire month of this past July, over a heroin-related charge. He came home immediately after and overdosed that same week-end. Luckily, his dad saved him that time. Now he got enrolled in college and was going to an outpatient pro-gram doing better—or so we all thought. School let out for break and I guess it all went downhill. He came to me on November 4 telling me he had used a couple of times and wanted my advice. I suggested an inpatient pro-gram. He went to Wellstone after he left my house, sat for several hours and finally was given a room. I went and checked on him two different times while he waited to make sure he was there. Thursday I didn’t receive any calls. Friday nothing either. Then, Sat-urday morning, the 7th of November, his mother called me to break my heart. He had passed away that Friday the 6th over in Louisville and they didn’t know who to contact until that Saturday morning, I guess. He had checked himself out of Wellstone, broke into his house, and took his Xbox, which he later either pawned or traded for heroin. Never in a million years did I think I would become close to anybody addicted to heroin. It doesn’t discriminate. It can get a hold of anyone and everybody. Never in my life have I been so depressed or heart-broken. All I want is his story shared. He was my happy ending gone way too soon. That was from our friend in Indiana who wanted to share her story with us. Let me tell you about Amanda, who lives in West Virginia. Amanda said: I walked into our new apartment. Although we had only spent 2 nights there, it already felt like home. I was so excited to move in with Nate. We had been on the fence be-tween being best friends and a couple, and making the decision to move in to-gether had finally settled years of un-certainty. As I turned the corner, I was surprised to see that he was in the exact same position as when I had left for my morning classes. I knew it had been a rough night of ‘‘partying,’’ but I thought he would be up to start our busy day of painting and moving. I touched his chest to feel the rise and fall, something that, as a mother, I had been doing to sleeping children for years. There was movement. He was breathing. I breathed a quick sigh of relief. I walked to the back of the apartment to set down my things, and that is when I realized I needed to go and get some things from my old apart-ment, and I started to leave. My hand was on the doorknob, but something stopped me in my tracks. To this day, I don’t know why I turned around. I laid down beside Nate, and I put my arm on his chest. He was not breathing, and when I looked up at his face, his eyes were wide open, but it was obvious that he was not there. The paramedics revived him to the point that he sur-vived in a coma for 1 week. At one point while in the hospital, his eyes opened, and I thought that our night-mare was over, but it was just a muscle reflex and false hope. On January 30, 2007, prescription drugs took the life of Nathan Keith Dunn, age 24. Tall, dark, and handsome is what the world saw. Intelligent, funny, witty, loving, and kind were the qualities seen by those who knew Nate best. He was my best friend, my musical soulmate, and my sounding board. We were inseparable, and I began to experi-ence an ache in my heart that, 9 years later, still occasionally brings me to my knees. But that is just who Nate was to me. He was also the older son of a mother who had left years of abuse at the hands of her husband in order to find a better life for her sons. He was the brother to—and the only soft spot of—a boy who had been hardened grow-ing up on the streets of a town outside of Houston, TX. It seemed as if the only thing that ever kept him ground-ed was Nate’s love. They had one an-other’s back in the best and worst of times. Nate was also the instant crush of any girl who ever laid her eyes upon him. He was the best friend of anyone who knew him. I often wonder who and where he would be today. But I guess I will just have to wonder forever. I wish this was the end of my story about how prescription drugs have af-fected my life, but it is not even close to the end. For longer than I care to admit, drugs have been part of my ev-eryday life. Shortly after Nate’s death, I became addicted to prescription opi-ates. At first, they were prescribed by my doctor. Eventually, I couldn’t get through a day without them. I was what is sometimes referred to as a ‘‘functioning addict,’’ although it is fair to say that such a thing does not exist. To the outside world, I appeared to be fine, normal even. I held a job. I cared for my young sons. I kept a tidy home. Meanwhile, my tolerance was building, and I began to require more and more of the drugs just to feel nor-mal, just to get through each day. Can you imagine living this life in which you wake up each day wondering if you have enough of the drug you need just to be OK for that day? So many people are facing this every single day. It could be the person sit-ting next to you. It could be your child’s teacher. Even worse, it could be your own child. The first thing to suffer was my fi-nancial situation. Every dime I had was spent on the drugs that would allow me to function today, tomorrow, and if I am lucky, the next. Then, my relationships with friends and family began to fail. It was painfully obvious that I was stealing from them. Next, I couldn’t keep a job—a record that will haunt me for the rest of my life. How could I go to work? How could I con-tinue on? Then, a catalyst walked into my life. I met a very good man. As we became closer, I realized that I couldn’t bring myself to tell him that I was a drug ad-dict. This is a silent killer. Nobody speaks; they all keep it very quiet. Mr. President, if I may have about 1 minute to finish up, I would appreciate it. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MANCHIN. Thank you, Mr. President. Very few people know what is actu-ally happening in your life. In order to get help, you have to be willing to openly talk about your issues, and most of us fear being harshly judged— and rightfully so. Trying to treat a person with addic-tion issues by using medication only or therapy only is like trying to extin-guish a raging house fire with a garden hose. She said: I was fortunate enough to have found a medication-based treat-ment program in my area, which is paid for by my insurance. She is going to move forward, and she wanted this story to be told. She said she wanted people to know how difficult it is. What we need to know as policy-makers is how hard it is for people in our States who realize they need help and can’t find it. So what I ask all of us to do—this CARA bill is a step in the right direc-tion. It is a piece of legislation that is much needed. As we move forward today on this piece of legislation, I hope we will find basically the support that people are needing to fight this opiate addiction. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

The Senator from Ohio. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, that is good news. The Presiding Officer just announced the results of the vote, and that is good news because it means the Senate has just taken another step to-ward the passage of CARA, the Com-prehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. I see my colleague Senator WHITE-
HOUSE is on the floor. I thank him and thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for moving forward on this legislation that will help us to save friends, family members, our neigh-bors, and communities that are strug-gling with addiction. This is a very important opportunity for us to be able to move forward on legislation that is comprehensive, that is bipartisan, and that has a companion bill on the House side, so there is a very good chance we could get this to the President’s desk. It is the only bi-partisan legislation that is comprehen-sive and evidence based, and it is crit-ical we move forward with it. In addition to Senator W
HITEHOUSE , I also thank Senator A
YOTTE , Senator K
LOBUCHAR , and 42 bipartisan cospon-sors for their support. Frankly, more important to me is the support around the country this legislation has. I think Senator W
HITE-
HOUSE and I now have over 130 groups around the country that are supporting this legislation. This includes doctors, nurses, health care professionals, also law enforcement, people who are in the trenches dealing every day with treat-ment and recovery, and those who are focused on prevention and how to en-sure people cannot just be treated for addiction but try to keep people out of the funnel of addiction. We started working on this legisla-tion about 3 years ago. We started by hearing from experts around the coun-try. We had five conferences in Wash-ington where we looked at all the issues, including criminal justice, women and addiction, the science of addiction, youth prevention, recovery issues, substance abuse impacting our veterans—a number of issues that en-abled us to write legislation that actu-ally makes sense, that will make a dif-ference in our communities. These 130 groups around the country are focused on getting this bill passed because they know it is going to make a difference in our communities. If enacted, this will help States and communities develop and implement these evidence-based practices that we have looked at from around the coun-try. It expands prevention and edu-cational efforts to prevent prescription opioid abuse and the use of heroin and increases drug disposal sites to keep medications out of the hands of youth. It also authorizes law enforcement task forces to combat heroin and meth-amphetamine and expands the avail-ability of the overdose reversal drugs such as naloxone, which are miracle drugs. It provides not just naloxone but also more training to our law enforce-ment officials, to firefighters, and to other emergency responders. In the criminal justice system, CARA will help promptly identify and treat individuals suffering from substance abuse and expand diversion and edu-cation efforts to give individuals a sec-ond chance. Frankly, it is going to help to get people into treatment rather than going into the criminal justice system. Locking up people hasn’t worked. If people are being arrested for possession alone, for using, this legisla-tion will help to divert those people into the treatment to get them back on their feet. CARA also authorizes resources to expand treatment in general, including medication-assisted treatment—again based on the research that has been done around the country. It allows veterans who were dis-charged for a substance abuse disorder to use drug courts as they recover. So it provides actual grants to these vet-erans treatment courts. They are doing a terrific job. I have toured these in Ohio and talked to some of these vet-erans who have been through these pro-grams. Again, it helps get our veterans back on the right track. Rather than ending in jail, they end up in a treat-ment program with other veterans helping them and supporting them, where they can begin to deal with their addiction and mental health issues. CARA supports recovery programs, including those focused on youth and building communities of recovery. This happens now at our colleges and uni-versities increasingly. We want to sup-port that. It also creates a task force on recovery to improve ways to address the collateral consequences imposed by addiction. One of the most important aspects of this legislation expands drug treat-ment for pregnant women who struggle with addiction and provides support for babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome, babies who are born with ad-diction. Recently, my wife Jane and I visited Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hos-pital in Cleveland, OH. We toured the neonatal unit. If you haven’t done this, it will break your heart because you will find there an increasing number of babies who are born, again, with this addiction, the neonatal abstinence syn-drome. Unfortunately, when you look at what has happened in Ohio, we have had a 750-percent increase in the num-ber of babies who are diagnosed with this neonatal abstinence syndrome just since 2004—a 750-percent increase. I am told in some of our States now 10 per-cent of the babies are being born ad-dicted. I have also been at other hospitals around our State, including Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center and St. Rita’s Special Care Nursery in Lima, OH. Last week my wife went to Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Co-lumbus. Every single one of these chil-dren’s hospitals is experiencing the same thing. What I have learned from these incredibly compassionate nurses and doctors who take these newborns

through a withdrawal process is that the numbers of babies who have been exposed to heroin or prescription drugs continue to grow. The problem is get-ting worse, not better. These hospitals serve as yet another reminder that ad-diction is a disease. It is a disease that has to be treated like other diseases, and it is a disease that can impact any-one. It is wonderful that these caring nurses, doctors, and others are working to try to ensure that these babies be-come healthy. We don’t know what the long-term consequences are, but we need to do more to avoid the addiction in the first place and better treat it when it occurs, and that is what this legislation does. Specifically, the measure takes steps to help women and babies by expanding treatment for ex-pectant and postpartum women and au-thorizing the Department of Health and Human Services to award grants to ensure that these women have access to evidence-based treatment services. That is in this legislation. It also reau-thorizes residential treatment pro-grams for pregnant and postpartum women struggling with addiction. There is a great center in Columbus, OH, called Amethyst. I had the oppor-tunity to visit it. It is a treatment cen-ter, and the average length of stay there is almost 2 years. Their results are unbelievable. They allow women to come with their babies, with their chil-dren, to go through treatment to-gether. So there is hope. There are treatment centers doing a great job. We want to hold those up and encour-age more of that around the country. Finally, the legislation also creates a pilot program for State substance abuse agencies that allows funds to be used to target women who are addicted to opioids and provide family-based services to those women in nonresiden-tial settings. So it helps on the residen-tial side but also with the nonresiden-tial outpatient side. Helping these women and helping these babies is just one aspect of this bill, but it is a very critical one. As we work to turn the tide in the struggle against addiction, it is one on which we should all be focused. The good news is that the bipartisan momentum we have seen here tonight is building. I think the Senate is ready to move on this legislation this week. There are other amendments that have been filed. The deadline was today. I hope we will have the opportunity to go through some more amendments, as we did last week, but meanwhile, we have strong support and strong mo-mentum, as we saw tonight, on both sides of the aisle. Both Republican and Democratic leaders have lined up to support this legislation. We need to pass this bill and get it signed into law so it can begin to make a real dif-ference in the lives of people we rep-resent. As the heroin epidemic in Ohio and around the country has reached crisis level, I look forward to working with my colleagues to get this bill over the finish line here in the Senate and then get it passed in the House, where there is companion legislation, and then on to the President’s desk and enable this Congress to play a role as a better partner with State and local govern-ments and with our nonprofits around this country to address this growing heroin epidemic around our entire country. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Ohio. 
MINERS PROTECTION ACT  
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, last week I met with Rita Lewis of West-chester, OH, in southwest Ohio. She was here to testify in front of the Sen-ate Committee on Finance in honor of her late husband Butch. Butch worked as a trucker for 40 years with the promise that the pen-sion he earned would be there to care for his family after he retired. I would also add that Butch had been drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates to play baseball some 45 years ago. In-stead, he enlisted to go into the U.S. Army and on to Vietnam. He was in-jured and could never play baseball again competitively. He came back and became a trucker and joined the Team-sters. As I said, he worked as a trucker for 40 years with the promise that the pen-sion he earned would be there to care for his family after he retired. But for Butch and Rita and thousands more Ohio retirees, that promise is under threat. Truckers and mine workers in Ohio and across the country are facing crippling cuts to the benefits they have earned. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act that Congress passed 2 years ago allows pension trustees to propose mas-sive cuts to the earned benefits of re-tirees when a plan is running low on funds. This is disgraceful. If a pension fund is in bad shape, it is our job to fix it, not break promises to American workers who have worked their whole lives to earn that pension. I believed that 2 years ago when I voted against that law which allowed these proposed cuts, and I believe it more strongly now. That is why I am calling on the Treasury Department to reject and to reject immediately the proposed cuts to the Central States Teamsters’ pen-sion. I am calling for us to imme-diately mark up and pass the Miners Protection Act, which will protect the benefits Ohio workers earned over a lifetime of work. Under MEPRA, the bill I talked about a moment ago, multiemployer pension trustees such as Central States are now able to propose massive cuts to the earned benefits of participants and retirees if the plans are in ‘‘critical and declining status.’’ Pension trustees for plans in ‘‘critical and declining status’’ may submit an application for pro-posed benefit cuts to the U.S. Treasury Department. The Central States pension plan trustees used the authority of MEPRA to propose cuts of as much as 70 per-cent, but in their own application, they admit that even with these drastic cuts, their plan—get this—still only has a 50.4-percent chance of remaining solvent. In other words, they are ask-ing Treasury to approve massive, life- shattering cuts to hundreds of thou-sands of workers for what amounts to a coin flip. Treasury should immediately reject this application. Put yourself—this is something we don’t do well around here—put yourself in the place of a worker who has planned for her retirement with her family. She expected a $2,000-a-month pension on top of $1,200 a month in So-cial Security, and she all of a sudden finds out her pension is cut 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 percent. That was the money she planned to live on. She has some sav-ings, but all that was calculated be-cause it was a promise from this pen-sion plan to honor that commitment of decades earlier. As I said, Treasury should imme-diately reject this application. The mine workers’ pension plan and the others are too far gone to use MEPRA. The United Mine Workers of America’s 1974 pension plan covers 100,000 mine workers, including thou-sands of miners in eastern and south-ern Ohio. It was almost completely funded before the financial collapse of 7 years ago brought on by Wall Street overreach and greed, but the plan was devastated by the recession. It has too few assets, too few employers, and too few union workers paying in. If Con-gress fails to act, thousands of retired miners could lose their health care this year and the entire plan could fail as early as next year. There is a bipartisan solution that is proposed by Senator M
ANCHIN , Senator C
ASEY , me, and others and supported by leaders of both parties. If it were brought to the floor today, it would pass with an overwhelming majority. It is time for the Senate to act. The Com-mittee on Finance should mark up this legislation this week. The Senate should bring it to the floor imme-diately. Miners worked in dangerous jobs— dangers from a mining accident, an ex-plosion, or a collapse every day when they went to work, and dangerous in the sense that so many mine workers die early because of premature bron-chial illnesses and heart ailments brought on by working in the mines. They have worked underground their whole lives to put food on the table, to send their kids to school, and to help power this country. Truckers criss- cross the State and country to pay their bills and support their families and drive our economy forward. They all deserve the full pension and health benefits they were promised and they worked a lifetime to earn. Butch Lewis led the Southwest Retir-ees Pension Committee’s fight against cuts to their earned benefits. He passed away on New Year’s Eve due to a stroke, which doctors have attributed

at least in part to the stress he faced over the proposed pension cuts not just to him and his family but to the work-ers he was fighting for as a union activ-ist. The benefits to his widow, his wife Rita, have already been cut. She faces an additional 40-percent reduction be-cause of the proposed cuts put forth by Central States. Butch said the cuts being forced on retirees—his words— ‘‘amount to a war against the middle class and the American dream.’’ He is right. Ohio’s retired workers have earned their pensions and their retire-ment savings over a lifetime of hard work. It was promised to them, wheth-er they worked behind a desk, on the factory floor, down in the coal mines, or behind a wheel. We should honor Butch’s memory by continuing his work. That means com-ing together to support a bipartisan so-lution to protect Rita’s benefits and the pensions of tens of thousands of re-tired Teamsters and retired mine work-ers.

TRIBUTE TO JACQUELYNE BRADY Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and honor the career of Jacquelyne ‘‘Jackie’’ Brady, as she retires from her position as town man-ager for Laughlin, NV. For more than 20 years, Jackie Brady has been dedicated to serving the resi-dents of Clark County. As the Laughlin town manager, Jackie has managed municipal services that Laughlin resi-dents depend on and enjoy. Throughout her tenure, Jackie has worked to build partnerships that spur economic progress and positively impact Laughlin and southern Nevada. Under her steadfast and innovative leader-ship, her office created the first eco-nomic development plan in the city, supported the improvement of Needles Highway, and helped develop the Colo-rado River Greenway Heritage Park and Trails, among other accomplish-ments. Jackie’s success is hard-fought and well-earned. She was born and raised in east Texas in a segregated community where she was not even allowed to use the local library. Instead, Jackie and her peers had to learn from textbooks that were outdated and out of circula-tion. Despite this, Jackie went on to receive her bachelor’s degree from East Tennessee State University, and she later returned to Texas to attend the newly established Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the Univer-sity of Texas at Austin, where she graduated with a master’s degree. In addition to her role as Laughlin town manager, Jackie has served as the county liaison to the town of Searchlight, NV, for more than 17 years. In 2014, Jackie was named a Dis-tinguished Woman in Nevada, and in 2015, she was awarded Woman of the Year by the Real Life Church in Las Vegas. Jackie also sits on the Laughlin Chamber of Commerce board and has been involved with the Rotary Club, United Way Allocations Committee, Family Resource Center Board, and the former Laughlin Kiwanis Club. I congratulate Jackie on her many successes and decades of public service. I appreciate and commend her dedica-tion to the Silver State, and I wish Jackie the best in her retirement and future endeavors. f 
51ST ANNIVERSARY OF BLOODY SUNDAY Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today marks the 51st anniversary of what has come to be known as Bloody Sunday. On March 7, 1965, J
OHNLEWIS and Rev-erend Hosea Williams led 600 brave civil rights activists in a march over the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, AL. These courageous men, women, and children gathered to draw atten-tion to the systematic disenfranchise-ment of African Americans in Alabama and throughout much of the Deep South. They marched in pursuit of the most fundamental right, the right pre-servative of all others—the right to vote. What they received that day, how-ever, were brutal beatings from police batons as State troopers turned them back and chased them down. More than 50 of the demonstrators were injured. J
OHN LEWIS was beaten unconscious and nearly killed. Ten days later, Federal district court Judge Frank M. Johnson, Jr., granted protection to the activists, ruling that they were permitted to march from Selma to the State capitol in Mont-gomery. In the historic order he issued, Judge Johnson wrote: ‘‘The law is clear that the right to petition one’s govern-ment for the redress of grievances may be exercised in large groups. Indeed, where, as here, minorities have been harassed, coerced and intimidated, group association may be the only real-istic way of exercising such rights. . . . These rights may be exercised by marching, even along public high-ways.’’ Days later, the march proceeded with a crowd of approximately 3,200 march-ers—which swelled to 25,000 by the time they reached the capitol. Within months, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law—guaranteeing that the right to vote would not be restricted through clever schemes, like poll taxes and lit-eracy tests, devised to keep African Americans from voting. Last month, the foot soldiers of the 1965 voting rights marches were recog-nized with a Congressional Gold Medal. JOHN LEWIS, who since 1987 has been Congressman J
OHN LEWIS, along with Reverend Frederick D. Reese, accepted the medal on behalf of the foot sol-diers. At the ceremony, Congressman L
EWIS said: ‘‘It was their determined marching feet that led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act. . . . They were just ordinary people with an ex-traordinary vision, to build a true de-mocracy in America.’’ In 2005, I was proud to join Congress-man L
EWIS on a trip to Selma for a cer-emonial walk across the Edmund Pettus Bridge to mark the 40th anni-versary of Bloody Sunday. As we marched in recognition of that extraor-dinary vision to build a true democ-racy, we celebrated the marchers’ achievement—a bill that has often been called the most significant civil rights law ever passed by Congress. Little did we know that, 8 years later, in 2013, the Supreme Court would strike down a major provision of that landmark leg-islation. In Shelby County v. Holder, on a 5–4 vote, a divided Supreme Court struck down the provision of the Voting Rights Act that required certain juris-dictions to preclear any changes to their voting laws with the Department of Justice. This decision effectively gutted the Voting Rights Act. Since the decision, States like Texas, North Carolina, Alabama, and Mississippi have put in place restrictive State vot-ing laws—which all too often have a disproportionate impact on lower-in-come and minority voters. In order to truly honor the foot sol-diers of Bloody Sunday and repair the damage done by Shelby County, Con-gress must restore the Voting Rights Act by passing the bipartisan Voting Rights Advancement Act. This bill, which Senator L
EAHY , Senator C OONS , and I introduced last year, would en-sure that the Federal Government is once again able to fully protect the fundamental right to vote. I wish that, 51 years after Bloody Sunday, America had reached a point where the protections of the Voting Rights Act were no longer necessary. But we have not, and the Voting Rights Act is still very much needed today. In 2006, Congress reauthorized the Voting Rights Act with an over-whelming bipartisan vote in both the House and the Senate. It is time to once again come together on a bipar-tisan basis and recognize the ongoing challenges that minority voters all too frequently face. Congress must take ac-tion to repair the Voting Rights Act and ensure the legacy of those who marched 51 years ago.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES1314 March 7, 2016 
REMEMBERING NANCY REAGAN Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, yester-day the American people lost an icon. Nancy Davis Reagan died at the age of 94. Years ago, during an event at the White House, Nancy once serenaded her husband, singing: ‘‘together we are going a long, long way.’’ And boy did they ever. Born in New York and raised in Chi-cago, Nancy studied theater at Smith College in Massachusetts before mov-ing westward to California to pursue a career in acting. She appeared in 11 motion pictures, but her life changed forever when her name appeared on the infamous list from the House Un-Amer-ican Activities Committee. This was a list of people suspected of having ties to the Communist Party. Worried that she may be blacklisted, she demanded to meet with the presi-dent of the Screen Actors Guild in an effort to remove her name. And guess who was serving as president of the Screen Actors Guild—Ronald Reagan. They met and fell in love. The rest is history. This month, 64 years ago, Ronald Reagan and Nancy Davis married, and in Nancy’s words: ‘‘my life really began when I married my husband.’’ And what a life it was. From the Governor’s mansion in California to the White House, one thing was clear, Nancy was always on Ronald Reagan’s mind. Straight out of a Hollywood script, their 52-year marriage was a true American love story. Their mutual love and devotion is a beautiful re-minder of what a marriage should look like. We should all be so lucky. Fiercely loyal to her husband and America, you didn’t want to get on the wrong side of Nancy Reagan. She had grit and was one tough lady when she had to be. Nancy was a passionate protector of her husband and the Presidency. And during talks with the Soviet Union, she constantly encouraged her husband to stay with it and not give up. She un-derstood that nothing is more impor-tant than peace, and the historic START I arms reduction treaty may not have been possible had it not been for Nancy. After her husband’s Presidency, she championed issues such as drug and al-cohol abuse and afterschool programs. In 1994, after announcing his diagnosis with Alzheimer’s, Ronald Reagan wrote: ‘‘I only wish there was some way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience.’’ But Nancy endured by working to stamp out Alzheimer’s and tirelessly advocated for embryonic stem cell re-search for the rest of her life. She was determined to save other families from the pain she had gone through and she raised millions of dollars for research. She praised President Obama when he removed restrictions on the Federal funding of embryonic stem cell re-search and even teamed up with Ted Kennedy to work on these issues that were so close to her heart. Nancy had a special friendship with Ted Kennedy— who would call her every year on her birthday and sing an old Irish song to his dear friend. That type of bond between the two political parties is missing today in Washington. In an era when the political discourse can overwhelm the real problems we work to solve, Nancy Reagan’s legacy can offer a path forward that we all can learn from. Before her death, Nancy re-flected on the state of American poli-tics and the inflammatory rhetoric we hear on the campaign trail, saying: ‘‘Do you believe this? Do you believe this?’’ Like many of us, she was dis-appointed by the lack of civility be-tween the candidates. It certainly does not reflect a saying she made famous: ‘‘Dignity should be at the center of ev-erything we do.’’ In honor of Nancy Reagan, I hope we all take that message to heart.

RECOGNIZING RYAN LAFFERTY FOR HIS RECOGNITION AS A MILKEN EDUCATOR AWARD WIN-NER 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 7, 2016 Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Mr. Ryan Lafferty, a teacher in the Bellevue School District who has been recognized as a winner of the prestigious Milken Educator Award. The Milken Educator Awards are bestowed upon educators by the Milken Family Founda-tion to celebrate, elevate, and activate excel-lence in the teaching profession. The award is given to teachers who exhibit exceptional edu-cational talent as evidenced by effective in-structional practices and educational accom-plishments beyond the classroom. Mr. Lafferty has been a teacher at the Inter-national School in Bellevue for six years and is highly praised for his interdisciplinary project-based teaching style, which incor-porates seemingly unrelated subjects like math, history, and the arts. He has developed a problem-based curriculum for Advanced Placement Physics where students build Roman arches, projectile instruments such as slingshots and catapults, and a single-string instrument called a Diddley bow. Mr. Lafferty’s classes are in high demand due to his track record of implementing creative lesson plans and for his infectious positive attitude. Mr. Lafferty is also beloved for the positive influence that he provides for his students. He makes himself available to students outside of class time if they need academic help, or if they need to talk for any other reason. He prioritizes the success of his students by regu-larly hosting meetings with students to deter-mine what works in his class, and what can be improved. It is for these reasons that Mr. Lafferty is considered a role model by many of his students. Mr. Lafferty, who grew up in Redmond, graduated from the University of Washington in 2008 and received a Master’s Degree in Teaching from Seattle University in 2010. He has worked with the Bellevue School District, the University of Washington and the George Lucas Educational Foundation to further de-velop his AP Physics curriculum in hopes of the program being implemented nationally. Lafferty is a National Honors Society advisor who serves on the school’s middle and high school science clubs and travels to the state science bowl. Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I congratulate teacher Ryan Lafferty for being honored with the Milken Educator Award. It is my great pleasure to recognize his dedication and service to his students and to the commu-nity. f

HONORING RARE DISEASE WEEK 
HON. TOM MARINO 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 7, 2016 Mr. MARINO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to rare diseases as we recog-nize ‘‘Rare Disease Week.’’ A ‘‘rare disease,’’ also referred to as an or-phan disease, is any disease that affects a small percentage of the population. The Na-tional Institute of Health defines a rare disease as one that affects less than 200,000 people in the United States. The impact of rare dis-eases is certainly not small; there are over 7,000 rare diseases that affect 30 million peo-ple, or 10% of the United States population. As the father of someone who suffers from Cystic Fibrosis, a rare disease affecting only 30,000 people in the United States, I know the difficulty of living with a rare disease and the financial burdens of care and treatment for families. Cystic Fibrosis requires specialized care that can cost upwards of $15,000 a year and hundreds of thousands of dollars over the course of a lifetime. I have done everything I can to make sure that my daughter receives the highest quality care as she continues her fight against Cystic Fibrosis. Thanks to advancements in medicine, the average life expectancy of someone who suf-fers from Cystic Fibrosis is now 37. This is much different than 50 years ago when a child diagnosed with the disease would be lucky to live to their teens. Every year we recognize rare disease week as a way to raise awareness and to stress the importance of funding rare disease research. It is my hope one day we can make rare, incur-able diseases a thing of the past.

RETIREMENT OF BISHOP T. LARRY KIRKLAND FROM THE AFRICAN METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH 
HON. KAREN BASS 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 7, 2016 Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, today I would like to make note of the retirement of The Right Reverend Theodore Larry Kirkland, Sr. from active service after over a half century of min-istry, as he steps down at the African Meth-odist Episcopal Church Fifth District General Conference today. Bishop Kirkland’s ministry of over 50 years has often placed him in the public eye and in the company of dignitaries. For example, he presided over the Homegoing Services of Deaconess Rosa Parks at Brown Chapel AME Church in Montgomery, Alabama, an event broadcast worldwide, and he welcomed then- Senator Barack Obama to the Ninth District’s observance of Bloody Sunday, in Selma. He is the author of several books on church growth and he has become known for developing strong relationships across denominational and cultural lines. Educated at Alcorn State University, Univer-sity of Mississippi, Claremont School of The-ology, and California School of Theology, Bishop Kirkland was the founding pastor of Brookins Community AME Church in Los An-geles, California. Arriving in 1977, he grew the congregation from twelve early members to over eight thousand during his twenty-year tenure. Elevated in 1996, he became the 114th elected and consecrated bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. His first assign-ment was to the Seventeenth Episcopal Dis-trict encompassing the countries of Zaire, Zambia, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Malawi and Zimbabwe. In 2000 he returned to ap-pointment as Ecumenical Officer for the De-nomination, served a term as President of the Council of Bishops, and from 2002 led the Ninth Episcopal District in Alabama, where he sought to support the community beyond the pulpit through a range of programs including computer literacy training and high-quality health services for the needy. For the past eight years, Bishop Kirkland has presided over the Fifth Episcopal District which includes fourteen western states. During this time, Bishop Kirkland has focused on in-spiring ministry and serving the greater com-munity. I would like to salute Bishop Kirkland and his family, especially his wife Mrs. Mary Kirkland, and thank him for his service to the faith and the community.

RECOGNIZING THE 28TH ANNIVER-SARY OF VIOLENCE AGAINST THE ARMENIAN COMMUNITY SUMGAIT, AZERBAIJAN 
HON. KATHERINE M. CLARK 
OF MASSACHUSETTS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 7, 2016 Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, February 27 marked the 28th anniversary of harrowing violence against the Armenian com-munity in Sumgait, Azerbaijan. I am proud to stand today with the Arme-nian-American community, including many of my constituents in Massachusetts, in remem-brance and mourning of this unspeakable trag-edy. In February of 1988, anti-Armenian rallies through Azerbaijan gave way to waves of eth-nically-motivated violence, death and destruc-tion. In the aftermath of these terrible events, Azerbaijan’s Armenian community all but dis-appeared, with thousands displaced, culmi-nating in a war against the people of Nagorno Karabakh. That war resulted in almost 30,000 dead on both sides. Hundreds of thousands of refu-gees were forced to flee their homes. And to this day, those who lost their lives or were dis-placed by this violence still seek resolution and justice. Many displaced Armenian families have sought refuge in America, and are now mak-ing vital contributions in the Fifth District of Massachusetts. Proudly, our diverse District is home to one of the largest Armenian commu-nities in the nation. Together, our community is a thriving example of strength and persever-ance in the face of extreme adversity. Like the persecution of too many others be-fore it, the lessons of the Sumgait Pogrom must not be forgotten. We have a moral obligation to promote tol-erance and justice, and we have a duty to rec-ognize the atrocities that have kept us from our common goal.

RECOGNIZING KIRK ADAMS FOR HIS YEARS OF SERVICE TO THE LIGHTHOUSE FOR THE BLIND, INC. 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 7, 2016 Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Mr. Kirk Adams, President and CEO of the Lighthouse for the Blind, Inc., for his contributions and service to the blind com-munity as he brings his leadership to his new role as President and CEO of the American Federation for the Blind. In 2008, Kirk became the first blind CEO and President of the Lighthouse for the Blind, an organization which provides independence and self-sufficiency through employment for people who are blind, deafblind, and blind with other disabilities. During his tenure as CEO, Kirk oversaw significant growth of the Light-house for the Blind’s footprint across the coun-try by expanding to eleven new locations. Each location added to the sustainability of the Lighthouse, while also empowering new groups of individuals to be gainfully employed. Prior to his executive role at the Lighthouse for the Blind, Kirk served as the General Man-ager of Administration and as the Director of Public Relations and Resource Development at the Lighthouse. Kirk is credited for crafting the Lighthouse’s successful fundraising strat-egy, which has greatly magnified their range of services offered and the number of individ-uals who are lifted up through employment op-portunities. Outside of his work at the Lighthouse for the Blind, Kirk is deeply involved in the commu-nity. He is a member of the Governor’s Task Force on Disability and Employment and the Seattle Public Library’s Strategic Plan Advi-sory Committee. He has served on the boards of the Aerospace Futures Alliance, the Asso-ciation of Washington Business, and the American Federation for the Blind. He is also the former Treasurer and member of the Board of the National Association for the Em-ployment of People Who Are Blind. Kirk graduated Magna Cum Laude with a Bachelors of Arts degree in Economics from Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington. He earned his Master’s Degree in Not-For- Profit Leadership from Seattle University, and is working toward his doctorate in Leadership and Change at Antioch University. Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I rec-ognize Kirk Adams for his admirable leader-ship and congratulate him on his role as Presi-dent and CEO of the Lighthouse for the Blind, Inc. His unrelenting dedication to the blind community serves as an example of the tre-mendous impact one person can have. f

IN RECOGNITION OF PATRICIA BRESEE 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 7, 2016 Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor my good friend Patricia Bresee, a highly re-spected and recognized expert in juvenile law, who has served on the Board of Directors of the California Court Appointed Special Advo-cates (CASA) for nine years as a remarkable leader with exceptional integrity and the ca-pacity to inspire everyone around her. Pat Bresee’s devotion to children is unmatched and she has dedicated her entire professional life to advocate for those in need. We are very fortunate that she will continue her advocacy for children in the dependency system through service on the Board of Directors for National CASA. Pat served as a Superior Court Commis-sioner in San Mateo County for 15 years. She was assigned to sit as a Juvenile Court Judge, handling dependency and delinquency issues and adoptions and guardianships. She was one of the original members of the California Judicial Council’s Family and Juvenile Law Advisory Committee and served as the chair of the Juvenile Law Rules and Forms Com-mittee. She teaches at the California Center for Judicial Education and trains attorneys and judicial officers in Juvenile Delinquency Law. She still manages to find time to be a regular presenter at Beyond the Bench and fills in as a judge at the Juvenile Court in San Mateo County. Her commitment to fight for justice is un-wavering and she has freely volunteered her expertise and time to a number of organiza-tions including the American Leadership Forum Silicon Valley, the Peninsula Commu-nity Foundation, the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, the San Mateo County First Five Commission, and most importantly, California CASA. I had the great honor and pleasure of working with Pat in her role at the San Mateo County Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Pre-vention Commission and the San Mateo County Blue Ribbon Commission on Children in Foster Care. Both commissions made rec-ommendations on ways in which the courts could improve safety, permanency, well-being and fairness for children and families in our state. Pat’s outstanding work has been proclaimed by the California Judges Association in 1994 when she was named Juvenile Court Judge of the Year and again in 1998 by National CASA as Judge of the Year. Judge Bresee grad-uated from Purdue University and earned her law degree from San Francisco Law School. She was admitted into the State Bar of Cali-fornia in 1972. When she is not fighting for justice, Pat likes to travel, attend the theater, read and lift weights. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Represent-atives to join me in honoring the truly remark-able legal career of Patricia Bresee who con-tinues to dedicate her life to advocate for chil-dren and thereby improves society as a whole. She is an outstanding example of a person with a moral compass who brings out the best in others. f

Named in honor of Saint Francis de Sales, DeSales was founded after Bishop Joseph McShea organized a survey of Catholic edu-cation opportunities in the Allentown Diocese. The study indicated there was a need for a Catholic College in the Lehigh Valley area of the Allentown Diocese. The Oblates of St. Francis de Sales broke ground for the new college in May of 1964 on a 500 acre tract located in Lehigh County’s Upper Saucon Township. DeSales accepted its first class of freshmen in September 1965 under its original name—Allentown College of St. Francis de Sales. The ensuing decades brought growth—both in the number of students enrolled and in the curriculum offered. In March 2000, Allentown College proudly became DeSales University. Currently, DeSales has a total enrollment of over 3,000 traditional, graduate and evening students and nearly 1,600 full-time under-graduate students. The school offers 41 ma-jors and 31 minors and boasts over 100 fac-ulty members. DeSales plays an integral role in the Lehigh Valley’s educational network and within the community. DeSales’ graduates have enjoyed tremendous success across the fields of busi-ness, medicine, philosophy, literature, science and teaching. It is my pleasure to congratulate the stu-dents, alumni, faculty and staff of DeSales University as they celebrate their 50th Anni-versary. It is my hope that a future member of this House will be able to enter a congratula-tory record on their behalf fifty years from now as well. f 
THE GROWING THREAT OF CHOL-ERA AND OTHER DISEASES IN THE MIDDLE EAST 
HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 7, 2016 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, during the last several years, conflicts in the Middle East have cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, primarily in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. As a result of conflicts in these countries, as well as the influx of refugees from conflict zones into surrounding countries such as Turkey, Jordan, and Lebanon, many of those who die are the victim of disease. Almost 17 million people in the region are in need of humanitarian assistance, including roughly four million refugees who have fled their countries and an additional 13 million people who have left their homes but are in-ternally displaced within their countries. A hearing I convened last week examined the scope of the cholera and other disease threats to determine what can and should be done to control it and minimize their spread beyond the Middle East. The World Health Organization reported the spread of a cholera epidemic that first began in Iraq in 2007 that crossed over into Iran, Syria and is considered the region’s greatest, although not only, health threat. These threats are worsened by the targeting of health work-ers in Syria and an Islamic State that has no experience and little interest in providing social services. Thus, cholera and other diseases are untreated, often unreported and pose a significant health threat in the region due to poor sanitation and overcrowding in areas such as refugee camps. Cholera is an acute diarrheal disease that can cause death within hours if left untreated. Roughly 80% of those who contract the dis-ease do not develop symptoms, leaving some uncertainty about precisely how many people contract the disease annually. Scientists esti-mate that between 1.4 and 4.3 million people contract cholera annually, of whom 28,000 to 142,000 die. Cholera bacteria are present in the feces of infected people for one to ten days after infection and can be spread to oth-ers if they ingest food or water that is contami-nated with their fecal matter. The spread of cholera is mostly facilitated by inadequate water and sanitation management and out-breaks are common in areas where basic in-frastructure is unavailable, such as urban slums and camps for internally displaced per-sons and refugees. As devastating as this cholera epidemic has been and can be going forward, we must also remember the MERS epidemic of three years ago. The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, is a respiratory illness. It is caused by a virus called Middle East Respiratory Syn-drome Coronavirus, or MERS–CoV. This virus was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. It is different from any other coronaviruses that have been found in people before. MERS–CoV, like other coronaviruses, is thought to spread from an infected person’s respiratory secretions, such as through coughing. However, the precise ways the virus spreads are not currently well understood. MERS–CoV has spread from ill people to oth-ers through close contact, such as caring for or living with an infected person. Infected peo-ple have spread MERS–CoV to others even in healthcare settings, such as hospitals. This transmission pattern is more likely when med-ical facilities and health workers are in short supply. The conflicts and political crises in the Mid-dle East have brought anguish, suffering, and severe declines in health to people throughout the region. The most catastrophic case by far is Syria, where more than a million people have experienced traumatic injuries, once-rare infectious diseases have returned, chronic dis-ease goes untreated, and the health system has collapsed. In Yemen, Libya, Gaza, and Iraq violence has limited access to health care and grievously harmed the population. According to Physicians for Human Rights last summer, at least 633 medical personnel had been killed and more than 270 illegal at-tacks on 202 separate medical facilities had taken place since March 2011 in Syria. Of the attacks on medical facilities, at least 51, or 19 percent, reportedly were carried out with barrel bombs. Almost all the assaults were inflicted by the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. In the Middle East, threats against as well as arrests and intimidation of health workers extends beyond armed conflict to situations of political volatility, as evident in Bahrain, Egypt, and Turkey. In most of these cases, doctors and nurses who treat victims of violence are, by the very act of providing treatment, deemed guilty of anti-government activities. In Bahrain, almost 100 doctors and nurses were arrested and 48 originally charged with felonies for hav-ing offered medical care to wounded people in the wake of the 2011 Arab Spring uprising, Cholera can be treated and its spread can be prevented, but diseases such as MERS pose a danger of spreading beyond the re-gion. However, beyond the global health impli-cations, we must consider the compounded suffering of people in the Middle East. Not only are they often in threat of violence through no fault of their own but they face pre-ventable, treatable diseases that have gotten out of control due to conflicts. Our panel at the hearing included health ex-perts who helped us think through the health challenges our government faces in consid-ering how to provide the most effective assist-ance to people in the Middle East. The two keys to success are: remain vigilant and sus-tain commitment. The hearing last week was intended to demonstrate our vigilance and commitment to addressing this situation.

HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 7, 2016 Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Women’s History Month. Each year, we pay special tribute to the contributions and sacrifices made by our nation’s women. It is an honor to pay homage to outstanding women who are making a difference in my Congressional District. I would like to recog-nize a remarkable woman, Helen Leung, of Elysian Valley, a unique neighborhood in Los Angeles, California. Helen grew up in Elysian Valley and at-tended local public schools. After high school, she moved east to attend the University of Pennsylvania, where she received her Bach-elor’s Degree in Political Science and Commu-nications, after which she attended Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government and obtained a Master’s Degree in Public Policy and Urban Planning. With a passion for redefining the connection of social equity and community development, Helen worked at Living Cities in Washington, D.C., a national funders collaborative focused on systemic impact in low-income commu-nities. She then served as a White House In-tern in 2010, a Fellow at the Department of Housing and Urban Development in 2012, and gained extensive community-based experience working for former Los Angeles City Council President Eric Garcetti, in policy, planning and neighborhood development. Currently she is Co-Executive Director of LA-Ma´s, a non-profit community design organization headquartered in Elysian Valley. In this role, Ms. Leung en-sures that all LA-Ma´s projects, such as the Futuro de Frogtown and Elysian Valley Knowl-edge Hub projects, are grounded in commu-nity need and policy potential. Helen’s past volunteer involvement includes serving on the boards of the Elysian Valley Riverside Neighborhood Council and the Wild-wood Foundation. Currently she serves on the Los Angeles Police Commission’s Police Per-mit Review Panel, the Community Advisory Board of Genesis LA and the board of the Ely-sian Valley Arts Collective. I ask all Members to join me in honoring an exceptional woman of California’s 28th Con-gressional District, Helen Leung, for her ex-traordinary service to the community.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF LOUISIANA STATE REP. RON-NIE EDWARDS 
HON. CEDRIC L. RICHMOND 
OF LOUISIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 7, 2016 Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Louisiana State Representative Ronnie Edwards, a dear friend and model public servant. Rep. Edwards passed away on February 24, 2016, at the age of 63 after a two-year battle with pan-creatic cancer. Rep. Edwards was born in Woodville, Mis-sissippi on July 20, 1952, and was a long time resident of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. An ad-ministrator with over 40 years of experience in government and industry, Rep. Edwards formed lasting relationships and partnerships with education institutions, nonprofits, faith leaders and elected officials to effect change through her community development work. In 1992, Rep. Edwards founded the Urban Restoration Enhancement Corporation (UREC) as a trusted and credible community develop-ment organization. With the assistance of many community leaders and supporters, her tenacity resulted in: safe and affordable hous-ing for families; the establishment of Louisi-ana’s first home for grandparents raising grandchildren in Baton Rouge; innovative youth enrichment initiatives; small business training and development; and the develop-ment of the Security Dads initiative to combat violence. Rep. Edwards was elected to represent Dis-trict 5 on the Baton Rouge Metro Council in 2009. She served on the Council for six years before being elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives in November 2015. In December 2013, Rep. Edwards was diag-nosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. But for the first year and a half, she did not stop her work at the local level and maintained perfect attendance at Metro Council meetings, where she was a strong advocate of health living ini-tiatives, cancer screenings and affordable housing. Rep. Edwards’ diagnosis and experi-ence in the health care system was motivation for her to run for State Representative be-cause she wanted to be an advocate for ways to bring health care access to more citizens. Ronnie was a talented and compassionate legislator, but more importantly she was a friend. The news of her passing is not only devastating to me, it is a tremendous loss for the entire state. She committed her life to serving her constituents and fighting for those who needed it the most. As we mourn her loss we must honor her legacy by renewing our commitment to the work she fought so hard to complete. Lou-isiana has lost a lion, but her memory will live on forever. Mr. Speaker, my deepest condolences are with her family as they go through this difficult time. f 
HONORING WORLD WAR II VET-ERAN & CIVIL ENGINEER HELIAS DOUNDOULAKIS 
HON. KATHLEEN M. RICE 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 7, 2016 Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary life of Helias Doundoulakis, who passed away on February 29th, 2016 at the age of 92. A long- time resident of New York’s fourth congres-sional district, Mr. Doundoulakis was a deco-rated veteran of World War II and an accom-plished civil engineer who played a critical role in developing some of the greatest aeronautic achievements of the 20th century. Born in Ohio and raised in Crete, Greece, Mr. Doundoulakis was still in high school when Axis forces invaded Crete in 1941. Neverthe-less, he joined the Cretan resistance and worked alongside the British Special Oper-ations Executive, collecting vital intelligence for allied forces and sabotaging Axis military operations across the Mediterranean. When it became too dangerous for Mr. Doundoulakis to remain in Crete, he and his brother fled to Egypt, where they immediately rejoined the fight and enlisted in the United States Office of Strategic Services. Despite overwhelming dan-ger, Mr. Doundoulakis’ commitment to liber-ating Crete and defeating the Axis powers never wavered. After the war, Doundoulakis returned to the United States and settled in New York, where as a civil engineer for Grumman Aerospace Corporation, he helped develop several groundbreaking aeronautic innovations, includ-ing the Apollo Lunar Module, the Space Shut-tle and the F–14 Tomcat fighter jet. One of Mr. Doundoulakis’ most notable achievements was his patent for a radio telescope, used in the design for the largest of its kind at the NAIC Arecibo Observatory, in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, which is the world’s largest single-aperture tel-escope and has played a crucial role in at-mospheric and astronomical research. Mr. Doundoulakis served his country both as a courageous soldier and a bold innovator who helped propel the United States to the fore-front of aviation and space exploration. While those who knew Mr. Doundoulakis mourn his passing, we also celebrate his in-credible life and all that he achieved. It was truly an honor to serve as Mr. Doundoulakis’ representative in Congress and I extend my sincere condolences to his wife Rita Doundoulakis, his children, grandchildren and to all those whose lives he touched. f

INTRODUCTION OF THE GENDER DIVERSITY IN CORPORATE LEADERSHIP ACT 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 7, 2016 Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, today I am proud to introduce the Gender Diversity in Corporate Leadership Act, common-sense legislation to address the striking gender disparity in America’s cor-porate boardrooms. A recent GAO report found that women hold only about 16 percent of board seats at S&P 1500 companies, up from 8 percent in 1997. While this is progress, even if women com-prise half of new board members from this point forward, the report estimated it would take over 40 years to reach gender parity. My legislation would take a few simple steps to collect data to better define this disparity and encourage businesses to take steps to di-versify their boards. By requiring publicly-trad-ed companies to report the gender composi-tion of their boards, we will make it easy for investors and other organizations to evaluate board diversity. The evidence is clear, companies with di-verse leadership are better-positioned to suc-ceed. Indeed, a recent report published by MSCI found that companies with ‘‘strong fe-male leadership’’ (either above-average board representation or a female CEO and at least one female board member) generated a high-er return on equity and valuation than compa-nies lacking female leadership. That finding follows a 2014 Credit Suisse report that found companies with at least one woman on their board outperformed other companies by 5 per-cent from the start of 2012–June 2014. I am proud that the Gender Diversity in Cor-porate Leadership Act is supported by a strong coalition of business leaders like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce as well as lead-ing voices to promote workplace diversity like Catalyst and the National Women’s Law Cen-ter. I want to commend these groups for their work on these issues, as well as my original co-sponsors Reps. D

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Southeast Chap-ter of Florida Head Huggers, also known as ‘‘Caps and Wraps,’’ as they celebrate their five-year anniversary. This wonderful group of ladies meets every Thursday to knit and crochet caps, wraps and blankets, which are donated to adult and pedi-atric cancer patients who are undergoing treat-ment. Since the group began in January 2011, Caps and Wraps has donated more than 20,000 ‘‘handmade hugs’’ to local hospitals and oncology offices to ensure that cancer pa-tients are provided with warmth and comfort. As a cancer survivor, I offer my heartfelt ap-preciation to Chapter founder, Aline Zucker, for her kindness and generosity. I commend the Southeast Chapter of Florida Head Huggers for their commitment and com-passion to the cancer community.

Each year, we pay special tribute to the contributions and sacrifices made by our nation’s women. It is an honor to pay homage to outstanding women who are making a difference in my Congressional District. I would like to recog-nize a remarkable woman, Dolores Diaz- Carey, of Pasadena, California. Born in Los Angeles, Dolores attended Sa-cred Heart Elementary School and Sacred Heart High School. She received her Bachelor of Arts Degree in Spanish Literature from Holy Names University and her Master’s Degree in Education from the University of Southern California. In addition, Dolores obtained a Counseling Credential from the University of California, Los Angeles and an Administrative Credential from California State University, Los Angeles. A consummate educator, Ms. Diaz-Carey’s long career in education began as a teacher at the elementary and junior high school levels in Northern California, after which she moved to Mexico City to teach. In 1969, Dolores joined the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) where she worked for 35 years. In LAUSD’s Division of Adult and Career Edu-cation, she worked in many capacities, includ-ing as an ESL (English as a Second Lan-guage) instructor, teacher advisor, counselor, assistant principal, and principal. From 1973 to 1975, Ms. Diaz-Carey was Executive Producer of the first bilingual ESL television series for adults, ‘‘POCHTLAN’’, for which she was awarded an Emmy from the Academy of Tele-vision Arts and Sciences. From 1987 to 1998, she was Principal of Garfield Community Adult School and while there, founded a family lit-eracy program for adults and their children. In 1998, Dolores became Director of the Adult In-structional Services Unit where she was re-sponsible for overseeing the development and implementation of all the curricula for adults, including ESL, high school diploma, basic edu-cation, parenting, and nursing programs—dur-ing this time, she was also Program Director of the Community Based English Tutoring pro-gram. Dolores is a longtime member of the East Los Angeles Rotary Club, where she serves as the Rotarian advisor for a youth club, and is the incoming club president. In 2011, she received the Rotarian Foundation District Service Award.

HON. KAREN BASS

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE285 March 7, 2016 
Young Charlie showed a fighting spirit from early in life, and learned his values at his fa-ther’s knee, including when W.E.B. DuBois (no relation) would stop by his home to argue and discuss issues of race and justice. Now four generations of the DuBois family have dedi-cated themselves to lifting up working people. Charlie enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1944 and served honorably in the Pacific theatre. After returning from the war, Charlie often pro-vided security services for those speaking out and demanding social change, including Paul Robeson, Hortensia Bussi and Angela Davis. Charlie moved to Los Angeles in the 1960s, where he met and married his wife, Viki. They both worked at Kaiser Permanente for years. He and Viki were blessed with two sons. Charlie and Viki were organizers and lead-ers of Black Women United (which evolved into Black Women and Men during the 1970s). Through these organizations, they fought (among other things) for criminal justice re-form. These groups also worked to support those who were incarcerated, helping their families during the time they were in prison, and working to aid their adjustment when they returned to the community. Charlie often mentored youth in the justice movement, and he was instrumental in my own decision to pursue medical training as an effective way of seeking change and providing service to others. I would like to salute Charles Edward DuBois for his longstanding commitment to serving others and for remaining true to his principles throughout his long life.

CHRONICLING THE PRESIDENT’S UNCONSTITUTIONAL ACTIONS 
HON. KEITH J. ROTHFUS 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 7, 2016 Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, when our Founders wrote the Constitution, they had the wisdom to create a system of checks and bal-ances among the three branches of govern-ment. They knew this would limit power, protect against abuses, and promote liberty under the Constitution. The President has the right to nominate jus-tices to the Supreme Court, but the Senate has the co-equal right to consent to such an appointment. One branch has a power; another has a check. Today, with a vacancy on the Supreme Court, we have a chance to see this system of checks and balances in action. In deciding to exercise its consent to an ap-pointment to the Supreme Court, the Senate should assess whether the President has been acting consistent with the Constitution. The chart below highlights just a few of the President’s unconstitutional actions since he was reelected in 2012. July 2013: President disregards employer mandate. February 2014: President disregards em-ployer mandate again. June 2014: SCOTUS rules 9–0 President violated Appointments Clause. November 2014: President announces exec-utive amnesty. May 2015: Court of Appeals stops executive amnesty. February 2016: Stops Clean Power Plan. These actions have been frequent, re-peated, and grave. These actions have poisoned the well of de-liberation for this appointment. In that light, why shouldn’t the Senate with-hold consent? It is a game the President chose to play, and now he must face the con-sequence. SENATE COMMITTEE MEETINGS Title IV of Senate Resolution 4, agreed to by the Senate of February 4, 1977, calls for establishment of a sys-tem for a computerized schedule of all meetings and hearings of Senate com-mittees, subcommittees, joint commit-tees, and committees of conference. This title requires all such committees to notify the Office of the Senate Daily Digest—designated by the Rules Com-mittee—of the time, place and purpose of the meetings, when scheduled and any cancellations or changes in the meetings as they occur. As an additional procedure along with the computerization of this infor-mation, the Office of the Senate Daily Digest will prepare this information for printing in the Extensions of Remarks section of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD  on Monday and Wednesday of each week.
