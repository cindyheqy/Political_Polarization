CONGRATULATING MAJOR REY VALDES ON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. MARIO DIAZ-BALART 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 3, 2016 Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the retirement of Major Rey Valdes, who has served the Miami-Dade com-munity as a police officer for over thirty-one years. Major Valdes began his career as an officer, and has risen steadily through the ranks. Throughout his time in the Miami-Dade Police Department he has exhibited a passion for continued education, respect and compassion for his colleagues, and an understanding of the seriousness and importance of the profes-sion he chose. At various times during his career, Major Valdes worked with the homicide bureau, the narcotics bureau, and warrants management in several different roles throughout the de-partment. In his current position, Major Valdes is responsible for all aspects of the Commu-nications Bureau of the Miami-Dade Police Department. The Communications Bureau is the largest 911 Center in the southeastern United States, and the fourth largest in the country. Even as he is preparing to leave the depart-ment, Major Valdes is currently studying to take the test to be certified as an Anti-Money Laundering Specialist. This credential will add to his value as a Certified Fraud Examiner. He hopes to continue to work in the field of fraud examination after his retirement. Miami-Dade has been lucky to have had such an exceptional individual serving in its police force. Through the years, I have gotten to know Rey personally, as his daughter Katrina serves as my communications director, and am honored to call him a friend. I would like to extend my sincerest congratulations to Rey on his illustrious and productive career, and extend my warmest wishes to his wife Elizabeth, and children Giorey, Armani, and Katrina. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to pay tribute to Major Rey Valdes for his tremendous service to the Miami community, and I ask my col-leagues to join me in recognizing this remark-able individual.

HONORING 10,000 DEGREES 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 3, 2016 Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 10,000 Degrees in honor of its 35th anniversary. A nonprofit located in Marin County, California, 10,000 Degrees has worked to get thousands of underserved stu-dents into and through college. Founded in 1981, 10,000 Degrees has awarded approximately $56 million in scholar-ships during its three and a half decades, and has over 18,000 alumni of the program. Par-ticipants come from low-income households, and approximately 90 percent are the first in their families to attend college. Currently, the program serves 4,500 family members and students annually—nearly 90 percent of whom are people of color—and facilitates millions in scholarships and non-loan financial aid. Not only does 10,000 Degrees help pay for higher education, they are committed to pre-paring students for college success. With early college awareness training, financial aid coun-seling, and mentoring services, the organiza-tion ensures that over 80 percent of their stu-dents complete college—nearly three times the national rate of low income students, and significantly higher than both the national aver-age and the average of students from affluent families. 10,000 Degrees has been an effective orga-nization since its origin, with a wide-ranging impact that has touched thousands of lives in Marin County. Mr. Speaker, it is fitting to honor and thank 10,000 Degrees on their 35th anniversary for their impressive efforts toward making college accessible to all, and to wish them success in the decades to come. f

I inadvertently voted in the negative. In my view, every child deserves access to a quality education without fear of being ostracized, punished, or discriminated against because of their race, religion, gender, ability, or because they are LGBT. I have long been an out-spoken advocate for efforts to protect individ-uals from discrimination because of who they are or whom they love. That has not and will not change.

from Canada, the Caribbean, South Africa, Great Britain, France, Germany, and the Neth-erlands. As the very first Black Pride festival, DC Black Pride fostered the beginning of the Cen-ter for Black Equity (formerly known as the International Federation of Black Prides, Inc. (IFBP)) and the ‘‘Black Pride Movement,’’ which now consists of 40 Black Prides on four continents. The Center For Black Equity, the celebration’s organizing body, chose: ‘‘I AM U. U R ME. WE ARE PRIDE!’’ as the theme for this year’s celebration. DC Black Pride is a project of the Center For Black Equity and is coordinated by Earl D. Fowlkes, Jr. and Kenya Hutton with assistance from a volunteer advisory board, which coordi-nates this annual event and consists of An-drea Woody-Macko; Shannon Garcon; Genise Chambers-Woods; Re´ginald Shaw-Richard-son; and Gladece Knight. I ask the House to join me in welcoming all attending the 26th annual DC Black Pride celebration in Washington, D.C., and I take this opportunity to remind the celebrants that United States citizens who reside in the Dis-trict of Columbia are taxed without full voting representation in Congress.

CONGRATULATING VALLEY HOPE AT GRAPEVINE ON THEIR FIF-TEENTH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. KENNY MARCHANT 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 3, 2016 Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Valley Hope at Grapevine on their fifteenth anniversary of service in the Dal-las-Fort Worth Metroplex. Nearly fifty years ago in Norton, Kansas, Valley Hope began providing affordable treat-ment services to those within their community suffering from addiction and needing assist-ance. Since first opening in 1967, Valley Hope has grown to offer their services in seven states and provides support to thousands of individuals in need. Over the last fifteen years, Valley Hope has provided the residents of Grapevine and the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex with addiction treatment and reha-bilitative services, impacting the lives of count-less Texans and their families struggling with addiction. By providing comprehensive treat-ment services for substance use disorders, Valley Hope is able to increase the quality of life of their patients and allow them the oppor-tunity to live their lives free from the anchors of addiction. The nation’s substance abuse epidemic continues to spread throughout our cities, our communities, and our schools. I commend Valley Hope for their efforts to address this cri-sis and tackle an issue of such great impor-tance head on. Rehabilitation services such as those offered by Valley Hope provide a tre-mendous benefit to the community. Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to recognize the tireless efforts Valley Hope has made to-wards ending chemical dependency and sub-stance use disorders. I ask all of my distin-guished colleagues to join me in congratu-lating Valley Hope at Grapevine on their fif-teenth anniversary of service. f 
IN HONOR OF ELENA IZCALLI ME-DINA FOR HER RECOGNITION BY RENOWNED POET LAUREATE JUAN FELIPE HERRERA AT THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS 
HON. JUAN VARGAS 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 3, 2016 Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Elena Izcalli Medina on being honored by United States Poet Laureate Juan Felipe Herrera at the Library of Congress. The 21st Poet Laureate Consultant Juan Felipe Herrera celebrated the conclusion of the first year of his laureateship by honoring young poet Elena Izcalli Medina at the Library of Congress. Elena Izcalli is a 7th grader at-tending High Tech Middle School in Chula Vista, California. She has been writing poetry for four years. She first received praise from Herrera in 2012 for her poem ‘‘Where I am from’’ which Herrera said ‘‘contained a philo-sophical reflection about how all of us are im-permanent. It was just a solid poem where she really touched base with wisdom.’’ Herrera made an unprecedented gesture by arranging for Elena Izcalli and her family to at-tend the last lecture of his first term. Herrera presented Elena Izcalli to guests and dig-nitaries at the Library of Congress where she read her poem ‘‘One Day’’ on April 13, 2016. I would like to submit her poem. 
ONEDAY (by Elena Izcalli Medina) One day the border will come down And all the colors will flow and We will grant ALL a crown. One day police brutality will be no more And ALL will have equality no matter who you Are fighting for. One day we will ALL love each other No matter what skin what religion because we are from the same mother. One day we will treat the environment like a human being And ALL of nature Can go back to being free. One day when someone is shot Black and brown Lives will matter And ALL will stand up to the cops. One day we will have peace between coun-tries and instead of starting war we will grant each other awards One day we will find each other the same and realize we ALL go through sunshine and rain. One day we will look at women so they are not objectified But we’ll pay attention to who they are in-side and instead of calling them bossy We will take away the y. ’Cause I wonder why, why this belief is still alive. My hair flies freely in the wind Me being proud of the color of my skin I inhale clean air and exhale my worries But one worry that stays inside me is the idea that this one day might not come One day. One day we’ll all be free and proud to be Under the same sun singing songs of freedom *Last stanza borrowed from Matisyahu f HONORING 23 WORLD WAR II VET-ERANS FROM OREGON FOR THEIR HONOR FLIGHT TO THE NATION’S CAPITAL 
HON. GREG WALDEN 
OF OREGON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 3, 2016 Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recog-nize the 23 World War II veterans from Or-egon who will be visiting their memorial in Washington, D.C. through Honor Flight of Or-egon. On behalf of a grateful state and coun-try, we welcome these heroes to our nation’s capital. The veterans on this flight from Oregon are as follows: Clifford W. Anderson, Army; Ber-nard D. Brown, Army; Charles E. Brown, Army; Donald S. Doughton, Army; Wayne G. Homes, Army; Alvin W. Mohr, Army; Mikio Tamiyasu, Army; Delmar G. Wilks, Army; Wil-liam A.P. Lawrence, Army Air Forces; Robert E. Parry, Army Air Forces; John T. Reeves, Army Air Forces; Ray A. Snook, Army Air Forces; Richard L. Harriman, Merchant Ma-rines; William D. Alder, Navy; Alvin O. Brad-ford, Navy; George W. Hayes, Navy; Gorder R. Hoefer, Navy; John T. Hyer, Navy; Ray-mond M. Mader, Navy; James D. Walker, Navy; William E. Wetmore, Navy; George W. Zentgraf, Navy; and Jeanne E. Heuett, Wom-en’s Army Corps. These 23 heroes join the estimated 20,000 to 25,000 veterans who traveled to Wash-ington, D.C. from their home states in 2016, adding to the more than 150,000 veterans who have been honored through the Honor Flight Network of volunteers nationwide since 2005. I would also like to recognize the nine vol-unteers traveling on this trip who have also served our country: Eden R. Brown, Army Air Forces; Clement K. Hyer, Army; James E. Morley, Army; Theodore J. Riehl, Army; Marc R. Snook, Army; Michael Allegre, Army Air Forces; George W. Hyes, Marine Corps; and William M. Lawrence, Navy. These brave men and women put their lives on the line for our freedom, and they continue their dedication to service by contributing to this great cause and honoring those that came before them. Mr. Speaker, each of us is humbled by the courage of these brave Americans who put themselves in harm’s way for our country and way of life. As a nation, we can never fully repay the debt of gratitude owed to them for their honor, commitment, and sacrifice in de-fense of the freedoms we have today. My colleagues, please join me in thanking these veterans and the volunteers of Honor Flight of Oregon for their exemplary dedication and service to this great country.

RECOGNIZING THE LEADERSHIP AND DEDICATION OF DR. RON & MARY THOMAS TO THE UNIVER-SITY OF PUGET SOUND AND THE GREATER TACOMA COMMUNITY 
HON. DEREK KILMER 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 3, 2016 Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Ron & Mary Thomas, who this spring will complete their thirteenth and final year at the University of Puget Sound in Ta-coma, WA. Dr. Thomas has served as the University’s thirteenth President since 2003 and has left a historic mark on this already prestigious institution of higher education. The University of Puget Sound is a more di-verse, inclusive, comprehensive, accessible, and transformational place because of their leadership. Thousands of students, faculty, staff, and community members have been positively impacted by their presence in this community. Prior to arriving at Puget Sound, Dr. Thom-as served as a faculty member at the Univer-sity of Chicago, Harvard University, and Trinity College. His career in higher education is decorated with numerous recognitions for con-tributions in writing, student life, and institu-tional leadership. With the arrival of Ron and Mary Thomas to Tacoma in the summer of 2003, the University of Puget Sound began its historic growth and transformation. Mr. Speaker, for the past thirteen years, Dr. Thomas has led and overseen a renewal of the already beautiful University of Puget Sound campus. To complement the already stunning views of Mt. Rainier and towering Douglas fir trees, Dr. Thomas and his staff di-rected over $200 million in campus capital im-provements. These projects include a new academic science complex, upgrades in resi-dential facilities, and athletic and recreational centers to bolster student life. Thankfully, Dr. Thomas and his team ensured that these projects were encompassed into a thoughtful and comprehensive campus master plan. In addition to physical improvements on campus, Dr. Thomas and his wife Mary will forever be remembered in Tacoma for their dedication to the community and for success-fully following through on their vision to con-nect the Puget Sound campus to the commu-nity that surrounds it. Since their arrival, Ron and Mary have been generous with their time and resources in supporting the civic and cul-tural institutions of Tacoma. Mr. Speaker, during his tenure at UPS, Dr. Thomas helped create the ‘‘Tacoma Public Schools Commitment,’’ which created a clear pathway for local students to attend this pri-vate, liberal-arts education at an affordable price. Given the community’s diversity and challenges in paying for higher education, this initiative will help grow future generations of engaged and educated citizens of Tacoma. Mr. Speaker, I join the larger Tacoma com-munities in expressing my gratitude today in the United States Congress for Dr. Ron and Mary Thomas for their thirteen years of leader-ship and dedication. As the proud Representa-tive for Tacoma, WA in the House of Rep-resentatives, I offer my best wishes on their future adventures together.

OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 3, 2016 Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the band Cheap Trick on their in-duction into the Rock n’ Roll Hall of Fame. Cheap Trick is rightfully being honored by this iconic institution for their outstanding contribu-tions to the music industry. Cheap Trick, from our Congressional District in Rockford, Illinois, has performed over 5,000 times in the last four decades, sold over 20 million records and has 40 gold and platinum recording awards. They have also been recog-nized by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences for their incredible contribu-tions to music and pop culture. Cheap Trick has been a staple of rock and roll for the past four decades, and their music has provided inspiration for young musicians for years and for decades to come. Despite their demanding tour schedule, Cheap Trick has always remembered their roots in Rock-ford and has always found time to perform in their hometown. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Cheap Trick for their contributions to the rock and roll community, and for always making Rockford proud. I congratulate them again on their well- earned induction into the Rock n’ Roll Hall of Fame and wish them the best of luck in their future endeavors.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 3, 2016 Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Horizon Community Middle School for their participation at the White House Science Fair and for their recognition as a Samsung Solve for Tomorrow National Winner. A classroom of 40 seventh and eighth grad-ers designed and produced a fully functioning prosthetic limb for local disabled Marine Corps veteran, Kyle Kelly. The limb was designed to help Kyle live a more active lifestyle, even al-lowing him to hike, ski, and skateboard com-fortably. Three students from the Horizon group, Simon-Peter Frimpong, Grayson Fast, and Maya Maxfield-Villard presented this project to President Obama at the annual White House Science Fair on April 13th. It’s inspiring to see students taking an inter-est in solving real-world problems through STEM while also helping veterans in need. These student innovators serve as an exam-ple for students throughout Colorado and the United States. I would like to extend my sincere congratu-lations to the students and teachers of Horizon Community Middle School for all of your hard work on this important cause. PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON.

IN RECOGNITION OF POLISH DAY AT THE CONNECTICUT STATE CAPITOL 
HON. ELIZABETH H. ESTY

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, May 3, 2016 Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize today’s Polish Day celebration at the Con-necticut State Capitol, and to congratulate the Polish people in celebrating the 225th anniver-sary of Europe’s oldest written constitution. Poland adopted the first written constitution in Europe on May 3, 1791. With the leadership of King Stanislaw August, Poland’s constitu-tion established many of the same principles of freedom and democracy ratified in the United States, like freedom of religion, the separation of powers, and political equality. I am proud to represent New Britain, Con-necticut, which has more residents of Polish descent than any other community in our great state. Polish-Americans have made invaluable contributions to the social, cultural, and eco-nomic life and history of communities in cen-tral and northwest Connecticut, and through-out our great state. As a member of the Congressional Caucus on Poland, I am committed to strengthening the bilateral relationship between Poland and the United States. Those bonds of friendship date back centuries, and have only grown stronger through solidarity in the Cold War and continued collaboration to expand eco-nomic opportunity and promote security in the region and around the world. So Mr. Speaker, on this Polish Constitution Day, it is my privilege to join neighbors across Connecticut and the entire United States in celebrating the 225th anniversary of Poland’s first constitution. I know that this House joins me in honoring the many contributions of the people of Poland and those of Polish descent in developing democracy and furthering the cause of freedom throughout the world.

and efficiency of the Federal prison system for pregnant offenders, by establishing a pilot pro-gram of critical-stage, developmental nurseries in Federal prisons for children born to inmates. It is time that our nation recognizes a long- persistent need to break the cycle of generational, institutional incarceration amongst mothers convicted of non-violent crimes and the children they birth behind pris-on bars. H.R. 5130, the ‘‘SIMARRA Act of 2016,’’ gives those infants born to incarcerated moth-ers a chance to succeed in life. ‘‘SIMARRA’’ is not merely yet another sec-ond chance program, demanding leniency from the criminal justice system. Instead, H.R. 5130 asks our national crimi-nal justice system what it can do for those young Americans born and relegated to a life of nearly impossible odds of survival. ‘‘SIMARRA’’ provides that first chance—a first chance for American infants—that many of their mothers, born themselves to mothers behind bars, never received. We have a unique opportunity to nurture in-fants with the ‘‘SIMARRA Act of 2016,’’ pro-viding them a true head start. A 2015 article in the National, estimated that at least 10,000 babies are born to American prisoners annually. This issue is affecting more children and women than we realize. The New York Times reported that approxi-mately 25 percent of incarcerated women are pregnant, carrying children, on admission to prison, or gave birth during the previous year, still requiring special medical and nutritional resources for the health of their infants, as well as themselves. Current Federal Bureau of Prison policy dic-tates that, in most cases, incarcerated moth-ers relinquish their children immediately after giving birth, handing them over to friends or family members, and most often to the foster care system. Eleven percent of those children separated from incarcerated mothers and placed into fos-ter care experienced at least two changes in caregivers during the period of the mother’s incarceration; and sometimes these mothers, even when they have short prison sentences, never see their child again—forever lost to the foster-care system. This practice is devastating the wellness and safety of American infants, denying them the ability to lactate, bond and thrive with their mother’s host body, as healthy infants require during the critical stage of development. Children born to mothers in prison and re-moved to social services programs also expe-rience parental separation, and often illicit sub-stance use, mental illness, and domestic vio-lence, all of which are adverse childhood ex-periences associated with morbidity and pre-mature mortality. Neo-natal health science tells us that posi-tive social interactions in a child’s early years are considered critical to the development of healthy social relationships and personality growth. Studies indicate that, upon entering early childhood educational programs, children born to incarcerated women are at higher risk of behavioral health problems than their peers. It should not surprise anyone familiar with the juvenile criminal justice system that chil-dren of incarcerated women are more likely to be caught up in the criminal justice system themselves, deflating the upward trajectory of their life’s potential. The writing is on the wall: there is a posi-tive, statistically significant correlation between the total incarceration rate and the infant mor-tality. Studies reveal that newborn babies sepa-rated from their mothers, due to confinement, suffer health and psychological complications such as weakened attachment, bonding and abandonment at exponentially compounded rates. Ten states currently operate successful similar programs and studies have shown that 71 percent of the babies served attained at-tachment goals with their inmate-mothers while in a prison nursery setting, a percentage greater than that reported by most low-risk, community children whose mothers had no criminal history or involvement. Nursery participants also had a lower recidi-vism rate compared to non-participating moth-ers. In spite of the fact that the mothers of most of these children had not internalized secure attachment in their own childhoods, 71 percent of the babies achieved secure attachment with their own mothers while in the prison nursery setting. According to the Centers for Disease Con-trol and Prevention, the national infant mor-tality rate is 5.96 deaths per 1,000 births, in-creasing to 7.9 infant deaths per 1,000 live births for Hispanic inmates, and 14.3 infant deaths per 1,000 live births among African American inmates. Other studies have documented that paren-tal incarceration elevates the risk of early in-fant death by 29.6 percent for the average in-fant, concentrating effects during the post-neo-natal period. The data demonstrates that incarceration compounds women’s depression and the risk of contracting infectious or chronic stress-re-lated illnesses, which may harm infant health through numerous mechanisms also increas-ing infant mortality rates. The ‘‘SIMARRA Act’’ will decrease unprecedentedly high current infant mortality rates and allow inmate mothers to provide healthy and safe gestation to protect their un-born, as well as bond with infants during their first 30 months of life, designated by the CDC as one of the most critical stages of develop-ment. Further, H.R. 5130 simultaneously imple-ments risk and needs assessments, risk re-duction incentives, and risk and recidivism re-duction programs to address the healthcare, safety and rehabilitative needs of new-mother- inmates as they serve their sentence. Mass incarceration not only fosters inequal-ity but also diminishes a child’s chances of surviving its first year of life, which combined together can further hinder a child’s life chances. The most likely long-term mechanism through which imprisonment affects infant mortality is through its effects on maternal health. Mr. Speaker, as a nation we do not have a person to waste, so we must embrace prac-tices that nurture the bonds between mother and child. The ‘‘SIMARRA Act’’ will provide resources and programming to ensure a healthy and safe environment for these children during their critical stages of development. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in sponsoring and supporting H.R. 5130, the ‘‘Stop Infant Mortality and Recidivism Re-duction Act of 2016’’ or the ‘‘SIMARRA Act.’’
