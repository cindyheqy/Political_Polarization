OBAMACARE 
Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is a hard 
thing to admit you are wrong. It is al-ways very difficult. It is not very pleas-ing to look back and say to yourself: Oh, I wish I wasn’t so far off; I was way off. But as public servants, we have to ac-
cept reality, regardless of where we may have stood or what we may have said in the past. 
Unfortunately, Republicans in Con-
gress are trying their utmost to escape the reality that ObamaCare is a smash-ing success. 
Just consider a few of the facts—and 
these are only a few of them: 16.4 mil-lion Americans now have quality health coverage, many for the first time in decades, many for the first time in their lives. 
Since 2013, the United States has 
seen the largest decline in the unin-sured rate—ever. Nine in ten Ameri-cans have health insurance. In the last 18 months, the uninsured rate for non-elderly adults has fallen by 35 percent. Health care costs have grown at their slowest rate in 50 years. 
Since 2011, the number of preventable 
deaths at hospitals and care centers has dropped by 50,000. That is 50,000 lives—50,000 people are alive today who wouldn’t have been but for ObamaCare, and ObamaCare enrollees are over-whelmingly satisfied with their cov-erage. 
Those are the facts. No matter how 
hard my Republican colleagues try, they cannot wish those numbers away. All of the doomsday reports are wrong. 
I understand that many Senate Re-
publicans have worked hard to make their opposition to ObamaCare their legacy. 
In June of 2009, the Republican lead-
er—the majority leader—was on the Senate floor decrying health care re-form more than 3 months before the bill even passed. His mind was made up before he even saw the bill. 
And so it has been with too many 
other Republicans in this body, and certainly in the other body where they voted—I lost track of it—65 times to repeal it. Each time it has been a colos-sal flop. 
The junior Senator from Wyoming, 
for example, has been relentless in his condemnation of ObamaCare. He comes 
to the floor all the time with his charts and everything, but he avoids the facts. He has been relentless in his con-demnation of ObamaCare—before and after the bill was passed. But he is wrong. I don’t say so, the facts say so. 
For example, Paul Krugman’s piece 
in the New York Times today effec-tively lays out the options congres-sional Republicans have with respect to ObamaCare. Remember, this isn’t some high school teacher talking about the merits of ObamaCare, it is a Nobel laureate in economics. 
This is what he said today, and I 
quote part of what he said—simply put, Republicans were wrong on ObamaCare. In this body, it is under-standable for a Senator to be dead wrong on some piece of policy from time to time. It happens. But what is not understandable and what is not ac-ceptable is for the entire Republican Party to double down on its opposition after they have already been proven wrong. It says a lot about their inabil-ity to govern and, quite frankly, their grasp on reality—that Republicans refuse to acknowledge facts. 
That is a reality. 
I ask unanimous consent to have 
printed in the R
ECORD the full piece 
from the New York Times written by Paul Krugman. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows: 
[From the New York Times, Apr. 27, 2015] 
NOBODY SAIDTHAT 
(By Paul Krugman) 
Imagine yourself as a regular commentator 
on public affairs—maybe a paid pundit, maybe a supposed expert in some area, maybe just an opinionated billionaire. You weigh in on a major policy initiative that’s about to happen, making strong predictions of disaster. The Obama stimulus, you de-clare, will cause soaring interest rates; the Fed’s bond purchases will ‘‘debase the dol-lar’’ and cause high inflation; the Affordable Care Act will collapse in a vicious circle of declining enrollment and surging costs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2420 April 27, 2015 
But nothing you predicted actually comes 
to pass. What do you do? 
You might admit that you were wrong, and 
try to figure out why. But almost nobody does that; we live in an age of unacknowledged error. 
Alternatively, you might insist that sin-
ister forces are covering up the grim reality. Quite a few well-known pundits are, or at some point were, ‘‘inflation truthers,’’ claim-ing that the government is lying about the pace of price increases. There have also been many prominent Obamacare truthers declar-ing that the White House is cooking the books, that the policies are worthless, and so on. 
Finally, there’s a third option: You can 
pretend that you didn’t make the predictions you did. I see that a lot when it comes to people who issued dire warnings about inter-est rates and inflation, and now claim that they did no such thing. Where I’m seeing it most, however, is on the health care front. Obamacare is working better than even its supporters expected—but its enemies say that the good news proves nothing, because nobody predicted anything different. 
Go back to 2013, before reform went fully 
into effect, or early 2014, before the numbers on first-year enrollment came in. What were Obamacare’s opponents predicting? The an-swer is, utter disaster. Americans, declared a May 2013 report from a House committee, were about to face a devastating ‘‘rate shock,’’ with premiums almost doubling on average. 
And it would only get worse: At the begin-
ning of 2014 the right’s favored experts—or maybe that should be ‘‘experts’’—were warn-ing about a ‘‘death spiral’’ in which only the sickest citizens would sign up, causing pre-miums to soar even higher and many people to drop out of the program. 
What about the overall effect on insurance 
coverage? Several months into 2014 many leading Republicans—including John Boeh-ner, the speaker of the House—were pre-dicting that more people would lose coverage than gain it. And everyone on the right was predicting that the law would cost far more than projected, adding hundreds of billions if not trillions to budget deficits. 
What actually happened? There was no 
rate shock: average premiums in 2014 were about 16 percent lower than projected. There is no death spiral: On average, premiums for 2015 are between 2 and 4 percent higher than in 2014, which is a much slower rate of in-crease than the historical norm. The number of Americans without health insurance has fallen by around 15 million, and would have fallen substantially more if so many Repub-lican-controlled states weren’t blocking the expansion of Medicaid. And the overall cost of the program is coming in well below ex-pectations. 
One more thing: You sometimes hear com-
plaints about the alleged poor quality of the policies offered to newly insured families. But a new survey by J. D. Power, the market research company, finds that the newly en-rolled are very satisfied with their cov-erage—more satisfied than the average per-son with conventional, non-Obamacare in-surance. 
This is what policy success looks like, and 
it should have the critics engaged in soul- searching about why they got it so wrong. But no. 
Instead, the new line—exemplified by, but 
not unique to, a recent op-ed article by the hedge-fund manager Cliff Asness—is that there’s nothing to see here: ‘‘That more peo-ple would be insured was never in dispute.’’ Never, I guess, except in everything ever said by anyone in a position of influence on the American right. Oh, and all the good news on costs is just a coincidence. It’s both easy and entirely appropriate to 
ridicule this kind of thing. But there are some serious stakes here, and they go be-yond the issue of health reform, important as it is. 
You see, in a polarized political environ-
ment, policy debates always involve more than just the specific issue on the table. They are also clashes of world views. Pre-dictions of debt disaster, a debased dollar, and Obama death spirals reflect the same ideology, and the utter failure of these pre-dictions should inspire major doubts about that ideology. 
And there’s also a moral issue involved. 
Refusing to accept responsibility for past er-rors is a serious character flaw in one’s pri-vate life. It rises to the level of real wrong-doing when policies that affect millions of lives are at stake.

RELIGIOUS FREEDOM  
Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, Congress 
unanimously passed the International Religious Freedom Act in 1989 with a 98-to-0 vote in this body for that legis-lation, including 19 Senators still serv-ing today—11 Republicans and 8 Demo-crats. We asserted that religious free-dom ‘‘undergirds the very origin and existence of the United States.’’ Yet, religious freedom today is under attack across the country. 
Political activists are attacking reli-
gious freedom as the enemy of equal-ity, claiming that laws protecting reli-gious freedom are designed to enshrine discrimination in State law. This effort is misinformed, it is misguided, and it is misleading. It will serve only to harm religious freedom and to demon-ize religious people, many of whom 
would be allies in the effort to promote equality. 
The attack on religious freedom mis-
understands the history and impor-tance of religious freedom in America. That story began more than 400 years ago, as one religious community after another came to these shores so they could freely live their faith. As far 
back as December 1657, residents of the community known today as Flushing, NY, signed a petition called the Flush-ing Remonstrance. This petition pro-tested a ban on certain religious prac-tices that prevented the Quakers from worshipping. The petition signers stat-ed that they would let everyone decide for themselves how to worship. 
One hundred twenty years later, the 
original States and the Federal Gov-ernment specifically protected reli-gious freedom in their Constitutions. Indeed, the phrase America’s Founders chose for the first individual right list-ed in the First Amendment—the free exercise of religion—is very important. The free exercise clause is not limited to particular exercises of religion or to the exercise of religion by certain par-ties but instead protects the free exer-cise of religion itself. James Madison wrote in 1758 that exercising religion according to conviction and conscience is an inalienable right. Two hundred years later, Supreme Court Justice Ar-thur Goldberg declared that ‘‘to the Founding Fathers, freedom of religion was regarded to be preeminent among fundamental rights.’’ 
This belief in the special importance 
and preeminent status of religious free-dom did not end with America’s found-ing generation. In his famous 1941 State of the Union Address, President Franklin D. Roosevelt asserted that ‘‘the right of every person to worship God in his own way’’ is an essential human freedom. Just 4 years later, after the end of World War II, the United States signed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This crucial document includes religious freedom as one of the inalienable rights universal to all members of the human family. 
Our last several Presidents have 
issued annual proclamations declaring January 16 Religious Freedom Day. This date marks the anniversary of the Virginia General Assembly’s adoption of the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. In this year’s proclamation, President Obama said that religious freedom is a fundamental liberty and defined religious freedom as the right of every person to live and practice their faith how they choose. In pre-vious years, President Obama has called religious freedom a universal and natural human right and an essen-tial part of human dignity. President George W. Bush similarly declared that no human freedom is more funda-mental than the right to freely prac-tice one’s religious beliefs. President Clinton said that religious freedom is a fundamental human right, a core value

of our democracy, and essential to our 
dignity as human beings. 
I want my colleagues to appreciate 
how robust religious freedom has his-torically been in our country. Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that religious freedom includes ‘‘freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest . . . religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.’’ 
In America, religious freedom has al-
ways included freedom in both belief and behavior, in private and in public, individually and collectively. Today’s attacks on religious freedom know none of this. Instead, they dismiss reli-gious freedom as a sham, as little more than an excuse for mean-spirited peo-ple who want to discriminate. Today’s opponents of religious freedom laws ei-ther do not know or do not care that religious freedom is an integral part of the origin, the identity, and the very life of our Nation. 
They are also clearly misinformed 
about how, even in America, the re-ality of religious freedom has not al-ways matched the promise of religious freedom. The truth is that government does many things that compromise, burden, and even prohibit the exercise of religion. The Flushing Remon-strance was necessary because commu-nity leaders allowed religious freedom for some but not for others. Govern-ment has even sometimes passed laws explicitly designed to limit or stamp out particular religious practices or re-ligious communities. 
More often, government undermines 
and restricts the exercise of religion through indirect impact. General laws that on their face do not explicitly tar-get religion can nonetheless have a profound impact when applied to par-ticular religious practices. Zoning ordi-nances may restrict where churches can meet, whether they may expand their meeting place, and what services they may offer. Religious institutions may be forced to hire individuals who do not share their faith. Regulations may prohibit individuals from wearing items required by their faith or require employees to work on their Sabbath. 
Government at all levels—Federal, 
State, and local—is becoming ever more intrusive in virtually every facet of life. Unless government is mindful of its impact on religious practices, gov-ernment will become increasingly in-trusive in matters of religion as well. 
The attack on religious freedom is 
also misinformed about how important religious liberty laws are to protecting the exercise of religion. 
Prior to 1990, for more than a century 
the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the free exercise clause had gradually moved toward broader application and stronger protection. In the 19th cen-tury, for example, the Court said that the First Amendment protected reli-gious belief but not religious conduct, even though the First Amendment makes no such distinction. The Court subsequently adopted a more unified 
view of religious practice and set a standard that made it difficult for gov-ernment to interfere with either belief or conduct. 
In 1981, the Supreme Court made 
clear that government ‘‘may justify an inroad on religious liberty by showing it is the least restrictive means of achieving some compelling state inter-est.’’ This standard was important for two reasons. First, it reflected the gen-eral importance of religious freedom in our country. Second, it applied to both religious conduct and religious belief and protected against both direct and indirect government burdens and re-strictions. 
In a 1990 case entitled ‘‘Employment 
Division v. Smith,’’ the Supreme Court regrettably reversed course. Under the Court’s new interpretation of the First Amendment, as set forth in Smith, the free exercise clause applies only when government directly burdens religion with a law targeted at religious prac-tice. The clause provides no protection at all when government burdens reli-gion indirectly through a generally ap-plicable law or regulation. Before the Smith decision, it had been difficult but not impossible for government to interfere with the exercise of religion. Government had to show that a law or regulation burdening religion furthered a compelling State interest and was the least restrictive means of achiev-ing that interest. I might add, under the Court’s new Smith standard, how-ever, government can make religious practice not only difficult but even im-possible. Provided government does not specifically target religion for disfavor, it can pass all sorts of laws that inter-fere with worship, practice, or belief. 
It would be hard to overstate the im-
pact of Smith. In 1992, the Congres-sional Research Service found that as a result of Smith, ‘‘free exercise claims have become markedly unsuccessful.’’ Remember that the government has its biggest impact on religion not through direct suppression but, rather, by indi-rect restriction—by disregarding reli-gious practice as something needing special attention. Under Smith, gov-ernment can do exactly what the First Amendment forbids and prohibit the free exercise of religion so long as it does so through generally applicable laws rather than laws targeted at spe-cific groups. 
Congress responded to Smith by en-
acting the Religious Freedom Restora-tion Act, or RFRA. I had a lot to do with that. RFRA’s standard mirrored what the Supreme Court had only a few years earlier said the First Amendment required—namely, that government may impose a substantial burden on the exercise of religion only if it is the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling government purpose. 
RFRA does not automatically pro-
tect any specific exercise of religion, nor does it automatically prohibit any specific government action that bur-dens religion. RFRA sets a standard that requires balancing government ac-
tion against religious freedom and puts a thumb on the scale in favor of reli-gious freedom. RFRA leaves it to the courts, in individual cases based on real facts, to determine whether a par-ticular exercise of religion or a par-ticular governmental action is more important. 
In 1997, the Supreme Court held in 
City of Boerne v. Flores that RFRA ap-plies only to the Federal Government. This meant that once again religious practice was vulnerable to virtually any restriction, regulation, or prohibi-tion by State or local government. States responded to the Flores decision just as Congress had responded to the Smith decision: They immediately began enacting State religious restora-tion acts that set the same standard for State and local governments that the Federal statute still imposes on the Federal Government, the Federal stat-ute called the Religious Freedom Res-toration Act. These State RFRAs differ 
in a few minor ways from the Federal RFRA but are identical to the Federal RFRA in the core provision that really matters—the standard that govern-ment must satisfy in order to burden religious exercise. Under all of these statutes, government action that bur-dens religion must be the least restric-tive means of achieving a compelling government purpose. 
I want my colleagues to understand 
two things about these religious free-dom laws: First, States are enacting State-level Religious Freedom Restora-tion Acts for the same reason Congress did. Without such laws, every exercise of religion is vulnerable to restriction or even prohibition by government. Second, State versions of RFRA oper-ate the same way the Federal statute does. They set a standard and then leave that standard for courts to apply in individual cases with real facts. In every case, the party claiming RFRA protection must show that government action imposes a substantial burden on his or her exercise of religion, and the government must show that this bur-den is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling government interest. Without this protection, gov-ernment action will trump religious practice in almost every case. With this protection, government action will have to accommodate religious prac-tice in at least some cases. 
Those attacking religious freedom 
today are completely misinformed about why these laws are passed and how they work to protect religious freedom. They want people to believe that RFRA was passed to provide cover for discrimination masquerading as re-ligious practice and to therefore oppose efforts to pass or strengthen State- level RFRAs. That account is complete fiction. RFRA was passed so that the fundamental inalienable right to prac-tice religion can have at least some protection. 
What would happen if we treated the 
free speech clause of the First Amend-ment the way these activists treat the

free exercise clause of the First 
Amendment? No one would be pro-tected against government restrictions on speech because a few people might say things the rest of us don’t like. 
In addition to being misinformed 
about religious freedom in America and how the Religious Freedom Res-toration Act protects it, the attack on religious freedom today is misguided because discrimination—not religious freedom—is the real problem. 
I am sure my colleagues have heard 
the sound bite that RFRA legalizes dis-crimination. NBC News, for example, reported last year that the Arizona RFRA ‘‘would have permitted busi-nesses in the state to deny service to gays and lesbians for religious beliefs.’’ 
I explained how RFRA works to 
make crystal clear that this claim is false. Neither the Federal Government nor any State RFRA legalizes, permits or prohibits anything. RFRA sets a standard that government must meet when its actions burden the exercise of religion. Courts apply that standard in individual cases based on real facts to decide whether the religious practice or the government action is more im-portant. 
I need to make one more important 
distinction before looking at another reason why this claim is false. Those attacking religious freedom today use a very broad brush when raising the specter that businesses will ‘‘deny serv-ice.’’ They apparently want us to be-lieve that businesses everywhere are intent on turning away customers, on not doing business with certain people. That not only makes no sense, but it just plain is not true. 
Instead, the controversy exists only 
with regard to a few businesses that supply particular goods or services for weddings. A small number of business owners apparently feel that, while they gladly serve the general public and pro-vide goods and services to all types of customers, providing certain specific goods or services for a same-sex wed-ding would amount to supporting or endorsing something inconsistent with their religious beliefs. Think what you want about those business owners, I want my colleagues to know that RFRA does not protect their decision to refuse service today. 
Here is what has to happen for a case 
pitting RFRA against a claim discrimi-nation to exist. The particular State where the business is located must have a law prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in places of public accommo-dation such as businesses. The State must also have not only a Religious Freedom Restoration Act but one that applies between private parties. The business would have to violate the antidiscrimination law and, if the busi-ness were sued, argue that the anti-discrimination law imposed a substan-tial burden on the exercise of religion. Only then would a judge decide wheth-er—in that case based on its specific facts—the antidiscrimination law or the business owner’s religious beliefs 
were more important. 
Do you see why the claim that 
RFRA, by itself, legalizes discrimina-tion is absolutely, completely false? Not only does RFRA not legalize any-thing, the situation in which RFRA would even be involved does not exist anywhere in America today. Right now, according to the Human Rights Campaign, 17 States have the necessary antidiscrimination law, and only 4 of those 17 have a Religious Freedom Res-toration Act. And of those four, none has a RFRA that applies to lawsuits between private parties. In other words, the number of States today in which a business could look to RFRA to justify discrimination is precisely zero. 
Moreover, the current controversy, 
misinformed and misguided as it is, has no doubt diminished the likelihood that States with antidiscrimination laws will now enact religious freedom laws. Discrimination, not religious freedom, is the real problem. Despite what the activists want everyone to be-lieve, Americans practice religion every day in innumerable ways that have nothing whatsoever to do with anyone’s sexual orientation or gender identity. In the very few situations in which religious freedom and discrimi-nation might overlap, RFRA would ac-tually be the way to sort out the con-flict—the mechanism to balance these competing interests. Even though the exercise of religion is a fundamental and inalienable right, it is not abso-lute. Many courts have found that gov-ernment has a compelling interest in prohibiting discrimination. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that an excellent analysis of this point by David Rivkin and Professor Elizabeth Price Foley that appeared in the Wall Street Journal be printed in the R
ECORD following my remarks. 
Here is the bottom line. The situa-
tion that activists want everyone to believe is sweeping the country cannot exist anywhere in America today. If the day ever comes when that situation does arise, many applying RFRA would place freedom from discrimination over freedom of religion by a wide margin. 
The attack on religious freedom 
today is not only misinformed about religion freedom in America and how laws such as RFRA protect that free-dom, it is not only misguided in pre-senting religious freedom rather than discrimination as the real problem and RFRA as the culprit, but it is also mis-leading in broadly painting religious people as mean-spirited bigots. That is wrong. That is just plain wrong. 
It is also unfortunate because many 
Americans believe in both equality and religious freedom and could be allies in seeking to maximize both. I voted for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act last Congress after working with Senators on both sides of the aisle to strengthen its provisions protecting re-ligious freedom. Earlier this year, the Utah State Legislature passed and Governor Gary Herbert signed a law 
prohibiting discrimination in employ-ment and housing while also protecting religious freedom. 
How did we go from religious freedom 
being a fundamental and inalienable right to religious freedom laws being attacked as un-American? How did we go from religious freedom being an es-sential human right that undergirds our Nation’s very existence to activists calling laws that protect religious free-dom dangerous and even contemp-tuous? 
Those attacking laws that protect re-
ligious freedom would deny any legal protections for anyone to exercise reli-gion in any way today because a few people might someday attempt to exer-cise their religion in a way that the courts would likely reject. This is a misinformed, misguided, and mis-leading campaign that will only dam-age religious freedom and demonize many who would work toward maxi-mizing both equality and freedom for all Americans. 
I was the prime sponsor in the Senate 
of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. I went to Senator Kennedy. He was a friend, and we joined on many pieces of legislation that were in the best interests of everybody in America. At first, he said: I am not joining on that bill. Then I kept talking to him about it and how important it was. Fi-nally, he said: Yes, I am going to be a prime cosponsor on that bill. There are many other prime cosponsors on that bill. 
When that bill was signed on the 
South Lawn of the White House by President Clinton, one of the most proud people on Earth on that signing day happened to be Ted Kennedy, who knew that he had done right, who knew that it was right to protect the Reli-gious Freedom Restoration Act. And I know it is right. That is one reason we 
fought so hard for it, and it passed 97 to 3, if I recall it correctly—almost unani-mously—and unanimously in the House, as far as I know. 
It is time for us to wake up and real-
ize that religious freedom is under at-tack in this country. It is under attack because people don’t understand the Constitution and people don’t give a darn about the Constitution. It is under attack because some groups think they can get ahead by attacking religious freedom. Frankly, we ought to decry that, and we all need to stand up for the Religious Freedom Restora-tion Act, which upholds the first basic law of freedom in our Bill of Rights.

RFRAs, have regrettably pitted religious 
freedom against gay rights. Critics claim the laws provide a license to discriminate against lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT) individuals. But this criticism shouldn’t be aimed at the religious-freedom laws, which don’t license discrimination based on sexual orientation or anything else. 
Those wanting to advance LGBT rights 
should focus on enacting laws that bar dis-crimination. If there is a legal ‘‘license’’ to discriminate based on sexual orientation, it is because few jurisdictions today provide protection against such discrimination, or because the Constitution may immunize such behavior in certain circumstances. 
There is no federal law prohibiting private 
discrimination based on sexual orientation. An executive order by President Obama in 2014 bans such discrimination only for fed-eral workers and contractors. About 20 states and some municipalities prohibit sex-ual-orientation discrimination in workplaces and public accommodations. But the major-ity of states still don’t proscribe discrimina-tion based on sexual orientation, though dis-crimination based on race, gender, ethnicity or national origin is banned. 
The federal Religious Freedom Restoration 
Act was passed by overwhelming bipartisan majorities and signed by President Clinton in 1993. It represented a backlash against the Supreme Court’s 1990 decision in Employ-ment Division v. Smith. That decision held that the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause doesn’t allow a religious exemption from laws of general applicability—e.g., com-pulsory military service, or prohibitions on drug use or animal cruelty—even if those laws substantially burden religious exercise. 
The federal RFRA law supplanted Smith, 
declaring that the government could sub-stantially burden religious exercise only upon proving a ‘‘compelling’’ government in-terest for doing so, and using only the ‘‘least restrictive means’’ of furthering that inter-est. The Supreme Court, for example, re-cently affirmed that the federal RFRA al-lowed Hobby Lobby, a corporation closely held by religious owners, to refuse participa-tion in ObamaCare’s contraceptive mandate, which would have required the company to provide contraceptives that may destroy an already-fertilized egg. 
Because the federal RFRA applies only to 
federal actions, 20 states have passed their own religious-freedom laws designed to pro-vide the same protection against state-im-posed religious burdens. Another 11 states have implemented similar protections through court decisions, based on state con-stitutions. 
So why have the latest religious-freedom 
laws been so controversial? RFRA has be-come a political focal point for pent-up anger over the paucity of legal protections against LGBT discrimination. A specific con-troversy is over the application of such laws to lawsuits between private parties. 
Indiana’s RFRA applies ‘‘regardless of 
whether the state or any other governmental entity is a party to the proceeding.’’ Federal RFRA doesn’t clearly apply to such private disputes, and federal courts are divided on whether it should. Arkansas adopted lan-guage identical to the federal RFRA. 
Applying religious-freedom laws to private 
disputes has stirred fears that businesses will be able to defend discriminatory behav-ior when LGBT individuals sue them. This fear is greatly overblown. First, in states or localities where there is no law banning sex-ual-orientation discrimination, individuals and businesses are allowed to discriminate, with or without a RFRA. 
Second, where it’s illegal to discriminate, 
a religious-freedom defense requires proving that the antidiscrimination statute ‘‘sub-stantially burdens’’ religion. Third, even if it does, courts routinely con-
clude that preventing discrimination is a compelling interest, so the LGBT plaintiff wins. RFRA thus doesn’t change outcomes— only laws banning sexual-orientation dis-crimination will. 
Such laws won’t eliminate all legal ques-
tions, however. Those engaged in activities with a strong expressive component—e.g., of-ficiating at a wedding—may claim that their First Amendment free-speech or association rights trump antidiscrimination statutes. Some of these claims may prove successful. 
Moreover, state and federal law allows in-
dividuals to refuse to provide certain serv-ices, such as abortions, based on moral objec-tions. Similar conscience-based protections may eventually be demanded to accommo-date moral objections to participation in same-sex weddings by the likes of wedding planners, photographers or bakers. 
Americans have generally settled on the 
proper reach of statutes prohibiting race, gender, ethnicity or national origin-based discrimination by banning it in places of em-ployment or public accommodation. With this consensus in mind, states and the fed-eral government should consider statutes prohibiting in similar circumstances sexual- orientation discrimination. 
Religious-freedom laws merely recognizing 
religious liberty—a centerpiece of liberal so-ciety—would then be more likely to become as universally accepted as they were in the 1990s.

TAKATA AIRBAGS  
Mr. President, I am going to speak on 
a different subject today. It is not as pleasant as the remarks I addressed to the chairman, and it is on a completely different subject matter. It is about the defective airbags manufactured by the Takata Corporation which are explod-ing in people’s faces and our collective effort to get them out of cars. 
Instead of saving a life, these air-
bags—when they explode—either maim or kill because of the defective con-struction. When the airbag explodes, metal is coming out of the airbag like shrapnel and hitting the occupant of the car—either the driver or the pas-senger. Last November, we had a hearing in 
the commerce committee about these rupturing airbags and the recalls. The number of vehicles recalled due to the 
defective Takata airbags is going to be in the record books as one of the larg-est in American history. 
At that hearing, we saw that instead 
of preventing these deaths and injuries, the opposite was happening. Interest-ingly, many of these incidents are hap-pening in vehicles exposed to persistent high heat and humidity. 
This Senator is from Florida, so it is, 
sadly, no surprise that Florida has been the epicenter of these incidents. Earlier this year, I came to the floor and reported that Takata had received unconfirmed reports of 64 injuries and 5 deaths as a result of the exploding air-bags. At the time, these numbers from Takata were far greater than what had been reported. Takata recently pro-vided an update to the committee, and I have new numbers. 
According to the most recent data as 
of the end of January, Takata had identified 40 more alleged incidents of rupturing airbags, including 1 death. This brings the total number of alleged injuries from 64 to 105 and the total number of alleged deaths to 6. As one would expect, 17 of the 40 newly re-ported incidents provided by Takata to our committee occurred in Florida. That brings the total number of alleged incidents of exploding Takata airbags in Florida—just in Florida—to 35, in-cluding 1 that caused a death. 
Now, these injuries have been very 
serious. I am not talking about a minor little nick. These injuries include fa-cial fractures, blindness, a broken ster-num, and even quadriplegia. This Sen-ator has visited with one of his con-stituents—a big, strapping, healthy firefighter who will no longer be a fire-fighter because he does not have sight in one of his eyes. But even the new numbers I just gave do not paint the full picture. 
In fact, Reuters recently reported 
that another Takata airbag in Florida ruptured just last month. The figures I reported earlier were as of the end of last January. The victim who was in-jured last month was in a 2003 Honda Civic. He had a 1
1⁄2-inch piece of metal 
shrapnel lodged into his neck after the airbag exploded. He was airlifted to the hospital and the doctors were able to remove the shrapnel, but now he has a big scar and a constant reminder that this incident could and should have been prevented.

was due to shrapnel cutting the jugular vein of the victim. When the police got to that accident, instead of thinking it was a traffic accident, they looked at the driver and thought a homicide had just occurred. It didn’t occur to them that shrapnel from an exploding airbag killed the driver. 
Honda has informed us that they are 
sending their recall notices out in both English and Spanish in order to more effectively reach consumers. We appre-ciate what Takata has done in trying

to ramp up their production of replace-
ment inflators. After that Honda an-nouncement, Honda also started an ad campaign in both English and Spanish to remind owners to have their recalled airbag inflators replaced, but obviously more still needs to be done. 
We need to get to the root cause of 
the problem, that is what we need to do, and we need to make sure we know why these defective airbag inflators are failing. It may be the inflator or it may be the propellant inside. We need to know. So, yes, we need more replace-ment inflators, but we need to make sure they are actually safe replacement inflators instead of potentially pro-ducing more defective inflators. 
It is my understanding that Honda 
and others are taking steps to ensure the safety of the replacement inflators. Well, that needs to happen right now and be validated right away by an inde-pendent third party. We need to make sure we are able to prevent defects like this in the future. 
I am going to stay on Takata. This 
Senator is going to stay on the auto-makers. This Senator is going to stay on the National Highway Traffic Safe-ty Administration to do exactly that. But for right now, I urge anybody lis-tening to me—if a defect is identified and you receive a recall notice, get your car into the dealership for repair just as quickly as you can. I also want folks to know that even if they have not received a notice from Takata, they should go to the Web site, safecars.gov and put in their car’s VIN number to check and see if it is subject to this or any other recall. That is im-perative. 
We are continuing to monitor this 
situation. We are going through tens of thousands of pages of documents re-lated to this defect. I will keep the Senate updated. 
I am pleased to report that the Sen-
ate is very close to approving S. 304, the Motor Vehicle Safety Whistle-blower Act. This bipartisan legislation, which Chairman T
HUNE and I authored, 
would provide financial incentives for whistleblowers in the automotive sec-tor to step forward if they see a manu-
facturer that is hiding or failing to ad-dress a dangerous defect. 
Certainly none of us needs to be re-
minded about the ignition switch de-fect coverup at General Motors. They hid that defect for a decade, and at least 87 people died because of it. This bill will hopefully help prevent such coverups in the future. 
This bill, S. 304, is a small but mean-
ingful step toward automobile safety. I hope my colleagues will urge their con-stituents to check on those Takata air-bags by going online, and I urge my colleagues as well to clear this com-monsense legislation. I certainly urge the House to do so as well. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I yield 
the floor to my colleague, Senator C
OATS . The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
WASTEFUL SPENDING  
Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am just 
going to speak for a few minutes. I am happy to defer to the Senator from Tennessee, but it shouldn’t take more 
than 2 or 3 minutes. 
If the Senator is interested, this is 
this week’s installment of my ‘‘Waste of the Week’’ speech. I come to the floor every week to point out some spending of taxpayer dollars that per-haps we should absolutely save. The cost to the taxpayers, as I will point out shortly, is in the tens of billions, if not hundreds of billions, of dollars on programs that have already been iden-tified by government agencies as worthless, fraudulent, unnecessary, and wasteful. While we have been un-able—and the Senator from Tennessee was a very pivotal part of this effort— to come to an agreement on dealing with the larger issue of saving our country from insolvency down the line, the very least we can do is to point out those areas where we are spending money that absolutely does not need to be spent and can be returned to the taxpayer. This week’s waste of the week is such that I can’t keep from chuckling over how this could happen, but it happens. 
Everybody has heard about Ponce de 
Leon’s search for the fountain of youth. Obviously, that hasn’t hap-pened. A recently released Social Secu-rity Inspector General’s report found that 6.5 million individuals over the age of 112 still have active Social Secu-rity numbers. How can this happen? Well, it happened because in 1936 when the program started, there were some people even from the mid-1800s who were enrolled in Social Security, and they have never been taken off the rolls. Now, obviously, these people are not all receiving checks, but it opens the prospect for fraud and waste and people getting these numbers, using them, and then receiving Social Secu-rity benefits illegally. 
In this inspector general’s report, the 
Social Security Administration is faulted for poorly managing data on ‘‘number holders who exceeded max-imum reasonable life expectancies and were likely deceased.’’ 
Well, to put it mildly, if we have 6.5 
million people in America who are over the age of 112, my guess is that most of those people, if not all of those people, are deceased—not likely deceased but are, in fact, deceased. 
Of those 6.5 million, the Social Secu-
rity Administration inspector general has determined that nearly 3,900 num-bers were run through the U.S. Govern-ment’s E-Verify system for people more than a century old. The E-Verify system is used when someone applies for a job. So that means thousands of people over 100 years old are applying for these new jobs. Obviously, someone is fraudulently using the system to re-port a Social Security number for someone over 112 years of age who is in the E-Verify system as applying for a 
job. 
Auditors also discovered nearly 67,000 
Social Security numbers in recent years were used to report wages for people other than the cardholders themselves. The workers reported about $3 billion in earnings between 2006 and 2011, and then those earnings are used to calculate their Social Secu-rity benefits. 
Obviously, this is an issue that needs 
to be addressed. Auditors have pro-posed that the Social Security Admin-istration take action to correct death records, but the Social Security Ad-ministration says it doesn’t want to di-vert resources away from efforts to im-prove payment accuracy. I suggest the Social Security Administration might want to reassess their assessment. 
A gaping hole such as this under-
mines the confidence of the American people in our government and in the way we run this business of govern-ment in both the Social Security Ad-ministration and the Federal Govern-ment at large. 
Government agencies have estimated 
that the Social Security Administra-tion can reduce fraud and save at least $2 billion, likely more, if this problem is corrected. 
So as I do each week, we keep adding 
to our gauge of savings that now are approaching very close to $50 billion, just over several weeks of pointing out waste and fraud that has been docu-mented by nonpolitical, neutral Fed-eral agencies. We keep adding more. We are approaching $50 billion. Our goal is $100 billion. I think we will go way past that if I keep doing this every week. 
In order to help correct the problem, 
I have introduced legislation, along with Senator C
ARPER and others, which 
will update the Social Security system and ensure accuracy in Federal records, not just in Social Security but in other agencies as well. I am just looking at one agency. Wait until we get into some of the others. 
The key provisions of our bill include 
allowing Federal agencies access to the complete death database, because under current law, only agencies that directly handle beneficiary payments may have access to the complete data-base. The act allows all appropriate Federal agencies to have access to the complete death data program for integ-rity purposes as well as for other needs such as public safety and health. It re-quires the use of death data to curb im-proper payments. Our legislation estab-
lishes procedures to ensure more accu-rate death data. 
As I have said before, by simply cor-
recting the death records, the Social Security Administration can reduce fraud and save at least $2 billion. 
This is an area that is ripe for re-
form, and I urge my colleagues to sup-port this legislation and eliminate this waste, along with the other $49 billion we have identified in just the last few weeks. We would be doing the tax-payers a great service while making

our government the efficient, effective 
government it needs to be, particularly in these times of lack of fiscal dis-cipline. 
I thank the Chair for the time. I also 
thank my colleague from Tennessee for giving me this time. 
Mr. President, I know we have impor-
tant legislation on the floor this week. This ‘‘Waste of the Week’’ speech is kind of tongue in cheek. We are moving on to legislation that has historic con-sequences for the future of America, for our own future, our children’s fu-ture, and our grandchildren’s future. 
The debate that will take place this 
week, led by Senator C
ORKER from Ten-
nessee regarding the Iranian pursuit of nuclear weapons capability is, in my time of service here in the Senate and in Congress, I think the most con-sequential piece of legislative debate that I will ever enter into. It will have enormous historical consequences, and we need to get it right. 
So I commend my colleague Senator 
C
ORKER for his efforts in this regard. 
He has moved the legislation through the Senate Foreign Relations Com-mittee with total bipartisan support, which is absolutely key to the success of our efforts and necessary to prevent a catastrophic activity taking place in Iran. 
So I appreciate the time to speak, 
while not focusing all of my attention and effort, as I hope all of my col-leagues will, to this extraordinary challenge that we have before us this week that will determine the future for country and maybe the world. 
With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I wish 
to thank the Senator for his continual focus on fiscal issues. I know he spent a great deal of time with a handful of folks at the White House two summers ago trying to come up with a plan to really save our Nation. 
I actually was just standing up a 
minute ago. I was about to suggest the absence of a quorum until I saw the Senator from Indiana, so the Senator can speak as long as he wishes on these waste issues. I thank him for the kind of Senator he is and his continual ef-forts to save our Nation from a na-tional security standpoint and also our greatest national security risk right now which is our inability to get our fiscal house in order. 
So I thank the Senator for this, and 
I look forward to the debate over the next several days. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, this 
week we are going to, in my view, deal with one of the most concerning, one of 
the most dangerous, one of the most treacherous issues we will face—that I will face as a Member of the U.S. Sen-ate and, certainly, has been in the short period of time I have had the honor of representing Kansans here in our Nation’s Capital. It is the question of Iran. It is the question of their abil-ity to acquire nuclear weapons. 
On this question of Iran, American 
policymakers are approaching a num-ber of fateful decisions—in fact, a se-ries of decisions that I think have sig-nificant consequences. The implica-tions of the choices that will be made by our Nation and others will deter-mine events today, tomorrow, and well into the future, both regionally and globally. As I indicated, the con-sequences will be felt for decades—gen-erations, perhaps—to come. 
Such significant consequences re-
quire each step to be planted with great care and consideration. I fear that the recent American march into nuclear negotiations with Iran has been misguided, drawing our country and the global community into a dan-gerous position. 
American foreign policy with respect 
to Iran has long been centered around the goal of preventing Iranian acquisi-tion of nuclear weapon capability. Today, this policy has weathered and has been allowed to be weakened. It has become a position of delayed toler-ance of a nuclear Iran. This policy de-terioration was made clear in recent weeks by global affairs minds no less than former Secretaries of State George Shultz and Henry Kissinger, who wrote: ‘‘. . . negotiations that began 12 years ago as an international effort to prevent an Iranian capability to develop a nuclear arsenal are ending with an agreement that concedes that very capability. . . . ’’ 
The administration’s stated goal of 
securing a 1-year nuclear development breakout period reveals a shift from firm disapproval to acquiescence. The result, in my view, is a world that is much less safe, a Middle East that is further prone to violent conflict, and an international order trending toward nuclear armaments rather than walk-ing away from it. 
Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif point-
ed this out last week in his writing in the New York Times: 
Nothing in international politics functions 
in a vacuum. Security cannot be pursued at the expense of the insecurity of others. No nation can achieve its interests without con-sidering the interests of others. 
Nowhere are these dynamics more evident 
than in the wider Persian Gulf region. 
That is the Foreign Minister of Iran 
speaking. Mr. Zarif’s words apply to the pending nuclear question and the budding proposal to exchange sanctions relief for a temporary suspension of Iranian nuclear development. The deci-sions made by Iran and the P5+1 par-ticipants in these nuclear negotiations are being considered and acted upon and responded to by others in the re-gion and others around the globe. As 
Iran’s neighboring states are looking to increase arms purchases for use in the ongoing conflicts in their region, international concerns about a nu-clear-capable Iran are not merely pas-sive policy critiques. They are warn-ings worthy of our careful, determined consideration. 
I would suggest and I will ask what 
we must ask: Does this pending accord make the world safer or more dan-
gerous? Does it bring Iran closer to or further from nuclear capabilities? Can the world trust Iran to uphold its com-mitments? Will the terms of the deal be sufficiently verifiable to know if they do not? 
Ultimately, we must ask if this deal 
would stabilize tensions in the Middle East or accelerate them. These ques-tions are greater than any grappling things that go on between Congress and the President, between Republicans and Democrats. This cannot and should not be a politically partisan issue. It should be one of serious consideration about long-term consequences to America, its allies, and our enemies. 
The nuclear accord will have serious 
and lasting consequences for us all. It is incumbent upon American leadership to guide these efforts in the safest pos-sible direction. In my view, our trajec-tory to date has been uncertain. In re-sponse, Congress has insisted—and rightfully so—that it oversee and par-ticipate in the process, especially in any decision regarding the lifting of sanctions. 
The President’s efforts to ignore or 
sidestep the legislative branch’s con-stitutional role in foreign policy are troublesome. Many, including me, have been asking why Congress lacks the ability to block or more forcefully re-spond to a potential bad deal or to do more to limit the President’s ability to act unilaterally. Unfortunately, the law resulting from the previously passed sanctions legislation allows the President to waive sanctions under cer-tain conditions—the legislation that we passed. 
Let me say that again. The legisla-
tion that we passed over a period of time—and I am a Member of the bank-ing committee involved in this legisla-tion—allowed a President—this or other Presidents—to waive those sanc-tions under considerations of national security. What we regrettably discov-ered is that Congress provided way too much flexibility to a President too willing to ignore the concerns of the legislature, too willing to find a reason to waive the sanctions. 
But there remains reason of hope 
that Congress will play a constructive and important part in this matter. De-spite opposition from the White House, bipartisan efforts led by Senate For-eign Relations Committee Chairman Senator C
ORKER have produced legisla-
tion providing for a congressional re-view process. The bill had broad bipar-tisan support, and perhaps that makes it impervious to President Obama’s ini-tial threats of a veto.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2426 April 27, 2015 
Any increased role by Congress is 
welcomed, from my perspective. For too long, Congress has deferred to Ex-ecutive action when it comes to foreign 
relations and foreign affairs—not just this Congress and this President, but many Congresses and many Presidents. In my view, Congress has failed its con-stitutional authority to oversee a President’s foreign policy efforts. 
So this increased role for Congress is 
welcome. And for anyone who is skep-tical of the framework released by the State Department in early April or cu-rious about what the parameters might look like in a final deal, Congress will have the ability to see, to know, and to let the American people, and, in fact, the world know what these agreements might contain. 
After the presumed passage of the 
Iran Nuclear Review Act—the legisla-tion we have been considering this week—if it passes and the case is that a deal is ultimately struck and an agreement is struck by the June 30 deadline between the administration, the P5+1, and Iran, Congress will have 30 days to review that agreement. 
As we began late last week and early 
this week to consider this legislation, the point in being here at this stage is to indicate that while I wish there were more opportunities for congressional involvement in the process, what the committee has presented to us gives us the starting point, the beginning point, and the opportunity to explore fully what the administration has been ne-gotiating in secret. 
I have attended the meetings—the so- 
called classified briefings—and it is hard to leave those meetings with an understanding or appreciation or more knowledge of what is in the potential agreement with Iran than before I walked in the door. What will transpire this week on the Senate floor gives me and others the opportunity—and ulti-mately the American people—to know a lot more. 
As this process has been developed 
and as we implement it here on the Senate floor, it is important that we use this time to carefully examine the results of any nuclear negotiations and ask ourselves this question: Is the world better off as a result of that agreement? Is peace more assured, and does humanity have a better future? 
We don’t have the agreement in front 
of us yet, but what we do this week sets the stage for that review, for that understanding, and for the ability to reject, if necessary. What that agree-ment contains is important. It is en-couraging to me to see that the Sen-ate—the Congress, in fact—is stepping forward to play its rightful constitu-tional role in foreign affairs. 
I look forward to the discussion this 
week, but more importantly, I look for-ward to the passage of legislation that allows us to have a much greater say, much more significant knowledge, and a better opportunity to have under-standing about a potential treacherous path that our country may be headed toward. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I wish 
to thank the Senator from Kansas. I think he has articulated about as well as anybody the importance of passing the legislation on the floor. 
Many of my colleagues, I think, un-
like the Senator from Kansas, in some ways fail to recognize that when we put the sanctions in place that brought them to the table, in the meanwhile they were going from 164 centrifuges back in 2003 to 19,000 centrifuges today. What Congress did in a bipartisan way was put four tranches of sanctions in place to begin putting pressure on them to stop and to get them to the table. We have done that, but in each of those cases, we gave the President unilaterally the ability to waive or sus-pend the sanctions ad infinitum—for-ever. 
It is something that my friend Sen-
ator K
AINE from Virginia recognized in 
our meetings as we had the Secretary come forward and talk to us about the fact that, yes, you are going to have a vote on this. But we all recognized that was 4 to 5 to 6 years down the road after the sanctions regime had been to-tally alleviated. 
I just want to thank the Senator for 
being so articulate in his comments. 
The fact is that without this legisla-
tion—without this legislation passing— Congress will have zero. The President will go straight to the U.N. Security Council with the suspensions in his hands that we have already given them and implement whatever kind of deal he wants to implement. 
I have had a great conversation with 
my friend from Virginia today. I think this bill obviously does give Congress, as the Senator from Kansas mentioned, its rightful role. But I think it also gives the President a backstop when he is negotiating so that people will un-derstand that we are going to play that role. 
So I thank the Senator very, very 
much for his comments and for the constructive way he is on so many of the big issues we deal with and for his cosponsorship of this very important legislation. 
With that, I yield the floor. I see my 
friend from Virginia. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Thank you, Mr. Presi-
dent. 
I appreciate the comments of Chair-
man C
ORKER , and I appreciate the two 
punch lines of the Senator from Kansas to his argument that I am strongly in support of. The first is that this is a very momentous topic, and there are many, many questions about an ulti-mate deal that we have to grapple with. Second, it is so much of the mo-ment that the congressional sanctions themselves are so wrapped up in the discussion that Congress must have a role to fulfill our constitutional obliga-tion and to actually do what we essen-tially set in motion by passing the con-
gressional sanctions. We must have a role. 
So to the chairman and to all who 
are supporting the bill, I think we have got it in a good place on the floor, and I am proud to be a strong supporter of it. 
The only issue on which I would offer 
a slightly different take than the Sen-ator from Kansas is this. I think by all objective standards, the negotiations to this point have produced a status quo that has been better than where we were before the negotiations. If you think back to before November 2013, Iran—although under punishing sanc-tions—was moving forward in a very dramatic way to build up an architec-ture. While the sanctions were hurting the Iranian economy, there was some argument that it was not slowing down their nuclear program. It was accel-erating it because they were feeling isolated. 
Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel 
appeared before the United Nations and gave a very famous speech in which he talked about the stockpile of uranium that was enriched to a 20-percent level. We drew a bomb and showed a level of enrichment that was getting to an ex-tremely dangerous place. That is where we were before President Obama start-ed these negotiations with the P5+1 in November 2013. 
At the time the negotiations were 
started, there were some who said they were misguided or a historic mistake or a giveaway. But, by now, virtually all—even those who were skeptical at the beginning—would acknowledge that the negotiations have actually led to a status quo significantly better than before November 2013. The 20-per-cent enriched uranium stockpile Iran had has been rolled back to a 5-percent enrichment level. Many of the cen-trifuges and facilities where nuclear weapons and nuclear activities were oc-curring have either been disabled or in some way have been reconfigured so that they are not continuing to produce more material that would cause significant concern. Since No-vember 2013 the international commu-nity has been able to achieve signifi-cantly greater inspections of the Ira-nian nuclear activity than they had be-fore. 
So while we still have significant 
questions about an ultimate deal and Congress’s role, we have a much better handle on their program. They have 
rolled back that program to a signifi-cant degree, and even skeptics of the original deal acknowledge that. I do think that is important to mention. 
Congress needs to fulfill its article I 
powers, but we also need to have the President do the diplomacy that article II allows him to do.

Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I want 
to thank Senator K AINE and Senator 
CORKER . 
This is the second day that we have 
been debating the nuclear oversight bill. Members have had a chance to ex-press their concerns. They have had a chance to put forward amendments, to file them at this particular moment. We have been working with several Members to try to see whether we can work out an orderly way for the con-sideration of those amendments. I want all of the Members to know we are open for business. Senator C
ORKER has 
been meeting with Members, and I have been talking to Members. We hope we can find a way to move this bill for-ward tomorrow for the consideration of amendments. 
I would urge Members—we are not 
encouraging amendments because we think we took up these issues in the committee and we worked out a bipar-tisan bill to get this done. But please talk to us so we can try to work out in an orderly way the consideration of amendments starting tomorrow and hopefully finish the bill shortly there-after. 
I yield the floor.

NOMINATION OF DAVA J. NEWMAN 
TO BE DEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR OF THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under

The senior assistant legislative clerk

Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today 
the Senate will vote to confirm Dava Newman to be Deputy Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. I had the pleasure of meeting with Dr. Newman. She is a tal-ented individual. She is passionate about aerospace engineering and is 
generating awareness of science, tech-nology, energy, and math opportunities in Montana students. 
Dr. Newman is excited to get to work 
and continue to make NASA competi-tive with other countries studying space exploration. 
A graduate of C.R. Anderson Middle 
School and Capital High School in Hel-ena, MT, Dr. Newman is a testament to the quality of Montana’s public edu-cation. After graduating from high school, Dr. Newman attended the Uni-versity of Notre Dame before pursuing graduate school at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dr. Newman is now a professor of aeronautics and as-tronautics. 
In 2007, Time magazine highlighted 
Dr. Newman’s work as one of the best inventions of the year. She developed a new space suit, known as the BioSuit, to increase astronauts’ agility and movements, allowing astronauts to not only walk but also run and even climb mountains. 
Her track record of success and nomi-
nation to NASA serve as a way to en-courage young Montanans to pursue careers in space and engineering. 
Dr. Newman is an incredibly accom-
plished Montanan who truly exempli-fies our State’s legacy of public serv-ice. Her passion and dedication to NASA is clear. I know she will lead with honor and is prepared for what-ever challenges may lie ahead. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of Dr. Newman’s nomination. 
I yield back the remainder of my 
time. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. 
C
OATS ). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, in a few 
minutes, we are going to vote on the confirmation of Dava Newman, the nominee for Deputy Administrator of NASA. This little Agency happens to be one that I have some personal fond-ness for, having participated with NASA many Moons ago—29
1⁄2years 
ago—on the 24th flight of the space shuttle, a crew led by then-Navy Cap-tain Robert Gibson, otherwise known as Hoot Gibson, and his second in com-mand, the pilot of our mission, which was dubbed STS—Space Transpor-tation System—61–C. Subsequently, all of the numbers of the space shuttles re-verted to their original numbering, but there was a hiatus in there where sev-eral shuttle flights had a very com-plicated numbering system, and ours was one of them. The pilot of that mis-sion was then-Marine Colonel Charlie Bolden, now-Marine General, Retired, Charlie Bolden, who is the Adminis-trator of NASA and has been for the last 6 years. But Administrator Bolden does not have a Deputy, and he needs a 
Deputy Administrator. So this process has been carefully conducted, and they sifted through hundreds of names to come up with just the right person, and that is in the person of Dr. Dava New-man. 
She received her bachelor’s degree 
from the University of Notre Dame and two master’s degrees and a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Tech-nology. She is currently a professor of aeronautics and astronautics and engi-neering systems at MIT. She is also the director of the Technology and Policy Program there. 
Right off the bat, you can see there is 
no question as to her skills, her smarts, and her credentials, but she is also known for her leadership and tech-nical expertise in aerospace engineer-ing. She authored over 200 research publications, including the textbook ‘‘Introduction to Aerospace Engineer-ing and Design.’’ 
I think that would be kind of inter-
esting, that as a backup to Adminis-trator Bolden, who is a five-time space shuttle astronaut, we have someone who is an expert in aerospace engineer-ing design, particularly as we are cre-ating the new rockets and the new spacecraft as we speak, for the goal, which is Mars in the decade of the 2030s. 
During her career, she served as the 
principal investigator on three space flight experiments flown on board the space shuttle and on board the previous Mir Space Station. She is tremen-dously known for her innovative space suit designs that use mechanical counterpressure to make the space suit formfitting, lightweight, and much more flexible than previous space suits. 
If you notice, when you see the astro-
nauts outside of the International Space Station—which, by the way, blows the mind, how big it is. It is 110 yards long. From one goalpost to the other goalpost is 120 yards. That is how big the International Space Station is that is 250 miles above the Earth with six humans on board. When you watch those EVAs—extravehicular activi-ties—when they go outside to do the repairs, well, lo and behold, Dr. New-man is the designer of their innovative space suits. She has been recognized. Back in 2007, Time magazine recog-nized her and her space suit work as one of the best inventions of the year. She is currently leading the develop-ment of a suit that may help astro-nauts overcome back problems in space. The suit is planned to be tested on the International Space Station later this year. 
As we go on this dual track in our ci-
vilian space program—first the track with commercial rockets that will take our cargo and is taking our cargo to and from the International Space Sta-tion and will soon be taking Americans to and from the International Space Station, and the other track of the dual tracks is the development of this huge new rocket, much larger than the

This is called the Space Launch Sys-tem, and atop it will sit the human capsule Orion, which will start the process of developing the systems, the techniques, the lifesaving, life-enhanc-ing, and life-protecting measures and equipment that can take us all the way to Mars. 
So we need a professional at NASA to 
help General Bolden and his very dedi-cated team. I certainly commend Dr. Dava Newman to the Senate as that person. We should confirm her today, and we can continue this Nation’s ci-vilian space program.

VOTE EXPLANATION  
∑Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I am 
proud that Florida has such a rich his-tory and relationship with NASA. From the earliest launches of rockets that established manned missions, to the Apollo program and the continued support for the International Space Station, my home State of Florida is proud to take ownership in NASA’s past and will certainly be a part of its future. 
It is imperative that we continue to 
have a robust space exploration pro-gram that promotes America’s eco-nomic, scientific, and security inter-ests, and that effectively utilizes its re-sources. NASA must have strong lead-ership and I believe Dr. Dava Newman will serve the Administration well in her new role as Deputy Administrator of NASA. While other obligations kept me from Washington, I would have voted in favor of her nomination. ∑

CREATING A NEW BEGINNING 
Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I rise 
today to address for the first time this august body, the United States Sen-ate—the greatest governing body ever conceived. Out of respect, I have waited until we passed the 100-day mark to de-liver this speech, but I rise today be-cause I believe our Republic is in grave danger. We need to create a new begin-ning by dealing with the very real cri-sis of leadership we face today. It is why I ran for the Senate in the first place—because we need a new perspec-tive in Washington. Like many Ameri-cans, I am outraged by Washington’s dysfunction, its fiscal irresponsibility, its lack of leadership in foreign policy, its intrusiveness and overreach, and its negative impact on hard-working Americans. 
Before being elected to the Senate, I 
had never been involved in politics. Simply put, I am a political outsider committed to changing the direction of our country. I grew up in a small mili-tary town in Middle Georgia, working on our family’s farms. My mom and dad were public school teachers, and I grew up modestly, as did most people there. I worked my way through col-lege and was blessed with a business career that took me from the factory floor to become a Fortune 500 CEO. 
My story is not unique. It is the 
American story. Only in America is this possible, thanks to hard work and self-reliance. It is called the American dream, and it is our job to make sure it lasts. Many people today believe that this dream no longer exists, that we need big government to provide us with more and more financial security. I dis-agree totally. I believe our best days lie ahead. But we have to act boldly if we are to save this dream and our very way of life. 
As an outsider to the political proc-
ess, I am humbled by the privilege to serve my country as a U.S. Senator. I am sobered by the immense responsi-bility of representing the people of Georgia, and I am encouraged by the opportunity we have to solve this crisis of leadership and create a new begin-ning. 
As one of the Original Thirteen Colo-
nies, Georgia has long been blessed with outstanding statesmen in the U.S. Senate. The first Senator to serve in this seat in the first U.S. Congress in 1789 was Senator William Few. He also signed the U.S. Constitution. As fate would have it, Sarah Few Collins, a member of the team that helped me be-come Georgia’s 37th U.S. Senator in this seat, is a direct descendant of Sen-ator Few. I think that is pretty special. This desk I use on the Senate floor is also very meaningful to me. It has served such distinguished leaders from Georgia such as Saxby Chambliss, Zell

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2429 April 27, 2015 
Miller, Sam Nunn, Herman Talmadge, 
and the venerable Richard B. Russell, Jr. 
I rise to speak about three issues cre-
ating this national crisis of leadership we experience today: the abuse of Exec-utive power, the significant deteriora-tion of American foreign policy, and our out-of-control debt. 
First, ‘‘What we are witnessing today 
is one of the greatest challenges to our constitutional system in the history of this country’’—not my words but the words of George Washington University constitutional law professor Dr. Jona-than Turley, who incidentally voted twice for President Obama. Unbridled use of Executive orders and regulatory mandates has basically allowed this President to run the country without Congress for the past 6 years. Accord-ing to Professor Turley, this sets dan-gerous precedents for future courts and future Presidents. 
To create a new beginning, we must 
first get back to our founding prin-ciples articulated in our Constitution that created this miracle called Amer-ica in the first place: economic oppor-tunity, fiscal responsibility, limited government, and individual liberty. When government grows larger, indi-vidual liberty declines. I even believe that our Founders were committed to the concept of citizen legislators—peo-ple would come to Congress, do their work, and go home. I don’t believe they could perceive of the potential rise of career politicians we experience today. 
We also face a global security crisis 
that is getting worse by the day. This administration has created a situation where our allies don’t trust us and our enemies don’t fear us. Leading from be-hind has failed us as a foreign policy. 
Right now, we face the threat of nu-
clear proliferation starting with Iran. As President Obama has conceded, this deal being negotiated would leave Iran with a breakout time ‘‘almost down to zero’’ in 10 to 15 years. As Prime Min-ister Netanyahu reminded us when he spoke before Congress, a nuclear Iran is not just a threat to Middle East secu-rity, it is not only a threat to U.S. se-curity, it is indeed a threat to global security. 
A nuclear Iran whose leaders are 
committed to the death of Israel and America would spark an unprecedented wave of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East. Under no circumstances can we allow Iran to become a nuclear weapons State—not now, not in 10 years, not ever. 
After battling terrorism for the past 
14 years and fighting two major wars, with thousands of American lives lost and billions spent, we still face ter-rorist threats from jihadist Islamic groups who openly vow to do us harm. We face a tough choice, however: Deal with them over there or wait and deal with the consequences here at home. 
We are also witnessing the return of 
great power rivalries. Last year, Russia actually seized territory of a sovereign state and continues their aggression today in the Ukraine. China is also 
growing more aggressive, doubling its military spending and flexing its mus-cle in the region. 
New asymmetric threats, combined 
with traditional symmetric challenges, create unprecedented demand on our military at the very time this adminis-tration has reduced military spending to the point that we are about to have the smallest Army since World War II, the smallest Navy since World War I, and the smallest Air Force ever. This is simply unacceptable. 
To address this global security crisis 
and create a new beginning, we must have a consistent and strong foreign policy. However, to have a strong for-eign policy, we must have a strong de-fense. 
Providing for the national defense is 
one of only 6 reasons outlined in the Constitution why 13 Colonies formed our Union in the first place. To have a strong defense, though, we have to have a strong economy, as we proved during the Cold War with the Soviet Union. 
Our own fiscal irresponsibility jeop-
ardizes our very ability to fund a strong military. ADM Michael Mullen, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, once said that the greatest threat to our national security is our own Federal debt. This debt crisis threatens our ability to defend our country, stand for freedom, and main-tain our very way of life. It is a pri-mary reason why we need to create a new beginning. 
This debt crisis affects each of us 
every day. While the economy lurches along, we see working middle-class Americans struggling. Many people are having difficulty finding jobs, and those with jobs are lucky to have a job. Their wages remain stagnant, making it harder and harder to get from pay-day to payday. Many families can’t af-ford to buy a home or plan for the fu-ture. Moms and dads fear they can’t send their kids to college or prepare them for a good job. Many college grad-uates today have sizable student loans and still can’t find meaningful employ-ment. A comfortable retirement is only a dream for many. 
Back home in Georgia, people share 
my outrage with Washington’s fiscal irresponsibility. From what I have seen so far up here, there is not enough great sense of urgency in tackling this skyrocketing debt crisis. There are no innocent parties up here, either. Both sides have pushed us to the brink, con-tributing to this unsustainable level of debt we face today. In the last 6 years alone, the Federal Government has spent $21.5 trillion, but it borrowed $8 trillion, so that today we have a Fed-eral debt of more than $18 trillion. We simply cannot afford everything we are doing as a Federal Government. We are already overtaxed and overregulated. 
The progressive policies of the past 
100 years and particularly the egre-gious policies of this current adminis-tration have failed the very people they were intended to help—the work-
ing middle class. Instead, Washington has created a spiraling situation that will only take us deeper into debt. 
What is worse, we have over $100 tril-
lion in future unfunded liabilities re-lated to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Federal pensions, and the in-terest on the Federal debt. While devel-oping a long-term solution to this debt crisis, we also need to protect today’s seniors and save our safety net pro-grams so they will be there for people who really need them the most, when they need them. Shockingly, Social Se-curity and Medicare trust funds will be totally insolvent in just a few short years, and worse, this administration has no plan to deal with that. 
Unfortunately, we are already past 
the tipping point in this fiscal catas-trophe. If interest rates today were at their 5.5 percent 30-year average, we would already be paying almost $1 tril-lion in interest. That is twice what we spend on our military, and it is totally unmanageable. 
People back home expect Washington 
to work. This fiscal irresponsibility drives people back in Georgia abso-lutely crazy. Doubling down on bigger government, more Federal programs, and more government spending is not the answer, as has been proven repeat-edly over the last 100 years. We have to break the gridlock in Washington to solve this problem. One side wants to increase taxes; the other side wants spending cuts. The result is that we have had gridlock in Washington for a generation. 
The real solution, of course, is to 
grow our economy. Just 1 percentage point of incremental GDP growth would generate over $3 trillion of Fed-eral tax revenues in the next decade alone. Combine that with the elimi-nation of truly duplicative programs, and we can develop a long-term plan to solve this debt crisis, as well as get Americans back to work in meaningful, well-paying jobs. 
To create a new beginning, my focus 
in this body will be to add to the de-bate about how to grow our economy, rein in our outrageous spending, and solve this debt crisis. 
To grow our economy, three prior-
ities should be addressed right away. First, we need to totally reinvent how we fund our Federal Government. Many States, such as Georgia, have a balanced budget law, and so should Washington. American families can’t spend more than they take in, and nei-ther should their government. 
Our archaic tax system is choking 
growth, holding back innovation, and discouraging investment. Eventually, I believe, we should transition from an income tax to a simple consumption tax, such as the fair tax, that would level the playing field with the rest of the world. 
While that debate will take some 
time, there are things we can do right now to stimulate our economy. We need to reduce our corporate tax rate

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2430 April 27, 2015 
and eliminate entirely our repatriation 
tax to be more competitive with other countries. At the same time, we need to eliminate corporate welfare and make our tax system fairer and simpler for every American. 
We also have to rein in our out-of- 
control regulators. This President has created the fourth branch of govern-ment—the regulators—which today makes more rules that affect our lives and our jobs than does Congress. 
Finally, we need to unlock our full 
energy potential to get this economy moving. We need to develop our domes-tic natural resources. Isn’t it time we finally develop a long-term energy pol-icy that unleashes this potential while protecting our environment? 
Doing these things now will also 
allow us to fund our infrastructure needs, improve our education process, become more competitive with the rest of the world, create well-paying, 21st- century jobs, and ignite the next eco-nomic boom for our kids and grandkids. 
I have used the word ‘‘crisis’’ care-
fully and thoughtfully today. The first step toward making the tough choices required to change our direction comes from a true realization that we indeed have a crisis. Americans respond better than anyone in history to a true crisis, but we are not always the quickest to recognize we have one. 
To create a truly new beginning, it is 
time for this eminent body, the U.S. Senate, to rise above partisan politics and do the right thing. It starts with leadership. It starts with making hard choices. It starts with telling the American people the unvarnished truth. It starts with no longer kicking the can down the road. It starts with having the courage to actually solve these problems independent of how it might affect our reelection chances. 
My motivation is very simple. I do 
not want to be a member of the first generation in American history that has to tell its kids that we are leaving them a country that is worse off than our parents left us. 
Ronald Reagan once said: 
Freedom is never more than one genera-
tion away from extinction. We didn’t pass it along to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children’s children what it was once like in the United States when men were free. 
Let us fight to find common ground 
to create a new beginning for our coun-try, for people back home who are struggling, and for the future of our children and our children’s children. 
As I close, I am reminded of a sel-
dom-quoted closing sentence of the Declaration of Independence: 
And for the support of this Declaration, 
with a firm reliance on the protection of di-vine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor. 
Our Founders got it right. They 
would remind us of that commitment and encourage us today to put our dif-
ferences aside, to work together to solve these sometimes overwhelming problems. 
Together, we can put our differences 
aside. Together, we can do the right thing. Together, we can create a new beginning. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the 
floor.

CONGRATULATING SENATOR 
PERDUE 
Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
wish to congratulate our new colleague from Georgia on his insightful and ac-curate assessment of the biggest chal-lenges confronting our country. Not only did he lay out the biggest chal-lenges, he certainly laid out the best solutions to those challenges to get this country moving again and to guar-antee, as he put it, that we leave be-hind for the next generation a better country than our parents left behind for us. 
I congratulate our new colleague for 
an outstanding major speech. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am 
grateful that we have the distinguished Senator from Georgia in the Senate. I really enjoyed his remarks here this evening. He laid out a program that we ought to follow. 
I am very proud to have the Senator 
here, and I am proud to serve with him. We wish him the very, very best in every way. I think he will enjoy this body in spite of all the vagaries and va-rieties of it. But he is a great addition to this body, and we are very appre-ciative that he is here with us. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Georgia. 
Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I wish 
to note that my colleague from Geor-gia just made a great speech. In it he listed those who sat in the desk he now sits in—Nunn, Russell, Chambliss. It is obvious he has inherited that seat, and he is equal to the task of those gentle-men. I commend him on his first speech, and I am honored to serve with him in the Senate. 
I yield back. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I wish 
to say, I knew the Senator from Geor-gia prior to being a Senator. He was an outstanding CEO in a major public company. He has done business all over the world. I know when he campaigned in Georgia for this seat, what he said was that he was going to be the adult in the room. I just want to say that he certainly has distinguished himself since he came here in acting that way and looking at the big issues that our Nation has to deal with. 
I know that he knows that still the 
greatest threat to our country right now is our inability to get our fiscal house in order, and I really believe that 
Senator P
ERDUE is going to not just be 
a leader on the Foreign Relations Com-mittee, as he already is—hugely helpful in the vote that we had last week rel-ative to Iran—but I think as much as anybody in the Senate, Senator P
ERDUE is going to help drive this body 
to responsibly deal with fiscal issues we have to deal with. 
We have a lot of work to do. We 
haven’t even begun. I look forward to working with him, not only to ensure that our Nation is safe and secure but that we get our fiscal house in order. I could not be more gratified that Sen-ator P
ERDUE is part of this body and 
serving in the manner that he is. 
I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to 
congratulate the Senator from Georgia on the content of his speech as well as on his enthusiasm and also on how he follows through on what he says. I get to serve with him on the Budget Com-mittee, and I have been extremely im-pressed. 
At his first meeting, I introduced 
him as someone who has balanced budgets. He corrected me. In the pri-vate sector, one can’t just balance the budget; you have to do better than that. He has that kind of experience to bring to the Budget Committee and to this body, and I look forward to work-ing with him diligently on the budget. We only had 6 weeks to do what hadn’t been done in 6 years, and he was a tre-mendous help in getting through that process and understanding some of the complexities. He is a good numbers man. So when he talks about what we need to do with the budget and paying down the debt and the ways we can do it, I look forward to working with him to get those things accomplished. 
I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I wish 
to commend my fellow freshman, Sen-ator P
ERDUE , for a great maiden 
speech. I like particularly his emphasis upon growing our gross domestic prod-uct, growing our economy, and making it stronger. It echoes what Senator E
NZIjust said. It is not just about bal-
ancing the budget but about creating the sort of growth that creates more prosperity for the families who depend upon this prosperity for better jobs for them and their families. 
It was a great speech. I thank the 
Senator for capturing the optimism that makes the United States unique. 
I yield back.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S2431 April 27, 2015 
For 46 years he served alongside the 
faculty of SAU, the last 13 as president. Dr. Rankin made a career out of help-ing students and facilitating growth at the school. His vision to improve aca-demic programs and expand campus re-sources has been a success; benefiting the community and creating a new standard for education. 
Since becoming president in 2002, Dr. 
Rankin helped grow graduate enroll-ment 200 percent. Throughout his pres-idency SAU has not only seen record enrollment, but record development as well. Construction of state-of-the-art academic buildings, upgraded athletic facilities, a 30,000-square-foot agri-culture center and a $17.5 million Science Center are just a few of the projects championed by Dr. Rankin. 
Public service is a cornerstone of Dr. 
Rankin’s life. Serving as president of SAU is certainly enough to stay busy, but his commitment to the community and the State keep him active in a va-riety of other roles including as the chair of the Golden Triangle Economic Development Council. During his ten-ure he also served as the economic ad-visor to two Arkansas Governors. He is an active member of Central Baptist Church in Magnolia where he teaches Sunday school. 
I congratulate Dr. David Rankin for 
his outstanding achievements in edu-cation and the community. I have ap-preciated his friendship and enjoyed supporting his efforts to continue mak-ing his vision for SAU a reality. I wish him continued success. SAU is a much improved school thanks to his leader-ship and years of dedication to this in-stitution. ∑

STATEMENT ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. REED (for himself, Ms. 
WARREN , Mr. D URBIN , and Mr. 
MURPHY ): 
S. 1102. A bill to provide for institu-
tional risk-sharing in the Federal stu-dent loan programs; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-sions. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today post-
secondary education is required for most family-sustaining, middle-class jobs, and an educated workforce is es-sential to a modern, productive econ-omy. A recent report by the George-town University Center on Education and the Workforce found that college- intensive business services have re-placed manufacturing as the largest sector in the U.S. economy, and that while college-educated workers make up only 32 percent of the workforce, they now produce more than 50 percent of the Nation’s economic output, up from 13 percent in 1967. Median annual earnings for bachelor’s degree holders were $23,000 higher compared to high school graduates in 2014. 
Yet just as there is growing recogni-
tion that postsecondary education is indispensable in the modern economy, families are being required to shoulder growing debt burdens that threaten ac-cess to college. 
According to a recent analysis of stu-
dent loan debt by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, between 2004 and 2014, there was an 89 percent increase in the number of student loan bor-rowers and a 77 percent increase in the average balance size. Today, over 40 million Americans have student loan debt. 
This is a growing drag on our econ-
omy. As student loan debt has grown, young adults have put off buying homes or cars, starting a family, sav-ing for retirement, or launching new businesses. They have literally mort-gaged their economic future. 
We know that student loan borrowers 
are struggling. Default rates are on the rise. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that the number of bor-rowers who default each year increased from about half a million 10 years ago to 1.2 million annually in 2011 and 2012. Only 37 percent of borrowers are cur-rent on their loan and actively paying 
down their debt. 
We cannot tackle the student loan 
debt crisis without States and institu-tions also stepping up and taking greater responsibility for college costs and student borrowing. 
That is why I am pleased to intro-
duce the Protect Student Borrowers Act with Senators D
URBIN , W ARREN , 
and M URPHY to ensure there is more 
skin in the game when it comes to stu-dent loan debt by setting stronger mar-ket incentives for colleges and univer-sities to provide better and more af-fordable education to students, which will in turn help put the brakes on ris-ing student loan defaults. 
The Protect Student Borrowers Act 
will hold colleges and universities ac-countable for student loan defaults by requiring them to repay a percentage of defaulted loans. Only institutions that have 25 percent or more of their students borrow would be included in risk sharing based on their cohort de-fault rate. Risk-sharing requirements would kick in when the default rate ex-ceeds 15 percent. As the institutional default rate rises, so too will the insti-tution’s risk-share payment. 
The Protect Student Borrowers Act 
also provides incentives for institu-tions to take proactive steps to ease student loan debt burdens and reduce default rates. Colleges and universities can reduce or eliminate their payments if they implement a comprehensive student loan management plan. The Secretary may waive or reduce the payments for institutions whose mis-sion is to serve low-income and minor-ity students, such as community col-leges, Historically Black Institutions, or Hispanic Serving Institutions pro-vided that they are making progress in their student loan management plans. 
The risk-sharing payments will be in-
vested in helping struggling borrowers, preventing future default and delin-quency, and reducing shortfalls in the Pell Grant program. 
With the stakes so high for students 
and taxpayers, it is only fair that insti-tutions bear some of the risk in the student loan program. 
We need to tackle student loan debt 
and college affordability from multiple angles. And we need all stakeholders in the system to do their part. With the Protect Student Borrowers Act, we are providing the resources and incentives for institutions to take more responsi-bility to address college affordability and student loan debt and improve stu-dent outcomes. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill and look forward to working with them to include it and other key reforms in the upcoming re-authorization of the Higher Education Act. 
By Mr. DAINES (for himself, Mr. 
TESTER , Mr. R ISCH, and Mr. 
CRAPO ): 
S. 1103. A bill to reinstate and extend 
the deadline for commencement of con-struction of a hydroelectric project in-volving Clark Canyon Dam; to the 
Committee on Energy and Natural Re-sources. 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today, I 
introduce two bills, S. 1103 and S. 1104, with my colleague from Montana, Sen-ator J
ONTESTER , my Idaho colleagues 
Senators R ISCH and C RAPO and also my 
counterpart in the House, Montana’s Representative R
YAN ZINKE. Current 
uncertainty in the permitting process threaten sources of clean, renewable power in my State. My bills would allow the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to extend a license for nonfederal hydropower development on existing dams in my state of Montana. 
The first bill would extend for 3 years 
a contract for hydropower development on the Clark Canyon Dam in Dillon, Montana. The bill would allow for con-struction and operation of a project that would power about 1,200 homes each year with clean, renewable hydro-power, while replacing 18,000 metric tons of carbon each year. The bill would help create 30 to 40 jobs during construction. Further, the project would produce $611,000 in State and Federal taxes over the first 5 years of operation and $37,000 in property tax contributions over the first 5 years. 
The second bill would provide a 6 
year contract extension for nonfederal hydropower development on the Gibson Dam, near August and Choteau Mon-tana. Once completed, the project will provide for decades of stable of tax rev-enues per year to each Teton and Lewis and Clark Counties, the state of Mon-tana, and the Federal Government. Gibson Hydro project will benefit the environment as they are required by their FERC license to incorporate measures in their operations and con-struction that would enhance fish and wildlife resources, water quality, rec-reational and aesthetic resources. Fur-ther, the project would replace 40,000 tons of carbon per year and will strengthen the irrigation component of the Gibson Dam by providing a portion of the power sales to Greenfields Irriga-tion District to support irrigation im-provements, operations, water con-servation and usage enhancements. This bill will help create 15–25 con-struction jobs, $1 million in local rev-enue over 2 years, and $4–5 million in wages during construction phase and over $200,000 per year for the Sun River Cooperative. 
Hydropower development must be a 
key component of our Nation’s all-of- the-above strategy to meet our Na-tion’s needs. Passing these bills will show the Senate’s commitment to hy-dropower as a clean source of power for our country. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the text of the bills be print-ed in the R
ECORD . 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bills were ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows:

CLEAR WEAPONS CAPABILITY OF IRAN. 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The Islamic Republic of Iran has repeat-
edly stated that its nuclear enrichment pro-gram is solely for peaceful purposes. On Sep-tember 20, 2009, the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, stated that West-ern nations ‘‘falsely accuse the Islamic re-public of producing nuclear weapons. We fun-damentally reject nuclear weapons and pro-hibit the production and the use of nuclear weapons’’. 
(2) President Bill Clinton, on August 5, 
1996, signed the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996, which President Clinton stated was intended to ‘‘limit the flow of resources necessary to obtain weapons of mass destruc-tion’’. 
(3) In his 2006 State of the Union Address, 
President George W. Bush stated that ‘‘[t]he Iranian government is defying the world with its nuclear ambitions, and the nations of the world must not permit the Iranian re-gime to gain nuclear weapons’’. 
(4) As recently as April 2015, President 
Obama reiterated in an interview that ‘‘[m]y goal, when I came into office, was to make sure that Iran did not get a nuclear weapon and thereby trigger a nuclear arms race in the most volatile part of the world’’. 
(5) Secretary of State John Kerry, in the 
confirmation hearing on his nomination for appointment to that position on January 24, 2013, said about the development by Iran of a 
nuclear weapon that ‘‘[o]ur policy is not con-tainment. It is prevention, and the clock is ticking on our efforts to secure responsible compliance’’. 
(6) In a March 2015 letter to Congress, 
President Obama stated that ‘‘[c]ertain ac-tions and policies of the Government of Iran are contrary to the interests of the United States in the region and continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the na-tional security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States’’. 
(7) On March 26, 2015, testifying before the 
Committee on Armed Services of the Senate, Generals Lloyd Austin, David Rodriguez, and Joseph Votel, Commanders of the United States Central Command, the United States Africa Command, and the United States Spe-cial Operations Command, respectively, all agreed that ‘‘in terms of the long-term threat in the region, Iran is the greatest threat to stability’’. 
(8) On February 26, 2015, testifying before 
the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper was asked ‘‘[i]s it still [United States] policy that no options are off the table and that Iran should not have a nu-clear weapon?’’ Director Clapper replied, ‘‘[t]hat’s my understanding, yes sir. [. . .] No option is off the table’’. 
(b) D

policy of the United States that the Islamic Republic of Iran should not obtain nuclear weapons.

I also transmit for the information of the Senate the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia (the ‘‘Treaty’’) to which the Protocol relates, and the De-partment of State’s Overview of the Protocol, which includes a detailed ar-ticle-by-article analysis of both the Protocol and the Treaty. 
Ratification of the Protocol is in the 
best interest of the United States, as it will enhance U.S. security by fur-thering our objective of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons, strengthen our relations with the states and the people of Central Asia, demonstrate our commitment to the decision taken at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons that helped secure that Treaty’s indefinite extension, and contribute significantly to the contin-ued realization of the Central Asian Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in all its aspects. As the Department of State’s Overview of the Protocol explains, entry into force of the Protocol for the United States would require no changes in U.S. law, policy, or practice. 
I recommend that the Senate give 
early and favorable consideration to the Protocol and give its advice and

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
ARMENIAN GENOCIDE 
HON. LINDA T. SA´NCHEZ 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Monday, April 27, 2015 
Ms. LINDA T. SA ´NCHEZ of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the one hundredth anniversary of the Armenian Geno-cide and to honor Armenia for the enormous strides they have made since that unspeak-able tragedy. On April 24, 1915, approximately 1.5 million Armenians suffered the first delib-erate act of systematic mass murder by the Ottoman Empire and the unspeakable crime of genocide was born. I believe we are all mor-ally obligated to never forget this dark episode in history and call for an honest acknowledge-ment of the facts from all parties. 
I would also like to point out that this is also 
an opportunity to celebrate the resiliency of the Armenian people. Armenia has been a great champion of freedom and democracy. I expect our two nations will continue to build on our close ties and support peace and sta-bility in the region. 
Mr. Speaker, I would again like to express 
my sympathy to the survivors and descend-ants of the Armenian Genocide. I hope we can all take time to reflect on this solemn day of remembrance and take this occasion to rein-force our bond and renew our commitment to end tyranny and protect democracy. 
f 
OPPOSITION TO ESTATE TAX 
REPEAL 
HON. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN 
OF MARYLAND  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Monday, April 27, 2015 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, it was 
barely three weeks ago that the Republicans came to the floor with their ‘‘work harder, get less’’ budget. While making everyday life hard-er on working Americans, the Republican budget disinvests in the future of our nation by making deep cuts to education, infrastructure, and scientific research. Under their plan, Americans would face smaller paychecks and have a harder time getting ahead or buying a home; kids would have a harder time affording college; and seniors would have a harder time ensuring a secure retirement, with the end of the Medicare guarantee and immediate higher costs. 
The Republican plan also took budget 
quackery to a new level. Their budget claimed to repeal the ACA, but relied on its revenues and savings in order to claim it balanced in 2025. It made no accounting for the costs of the almost $1 trillion in business tax cuts that Republicans called for in the 113th Congress. The Republican budget also included all the revenue from the current estate tax. 
Today, Republicans are fully abandoning 
any claim to balancing the budget, and show-ing once again that they prioritize wealth over 
hard work. Instead of investing in America in a fiscally responsible way, Republicans want to give the very wealthiest households a $269 billion dollar tax cut by repealing the estate tax, while still refusing to close a single spe-cial-interest loophole to pay for it. 
The estate tax is designed so that it only af-
fects the very wealthiest households. Today, you do not have any estate tax obligation as a couple if your estate is less than $10 million. That means that only 5,500 of America’s rich-est families will pay the estate tax this year. There are cruise ships that hold more people than that. 99.8% of households will never pay it. We do have an estate tax on the amount over $10 million, because we do not believe that people should get ahead just by the wealth they inherited from others—Americans pride themselves on getting ahead through their own hard work. 
But instead of rewarding work, Republicans 
are passing a massive giveaway for just 5,500 of the wealthiest households in the country. The average tax cut will be $3.3 million. Three-quarters of the cost of this bill goes to households with estates over $20 million. For households with estates worth over $50 mil-lion, the average tax cut would be $22.5 mil-lion. And right now, the wealthy have rarely been better off. The top 1% of income-earners now hold 42% of all the wealth in the United States. Last week was the 90th anniversary of The Great Gatsby being published, and we are heading towards levels of wealth con-centration not seen since then. 
And yet, Republicans want to give tax cuts 
to the very richest families without doing any-thing for the middle class. In fact, the Repub-lican budget would raise taxes on American workers—it ends the American Opportunity Tax Credit for higher education, ends the ex-pansions to the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit, does nothing to ex-pand the EITC for childless workers, does nothing to expand tax credits for child or elder-ly care, and does nothing to help two-earner families. This bill also destroys any pretense of the Republicans balancing the budget in ten years. This is not just me talking—the non-partisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said, ‘‘if the estate tax were repealed, the budget would no longer balance.’’ And they did not even take into account the lost revenues from repealing the Affordable Care Act or unpaid for extensions of expiring tax provisions. If you add those altogether, in 2025, the Republican Budget is hundreds of billions of dollars in the red. 
Of course, this is nothing new. In the two 
years of the 113th Congress, the Republicans passed tax bills on the House floor and in the Ways and Means Committee that, including debt service, would have increased the deficit by a trillion dollars. The Republicans in this Congress are doing their very best to surpass even that level of fiscal irresponsibility. When you add up all the tax bills approved by Ways and Means Republicans in this Congress, the debt would grow by $700 billion—and it’s only April! Just today, in addition to the estate tax, 
the Republicans brought another permanent tax extension to the Floor without closing any loophole to pay for it—not the loophole for cor-porate jets, for hedge fund managers, or for shipping jobs overseas. 
The House Democratic Budget is focused 
on the priorities of the American people— boosting the economy to create more broadly shared prosperity, making critical investments in our future, and keeping our promises to seniors. Our plan would grow workers’ pay-checks and provide tax cuts for the middle class and for Americans who are working hard to get by; invest in our infrastructure and transportation network; help students pay for college; support working families and reduce the cost of childcare. And we do it in a fiscally responsible way. 
Today is more proof that Republicans are 
not seeking balance. Rather, they want to cut crucial supports for children and the elderly, voucherize Medicare and cut investments in research and infrastructure, all so that they can give America’s wealthiest families multi- million dollar tax cuts. 
We need to foster shared prosperity and re-
ward hard work, not give a tax cut to multi-mil-lionaires. I urge my colleagues to vote no on H.R. 1105.

HONORING ISRAEL’S 67TH 
INDEPENDENCE DAY 
HON. LOIS FRANKEL 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Monday, April 27, 2015 
Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, 
every year I am reminded of the extraordinary accomplishments of the young State of Israel. See, our birthdays are just a few days apart. This year we both turn sixty-seven. 
When I think of some of my own milestones 
I inherently think about Israel. 
We came into the world at the same time, 
but while I was being cared for by loving par-ents, Israel was forced to fight for its very sur-vival when it was attacked by surrounding Arab armies immediately after declaring inde-pendence in 1948. 
As I entered my college years at Boston 
University in 1967, Israel retook control of the holiest site in Judaism during the Six Day War, allowing Jews to once again pray in the old city of Jerusalem where they have prayed for thousands of years. 
During my days as a law student at George-
town, in the early 1970s, Israel elected an American-born woman, Golda Meir, to lead the country as Prime Minister—one of the first women to ever lead a nation. 
In March of 1979, following the birth of my 
son Ben, Israel reached a ground-breaking treaty with Egypt, ceding the entire Sinai—a landmass larger than the current State of Israel—in exchange for recognition and peace. 
In the early 1990s, as a State Legislator, I 
took my second trip to Israel meeting with

many Ethiopian Jews who were among the 
tens of thousands saved by Israel when they were airlifted to the Democratic Jewish State. 
While I was back in Florida’s Legislature, 
Israel reached yet another critical peace agreement, this time with Jordan, dem-onstrating once again Israel’s enduring com-mitment to ending conflict. 
I remember facing many challenges in my 
next role as Mayor of West Palm Beach but none compared to the daily barrage of terror attacks Israelis suffered during the Second Intifada. 
And over the last few years, while I have 
served in the House of Representatives, Israel has accomplished so much even while faced with the constant threat of rocket attacks from Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah terror in Lebanon, spill-over from the war in Syria, attacks from Sinai in Egypt, and the ire of a possible nu-clear Iran. 
Since its founding Israel has been at a near 
perpetual state of war, yet the resilience of Israeli people has allowed the nation to thrive and contribute so much to the community of nations. 
In a tiny country where 60 percent of the 
land mass is desert, Israelis invented drip irri-gation to make the desert bloom with vine-yards and vegetable farms. They now share that technology with countries in Africa facing water scarcity where millions more people are being fed by cutting water use over 90 per-cent. 
Israel also perfected seawater desalination 
which it is sharing today with California to help them during their drought. In fact, an Israeli company is helping to build what will become the largest desalination plant in the Western Hemisphere just north of San Diego. 
Israel at 67 is a world leader in medicine, 
technology, defense, and energy. It is a coun-try with whom the United States has partnered since President Harry Truman recognized the nascent state just minutes after its founding. And Israel is a country with whom we continue to partner because it represents freedom, de-mocracy, and progress in a region where tyr-anny too often reigns. 
As we celebrate more birthdays together in 
the future, I will do all I can to ensure Israel continues to flourish as a Jewish and demo-cratic state, and that the bond between our two nations never falters. 
Yom Huledet Sameach, happy 67th birthday 
to our enduring ally Israel.

INMAN FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH 
150TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. TREY GOWDY 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Monday, April 27, 2015 
Mr. GOWDY. Mr. Speaker, I submit the fol-
lowing proclamation: 
Whereas, Mount Calvary Baptist Church 
was formed July 28, 1865, with 19 charter members led by Pastor I. L. West; and 
Whereas, after several name changes in 
1915 the name was changed to its present name, Inman First Baptist Church; and Whereas, Inman First Baptist Church con-
tinues to be one of the leading churches in Inman, South Carolina, and under the leader-ship of Dr. Paul Moore the congregation con-tinues to be active and enthusiastic members of our community; and 
Whereas, Inman First Baptist Church is 
celebrating its 150th anniversary this year and this anniversary celebration will draw former and current members to Inman, South Caro-lina, to participate in this momentous mile-stone in the history of their church; 
Now therefore, be it resolved that I, T
REY 
GOWDY , do congratulate the members of 
Inman First Baptist Church in recognition of their 150th anniversary and thank them for their unwavering commitment, dedication, and contributions to Spartanburg County and to the Fourth Congressional District of South Carolina.

IN HONOR OF THE 40TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND’S 1975 NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP LACROSSE TEAM AND COACH BUDDY BEARDMORE 
HON. C.A. DUTCH RUPPERSBERGER 
OF MARYLAND  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Monday, April 27, 2015 
Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today, in honor of the 40th anniversary of The University of Maryland Men’s National Cham-pionship Lacrosse Team of 1975. And it’s dis-tinguished Coach Buddy Beardmore, and his players and coaches, and trainer Jim Weir who has since passed. Buddy brought two Na-tional Championship titles to Maryland, with his now famous ‘‘Be the Best’’ ethos, and brought the lacrosse world into the modern day age, with his weight training, running, and tactics both on and off the field. Their speed and strength and power were something to behold, and they are the benchmark by which any great team is measured today. 
‘‘Be the Best’’ Now beat Hopkins guys!

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE 
HON. STEPHEN F. LYNCH 
OF MASSACHUSETTS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Monday, April 27, 2015 
Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise to join with 
Armenians throughout the United States, Ar-menia, and the world in commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Armenian genocide. This past week, members and friends of the Armenian community gathered to remember April 24, 1915, when the arrest and murder of 200 Armenian politicians, academics, and community leaders in Constantinople marked the beginning of an eight-year campaign of ex-termination against the Armenian people by the Ottoman Empire. Between 1915 and 1923, approximately 1.5 
million Armenians were killed and over 500,000 more were exiled to the desert to die of thirst or starvation. The Armenian genocide was the first mass murder of the 20th century, a century that was sadly to be marked by many similar attempts at racial or ethnic exter-mination, from the Holocaust to the Rwandan genocide to Darfur, Sudan. 
As we solemnly remember the victims of 
this tragedy, let us also celebrate the extraor-dinary strength and spirit of the Armenian peo-ple, who have fought successfully to preserve their culture and identity for over a thousand years. They overcame the horrors of geno-cide, two world wars, and decades of Soviet dominance in order to establish modern Arme-nia. In addition, the vibrant Armenian diaspora continues to thrive and around the world. 
It is only by acknowledging and learning 
from the past that we can build a future free of racial, ethnic, and religious hate and vio-lence. By remembering the Armenian geno-cide and speaking out against all such atroc-ities, we can live up to the promise made to all those who suffered of ‘‘never again.’’

CONGRATULATING THE EL MONTE 
UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT OF EL MONTE 
HON. LINDA T. SA´NCHEZ 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Monday, April 27, 2015 
Ms. LINDA T. SA ´NCHEZ of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the El Monte Union High School District of El Monte, California for receiving the 2015 U.S. Depart-ment of Education Green Ribbon School and District Sustainability Award. El Monte Union High School District was one of just 14 school districts across the country chosen to receive such an award and I am honored to represent them. 
The Green Ribbon award recognizes 
schools and districts that shine in three areas of environmental sustainability. These three areas are: reducing utility cost and environ-mental impact, improving the environmental health on campus including fitness and nutri-tion, and offering effective sustainability edu-cational programs. Schools and districts must excel in all three areas in order to receive the award. 
We have a moral obligation to protect our 
environment. Every one of us should be chip-ping in to help preserve our planet. I am im-mensely proud to represent a school district that has taken this to a new level. The stu-dents, parents, and faculty members should be proud of themselves for their hard work. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the El Monte Union High School District, and the other schools and districts across the country who’ve received this year’s Green Rib-bon School Award. Thank you all for doing your part to preserve our planet.
