PRAYER Reverend Timothy Kesicki, Jesuit Conference, Washington, DC, offered the following prayer: God of all consolation, from whom human sadness is never hidden, we turn to You to be our strength this day. The psalmist proclaims that You are close to the brokenhearted and that You save those crushed in spirit. We pray that You lift the spirit of our Nation this day, and guide those who represent and lead Your people. Help our leaders to find good counsel and give ear to Your holy words. The Book of Proverbs teaches us that: ‘‘For lack of counsel a nation fails, security lies with many advisers.’’ May all who advise, guide, and help to direct our government do so with selfless care. May they put the needs of others before their own cares and lift the burden of those who suffer most. Grant our leaders discerning minds and hearts, so that ‘‘Your will be done’’ today and every day with which You bless us. We pray this with great faith and hope. Amen.

Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Jour-nal stands approved. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The SPEAKER. The question is on the Speaker’s approval of the Journal.

RECOGNIZING PERRY TECHNICAL INSTITUTE AND TYLER ANDRINGA (Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Perry Technical Institute for receiving the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Col-leges’ 2017 School of Excellence Award. Perry Tech has continually provided high-quality education and technical training for students in the Yakima Valley of central Washington, and this award is well deserved. On top of that, I would like to recog-nize Tyler Andringa, who received the commission’s 2017 Outstanding Grad-uate Award. Tyler graduated from Perry Tech in December 2016 with a certificate in information technology and communication systems. Tyler has cerebral palsy and has overcome many challenges to obtain his certificate. He has served as a role model and a leader among his class-mates. Applying the resources and guidance he received at Perry Tech, Tyler is cur-rently employed with Continuant, a telecommunications service provider, where he is succeeding in advancing his career goals. His achievements are commendable, and I wish him the best in his future endeavors. Please join me in congratulating Perry Technical Institute on their achievements as they continue to pro-vide excellent education and job train-ing to equip students just like Tyler Andringa. f 
TAX REFORM (Mr. PETERS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, our tax system is broken and in desperate need of reform. We need a simpler Tax Code that is fiscally responsible, makes American businesses more competitive, and allows working families to prosper in a 21st century economy. But the Ryan-McConnell tax proposal would do the opposite and fails on the promises made by President Trump to boost the middle class. Middle class families would see an average tax in-crease of $1,290 per year. That is a 380 percent increase for an average family of four. A new analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center said that the Ryan- McConnell proposal would add $5.6 tril-lion to the national debt, a 27 percent increase from the current debt which is already too high. Under this proposal, the increased deficits will far outweigh the benefits

of reductions, and economic growth and hardworking Americans will both suffer. Instead, we need forward-looking policies that are fiscally responsible and create opportunities for families and businesses in today’s economy. That will only come from bipartisan negotiations where we can work to-gether to create the best possible tax conditions for Americans. 
f 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL FARM TO SCHOOL MONTH (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute and to re-vise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, October is National Farm to School Month. It is time when we celebrate food education, school gar-dens, and lunch trays filled with healthy, local ingredients. Farm to School brings healthy foods from local farms to schoolchildren na-tionwide. The program teaches stu-dents about the path from farm to fork and instills healthy eating habits that can last a lifetime by introducing chil-dren to real food. At the same time, use of local produce in school meals and edu-cational activities provides a new di-rect market opportunity for family farmers in the area and lessens envi-ronmental impacts of transporting food long distances. More than 31 million children eat a school lunch 5 days a week, 180 days a year. If school lunch can taste great and support the local community, ev-erybody wins. In the early 1990s, there were merely a few Farm to School pro-grams, and today there are thousands. Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Nu-trition Subcommittee, it is encour-aging to see this program grow and our schoolchildren’s diets improving. A lifelong love of healthy, locally grown food from your local farmer is some-thing we can all support. 
f 
GUN VIOLENCE (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, 585, the number of people murdered and injured in Las Vegas on Sunday during the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. his-tory. 477, the number of days since the pre-vious deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history in Orlando. 521, the number of mass shootings since Orlando. 91, the average number of Americans killed by gun violence every day. 69, the number of homicides in Char-lotte in 2017. Zero, the number of actions taken by Congress to address the gun violence epidemic in our country. When is enough enough? What is it going to take for Congress to end gun violence? Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stop wasting time and demand that a joint select committee be established to combat gun violence and the bipar-tisan King-Thompson bill be brought to the floor for a vote. It is time that we had the moral courage to act. Our Nation can’t wait, and they shouldn’t. f 
RECOGNIZING BRETT RUBIN OF BUCKS COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of a brave young man in Bucks County, Pennsyl-vania, Brett Rubin. A resident of Northampton, Brett’s positive attitude and boundless energy make him a promising young leader in our community. This is even more no-table due to the challenges Brett faces from type 1 diabetes. Despite these ob-stacles, Brett has never allowed this illness to define him or hold him back. More amazing, Mr. Speaker, is that Brett has channeled his desire to cure this illness and to help others. Partnering with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, Brett and his mother, Sandy, have raised thousands of dollars to combat type 1 diabetes. Participating in foundation walks, the Rubins join a close-knit group of fam-ily and friends, and they call them-selves Brett’s Band, which is a fitting name honoring a teenager who marches to his own beat and steals the show wherever he goes. It is my honor to recognize this ex-emplary young man. I know Brett’s fu-ture will be bright and that type 1 dia-betes will never interfere with his am-bitions or his aspirations.

SEC. 414. RESERVE FUND FOR COMMERCIALIZA-TION OF AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—In the House of Rep-resentatives, the chair of the Committee on the Budget may adjust, at a time the chair deems appropriate, the section 302(a) alloca-tion to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and other applicable com-mittees of the House of Representatives, ag-gregates, and other appropriate levels estab-lished in this concurrent resolution for a bill or joint resolution, or amendment thereto or conference report thereon, that commer-cializes the operations of the air traffic con-trol system if such measure reduces the dis-cretionary spending limits in section 251(c) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Def-icit Control Act of 1985 by the amount that would otherwise be appropriated to the Fed-eral Aviation Administration for air traffic control.

TITLE V—POLICY STATEMENTS 
SEC. 501. POLICY STATEMENT ON OBAMACARE REPEAL. 
It is the policy of this resolution that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111–148), and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Public Law 111–152) should be repealed. 
SEC. 502. POLICY STATEMENT ON REPLACING OBAMACARE. 
(a) F INDINGS .—The House finds the fol-lowing: (1) Obamacare put Washington’s priorities before those of patients’. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has failed to reduce health care premiums as promised. Instead, the law mandated benefits and coverage levels, deny-ing patients the opportunity to choose the type of coverage that best suits their health needs and driving up health coverage costs. A typical family’s health care premiums were supposed to decline by $2,500; instead, average premiums have increased 105 per-cent. A study conducted by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated premiums to continue rising over the next decade, projecting an average increase of 8 percent per year between 2016 and 2018, and increasing by nearly 60 percent by 2026. (2) President Obama pledged, ‘‘If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan.’’ Instead, CBO now esti-mated 7 million Americans will lose employ-ment-based health coverage due to the health care law, further limiting patient choice. (3) Then-Speaker of the House Pelosi stat-ed that the President’s health care law

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH7854 October 5, 2017 
would create 4 million jobs over the life of the law and almost 400,000 jobs immediately. Instead, CBO estimated that by 2025 Obamacare will reduce the number of hours worked by approximately 2 million full-time equivalent workers, compared with what would have occurred in the absence of the law. Additionally, a study by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University esti-mated that Obamacare will reduce employ-ment by up to 3 percent, or about 4 million full-time equivalent workers. (4) Since the ACA was signed into law, the Obama administration repeatedly failed to implement it as written. President Obama’s unilateral actions resulted in numerous changes, delays, and exemptions. President Obama signed into law another 24 changes made by Congress. The Supreme Court struck down the forced expansion of Med-icaid; ruled the individual ‘‘mandate’’ could only be characterized as a tax to remain con-stitutional; and rejected the requirement that closely held companies provide health insurance to their employees even if it vio-lates the companies’ religious beliefs. More than 7 years after enactment, the courts con-tinue to evaluate the legality of how Presi-dent Obama’s administration implemented the law. All of these changes prove the folly of the underlying law; health care in the United States cannot be run from a central-ized bureaucracy. (5) Obamacare is unaffordable, intrusive, overreaching, destructive, and unworkable. Its complex structure of subsidies, mandates, and penalties perversely impact individuals, married couples, and families. Those who previously had insurance along with those who did not have been funneled into a new system that is providing less access to doc-tors and treatments. Millions of Americans have been added to a broken Medicaid sys-tem that is incapable of providing the care promised. Cuts made to Medicare to fund a new entitlement are undermining the health security of seniors. Taxes and mandates are distorting the insurance market and harm-ing the broader economy, resulting in fewer jobs and less opportunity. By design, Obamacare put Washington at the center of our health care system, at the expense of pa-tients, families, physicians, and businesses. The ACA should be fully repealed, allowing for real patient-centered health care reform that puts patients first, not Washington. (b) P
OLICY ON REPLACING OBAMACARE .—It is the policy of this resolution that Obamacare must not only be repealed, but also replaced by enacting the American Health Care Re-form Act. 
SEC. 503. POLICY STATEMENT ON MEDICARE. 
(a) F INDINGS .—The House finds the fol-lowing: (1) More than 50 million Americans depend on Medicare for their health security. (2) The Medicare Trustees Report has re-peatedly recommended that Medicare’s long- term financial challenges be addressed soon. Each year without reform, the financial con-dition of Medicare becomes more precarious and the threat to those in or near retirement becomes more pronounced. According to the Medicare Trustees Report— (A) the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be exhausted in 2028 and unable to pay sched-uled benefits; (B) Medicare enrollment is expected to in-crease by over 50 percent in the next two decades, as 10,000 baby boomers reach retire-ment age each day; (C) current workers’ payroll contributions pay for current beneficiaries; and (D) most Medicare beneficiaries receive about three dollars in Medicare benefits for every one dollar paid into the program. (3) Failing to address this problem will leave millions of American seniors without adequate health security and younger gen-erations burdened with enormous debt to pay for spending levels that cannot be sustained. (b) POLICY ON MEDICARE REFORM .—It is the policy of this resolution to protect those in or near retirement from any disruptions to their Medicare benefits due to the program’s impending bankruptcy, and instead offer beneficiaries more options, better care, with reduced costs for both benficiaries and the Federal Government, by modernizing Medi-care. (c) A
SSUMPTIONS .—This resolution assumes reform of the Medicare program such that: (1) Medicare is preserved for current and future beneficiaries. (2) Medicare is reformed to provide a pre-mium support payment and a selection of guaranteed health coverage options from which recipients can choose a plan that best suits their needs. (3) Medicare will maintain traditional fee- for-service as an option. (4) Medicare will provide additional assist-ance for lower-income beneficiaries and those with greater health risks. (5) Medicare spending is put on a sustain-able path and the Medicare program becomes solvent over the long-term. (6) The Medicare eligibility age is gradu-ally increased to keep pace with increases in longevity. (7) Medicare is simplified by combining parts A and B and reforms to Medigap plans are implemented. 
SEC. 504. POLICY STATEMENT ON MEDICAID STATE FLEXIBILITY BLOCK GRANTS. 
It is the policy of this resolution that Med-icaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) should be block granted to the States in a manner prescribed by the State Health Flexibility Act. 
SEC. 505. POLICY STATEMENT ON SOCIAL SECU-RITY. 
(a) F INDINGS .—The House finds the fol-lowing: (1) More than 55 million retirees, individ-uals with disabilities, and survivors depend on Social Security. Since enactment, Social Security has served as a vital leg on the ‘‘three-legged stool’’ of retirement security, which includes employer provided benefits as well as personal savings. (2) The Social Security Trustees Report has repeatedly recommended that Social Se-curity’s long-term financial challenges be addressed soon. Each year without reform, the financial condition of Social Security be-comes more precarious and the threat to sen-iors and those receiving Social Security dis-ability benefits becomes more pronounced: (A) In 2022, the Disability Insurance Trust Fund will be exhausted and program reve-nues will be unable to pay scheduled bene-fits. (B) In 2034, the combined Old-Age and Sur-vivors and Disability Trust Funds will be ex-hausted, and program revenues will be un-able to pay scheduled benefits. (C) With the exhaustion of the Trust Funds in 2034, benefits will be cut nearly 25 percent across the board, devastating those cur-rently in or near retirement and those who rely on Social Security the most. (3) The Disability Insurance program pro-vides an income safety net for those with disabilities and their families. However, the program is in serious financial trouble. The number of beneficiaries has skyrocketed from 2.7 million in 1970 to 10.6 million in 2016. At the same time, the labor force participa-tion rate has now fallen to the lowest levels since the 1970s. As a result, the Social Secu-rity Actuary now projects that the Dis-ability Insurance Trust Fund will be de-pleted in 2023. (4) If this program is not reformed, fami-lies who rely on the lifeline that disability benefits provide will face benefit cuts of up to 11 percent in 2023, devastating individuals who need assistance the most. (5) Americans deserve action by the Presi-dent, the House, and the Senate to preserve and strengthen Social Security. It is critical that action be taken to address the looming insolvency of Social Security. (b) POLICY ON SOCIAL SECURITY .—It is the policy of this resolution that Congress should work to make Social Security sustainably solvent. This resolution assumes these reforms will include the following poli-cies, based upon the Social Security Reform Act: (1) Adoption of a more accurate measure for calculating cost of living adjustments. (2) Adoption of adjustments to the full re-tirement age to reflect longevity. (3) Makes Social Security benefits more progressive over the long term, providing those most in need with a safety net in re-tirement. (c) P
OLICY ON DISABILITY INSURANCE .—It is the policy of this resolution that Congress and the President should enact legislation on a bipartisan basis to reform the Disability Insurance program prior to its insolvency in 2016 and should not raid the Social Security retirement system without reforms to the Disability Insurance system. This resolu-tions assumes that reforms to the Disability Insurance program will include— (1) encouraging work; (2) updates of the eligibility rules; (3) reducing fraud and abuse; (4) enactment of H.R. 2031, the Social Secu-rity Disability Insurance and Unemployment Benefits Double Dip Elimination Act, to pro-hibit individuals from drawing benefits from both programs at the same time; and (5) enactment of H.R. 1540, the Social Secu-rity Disability Insurance Return to Work Act, to allow the award of time-limited bene-fits for applicants whose medical recovery is anticipated in order to create new opportuni-ties for beneficiaries. 
SEC. 506. POLICY STATEMENT ON MEANS-TESTED WELFARE PROGRAMS. 
(a) F INDINGS .—The House finds that: (1) Too many people are trapped at the bot-tom rungs of the economic ladder, and every citizen should have the opportunity to rise, escape from poverty, and achieve their own potential. (2) In 1996, President Bill Clinton and con-gressional Republicans enacted reforms that have moved families off of Federal programs and enabled them to provide for themselves. (3) Today, there are approximately 92 Fed-eral programs on which Government at the Federal and State level spend more than $1 trillion annually that provide benefits spe-cifically to poor and low-income Americans. (4) It should be the goal of welfare pro-grams to encourage work and put people on a path to self-reliance. (b) P
OLICY ON MEANS -TESTED WELFARE PRO-
GRAMS .—It is the policy of this resolution that— (1) the welfare system should be reformed to give states flexibility to implement and improve safety net programs and that to be eligible for benefits, able bodied adults with-out dependents should be required to work or be preparing for work, including enrolling in educational or job training programs, con-tributing community service, or partici-pating in a supervised job search; and (2) the President’s budget should disclose, in a clear and transparent manner, the ag-gregate amount of Federal welfare expendi-tures, as well as an estimate of State and local spending for this purpose, over the next ten years.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7855 October 5, 2017 
SEC. 507. POLICY STATEMENT ON REFORM OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION AS-SISTANCE PROGRAM. 
(a) SNAP.—It is the policy of the resolu-tion that the Supplemental Nutrition Assist-ance Program be reformed so that: (1) Nutrition assistance funds should be distributed to the states as a block grant with funding subject to the annual discre-tionary appropriations process. (2) Funds from the grant must be used by the states to establish and maintain a work activation program for able-bodied adults without dependents. (3) It is the goal of this proposal to move those in need off of the assistance rolls and back into the workforce and towards self-suf-ficiency. (b) A
SSUMPTIONS .—This resolution assumes that, pending the enactment of reforms de-scribed in (a), the conversion of the Supple-mental Nutrition Assistance Program into a flexible State allotment tailored to meet each State’s needs. 
SEC. 508. POLICY STATEMENT ON WORK RE-QUIREMENTS. 
It is the policy of this resolution that all means-tested welfare programs should in-clude work activation requirements for able- bodied adults. 
SEC. 509. POLICY STATEMENT ON A CARBON TAX. 
It is the policy of this resolution that a carbon tax would be detrimental to Amer-ican families and businesses, and is not in the best interest of the United States. 
SEC. 510. POLICY STATEMENT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH AND JOB CREATION. 
(a) F INDINGS .—The House finds the fol-lowing: (1) Across the Nation, too many Americans are struggling to make ends meet. The slow-ly falling unemployment rate has masked an underlying crisis as millions of Americans have abandoned the work force and wages have stagnated. The labor force participation rate has plummeted to levels not seen since the Carter presidency. (2) Looking ahead, CBO expects the econ-omy to grow by an average of just 1.9 percent over the next 10 years. That level of eco-nomic growth is simply unacceptable and in-sufficient to expand opportunities and the incomes of millions of middle-income Ameri-cans. (3) Sluggish economic growth has also con-tributed to the country’s fiscal woes. Subpar growth means that revenue levels are lower than they would otherwise be while govern-ment spending (e.g. welfare and income-sup-port programs) is higher. (4) The unsustainable fiscal trajectory has cast a shadow on the country’s economic outlook. investors and businesses make deci-sions on a forward-looking basis. they know that today’s large debt levels are simply to-morrow’s tax hikes, interest rate increases, or inflation and they act accordingly. This debt overhang, and the uncertainty it gen-erates, can weigh on growth, investment, and job creation. (5) Nearly all economists, including those at the CBO, conclude that reducing budget deficits (thereby bending the curve on debt levels) is a net positive for economic growth over time. (6) If the Government remains on the cur-rent fiscal path, future generations will face ever-higher debt service costs, a decline in national savings, and a ‘‘crowding out’’ of private investment. This dynamic will even-tually lead to a decline in economic output and a diminution in our country’s standard of living. (7) The key economic challenge is deter-mining how to expand the economic pie, not how best to divide up and re-distribute a shrinking pie. (8) A stronger economy is vital to lowering deficit levels and eventually balancing the budget. According to CBO, if annual real GDP growth is just 0.1 percentage point higher over the budget window, deficits would be reduced by $273 billion. (9) This budget resolution therefore em-braces pro-growth policies, such as funda-mental tax reform, that will help foster a stronger economy, greater opportunities and more job creation. (b) POLICY ON ECONOMIC GROWTH AND JOB C
REATION .—It is the policy of this resolution to promote faster economic growth and job creation. By putting the budget on a sustain-able path, this resolution ends the debt- fueled uncertainty holding back job creators. Reforms to the tax code will put American businesses and workers in a better position to compete and thrive in the 21st century global economy. This resolution targets the regulatory red tape and cronyism that stack the deck in favor of special interests. All of the reforms in this resolution serve as means to the larger end of helping the economy grow and expanding opportunity for all Americans. 
SEC. 511. POLICY STATEMENT ON TAX REFORM. 
(a) F INDINGS .—The House finds the fol-lowing: (1) A reformed tax code should be simple, fair, and promote (rather than impede) eco-nomic growth. The United States tax code fails on all 3 counts: it is complex, unfair, and inefficient. The tax code’s complexity distorts decisions to work, save, and invest, which leads to slower economic growth, lower wages, and less job creation. (2) High marginal tax rates lessen the in-centives to work, save, and invest, which re-duces economic output and job creation. (3) The United States corporate income tax rate is the highest rate in the industrialized world. Tax rates this high suppress wages, discourage investment and job creation, dis-tort business activity, and put American businesses at a competitive disadvantage with foreign competitors. (4) The ‘‘world-wide’’ structure of United States international taxation essentially taxes earnings of United States firms twice, putting them at a significant competitive disadvantage with competitors that have more competitive international tax systems. (5) The tax code imposes costs on American workers through lower wages, consumers in higher prices, and investors in diminished re-turns. (6) Closing tax loopholes to finance higher spending does not constitute fundamental tax reform. (7) Tax reform should curb or eliminate loopholes and use those savings to lower tax rates across the board, not to fund more wasteful Government spending. Washington has a spending problem, not a revenue prob-lem. (8) Many economists believe that funda-mental tax reform, including a broader tax base and lower tax rates, would lead to greater labor supply and increased invest-ment, which would have a positive impact on total national output. (b) P
OLICY ON TAXREFORM .—It is the pol-icy of this resolution that Congress should enact legislation that provides for a com-prehensive reform of the United States tax code to promote economic growth, create American jobs, increase wages, and benefit American consumers, investors, and workers through fundamental tax reform that is rev-enue-neutral on a dynamic basis that pro-vides for the following: (1) Targets revenue neutrality based on a dynamic score that takes into account the macroeconomic effects of reform. (2) Collapses the current seven brackets for individuals into just three, with a top rate of no more than 33 percent. (3) Simplifies the tax code to ensure that fewer Americans will be required to itemize deductions. (4) Gives equal tax treatment to individual and employer healthcare expenditures mod-eled on the American Health Care Reform Act. (5) Encourages charitable giving. (6) Repeals the Death Tax. (7) Eliminates marriage penalties. (8) Provides tax-free universal savings ac-counts to reward saving. (9) Repeals the alternative minimum tax. (10) Reduces double taxation by lowering the top corporate rate to no more than 20 percent. (11) Reduces the rate for capital gains and dividends. (12) Encourages net investment, savings, and entrepreneurial activity, including full expensing. (13) Moves to a competitive territorial sys-tem of international taxation. (14) Ends distortionary special interest giveaways, such as the Wind Production Tax Credit. SEC. 512. POLICY STATEMENT ON TRADE. 
(a) F INDINGS .—The House finds the fol-lowing: (1) Opening foreign markets to American exports is vital to the United States econ-omy and beneficial to American workers and consumers. (2) The United States can increase eco-nomic opportunities for American workers and businesses through the elimination of foreign trade barriers to United States goods and services. (3) American businesses and workers have shown that, on a level playing field, they can excel and surpass international competition. (b) P
OLICY ON TRADE .—It is the policy of this concurrent resolution— (1) to pursue international trade, global commerce, and a modern and competitive tax system to promote domestic job cre-ation; (2) that the United States should continue to seek increased economic opportunities for American workers and businesses through high-standard trade agreements that satisfy negotiating objectives, including— (A) the expansion of trade opportunities; (B) adherence to trade agreements and rules by the United States and its trading partners, and (C) the elimination of foreign trade bar-riers to United States goods and services by opening new markets and enforcing United States rights; and (3) that any trade agreement entered into on behalf of the United States should reflect the negotiating objectives and adhere to the provisions requiring improved consultation with Congress. 
SEC. 513. POLICY STATEMENT ON ENERGY PRO-DUCTION. 
It is the policy of this resolution that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) and currently unavailable areas of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) should be open for energy exploration and production. 
SEC. 514. POLICY STATEMENT ON FEDERAL REG-ULATORY BUDGETING AND REFORM. 
(a) F INDINGS .—The House finds the fol-lowing: (1) Excessive Federal regulation— (A) has hurt job creation, investment, wages, competition, and economic growth, slowing the Nation’s recovery from the eco-nomic recession and harming American households; (B) operates as a regressive tax on poor and lower-income households;

(C) displaces workers into long-term unem-ployment or lower-paying jobs; (D) adversely affects small businesses, the primary source of new jobs; and (E) impedes economic growth. (2) Federal agencies routinely fail to iden-tify and eliminate, minimize, or mitigate ex-cess regulatory costs through post-imple-mentation assessments of their regulations. (3) The United States Code of Federal Reg-ulations now contains over 185,000 pages of regulations in 242 volumes. (4) Notwithstanding the size and growth of Federal regulations, Congress lacks an effec-tive mechanism to manage the level of new Federal regulatory costs imposed each year. Other nations, meanwhile, have successfully implemented the use of regulatory budgeting to control excess regulation and regulatory costs. (5) Implementation of the Affordable Care Act has resulted in more than 177.9 million annual hours of regulatory compliance pa-perwork, $37.1 billion of regulatory compli-ance costs on the private sector, and $13 bil-lion in regulatory compliance costs on the States. (6) Agencies impose costly regulations without relying on sound science through the use of judicial consent decrees and set-tlement agreements and the abuse of interim compliance costs imposed on regulated enti-ties that bring legal challenges against newly promulgated regulations. (b) P
OLICY ON FEDERAL REGULATORY BUDG-
ETING AND REFORM .—It is the policy of this concurrent resolution that the House should, in consultation with the public, consider leg-islation that— (1) promotes— (A) economic growth, job creation, higher wages, and increased investment by elimi-nating unnecessary red tape and stream-lining, simplifying and lowering the costs of Federal regulations; and (B) the adoption of least-cost regulatory alternatives to meet the objectives of Fed-eral regulatory statutes; (2) protects— (A) the poor and lower-income households from the regressive effects of excessive regu-lation; and (B) workers against the unnecessary elimi-nation of jobs and loss or reduction of wages; (3) requires— (A) an annual, congressional regulatory budget that establishes annual costs of regu-lations and allocates these costs amongst Federal regulatory agencies; (B) cost-benefit and regulatory impact analysis for new regulations proposed and promulgated by all Federal regulatory agen-cies; (C) advance notice of proposed rulemaking and makes evidentiary hearings available for critical disputed issues in the development of new major regulations; and (D) congressional approval of all new major regulations before the regulations can become effective, ensuring that Congress can better prevent the imposition of unsound costly new regulations; (4) reduces— (A) regulatory barriers to entry into mar-kets and other regulatory impediments to competition and innovation; and (B) the imposition of new Federal regula-tion that duplicates, overlaps or conflicts with State, local, and Tribal regulation or that impose unfunded mandates on State, local, and Tribal governments; and (5) eliminates the abuse of guidance to evade legal requirements applicable to the development and promulgation of new regu-lations. SEC. 515. POLICY STATEMENT ON FEDERAL FUNDING OF ABORTION. 
It is the policy of this resolution that no taxpayer dollars shall go to any entity that provides abortion services. 
SEC. 516. POLICY STATEMENT ON TRANSPOR-TATION REFORM. 
It is the policy of this resolution that State and local officials are in a much better position to understand the needs of local commuters, not bureaucrats in Washington. Federal funding for transportation should be phased down and limited to core Federal du-ties, including the interstate highway sys-tem, transportation infrastructure on Fed-eral land, responding to emergencies, and re-search. As the level of Federal responsibility for transportation is reduced, Congress should also concurrently reduce the Federal gas tax. 
SEC. 517. POLICY STATEMENT ON THE DEPART-MENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. 
(a) F INDINGS .—The House finds the fol-lowing: (1) For years, there has been serious con-cern regarding the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) bureaucratic mismanagement and continuous failure to provide veterans timely access to health care. (2) In 2015, for the first time, VA health care was added to Government Account-ability Office’s (GAO) ‘‘high-risk’’ list, due to mismanagement and oversight failures, which have resulted in untimely and ineffi-cient health care. According to GAO, ‘‘the absence of care and delays in providing care have harmed veterans.’’. (3) The VA’s failure to provide timely and accessible health care to our veterans is un-acceptable. While Congress has done its part for more than a decade by providing suffi-cient funding for the VA, the administration has mismanaged these resources, resulting in proven adverse effects on veterans and their families. (b) P
OLICY ON THE DEPARTMENT OF VET-
ERANS AFFAIRS .—It is the policy of this con-current resolution that— (1) the House Committee on Veterans’ Af-fairs continue its oversight efforts to ensure the VA reassesses its core mission, includ-ing— (A) reducing the number of bureaucratic layers; (B) reducing the number of senior and mid-dle managers; (C) improving performance measure metrics; (D) strengthening the administration and oversight of contractors; and (E) supporting opportunities for veterans to pursue other viable options for their health care needs; and (2) the House Committee on Veterans’ Af-fairs and the Committee on the Budget should continue to closely monitor the VA’s progress to ensure VA resources are suffi-cient and efficiently provided to veterans. 
SEC. 518. POLICY STATEMENT ON REDUCING UN-NECESSARY, WASTEFUL, AND UNAU-THORIZED SPENDING. 
(a) F INDINGS .—The House finds the fol-lowing: (1) The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is required by law to identify exam-ples of waste, duplication, and overlap in Federal programs, and has so identified doz-ens of such examples. (2) In its report to Congress on Govern-ment Efficiency and Effectiveness, the Comptroller General has stated that address-ing the identified waste, duplication, and overlap in Federal programs could ‘‘lead to tens of billions of dollars of additional sav-ings.’’ (3) In 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, the GAO issued reports showing exces-sive duplication and redundancy in Federal programs. (4) Federal agencies reported an estimated $137 billion in improper payments in fiscal year 2015. (5) Under clause 2 of rule XI of the Rules of the House of Representatives, each standing committee must hold at least one hearing during each 120-day period following its es-tablishment on waste, fraud, abuse, or mis-management in Government programs. (6) Clause 2(a)(1) of rule XXI of the House of Representatives prohibits an appropria-tion for an expenditure not previously au-thorized by law. Despite this longstanding prohibition, more than $310 billion has been appropriated for unauthorized programs in fiscal year 2016, spanning 256 separate laws. (7) The findings resulting from congres-sional oversight of Federal Government pro-grams should result in programmatic changes in both authorizing statutes and program funding levels. (b) POLICY ON REDUCING UNNECESSARY , W
ASTEFUL , ANDUNAUTHORIZED SPENDING .— (1) Each authorizing committee annually should include in its Views and Estimates letter required under section 301(d) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 rec-ommendations to the Committee on the Budget of programs within the jurisdiction of such committee whose funding should be reduced or eliminated. (2) Committees of jurisdiction should re-view all unauthorized programs funded through annual appropriations to determine if the programs are operating efficiently and effectively. (3) Committees should reauthorize those programs that in the committees’ judgment should continue to receive funding. (4) For those programs not reauthorized by committees, the House of Representatives should enforce the limitations on funding such unauthorized programs in the House rules. 
SEC. 519. POLICY STATEMENT ON A BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT. 
(a) F INDINGS .—The House finds the fol-lowing: (1) The Government will collect approxi-mately $3.4 trillion in taxes, but spend near-ly $4 trillion to maintain its operations, bor-rowing 14 cents of every Federal dollar spent. (2) As of March 16, 2017, the national debt of the Unites States was nearly $20 trillion. (3) A majority of States have petitioned the Government to hold a constitutional convention to adopt a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. (4) Forty nine States have fiscal limita-tions in their State constitutions, including the requirement to annually balance the budget. (5) Five States, including Arizona, Georgia, Alaska, Mississippi, and North Dakota, have agreed to the Compact for a Balanced Budg-et, which is seeking to amend the Constitu-tion to require a balanced budget through an Article V convention by April 12, 2021. (b) P
OLICY ON A BALANCED BUDGET CON-
STITUTIONAL AMENDMENT .—It is the policy of this concurrent resolution that Congress should propose a balanced budget constitu-tional amendment for ratification by the States. 
SEC. 520. POLICY STATEMENT ON DEFICIT RE-DUCTION THROUGH THE CANCELLA-TION OF UNOBLIGATED BALANCES. 
(a) F INDINGS .—The House finds the fol-lowing: (1) According to the most recent estimate from the Office of Management and Budget, Federal agencies held $921 billion in unobli-gated balances at the end of fiscal year 2017. (2) These funds comprise both discre-tionary appropriations and authorizations of mandatory spending that remain available for expenditure.

(3) In many cases, agencies are provided appropriations that remain indefinitely available for obligation. (4) The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 requires the Office of Management and Budg-et to make funds available to agencies for obligation and prohibits the administration from withholding or cancelling unobligated funds unless approved by an Act of Congress. (b) P
OLICY ON DEFICIT REDUCTION THROUGH  
THE CANCELLATION OF UNOBLIGATED BAL-
ANCES .—It is the policy of this concurrent resolution that— (1) greater congressional oversight is re-quired to review and identify potential sav-ings from canceling unobligated balances of funds that are no longer needed; (2) the appropriate committees in the House should identify and review accounts with unobligated balances and rescind such balances that would not impede or disrupt the fulfillment of important Federal com-mitments; (3) the House, with the assistance of the Government Accountability Office, the In-spectors General, and appropriate agencies, should continue to review unobligated bal-ances and identify savings for deficit reduc-tion; and (4) unobligated balances in dormant ac-counts should not be used to finance in-creases in spending. 
SEC. 521. POLICY STATEMENT ON REFORMING THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET PROCESS. 
(a) F INDINGS .—The House finds the fol-lowing: (1) Enactment of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 was the first step toward restoring constitu-tionally endowed legislative responsibility over fundamental budget decision making. (2) However, the congressional budget proc-ess has neither constrained spending nor in-hibited the expansion of Government. The growth of the Government, primarily through a multiplicity of mandatory pro-grams and other forms of direct spending, has largely been financed through borrowing and high tax rates. (3) The enforcement of the current budget process, including congressional points of order and statutory spending limits, have been too often waived or circumvented. This contributes to a lack of accountability, which has led to broad agreement that re-forming the system is a high necessity. (b) P
OLICY ON REFORMING THE CONGRES -
SIONAL BUDGET PROCESS .—It is the policy of this concurrent resolution that Congress should— (1) restructure the fundamental procedures of budget decision making; (2) reassert congressional power over spending and revenue, restore the balance of power between Congress and the President as the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 in-tended, and attain the maximum level of ac-countability for budget decisions through ef-ficient and rigorous enforcement of budget rules; (3) improve incentives for lawmakers to budget as intended by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, especially by adopting an annual budget resolution; (4) encourage more effective control over spending, especially currently uncontrolled direct spending; (5) revise the methodology used in devel-oping the baseline, which is intended to re-flect an objective projection of the budg-etary effects of current laws and policies for future fiscal years, by removing any tend-ency toward assuming higher spending lev-els; (6) promote efficient and timely budget ac-tions to ensure lawmakers complete their budget actions before the start of the new fiscal year; (7) provide access to the best analysis of economic conditions available and increase awareness of how fiscal policy directly im-pacts economic growth and job creation; and (8) eliminate the complexity of the budget process and the biases that favor higher spending. (c) LEGISLATION .—The Committee on the Budget of the House should draft legislation during the 115th Congress that rewrites the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to fulfill the goals of making the congressional budget process more effective in ensuring taxpayers’ dollars are spent wisely and efficiently. Such legis-lation shall— (1) attain greater simplicity without sacri-ficing the rigor required to address— (A) the complex issues of the domestic and world economy; (B) national security responsibilities; and (C) the appropriate roles of rulemaking and statutory enforcement mechanisms; (2) establish a new structure that assures the congressional role in the budget process is applied consistently without reliance on reactive legislating; (3) improve the elements of the current budget process that have fulfilled the origi-nal purposes of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974; and (4) rebuild the foundation of the budget process to provide a solid basis from which additional reforms may be developed. 
SEC. 522. POLICY STATEMENT ON FEDERAL AC-COUNTING. 
(a) F INDINGS .—The House finds the fol-lowing: (1) Current accounting methods fail to cap-ture and present in a compelling manner the full scope of the Government and its fiscal situation. (2) Most fiscal analyses produced by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) are con-ducted over a 10-year time horizon. The use of generational accounting or a longer time horizon would provide a more complete pic-ture of the Government’s fiscal situation. (3) The Federal budget currently accounts for most programs on a cash accounting basis, which records revenue and expenses when cash is actually paid or received. How-ever, it accounts for loan and loan guarantee programs on an accrual basis, which records revenue when earned and expenses when in-curred. (4) The Government Accountability Office has advised that accrual accounting may provide a more accurate estimate of the Gov-ernment’s liabilities than cash accounting for some programs, specifically insurance programs. (5) Accrual accounting under the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) under-states the risk and thus the true cost of some Federal programs, including loans and loan guarantees. (6) Fair value accounting better reflects the risk associated with Federal loan and loan guarantee programs by using a market based discount rate. CBO, for example, uses fair value accounting to measure the cost of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. (7) In comparing fair value accounting to FCRA, CBO has concluded that ‘‘adopting a fair-value approach would provide a more comprehensive way to measure the costs of Federal credit programs and would permit more level comparisons between those costs and the costs of other forms of Federal as-sistance’’. (8) This concurrent resolution directs CBO to estimate the costs of credit programs on a fair value basis to fully capture the risk as-sociated with Federal credit programs. (b) POLICY ON FEDERAL ACCOUNTING METH-
ODOLOGIES .—It is the policy of this concur-rent resolution that the House should, in consultation with CBO and other appropriate stakeholders, reform government-wide budg-et and accounting practices so Members and the public can better understand the fiscal situation of the United States and the op-tions best suited to improving it. 
SEC. 523. POLICY STATEMENT ON AGENCY FEES AND SPENDING. 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress finds the fol-lowing: (1) A number of Federal agencies and orga-nizations have permanent authority to col-lect fees and other offsetting collections and to spend these collected funds. (2) The total amount of offsetting fees and offsetting collections is estimated by the Of-fice of Management and Budget to be $513 billion in fiscal year 2017. (3) Agency budget justifications are, in some cases, not fully transparent about the amount of program activity funded through offsetting collections or fees. This lack of transparency prevents effective and account-able government. (b) P
OLICY ON AGENCY FEES AND SPEND -
ING.—It is the policy of this resolution that Congress must reassert its constitutional prerogative to control spending and conduct oversight. To do so, Congress should enact legislation requiring programs that are fund-ed through fees, offsetting receipts, or offset-ting collections to be allocated new budget authority annually. Such allocation may arise from— (1) legislation originating from the author-izing committee of jurisdiction for the agen-cy or program; or (2) fee and account specific allocations in-cluded in annual appropriation Acts. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 553, the gentleman from California (Mr. M
CCLINTOCK ) and a Member opposed each will control 15 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3
1⁄2minutes. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to present the Republican Study Commit-tee’s 2018 budget, Securing America’s Future Economy. This proposal combines savings that have been proposed by the Congres-sional Budget Office, many RSC mem-bers, and public policy think tanks, in-cluding The Heritage Foundation, Citi-zens Against Government Waste, and the National Taxpayers Union. It is based on a simple principle that gov-ernment should spend its money as carefully as families spend what they have left after they have paid their taxes. By restraining the growth of spend-ing and refocusing resources on core government responsibilities, adopting commonsense reforms, and placing Medicare and Social Security back on sound financial footing, we believe there is still time to save this country from financial and economic ruin. But time is running out. On our current course, the Congres-sional Budget Office warns that, within 4 years, our deficits will balloon to $1 trillion annually, adding about $8,000 a year to an average family’s debt that they will have to pay off in future taxes. Two years after that, interest on

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH7858 October 5, 2017 
the national debt will reach $654 bil-lion. That is more than we currently spend for the entire defense establish-ment. Let me repeat that so it sinks in. Six years from now, we will spend more than our current defense budget ac-complishing nothing but renting the money that we have already borrowed and spent. Three years later, Medicare will collapse. Six years after that—if we get that far—Social Security runs out of money. This approaching crisis can be de-scribed with just three numbers: 26, 35, and 49. Once you understand those three numbers—26, 35, and 49—you can plainly see the root of our problems. Twenty-six percent is the combined population and inflation growth over the past 10 years. Thirty-five percent is the growth in Federal revenues. Clear-ly, this is not a revenue problem. The problem is that third number. Forty- nine percent is the growth in spend-ing—nearly twice the rate of inflation and population combined. We are about to hear about the dra-conian cuts from the opposition. Let me emphasize, the RSC budget con-tinues to grow the Federal Government every year. I repeat, the RSC budget spends more every year. Over the decade, we have provided for more than $1 trillion of government growth. Only in Washington can that be described as a cut. The RSC budget merely restrains the growth of spend-ing over the next decade to give fami-lies the time and room to catch up. b0915 By doing so, we can arrest the ruin-ous spiral of debt and interest costs that now threaten the very solvency of our Nation. This budget gores a lot of sacred cows, because we want to point out the wide range of savings available to achieve. But I would ask the opponents of this budget to consider one thing as we race toward the looming fiscal cri-sis just 4 years down the road: you can-not provide for the common defense or general welfare or do all of the other things our government is called upon to do if you cannot pay for them. Our mountainous debt, driven by out-of- control spending, now threatens our ability to do so. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Kentucky is recognized for 15 minutes. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Chairman, I am going to cut to the chase: the Republican Study Com-mittee budget is so extreme, it cannot be taken seriously. It cuts spending by $10 trillion over 10 years, which is $4 trillion more than the already irre-sponsible spending cuts in Chairman B
LACK ’s budget. To its credit, the RSC tells us where those cuts will come from, rather than leaving large amounts unspecified or using matching asterisks or phony eco-nomic assumptions to reduce spending. The RSC budget cuts Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. It cuts pro-grams that ensure basic living stand-ards, protect the environment, and help families afford college. For 2018, the RSC budget matches the President’s level for defense, including war funding. But for nondefense discre-tionary spending, the RSC budget pro-vides $394 billion, which is $122 billion, or 24 percent, below the austerity cap. There is no way this House or any House would approve an appropriations bill that inflicted a 24 percent cut on all government operations. If just two programs—veterans’ programs and NIH funding—were excluded from those cuts, everything else would be cut by more than 55 percent. So yes, this budget claims to reach balance, but it would achieve it by making cuts that would be cata-strophic. Not even Congress is that self-destructive. I contend that the two Republican budgets actually show how dismissing the notion that revenues must be a part of any solution to restrain deficits and debt, compounded with the flawed notion that balance must be achieved in the short term, will inflict intoler-able hardship on the American people. While totally unintentional, they make a pretty compelling case that for Congress to responsibly address our debts and deficits, while funding the Federal programs and investments that the American people want and expect, raising revenues has to be part of the equation. One of the things that amuses me, in a very kind of dark way, is that I re-member so well, in 2010, when Repub-licans actually rode to victory in the House by claiming that we Democrats were going to cut $750 billion out of Medicare. That wasn’t true, but they claimed it. Now, in this Republican Study Com-mittee budget, they have doubled down on that. It is not exactly double, but they are going to cut it by $898 billion. I don’t think America’s seniors and the disabled population would feel very good about that. I would like to thank my colleagues for bringing that important issue to the debate. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. W
ALKER ), the chairman of the Republican Study Committee. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Chairman, $20.2 trillion. Our national debt is more than $20.2 trillion. Let’s put it this way: each Ameri-can’s share of the national debt is $62,000. From the retiree in North Caro-lina who has already done so much to serve the country, to the newborn child in New York with so much potential, that is $62,000. In fact, it is more than the median American family brings home in an entire year. Our debt continues to mount, even as Federal reserves reach record highs. This leads to an undeniable conclusion, even from Captain Obvious: the Federal Government has a spending problem. The growing Federal Government has significant negative consequences for the country and its people. The large Federal debt reduces investment, pro-ductivity, and wages, while Federal interventions in the economy reduce the incentive to work, resulting in a shrinking labor market. The debt can have dangerous implica-tions for our national security, re-cently causing a bipartisan group of leading national security officials to write that ‘‘our long-term debt is the single greatest threat to our national security.’’ Most fundamentally, when the Fed-eral Government is too big and too in-trusive, it interferes with our unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Eleven months ago, the American people voted to give Republicans uni-fied control of government. Now it is time to follow through and implement the policy agenda that Congress and the President were elected on. As the calendar moves into fall, the grade of the 115th Congress will be de-livered on whether we can reform our inefficient Tax Code. This process starts with the budget. Along with re-pealing ObamaCare and securing our border, the Republican Study Com-mittee budget allows us to fulfill these promises, and more. This fiscal year 2018 RSC budget en-sures a strong national security, robust economic growth, equal opportunity for all, a sustainable social safety net, and a return to constitutionally lim-ited government, all with a goal of se-curing America’s future economy. Instead of a future of high debt and low growth, the RSC budget proposes a positive blueprint for success and op-portunity. Our budget focuses on progrowth, profamily policies that will boost America’s economy and provide a strong fiscal foundation for genera-tions to come. Mr. Chairman, in closing, I would like to thank my friend, Mr. MCCLIN-
TOCK , for his leadership of the RSC budget task force, as well as all the members of the Republican Study Committee who participated in this ef-fort. With this budget, we have accom-plished our goals of detailing the vari-ety of bold policy solutions, as well as helping to influence the balanced budg-et offered by my friend, Chairman B
LACK , to include meaningful, enforce-able, reconciliation targets, as the RSC budget does, so that we can begin the essential task of implementing these policies into law. My fellow Members, when will our debt matter? Next year? The year after?

In 6 years, we are projected to spend more than $650 billion on interest alone on our debt. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from North Carolina. Mr. WALKER. What will it take for our friends on the left to stop hijacking the American Dream for our children and grandchildren? Is it not a moral in-justice to leave this level of debt to the next generation? Mr. Chairman, we have been making this argument in the House for years. Today, it is time to make a difference. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Chairman, it is fascinating to have this debate and speaking in such high-principled ways about the need to reduce deficits and debt. I don’t think any Democrat would argue that we need to do something to reduce deficits and debt. We face a very dire, long- term fiscal future. But we also lose sight of the fact that the American people expect something from their government. They expect our government to keep them safe, but they also expect their government to protect their drinking water, protect their air, to make sure that the food they eat is not dangerous, to provide law enforcement and help local law en-forcement to do many things. The budget, as well as Chairman B
LACK ’s committee budget, would deci-mate all of those services that the American people expect from the Fed-eral Government. I think only about what is going on right now with Houston, Florida, Puer-to Rico, and the Virgin Islands and the enormous cost that the Federal Gov-ernment is going to have to bear to help restore those communities and those territories to some degree of nor-malcy. That is what they expect the American Government to do. These budgets would make that all but im-possible. So we look at it both ways. Later, we will propose a Democratic alternative that actually makes those kind of in-vestments and makes sure that the no-tion of American security is not just a huge military, but is a foundation of investment in human capital and re-search and infrastructure that will allow this economy to grow. We do it with keeping debt at the same percent-age of the economy, as it is now, be-cause we are willing to raise revenues. On the other hand, Republican budg-ets, both the Republican Study Com-mittee budget and the chairman’s budget, anticipate enormous tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and cor-porations—tax cuts that have been proven to do exactly the opposite of what many on the other side claim they do, which is to stimulate eco-nomic growth. We will hear claims that, yes, we can cut taxes by $2 trillion or $3 trillion over 10 years, and they are going to be paid for by this renewal of economic activity. But history tells us that is not what happens. Not only history tells us that, but virtually all the economists in the country tell us that, too. Goldman Sachs, Steve Mnuchin’s pre-vious employer, says that the tax cuts outlined last week would maybe create an additional 0.2 percent of growth in the economy. CBO and the Federal Reserve say tax cuts don’t pay for themselves. Even Bruce Bartlett, the author of ‘‘Reagan-omics,’’ says this whole notion that tax cuts pay for themselves is nonsense. He actually said bull, which is half of what he said, but you get the idea. This is not easy. We can speak in the darkest terms of how we are imposing this debt on our grandchildren and try to use emotional arguments. But the fact is, we are dealing with a very real-istic, pragmatic dilemma, and that is: how to do what the American people expect us to do without making the fu-ture impossible. It is not done by the Republican budgets. We think it is helped along by the Democratic alternative, and we look forward to having that debate just a little bit later this morning. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Chairman, I would remind my friend from Kentucky that Ronald Reagan reduced the Federal income tax rate from 70 percent down to 28 per-cent, and income tax revenues doubled. He is correct that we expect things from our government. We have seen a 49 percent increase in spending in the last decade. Have we seen a 49 percent increase in the quality of education or a 49 percent increase in our infrastruc-ture or our defense capability? What we have seen is a 49 percent in-crease in bureaucracy and government. I would remind the gentleman that when we squander the people’s money, we rob them of the means to meet the disasters and unforeseen circumstances that confront our country. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. F
LO-
RES), my friend and former chairman of the Republican Study Committee. Mr. FLORES. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I want to go off script for a little bit and echo the comments the gentleman was making. He talked about the Reagan tax cuts and what they did to stimulate the economy and to grow tax revenues and to allow hardworking American fami-lies to keep more of their paychecks. I would also go on to remind the gen-tleman from Kentucky, to disabuse him about his views of tax reform, and remind him that President John F. Kennedy, a Democrat, reduced the top marginal rates from 93 percent to 73 percent. The economy grew, more jobs were created, and more revenue was created for the Federal Government. Mr. Chairman, the Federal Govern-ment doesn’t have a revenue problem. It has a spending problem. That is what we tackle with the Republican Study Committee budget. I thank Mr. MCCLINTOCK for his in-credible and insightful leadership in generating the FY 2018 RSC budget that we are now considering. The House Budget Committee’s budg-et proposals continue to benefit from the framework of the RSC budget by including meaningful, enforceable rec-onciliation targets, as our budget does. The House budget will begin the essen-tial task of implementing these poli-cies into law. Other instances where the RSC-led budget proposals have historically wound up being adopted in the larger House budget include the following: First, balancing the budget within a 10-year budget window. Two, including policies to ensure the solvency of entitlement programs, such as Social Security, Medicare, and also Medicaid. Number three, providing the nec-essary funding and resources for a ro-bust national security. Number four, fully repealing ObamaCare. Number five, establishing a pathway to progrowth tax reform that will jump-start our economy and help hard-working American families take home more of their paychecks. I was humbled to serve as the chair-man of the RSC during the 114th Con-gress. At that time, we generated a new budget for fiscal year 2017, called the Blueprint for a Balanced Budget 2.0. It was written and released in the spring of 2016. Like the current RSC budget, it pro-vided a robust agenda of conservative policies to show the American people our vision for this Nation. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. FLORES. In the tradition of The Heritage Foundation’s 1980 mandate for leadership that provided a policy agen-da for the incoming Reagan adminis-tration, our Blueprint for a Balanced Budget 2.0 for the new President and his administration set forth an agenda for governing in 2017. b0930 By all accounts, the RSC budget has proven successful in achieving this goal, with President Trump basing many of the policies for his fiscal 2018 budget request on the RSC’s fiscal 2017 budget. I am pleased to see that many RSC- led proposals are included in both the President’s budget and the House budg-et that we will consider later today. In the coming years, I look forward to continuing to see the RSC putting forth and leading on many conserv-ative, sound policy ideas for our budg-etary process.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH7860 October 5, 2017 
Mr. Chairman, I urge all our col-leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the RSC budg-et and to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the House GOP budget. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Chairman, I feel like I have to be Paul Harvey for a sec-ond and talk about the rest of the story. Because while what Mr. M
CCLINTOCK  said was true about the initial phases of the Reagan administration, at the end of the Reagan administration, the national debt had almost tripled, and he had been forced to raise taxes a cou-ple of times in the interim. So, again, we can argue about how positive cutting taxes were in the Reagan administration, but the end re-sult wasn’t particularly good for the American economy. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. S
CHAKOWSKY ), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Chairman, who wins in the Republican budget? Same old same old; millionaires, bil-lionaires, large corporations. The Re-publican budget paves the way for their plan, which gives 80 percent of its tax cuts to the top 1 percent of Americans, while 30 percent of middle class house-holds making between $50,000 and $150,000 a year would actually see a tax increase. This is according to the non-partisan Tax Policy Center. It slashes $1.5 trillion from Medicare and Medicaid, even worse than TrumpCare, and it ends the guarantee of Medicare benefits for American sen-iors. It attacks women’s health by defunding, of course, Planned Parent-hood, once again. It slashes SNAP— SNAP, the Food Stamp program—by $154 billion, taking nutrition assistance away from up to 7 million households. Did you really come to Congress to take food out of the mouths of hungry children? Now we are considering the Repub-lican Study Committee budget, which includes even deeper cuts for children and families and seniors while giving tax cuts to the wealthy. My Democratic colleagues and I offer A Better Deal for America. The United States is the richest country in the world at the richest time in history. We can have quality healthcare, afford-able childcare, debt-free college, secure retirement, and world-class infrastruc-ture, but not if we give massive tax cuts to the wealthiest individuals and corporations. So I urge my colleagues to reject the RSC budget, reject the Republican budget, and to support the Democratic alternative. Americans deserve a budg-et that grows our middle class and in-vests in our future. I want to read just one paragraph of a letter from Planned Parenthood that says: ‘‘The House Budget Resolution proposes cuts that would be disastrous for women, men, and young people Planned Parenthood sees every day. It sacrifices access to healthcare, repeal-ing the Affordable Care Act, gutting Medicaid, and proposing even deeper cuts to low-income nondefense discre-tionary spending. It undermines access to critical reproductive healthcare, in-cluding no copay birth control, for mil-lions of women.’’ The women of America are watching. This budget is a particular disaster for them, for us. Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. P
ALMER ). Mr. PALMER. Mr. Chairman, Article I, section 9 of the Constitution grants Congress the power of the purse. This assigns to Congress the role of final ar-biter of the use of public funds. Despite this clear declaration of power, the Office of Management and Budget estimates that agencies col-lected over $513 billion in fines, fees, penalties, and other offsetting collec-tions and receipts in fiscal year 2017. Allowing agencies to have slush funds outside of the normal appropriations process is a recipe for bad acting. The RSC budget calls for imple-menting the Agency Accountability Act, which directs that all fines, fees, and settlements go to the Treasury, making them subject to the normal ap-propriations process. This would end the agencies’ ability to operate inde-pendently and outside of the oversight of Congress. More importantly, it would allow Congress to fully account for how much money the government actually collects and where that money is coming from. I am also pleased that the RSC budg-et does what is increasingly becoming an impossible task: it balances the budget, all while prioritizing defense spending to keep this country secure. This budget sets forth the bold ideas necessary to put the country back on a path of fiscal responsibility. The Congressional Budget Office re-ports that if we stay on the current ir-responsible fiscal path we are on, by 2047, in 30 years, our debt to GDP will be 150 percent. Stated more simply, our debt will be 50 percent greater than our entire gross domestic product. We must put our Nation back on a path of fiscal responsibility, and the RSC budget does exactly that. As former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullin warned, our na-tional debt is the greatest threat to our national security. By putting our Nation on a sensible fiscal path of bal-ancing the budget, we reduce the ex-tremely heavy burden that a bloated Federal Government places on Amer-ica’s working families, allowing them to prosper and making the government less intrusive in their lives. I would also like to add extempo-raneously in regard to what we are doing on SNAP benefits. What we are doing is imposing work requirements on able-bodied adults with no children. I want to repeat: able-bodied adults with no children. I think most Ameri-cans would agree that if they are get-ting payments from the Federal Gov-ernment, they ought to at least do some work. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. WELCH ), a distinguished member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chairman, I want to state to my colleagues on this budget that there are two fundamental as-sumptions that are being made that need to be challenged. One, you are saying that we have a spending problem, not a revenue prob-lem. This country is spending on do-mestic priorities and defense at a level that existed when the President of the United States was Dwight D. Eisen-hower, and that was before Medicaid and Medicare. We have a significant issue about how we are going to meet the needs of the people of this country, both on de-fense, where we need some help, but definitely on the domestic side as well. The second assumption that you are making—and it is an assertion that is made over and over again—is that tax cuts will pay for themselves. That is the theology of your budget: tax cuts pay for themselves. You know, why not go to zero, and we will all be rich? That is essentially what is being said here. But the tax cuts are always at the high end of the income spectrum, which is exacerbating inequality and creating a problem for us to meet es-sential needs in this country. So this question of tax cuts paying for themselves and fiscal responsi-bility, let’s have a little bit of history here. This was the theology of George Bush when he passed the tax cuts when he became President. They did not pay for themselves. We went from the Clin-ton-era surpluses to the Bush-era defi-cits, and in another fiscally, grossly ir-responsible move, he put the war on the credit card. The war was on the credit card. We had unpaid-for tax cuts and we had an unpaid-for war. And this is not just fis-cal responsibility; this is govern-mental, personal, congressional irre-sponsibility. You have got to pay for things. Whether it is the war or it is food stamps or it is any program that you want to pick, you have got to pay for it. You don’t pay for it by the magic as-terisk of saying, ‘‘the tax cuts that we propose,’’ when we are going to spend by cutting taxes or going into a war that we don’t pay for, $1 trillion, it doesn’t work. And that is why we are in this path that is very dangerous with respect to the long-term debt. I believe in that. We have got to pay our bills. When we had the majority, we had a doctrine that said: Pay as you go. If any Democrat, the budget chair, or me wanted to propose some spending, we either had to come up with the rev-enue or we had to cut somewhere else. I believe in that. But I don’t believe in unpaid-for tax cuts paying for themselves. I don’t be-lieve that more spending pays for itself

and we can just put it on the credit card. Now, we have got some problems and challenges in this country. We have got an opportunity problem. The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from Vermont. Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chairman, kids going to school get out with a debt the size of a mortgage. We have got an in-equality problem. It has never been worse. It goes back to the Great De-pression, when we had this divide be-tween what hardworking people made and what the top 1 percent made. We have got a healthcare afford-ability problem, but you don’t solve that by slashing access to healthcare and throwing 24 million people off of healthcare. We have got an infrastruc-ture problem that we are totally ne-glecting. It is not addressed in this budget. We have got a DREAMer problem. How is it that, in this Congress, we are literally not allowing 800,000 young people who came here, through no fault of their own, not voluntarily, and we are going to give them the hook and deport them? It is outrageous? We have got a rural America prob-lem. Rural America has been left be-hind. The inequality in this country is really hitting hard on rural America, in parts of Vermont, and in all parts of this country. And there is nothing in this budget that says: We are going to give hope to rural America by invest-ing in them. Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. R
YAN), the Speaker of the House. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Chair-man, I rise to urge the whole House to support this Republican budget, H. Con. Res. 71. Let me just say a few things. First, this is a budget that reflects our first principles: freedom, freedom enterprise, a government accountable to the people it serves. It is a budget that will help grow our economy, and it is a budget that will help rein in our debt. It strengthens our national defense. It supports our men and women in uniform. It elimi-nate mindless, endless spending, and it maximizes American’s tax dollars. It reforms Medicaid. It strengthens Medi-care. This is a budget that keeps our re-sponsibilities to our children and our grandchildren. Remember, we have a responsibility here, each and every generation, each and every Member: leave the country better off so your kids and your grandkids can prosper. That American legacy is seriously at risk because of our growing deterio-rating budget situation, because of the coming debt crisis. This budget tackles that. There is one more thing that this budget does that is so important. It paves the way for historic tax reform. It unlocks the reconciliation process. We need to pass this budget so that we can deliver real relief for middle-in-come families across this country. We need to pass this budget for the people who are living paycheck to paycheck in America, who are trying to juggle it all. They are looking to get under a hopelessly broken Tax Code. We haven’t reformed this tax system since 1986. We need to pass this budget so that we can help bring more jobs, fairer taxes, and bigger paychecks for people across this country. The time for this is now, and the opportunity is right in front of us. I want to especially commend Chair-man BLACK for her commitment to this vision. I want to especially commend the members of the Budget Committee for their steadfast commitment to this vision. We would not be in a position today to pass this budget without her tireless leadership and the leadership of her members of the committee. It is so encouraging that the Senate has passed their budget out of com-mittee. They are on the track, too. That means we look forward to work-ing with the Senate to take the next step. We have an opportunity to make right by our fellow countrymen. We have an opportunity to make right by the people we represent. We have an opportunity to actually restore pros-perity in this country. b0945 We haven’t seen that kind of eco-nomic potential in this country in at least a decade. We can fix that this year. We know a debt crisis is coming. We know if we do nothing, the next gen-eration will be worse off. We can stop that, fix this, and make them better off. That is what this budget paves the way for, and that is why I urge all of my colleagues to support this budget. I thank the chair for her steadfast support. I thank the Members for get-ting us to where we are today, and I really look forward to the day where we can look at this moment as when we got the country on the right track. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Chairman, in closing, I would just say that we need to cut right to the chase. It is unlikely that either the Repub-lican Study Committee budget or the Republican Budget Committee budget could pass this House. It certainly couldn’t pass the Congress. This is all about moving the ball for-ward so we can push through a massive tax cut to the wealthiest Americans, with 51 votes in the Senate. That is what this day is about, and that is what this process is about. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to reject both the Republican Study Committee budget and the Republican Budget Committee budget, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. M

EARREPRESENTATIVE WALKER : I am writ- ing you to express our appreciation for the fiscally responsible budget released by the Republican Study Committee. Your budget would make important progress by putting debt on a downward path as a share of GDP, reducing it from 77 per-cent today to 56 percent by 2027—instead of letting it rise to 89 percent as under current law. By calling for spending cuts and entitle-ment reforms, your budget helps to keep the national debt on a sustainable path. We applaud the Republican Study Com-mittee for your serious contribution to the ongoing budget debate. Sincerely, M

OUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , Washington, DC. D
EARREPRESENTATIVE : You will soon vote on several different budget proposals for fis-cal year (FY) 2018. On behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW), I urge you to support the budget resolution as reported by the House Budget Committee and the Republican Study Committee’s (RSC) budget resolution, both of which would put the nation back on the path to fiscal sanity and pave the way for comprehensive, pro-growth tax reform. Under the leadership of Chairman Diane Black (R–Tenn.), H. Con. Res. 71, as reported by the House Budget Committee, would re-duce spending by $6.5 trillion over 10 years and balance the budget by 2027. H. Con. Res. 71 provides reconciliation instructions for fundamental tax reform that, if enacted, will allow Americans to keep more of their money, simplify the filing of taxes, and allow small businesses to boost wages and create jobs. While H. Con. Res. 71 would in-crease defense spending above Budget Con-trol Act mandated cap levels, this legislation also calls for $203 billion in spending cuts across various programs and a $700 billion re-duction in improper payments. The RSC budget enacts many of the same reforms as the House Budget Committee’s plan, but it proposes to reduce government spending by $10 trillion over 10 years and achieves balance in six years. The RSC plan creates a pathway for tax reform; repeals and replaces Obamacare; makes Social Secu-rity solvent; rescues Medicare and disability insurance; and decreases FY 2018 non-discre-tionary spending to $394 billion. Tax reform presents an historic oppor-tunity to unleash the economic potential of the American people. While Congress is well- positioned to enact tax reform, that cannot occur until a budget resolution with rec-onciliation instructions is adopted. I urge

[From FreedomWorks, Oct. 4, 2017] K
EYVOTEYES ON THE MCCLINTOCK  A
MENDMENT TO H. C ON. RES. 71 On behalf of FreedomWorks’ activist com-munity, I urge you to contact your rep-resentative and ask him or her to vote YES on the amendment offered by Rep. Tom McClintock (R–Calif.) to H. Con. Res. 71, the budget resolution for FY 2018. The amend-ment, which includes reconciliation instruc-tions for fundamental tax reform, is the Re-publican Study Committee’s FY 2018 budget alternative. The Republican Study Committee’s (RSC) FY 2018 budget would reduce federal spend-ing by more than $10 trillion over the ten- year budget window, bringing the budget into balance in FY 2023. The RSC’s budget would repeal ObamaCare and enact other pa-tient-centered health insurance reforms, make Social Security and Medicare solvent, and reform federal welfare programs. It also promotes free trade, regulatory reform, and other free market, limited government prin-ciples. The current text of H. Con. Res. 71 and the McClintock amendment include language that allows the House Ways and Means Com-mittee to produce legislation to reform the tax code. Riddled with loopholes and special interest deductions, America’s tax code has become far too complex. According to the Tax Foundation, Americans spent 8.9 billion hours and $409 billion complying with the more than 74,000-page tax code. It has been more than 30 years since Con-gress passed fundamental tax reform. Con-gress has a generational opportunity to re-form the tax code by consolidating and low-ering tax rates, broadening the tax base, and promoting job creation and international competitiveness for American businesses. This will make the tax code fairer and sim-plify the filing process, allowing the vast majority of Americans to file their taxes on a postcard. FreedomWorks will count the vote on the McClintock amendment to H. Con. Res. 71 on our 2017 Congressional Scorecard. The score-card is used to determine eligibility for the FreedomFighter Award, which recognizes Members of the House and Senate who con-sistently vote to support economic freedom and individual liberty. Sincerely, A
DAMBRANDON , President, FreedomWorks. 
[From Heritage Action for America, Oct. 3, 2017] ‘‘Y
ES’’ ON THE RSC’ SBUDGET : SECURING  A
MERICA ’SFUTURE ECONOMY  (By Andrea Palermo) On Thursday, the House will vote on the Fiscal Year 2018 (FY18) Budget offered by the Republican Study Committee (RSC) as an amendment to the committee-approved FY18 budget resolution. The RSC’s Budget: Secur-ing America’s Future Economy, introduced by RSC Budget and Spending Task Force Chairman Tom McClintock (R–Calif.), would balance in 2023, reduce non-defense discre-tionary spending, reestablish national de-fense spending to support the military, break the ‘‘firewall’’ between defense and non-defense discretionary spending, fully repeal and replace Obamacare, repeal Dodd-Frank by implementing the Financial CHOICE Act, reform entitlement programs, and finally, enact pro-growth tax reform. If passed, the RSC’s budget would give lawmakers a seri-ous conservative blueprint for reform. Pro-Growth Tax Reform. Republicans cam-paigned and promised to fix America’s bro-ken tax code. The current code has become a significant obstacle to economic growth, job creation and higher wages for American workers. The RSC budget would fulfill the Republican campaign promise by enacting tax reform that cuts taxes for families, makes American businesses competitive around the globe, ends double taxation, and simplifies the code. Repealing Obamacare. Republicans owe their majorities to their unwavering opposi-tion to Obamacare, a reality that is reflected in the RSC’s budget. The budget remains committed to fully repealing the law despite recent Republican failures, and sends a sig-nal to the American people that conserv-atives will continue to push for free-market, patient-centered health care reforms. Funding Defense. Although the Budget Control Act of 2011 has put significant pres-sure on our military, a conservative budget would align military spending with strategic priorities by breaking the firewall. The RSC’s budget does not rely on the much-dis-cussed OCO gimmick, but increases defense spending to a total of $668 billion in FY18, which is $119 billion above the current de-fense cap. Importantly, that cost is offset by lowering non-defense discretionary spending to $394 billion in FY18, which is $122 billion below the cap. Reforming Entitlements. The RSC’s budget maintains the Medicare premium support re-forms, which are widely established and broadly supported. In addition, the budget lays down bold markers on Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance and Medicaid. It takes a similarly aggressive ap-proach on mandatory program spending like food stamps (Supplemental Nutrition Assist-ance Program, or SNAP) and Temporary As-sistance for Needy Families (TANF) by building on the success of the 1996 welfare re-forms and enacting work requirements as outlined in the Welfare Reform and Upward Mobility Act (H.R. 2832/S. 1290) and the Sup-plemental Nutrition Assistance Program Re-form Act (H.R. 2996). Other important items in the budget in-clude: Enacting the Financial CHOICE Act, eliminating the Consumer Financial Protec-tion Bureau (CFPB), holding federal agencies accountable, reducing funding for the Envi-ronmental Protection Agency (EPA), sepa-rating food stamps and farm programs, end-ing commodity subsidy programs, reforming crop insurance, ending unconstitutional am-nesty for illegal immigrants, enforcing exist-ing immigration laws, securing our borders, delegating elementary and secondary edu-cation to states and localities modeled after the Academic Partnership Leads us to Suc-cess (A-PLUS) Act, reforming Higher Edu-cation by passing the Higher Education Re-form and Opportunity (HERO) Act, elimi-nating Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, return-ing transportation and infrastructure policy to the states, reorganizing the executive branch, and protecting the life of the unborn. Taken as a whole, the RSC’s ‘‘Securing America’s Future Economy’’ demonstrates a seriousness of purpose when it comes to gov-erning. If passed, this budget would provide a fiscally responsible path forward for our na-tion, limit the size and scope of our bloated federal government, and unleash economic prosperity for all Americans. 
Mr. M CCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, Just a few steps from this Hall, Thom-as Jefferson addressed his first inau-gural address. After listing all of the blessings that our country enjoys, he asked what more do we need to main-tain a happy and prosperous society. He said: ‘‘Still one thing more, fellow citizens. A wise and frugal government, which shall restrain men from injuring one another, shall leave them other-wise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned. This is the sum of good government. . . .’’ We have it within our power to re-store that wise and frugal government and the prosperity and happiness that free societies always produce the mo-ment we summon the political will to do so. The Republican Study Com-mittee seeks that shining city on a hill and today offers this map to get us there. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-ance of my time. The Acting CHAIR.

TITLE IV—POLICY STATEMENTS 
SEC. 401. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON AFFORD-ABLE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR WORKING FAMILIES. 
(a) F INDINGS .—The House finds the fol-lowing: (1) Making health care coverage affordable and accessible for all American families will improve their health and financial security, which will make the economy stronger. (2) Medicaid is the Nation’s largest health insurance program, providing quality, com-prehensive, and affordable coverage to more than 70 million vulnerable Americans, in-cluding more than one in three children. (3) Millions of low-income seniors and peo-ple with disabilities rely on Medicaid to pay for nursing home care and home- and com-munity-based services that provide help with activities of daily living. (4) Medicaid coverage provides financial stability to families struggling to escape poverty and to parents of children with dis-abilities and special health care needs. (5) The existing financing structure of Medicaid ensures that Federal contributions keep pace with costs and enables States to respond to changing needs, such as increased enrollment in coverage during economic downturns or an aging population that re-quires extensive long-term care services. (6) Under the Affordable Care Act, 31 States and the District of Columbia have ex-panded Medicaid eligibility to low-income adults, including working parents who do not receive coverage through their employ-ers. (7) Roughly 20 million previously unin-sured people have gained health care cov-erage under the Affordable Care Act, reduc-ing the Nation’s uninsured rate for working- age adults to one of the lowest levels on record. (8) The law provides premium tax credits that vary by income and the local cost of coverage and cost-sharing assistance to help low- and middle-income families afford qual-ity insurance and pay their out-of-pocket costs. (9) The law prohibits insurers from denying coverage or charging higher premiums based on pre-existing conditions, requires coverage of essential health benefits like maternity care and prescription drugs, limits out-of- pocket costs, and prohibits lifetime and an-nual limits on coverage. (10) The law put in place significant cost- saving reforms to Federal health programs that have played a part in slowing the rate of healthcare spending growth in recent years, with 2011, 2012, and 2013 experiencing the slowest growth rates in real per capita national health expenditures on record. (11) On May 4, 2017, the House of Represent-atives passed H.R.1628, the American Health Care Act of 2017, legislation that would re-peal provisions of the Affordable Care Act, make deep cuts in Medicaid, and— (A) result in 23 million Americans losing health insurance in 2026, including 14 million people losing Medicaid; (B) dramatically increase costs for older adults, low-income families, and people with pre-existing conditions; (C) reduce Medicaid spending by $834 bil-lion over ten years; (D) jeopardize care for seniors in nursing homes, children with disabilities, and fami-lies receiving Medicaid benefits as States look to reduce coverage and services; (E) severely undermine access to substance abuse treatment during the nationwide opioid epidemic; (F) shorten the life of the Medicare Hos-pital Insurance Trust Fund; and (G) provide nearly $1 trillion in tax cuts that mostly benefit millionaires, billion-aires, and wealthy corporations. (b) POLICY .—It is the policy of the House that— (1) Congress should build upon the progress of the Affordable Care Act to make health care coverage more affordable and accessible to all American families, and reject any measures to repeal or undermine the law; (2) the Administration and Congress should fully implement, enforce, and fund the Af-fordable Care Act, and stop any efforts to sabotage the health insurance marketplaces; and (3) Congress should preserve Medicaid and not dismantle it by converting Medicaid into a block grant, per capita cap, or other fi-nancing arrangement that would limit Fed-eral contributions and render the program incapable of responding to increased need that may result from trends in demographics or health care costs or from economic condi-tions. SEC. 402. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON TAX RE-FORM THAT PROVIDES SUPPORT AND RELIEF TO HARDWORKING AMERICAN FAMILIES. 
(a) F INDINGS .—The House finds the fol-lowing: (1) Tax plans from House Republicans and President Trump prioritize tax cuts for mil-lionaires, billionaires, and wealthy corpora-tions, while shifting more of the burden onto everyone else. Their plans fail to close spe-cial interest loopholes in the tax code, and even add trillions of dollars of new loopholes for the wealthy. These plans reflect the failed theory of ‘‘trickle-down’’ economics, which creates few jobs and instead leads to massive deficits. A return to these policies would— (A) fail to create good paying middle-class jobs; (B) do nothing to help low-income or mid-dle-class households with the rising costs of health care, education, housing, child care, or retirement; and (C) widen the income gap between million-aires and billionaires and the middle class. (2) Americans today are working harder than ever, but continue to struggle to find good jobs, get ahead, and stay ahead. This is part of a four-decade trend of stagnant wages for middle-class and low-income households, even as millionaires and billionaires become richer and corporations reap massive profits. (3) The Obama Administration ended with 83 consecutive months of private-sector job growth, but challenges still remain to create more good-paying jobs and broadly shared prosperity. The number of long-term unem-ployed remains elevated, and unemployment for people of color continues to be higher than the rest of the population. Many areas remain in need of well-paying jobs. (4) By almost any metric, the middle class has seen little to no improvements in their incomes. Real median household income in 2013 was only $7,000 higher than it was in 1979. Median weekly real earnings for work-ers increased less than 1 percent from 1979 to 2014. Poorer workers have done even worse. For workers in the lower half of the income scale, real annual wages from 1979 to 2014 grew only $76. And the entire lower 50 per-cent of the United States population holds a mere 1 percent of total national wealth. (5) All the while, millionaires and billion-aires have seen their incomes and wealth skyrocket. Incomes for the top one percent of households grew five times as fast as for middle-income workers, and now average over $1 million a year. CEOs make nearly 300 times what the typical worker does. Ten per-cent of the population owns 76 percent of the Nation’s total wealth, and the average net assets of the top one percent now exceed $10 million per person. (6) The top one percent of households re-ceives a disproportionate share—17 percent— of the benefit of major tax expenditures. This uneven distribution of major tax ex-penditures has exacerbated income and wealth inequality. The tax code treats in-come from wealth more favorably than in-come from work by giving preferential tax rates on unearned income, and it contains numerous, wasteful tax breaks for special in-terests. (b) P
OLICY .—It is the policy of the House to responsibly reform the tax code to provide support and relief to low- and middle-income families, create good-paying jobs, and drive broadly-shared prosperity, while closing spe-cial-interest loopholes and making sure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share. 
SEC. 403. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON DEFENSE AND NONDEFENSE FUNDING IN-CREASES.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH7870 October 5, 2017 
(1) The current spending limits set by the Budget Control Act of 2011 are too low, for both defense and nondefense funding. De-fense and nondefense investments must be at appropriate levels to protect both national security and economic security. The non-defense discretionary spending limit for 2018 is $2 billion less than it was in 2016, in nomi-nal terms, representing a significant cut to purchasing power. If the inflation rate is what the Congressional Budget Office projects, the 2018 cap represents a reduction of nearly $30 billion compared with 2016. De-fense spending faces similar reductions. (2) The Budget Control Act of 2011 is based on parity for defense and nondefense spend-ing, setting up separate caps for both and in-stituting a ‘‘firewall’’ to prevent reductions in one category because of increases in the other. (3) Bipartisan agreement has provided a so-lution to the austerity-level caps before, and can be used again to change these arbitrary spending caps to prevent the harsh impact of massive, irresponsible cuts to important Federal programs. (4) Congress must begin discussions and ne-gotiations immediately, to raise the caps to appropriate levels, and maintain parity be-tween defense and nondefense. (b) P
OLICY ON DEFENSE AND NONDEFENSE  F
UNDING INCREASES .—It is the policy of the House that Congress should enact increases to the current defense and nondefense spend-ing limits, in equal amounts, without using reductions in one category to pay for in-creases in the other. 
SEC. 404. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON IMMIGRA-TION REFORM. 
(a) F INDINGS .—The House finds the fol-lowing: (1) Fixing the country’s broken immigra-tion system will mean safer communities, a stronger economy and lower budget deficits. (2) The Congressional Budget Office esti-mated that enacting the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, as introduced by House Democrats in the 113th Congress, would have reduced the deficit by $900 billion over the next 2 decades, boosting the economy by 5.4 percent, and increasing productivity by 1.0 percent. (3) The Social Security Actuary estimated that immigration reform will reduce the So-cial Security shortfall by 8 percent and will extend the life of the Social Security Trust Fund by 2 years. (4) The United States is a Nation founded, built and sustained by immigrants, and the Congress has a responsibility to harness the power of that tradition by implementing an effective and fair immigration policy. (5) The current immigration system is bro-ken because it keeps families of legal immi-grants and United States citizens separated for decades, it allows for the exploitation of undocumented workers to the detriment of all workers, it does not meet the needs of our economy and discourages legal immigration, and it keeps millions of hard-working, law- abiding families who have lived in our com-munities for decades hiding in the shadows, including many thousands who came to the United States as infants or young children. (6) Overly aggressive immigration enforce-ment that focuses on individuals with deep ties to the United States hurts State and local law enforcement efforts to establish and maintain trust with immigrant commu-nities. The number of Latinos reporting crimes in big cities across the country is lower than past years, particularly among domestic violence and sexual assault vic-tims. (7) The vast majority of individuals in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody have not been convicted of a serious crime. ICE’s own statistics dem-onstrate that arrests of people with no criminal record increased 157 percent in the first 100 days of the Trump Administration, and only 6.5 percent of those arrested were convicted of violent crimes. (8) The number of detained asylum seekers continues to rise dramatically and detaining asylum seekers, other vulnerable popu-lations, and those who do not pose risks to public safety is unnecessary and wasteful. (9) Increasing the use of alternatives to de-tention rather than expanding immigration detention would be more humane and cost- effective. (10) It has been nearly four years since the Senate passed, on a bipartisan basis, its com-prehensive immigration reform bill. (11) Immigration reform is needed to se-cure the sovereignty of the United States of America and to establish a coherent and just system for integrating those who seek to join American society. (12) A successful immigration system can-not rely on border security alone. The coun-try needs a system that promotes the reuni-fication of families, protects workers and is responsive to the needs of employers, and implements an inclusive legalization pro-gram for those who are currently here. (b) POLICY .—It is the policy of the House that Congress enact comprehensive immigra-tion reform – such as the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, introduced by House Democrats in the 113th Congress – to boost our economy, lower deficits, establish clear and just rules for citizenship, and make our communities safer. 
SEC. 405. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON SOCIAL SE-CURITY. 
(a) F INDINGS .—The House finds the fol-lowing: (1) Most of the 61 million Americans who currently receive earned Social Security benefits rely on these benefits for the major-ity of their income, with nearly a quarter of them relying on Social Security for at least 90 percent of their income. (2) In the past, Social Security benefits were part of a 3-legged stool where retirees relied on a combination of Social Security, a private pension, and personal savings to fi-nance retirement. (3) Social Security benefits will be more important to future retirees as few workers will receive traditional pensions, and many workers cannot afford to adequately fund their retirement through employer-spon-sored savings plans or IRAs. (4) Social Security’s Disability Insurance (DI) and Old Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) systems are intertwined both in their benefit structure and in their revenues – DI recipients who reach retirement age receive OASI benefits and beneficiaries in each cat-egory have helped finance the other category even if they will never receive those benefits. (5) Social Security benefits are already being cut as Social Security’s normal retire-ment age is increasing from 66 years for workers retiring now to 67 years for those born in 1960 and later. This cut dispropor-tionately impacts low-earners because life expectancy continues to increase among higher-earners but not low-earners. Thus, high-earners will generally receive benefits for a longer time than low-earners. (b) P
OLICY .—It is the policy of the House that the House of Representatives will not adopt changes to Social Security that in-volve reductions in earned Social Security benefits. 
SEC. 406. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON PRO-TECTING THE MEDICARE GUAR-ANTEE FOR SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. 
(a) F INDINGS .—The House finds the fol-lowing: (1) Senior citizens and persons with disabil-ities highly value the Medicare program and rely on Medicare to guarantee their health and financial security. (2) In 2018, 60,000,000 people will rely on Medicare for coverage of hospital stays, phy-sician visits, prescription drugs, and other necessary medical goods and services. (3) The Medicare program has lower admin-istrative costs than private insurance, and Medicare costs per enrollee have grown at a slower rate than private insurance for a given level of benefits. (4) People with Medicare already have the ability to choose a private insurance plan within Medicare through the Medicare Ad-vantage option, yet two-thirds of Medicare beneficiaries chose the traditional fee-for- service program instead of a private plan in 2016. (5) Rising health care costs are not unique to Medicare or other Federal health pro-grams, they are endemic to the entire health care system. (6) Converting Medicare into a voucher for the purchase of health insurance will merely force seniors and individuals with disabil-ities to pay much higher premiums if they want to use their voucher to purchase tradi-tional Medicare coverage. (7) A voucher system in which the voucher payment fails to keep pace with growth in health costs would expose seniors and per-sons with disabilities on fixed incomes to un-acceptable financial risks. (8) Shifting more health care costs onto Medicare beneficiaries would not reduce overall health care costs, instead it would mean beneficiaries would face higher pre-miums, eroding coverage, or both. (9) Versions of voucher policies that do not immediately end the traditional Medicare program will merely set it up for a death spi-ral as private plans siphon off healthier and less expensive beneficiaries, leaving the sick-est beneficiaries in a program that will with-er away. (b) POLICY .—It is the policy of the House that the Medicare guarantee for seniors and persons with disabilities should be preserved and strengthened, and that any legislation to end the Medicare guarantee, financially penalize people for choosing traditional Medicare, or shift rising health care costs onto seniors by replacing Medicare with vouchers or premium support for the pur-chase of health insurance, should be rejected. 
SEC. 407. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON FINANCIAL STABILITY AND CONSUMER PROTEC-TION. 
(a) F INDINGS .—The House finds the fol-lowing: (1) The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 is an important component of the country’s re-sponse to the financial crisis and recession. It took a number of steps to protect con-sumers of financial products and services as well as protect taxpayers from the costs of another financial crisis. (2) These steps included the creation of an orderly liquidation process to allow regu-lators to close failing institutions that some argue are ‘‘too big to fail,’’ as well as a new Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), an Office of Financial Research to monitor the stability of our financial sys-tem, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the Consumer Bureau). (3) The Consumer Bureau plays a critical role in protecting older Americans, military service members, student loan borrowers, and other consumers, especially in minority and low-income communities. It has imple-mented new rules for mortgage markets and prepaid cards, and also successfully recov-ered nearly $12 billion on behalf of more than 29 million consumers and service members.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7871 October 5, 2017 
(4) The Consumer Bureau’s funding from the Federal Reserve’s operations help give it important independence from efforts to interfere with its vital mission and activi-ties, independence on par with every other banking regulator. (5) The Consumer Bureau has already faced and overcome efforts to obstruct its oper-ations. (b) P
OLICY .—It is the policy of the House that Congress should continue to support the vital work of the Consumer Financial Pro-tection Bureau as well as its governing and financing structures and other key compo-nents of the Dodd-Frank legislation such as orderly liquidation authority, FSOC, and the Office of Financial Research. 
SEC. 408. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON WOMEN’S ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT. 
(a) F INDINGS .—The House finds the fol-lowing: (1) Women’s contributions are critical to the economic success of hard-working fami-lies. (2) Not only do women play a key role in maintaining healthy families, they also have unique health care needs and face issues that require special focus. (3) Every hard-working American deserves to feel safe and supported during retirement. Yet women are more likely to face financial risk during retirement because of their lower lifetime earnings and disproportionate role as family caregivers. (b) P
OLICY .—It is the policy of the House that Congress should economically empower women and protect their health and safety. Congress must enact policies that would ac-complish the following: (1) Help families attain better jobs, fight pay inequity, raise the minimum wage, and enable women entrepreneurs and small busi-nesses to achieve their goals. (2) Give American families control of their own lives, and help them balance the de-mands of work and family. These policies in-clude paid and expanded family and medical leave, paid sick days, and quality, affordable child care. (3) Strengthen the retirement security of women and their families by protecting So-cial Security, Medicare and Medicaid. (4) Support caregivers, many of whom sac-rifice their own careers to provide for family members. (5) Maintain health insurance protections for women, increase funding for the preven-tion and treatment of women’s health issues such as breast cancer and heart disease, and support access to full reproductive care. (6) Prevent and protect women from do-mestic violence and sexual abuse. 
SEC. 409. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON NATIONAL SECURITY. 
(a) F INDINGS .—The House finds the fol-lowing: (1) The country faces many national secu-rity challenges and we must continue to sup-port a strong military that is second to none. (2) Those who serve in uniform are our most important security resource and the Administration and Congress shall continue to provide the support they need to success-fully carry out the missions the country gives them. (3) A growing economy is the foundation of our security and enables the country to pro-vide the resources for a strong military, sound homeland security agencies, and effec-tive diplomacy and international develop-ment. (4) Austerity-level spending caps threaten adequate investment in activities critical to our economy and national security, which include activities funded by both the defense and nondefense portions of the discretionary budget. (5) Diplomacy and foreign aid are essential components of our security and the Presi-dent’s proposal to cut these activities by 32 percent below current levels prompted more than 120 retired admirals and generals who have first-hand knowledge of their effective-ness in securing our Nation to forcefully ob-ject. (6) The Nation’s projected long-term debt could have serious consequences for our economy and security, and that more effi-cient military spending has to be part of an overall plan that effectively deals with this problem. (7) Reining in wasteful spending at the Na-tion’s security agencies, including the De-partment of Defense—the last department still unable to pass an audit—such as the elimination of duplicative programs and bet-ter controlling delays and cost overruns on weapon systems that have been identified by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) needs to continue as a priority. (8) The Department of Defense should con-tinue to review defense plans and require-ments to ensure that weapons developed to counter Cold War-era threats are not redun-dant, are affordable, and are applicable to 21st century threats; and such review should include, with the participation of the Na-tional Nuclear Security Administration, ex-amination of requirements for, and cost of, the nuclear weapons stockpile, nuclear weap-ons delivery systems, and nuclear weapons and infrastructure modernization. (9) Nonwar operation and maintenance costs per active-duty service member have grown at a rate well above inflation for dec-ades—from $59,000 per service member in 1980 to $157,000 per service member in 2015 (meas-ured in constant 2017 dollars), and it is im-perative that unsustainable cost growth be controlled in this area. (10) Cooperative threat reduction and other nonproliferation programs (securing ‘‘loose nukes’’ and other materials used in weapons of mass destruction), which were highlighted as high priorities by the 9/11 Commission, need to be funded at a level that is commen-surate with the evolving threat. (b) POLICY .—It is the policy of the House that— (1) the austerity-level spending caps re-quired by the Budget Control Act of 2011 for fiscal years 2018 through 2021 should be re-scinded and replaced by a fiscal plan that is balanced and takes into account a com-prehensive national security strategy that includes careful consideration of inter-national, defense, homeland security, and law enforcement programs; and (2) efficiencies can be achieved in the na-tional defense budget without compromising our security through greater emphasis on eliminating duplicative and wasteful pro-grams, reforming the acquisition process, identifying and constraining unsustainable operating costs, and through careful analysis of our national security needs. 
SEC. 410. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON VETERANS AFFAIRS. 
(a) F INDINGS .—The House finds the fol-lowing: (1) The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) continues to face challenges meeting the needs of the next generation of returning veterans, including sufficient funding to pro-vide critical services and benefits. (2) Access to quality health care and vet-erans’ benefits has been an ongoing chal-lenge for the VA, highlighted most recently in the ongoing claims backlog and veterans waiting months for health care appoint-ments. (3) Providing health care where veterans live and ensuring a sufficient number of health care professionals, especially in the area of mental health treatment, have also been challenges. (4) The VA has made progress in reducing the number of initial benefit claims, drop-ping the claims backlog to less than 94,000 from a peak of 611,000 claims just a few years ago, but that statistic leaves out the many veterans who are still waiting many months or even years to have their appeals decided. (5) The President’s budget includes a 6 per-cent increase over current-year funding but shifts funding away from critical programs that veterans rely on in favor of expanded funding that pays for certain veterans to get private health care at the expense of care provided at VA hospitals and clinics. (6) The President’s budget also cuts fund-ing from other Federal agencies that provide lifesaving programs and services for vet-erans, including deep cuts to Medicaid bene-fits veterans rely on, the elimination of the Interagency Council on Homelessness, steep cuts at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, elimination of the Legal Services Corporation, and severe cuts to entrepreneurship outreach programs tar-geted to veterans through the Small Busi-ness Administration. (7) The VA currently has advance appro-priations for approximately 85 percent of its discretionary budget. The residual 15 per-cent, which includes funding for the day-to- day operations at the Veterans Benefits Ad-ministration, remains vulnerable to a Gov-ernment shutdown. (b) POLICY .—It is the policy of the House that— (1) Congress should support a funding level no less than the President’s request for vet-erans’ discretionary programs so that the VA has the resources it needs to ensure veterans get the health care and benefits they earned in a timely fashion; (2) Congress should lift the austerity-level funding cap on nondefense programs for 2018 and beyond to ensure adequate funding for veterans’ programs; (3) advance appropriations be expanded to cover all of VA’s discretionary budget to pre-vent delays in veterans’ benefits and services during a Government shutdown; (4) the VA submit along with its annual budget a ‘‘Future-Years Veterans Program’’ that projects its needs over five years to help facilitate the appropriations and oversight processes; (5) Congress should provide sufficient re-sources for the VA’s Office of the Inspector General to guarantee veterans are properly served and that resources are spent effi-ciently; (6) no changes be made to the Individual Unemployability benefit to ensure that dis-abled veterans, many of them severely dis-abled, who are deemed unable to engage in substantial work as a result of their service to our country, continue to receive the full disability and social security benefits they earned and were promised; and (7) Congress shall provide sufficient fund-ing and staff resources for VA hospitals and clinics, and that any increased funding for private and community care not provided di-rectly by the VA should not come at the ex-pense of necessary resources for VA hospitals and clinics. 
SEC. 411. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON DISASTER RESPONSE FUNDING. 
(a) F INDINGS .—The House find the fol-lowing: (1) Natural disasters such as hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria require swift con-gressional action to help storm survivors get their lives back on track, rebuild disaster- stricken communities, and prevent further damage to the economy. (2) The Budget Control Act of 2001 provides procedural tools specifically to respond to

natural disasters, by allowing adjustments to the spending caps for disaster and emer-gency spending. (3) Mitigation and prevention is an impor-tant part of disaster recovery and response, providing investments that make future dis-asters less costly in terms of both dollars and lives. (b) P
OLICY ON FUNDING FOR DISASTER RE-
SPONSE AND RECOVERY .—It is the policy of the House that Congress should act swiftly to assist with recovery from hurricanes and other natural disasters. Such funding should be provided using the budgetary provisions in place for this purpose: providing adjust-ments to the spending caps for disaster and emergency response, recovery, and mitiga-tion. Congress must also support efforts to address future disaster damage and loss, by appropriately funding mitigation and pre-vention efforts. 
SEC. 412. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON THE FED-ERAL WORKFORCE. 
(a) F INDINGS .—The House finds the fol-lowing: (1) The Federal workforce provides vital services to our Nation on a daily basis. It in-cludes those who patrol and secure our bor-ders, protect us from terrorists, take care of our veterans, help run our airports, counter cyber-attacks, find cures for deadly diseases, and keep our food supply safe. (2) Veterans make up 31 percent of the Fed-eral workforce. (3) Many Federal workers are paid at a rate that is far below their private sector coun-terparts. (4) The Federal workforce is older than in past decades and older than the private sec-tor workforce. Nearly one third of the Fed-eral workforce is eligible to retire. (5) Federal employee pay and benefits are not the cause of the country’s deficits and debt. The Federal workforce has already con-tributed more than $180 billion toward reduc-ing the country’s deficits in the form of pay freezes, pay raises insufficient to keep pace with inflation, furloughs, and increased re-tirement contributions. The President’s budget for 2018 continues to unfairly target the Federal workforce by proposing an addi-tional $149 billion in compensation and re-tirement benefit cuts. (6) Since 1975, the Federal workforce has declined 35 percent relative to the size of the population of the United States. (7) Nearly all of the increase in the Federal civilian workforce from 2001 to 2016 is due to increases at security-related agencies, in-cluding the Department of Defense, Depart-ment of Homeland Security, and Department of Veterans Affairs. (8) Proposals to reduce the size of the workforce at nonsecurity agencies by 10 per-cent have excluded an assessment of their impact on government services. (b) P
OLICY .—It is the policy of the House that Congress should not target Federal em-ployees to achieve further reductions in the deficit as they have already contributed more than their fair share, that Federal workers should be compensated with pay and benefits at a level that enables the govern-ment to attract high quality people—which is especially important during this period when more workers will be retiring—and that no proposal to reduce the size of the workforce should be considered without an assessment of its impact on government services. 
SEC. 413. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON CLIMATE CHANGE SCIENCE. 
(a) F INDINGS .—The House finds the fol-lowing: (1) Global climate change is a threat to na-tional security, public health, and economic growth. (2) The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that the effects of climate change are occurring worldwide, stating: ‘‘The impacts of climate change have already been felt in recent dec-ades on all continents and across the oceans’’. (3) The United States Government Ac-countability Office described climate change as, ‘‘a complex, crosscutting issue that poses risks to many environmental and economic systems—including agriculture, infrastruc-ture, ecosystems, and human health—and presents a significant financial risk to the Federal Government’’. (4) In March 2017, Secretary of Defense James Mattis, in written testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee, stated that ‘‘climate change can be a driver of in-stability and the Department of Defense must pay attention to potential adverse im-pacts generated by this phenomenon’’. (5) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that 2016 was the warmest year on record, setting a new record for global average surface tem-peratures for the third year in a row. Fur-thermore, 16 of the 17 warmest years on record have occurred since 2001. (6) The United States National Research Council’s National Climate Assessment and Development Advisory Committee found cli-mate change affects ‘‘human health, water supply, agriculture, transportation, energy, coastal areas, and many other sectors of so-ciety, with increasingly adverse impacts on the American economy and quality of life’’. (7) The most vulnerable among us, includ-ing children, the elderly, low-income individ-uals, and those with underlying health con-ditions, face even greater health risks as a result of climate change. (b) POLICY .—It is the policy of the House that climate change presents a significant public health, environmental, and financial risk to the United States. The United States must continue to play a leadership role on climate change policy and should not retreat from global commitments on climate change. Congress must provide robust fund-ing for climate change science, which pro-vides critical information for protecting human health, defending the United States, and preserving economic and environmental systems throughout the world. 
SEC. 414. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON INCREASED EFFICIENCY AND ELIMINATING WASTE. 
(a) F INDINGS .—The House finds the fol-lowing: (1) The Government Accountability Office (‘‘GAO’’) identifies examples of waste, dupli-cation, and overlap in Federal programs, and makes regular recommendations regarding ways to reduce costs and increase revenue. (2) The Comptroller General has stated that addressing the identified waste, duplica-tion, and overlap in Federal programs ‘‘could lead to tens of billions of dollars of addi-tional savings, with significant opportunities for improved efficiencies, cost savings, or revenue enhancements in the areas of de-fense, information technology, education and training, health care, energy, and tax enforcement.’’ (3) The tax gap, the difference between taxes owed and taxes paid, now averages $458 billion annually. Even modest improvements in enforcing existing law could yield a boost in revenue without any changes to the tax code. (4) Tax expenditures, or spending through the tax code, total $1.5 trillion per year and represent the largest category of spending in the budget — exceeding Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. However, unlike other types of spending, tax expenditures are not reviewed in any systematic way in the an-nual budget process. (5) Improper payments, payments that should not have been made or that were made in an incorrect amount, totaled $144 billion for 2016. While some improper pay-ments are the result of fraud, the vast ma-jority are due to unintentional errors, such as payments to eligible beneficiaries that were not properly verified, or overpayments or underpayments because of a data entry mistake. (6) Shutting down the government, arbi-trarily cutting agency budgets, and funding large portions of the government through stop-gap appropriations do not lead to effi-cient and effective government. (b) POLICY .—It is the policy of the House that Congress must continue to root out wasteful spending, make government oper-ations more efficient, pass appropriations bills on time, and avoid costly government shutdowns. Congress must task agencies with shrinking the error rate in government programs and provide adequate budgetary re-sources for agencies to develop new proc-esses, review expenditures, and improve in-formation technology systems. 
SEC. 415. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON THE INVES-TIGATION OF RUSSIAN INTER-FERENCE IN THE 2016 U.S. PRESI-DENTIAL ELECTION. 
(a) F INDINGS .—The House finds the fol-lowing: (1) Free and fair elections are the corner-stone of our democracy, and foreign inter-ference in them undermines the public trust and casts doubt on the legitimacy of our gov-ernment. (2) The country’s intelligence agencies all agree that Russia launched a campaign to undermine the 2016 U.S. presidential elec-tion, which included cyber-attacks, dissemi-nation of false information, and other intel-ligence operations to malign Secretary Hil-lary Clinton and increase the odds of a Don-ald Trump presidency. (3) Members of the Trump campaign had repeated contact with Russian government officials and oligarchs and then failed to re-port this contact in testimony to Congress and in security clearance applications. One such meeting reportedly included a request for a back-channel line of communications with the Russian government using Russian facilities, which would preclude U.S. Govern-ment oversight. Another involved a Kremlin- linked Russian lawyer and a former Soviet counterintelligence officer under the as-sumption that they would provide politically damaging information about Secretary Hil-lary Clinton as part of the Russian govern-ment’s effort to support the Trump cam-paign. (4) Under the direction of Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, the FBI was investigating whether members of President Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election. (5) On May 9, 2017, President Trump fired FBI Director Comey and then made state-ments suggesting his dismissal was to stop the investigation of collusion. (6) On May 17, 2017, the Department of Jus-tice announced the appointment of former FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III to serve as Special Counsel to investigate Russian in-terference into the 2016 presidential election and any coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7873 October 5, 2017 
Special Counsel appointed by the Depart-ment of Justice so that he can perform a thorough and nonpartisan investigation of Russia’s campaign to affect the 2016 U.S. presidential election and any individuals in the United States that may have colluded in those efforts. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 553, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Y
ARMUTH ) and a Member opposed each will control 15 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Chairman, Democrats and Repub-licans are looking at the same chal-lenges facing our country and Amer-ican families. Education, healthcare, and housing costs have all increased while wages stay stagnant. It used to be that the two parties would debate different strategies to ad-dress the problems facing the American people. Sadly, those times are behind us. In giving millionaires, including the majority of this Congress, the Presi-dent, and wealthy donors a giant tax cut, the Republican budget does not even pretend to address the problems facing the American people. Not only does it ignore working families, it in-creases their challenges. The Democratic budget alternative, in stark contrast to the Republican budget, begins to address the real chal-lenges our country faces now and in the long term. b1015 We are less than a decade removed from the worst economic crisis in most of our lifetimes, and we have a chance to rebound in a way that builds a foun-dation for our country to thrive for generations, but we have to seize that opportunity. Rather than giving resources to peo-ple and businesses that already have them, we are calling for targeted in-vestments in programs that grow our economy, create good-paying jobs, and provide real support for working fami-lies and real security in retirement. Rather than sending thank-you notes to the corporations that bankroll cam-paigns, we have an opportunity to make vital public investments that lead to a brighter future rebuilding roads, bridges, and other critical infra-structure, all of which lead to good jobs now and in the long run. Rather than giving the President a multimillion-dollar refund on taxes he refuses to disclose, we can invest in re-tirement security for seniors who didn’t inherit millions. We can invest in affordable education so young people do not have to grow up wealthy to have a shot at earning it in their future ca-reers. Instead of taking healthcare away from people, straining emergency rooms, and making Americans sicker, we have an opportunity to continue in-vesting in affordable quality healthcare for all of us, finally elimi-nating a great burden on American families, a burden that no other devel-oped nation shares. This budget is an opportunity for our country to invest in our future, and if we adopt the Republican budget plan, we will have squandered it. Democrats believe in a government that prioritizes American families, and they should be the priorities of this Congress. I, therefore, urge my col-leagues to oppose the Republican budg-et and support the Democratic alter-native. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Tennessee is recognized for 15 minutes. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Chair, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this budget substitute, which is, put sim-ply, an abdication of our fiscal respon-sibility as a governing body. Our country is $20 trillion in debt, with $9 trillion added to the national debt during the Obama years. We have the responsibility to our children and our grandchildren to stop this Con-gress’ addiction to spending. It is a re-sponsibility that I take seriously; it is a responsibility that the members of my committee take seriously; and it is a responsibility that Republicans in the House take seriously. Clearly, it is not a responsibility that our friends across the aisle take seri-ously. Our budget works to end the ad-diction to spending that has dominated Washington for far too long. The House budget, passed out of com-mittee with unanimous Republican support in July, begins to address our spending addiction by balancing the budget over 10 years so that we can start paying down our national debt, and it addresses mandatory spending in a significant way for the first time since 1997. This budget substitute does quite the opposite. The Democrats’ budget raises taxes by $2.7 trillion, which would be the largest tax increase in U.S. history. It increases spending by $6.2 trillion, compared to the budget passed by my committee. It never balances, with a deficit in 2027 of $852 billion. What we hear from the other side of the aisle and what we see in this budg-et is simply more of same: more spend-ing, more tax increases, and more debt. I don’t think that is acceptable, and neither do the American people. Since we began this budget debate yesterday, my counterparts on the other side of the aisle have been throw-ing out misleading numbers about our budget and our tax reform effort in order to hide the fact that they offer no new solutions to the most pressing problems our country faces. Here is a number that they should keep in mind while they discuss this fiscally irresponsible substitute. The national debt for every person is over $63,000. Every man, woman, and even child in our country has a $63,000 weight hanging over their heads. Our budget takes real steps to fix this cri-sis. This budget substitute does not. Honestly, it is as simple as that. Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to re-ject this Democrat substitute, and I re-serve the balance of my time. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. J
EFFRIES ), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee. Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Chair, once again, House Republicans are deter-mined to visit cruel and unusual pun-ishment on the American people by presenting a budget that is reckless, regressive, and reprehensible. It is a budget that will hurt working families, middle class folks, senior citizens, the poor, the sick, the afflicted, veterans, and rural America. It is a budget that will eradicate the social safety net, end Medicare as we know it, rip away health insurance from 23 million Americans, and impose billions and billions of dollars in life- altering debt on younger Americans. It is outrageous that this is all being done to enact tax cuts for the wealthy and the well-off, tax cuts for the privi-leged few, tax cuts for special interests here in Washington, D.C. This parade of horribles is being jammed down the throats of this coun-try so that everyday Americans can subsidize the lifestyles of the rich and shameless. We deserve better. The Democratic budget will invest in transportation and infrastructure, invest in education and job training, invest in the social safety net, invest in research and de-velopment, invest in affordable hous-ing, and invest in the wellbeing of ev-eryday Americans. The Republican budget is a raw deal. The Democratic budget is a better deal, focused on better jobs, better wages, and a better future. It is worthy of our support. The Acting CHAIR. The Committee will rise informally. The Speaker pro tempore (Mrs. H

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH7874 October 5, 2017 
Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gen-tleman from Florida (Mr. F
RANCIS ROO-
NEY). Mr. FRANCIS ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Chair, with all respect, the cruel and unusual punishment is the Demo-cratic-proposed substitute amendment. The raw deal is the Democratic-pro-posed substitute amendment that in-creases spending $6.2 trillion over our budget. This thing raises taxes—$2.7 trillion, the largest tax increase in American history, at a time when we are drown-ing in debt and stagnant wage growth. It requires a one-to-one match of de-fense and nondefense discretionary spending at a time when we can’t keep our F–18s flying and we have airplanes crashing around the country for lack of maintenance. This is unconscionable. This budget never balances. It will leave us with an $852 billion deficit by fiscal year 2027. It expands ObamaCare, the most disas-trous and heinous trick played on the American people that I can remember. It prioritizes amnesty over security. We are never going to get our coun-try straight and preserve our sov-ereignty if we don’t protect our secu-rity. On the other hand, we have got the Republican budget that offers to do a lot of things. One thing it offers to do is put a work requirement for able-bod-ied adults with no dependent children into welfare. Mr. Chair, I include in the R
ECORD an article by Nicholas Eberstadt of AEI talking about the horrible condition of our labor force now and how dras-tically important this is and how much it will improve the opportunities for people to rise out of poverty. We have got three 25- to 54-year-old males sit-ting out of the labor force collecting benefits for every one that is unem-ployed. The unemployed rate is 4.7 per-cent. That makes the total 20 percent. It is almost over 5 million people that we owe them a moral obligation to offer them an opportunity to rise out of poverty through work, and that is what the Republican budget does. 
[Commentary, Feb. 15, 2017] E
CONOMY : OURMISERABLE 21STCENTURY  (By Nicholas N. Eberstadt) On the morning of November 9, 2016, Amer-ican’s elite—its talking and deciding class-es—woke up to a country they did not know. To most privileged and well-educated Ameri-cans, especially those living in its bicoastal bastions, the election of Donald Trump had been a thing almost impossible even to imag-ine. What sort of country would go and elect someone like Trump as president? Certainly not one they were familiar with, or under-stood anything about. Whatever else it may or may not have ac-complished, the 2016 election was a sort of shock therapy for Americans living within what Charles Murray famously termed ‘‘the bubble’’ (the protective barrier of prosperity and self-selected associations that increas-ingly shield our best and brightest from con-tact with the rest of their society). The very fact of Trump’s election served as a truth broadcast about a reality that could no longer be denied: Things out there in Amer-ica are a whole lot different from what you thought. Yes, things are very different indeed these days in the ‘‘real America’’ outside the bub-ble. In fact, things have been going badly wrong in America since the beginning of the 21st century. It turns out that the year 2000 marks a grim historical milestone of sorts for our na-tion. For whatever reasons, the Great Amer-ican Escalator, which had lifted successive generations of Americans to ever higher standards of living and levels of social well- being, broke down around then—and broke down very badly. The warning lights have been flashing, and the klaxons sounding, for more than a dec-ade and a half. But our pundits and prognos-ticators and professors and policymakers, ensconced as they generally are deep within the bubble, were for the most part too dis-tant from the distress of the general popu-lation to see or hear it. (So much for the vaunted ‘‘information era’’ and ‘‘big-data revolution.’’) Now that those signals are no longer possible to ignore, it is high time for experts and intellectuals to reacquaint themselves with the country in which they live and to begin the task of describing what has befallen the country in which we have lived since the dawn of the new century. Consider the condition of the American economy. In some circles people still widely believe, as one recent New York Times busi-ness-section article cluelessly insisted before the inauguration, that ‘‘Mr. Trump will in-herit an economy that is fundamentally solid.’’ But this is patent nonsense. By now it should be painfully obvious that the U.S. economy has been in the grip of deep dys-function since the dawn of the new century. And in retrospect, it should also be apparent that America’s strange new economic mala-dies were almost perfectly designed to set the stage for a populist storm. Ever since 2000, basic indicators have of-fered oddly inconsistent readings on Amer-ica’s economic performance and prospects. It is curious and highly uncharacteristic to find such measures so very far out of align-ment with one another. We are witnessing an ominous and growing divergence between three trends that should ordinarily move in tandem: wealth, output, and employment. Depending upon which of these three indi-cators you choose, America looks to be head-ing up, down, or more or less nowhere. From the standpoint of wealth creation, the 21st century is off to a roaring start. By this yardstick, it looks as if Americans have never had it so good and as if the future is full of promise. Between early 2000 and late 2016, the estimated net worth of American households and nonprofit institutions more than doubled, from $44 trillion to $90 trillion. Although that wealth is not evenly distrib-uted, it is still a fantastic sum of money—an average of over a million dollars for every notional family of four. This upsurge of wealth took place despite the crash of 2008— indeed, private wealth holdings are over $20 trillion higher now than they were at their pre-crash apogee. The value of American real-estate assets is near or at all-time highs, and America’s businesses appear to be thriving. Even before the ‘‘Trump rally’’ of late 2016 and early 2017, U.S. equities mar-kets were hitting new highs—and since stock prices are strongly shaped by expectations of future profits, investors evidently are count-ing on the continuation of the current happy days for U.S. asset holders for some time to come. A rather less cheering picture, though, emerges if we look instead at real trends for the macro-economy. Here, performance since the start of the century might charitably be described as mediocre, and prospects today are no better than guarded. The recovery from the crash of 2008—which unleashed the worst recession since the Great Depression— has been singularly slow and weak. Accord-ing to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), it took nearly four years for Amer-ica’s gross domestic product (GDP) to re-at-tain its late 2007 level. As of late 2016, total value added to the U.S. economy was just 12 percent higher than in 2007. The situation is even more sobering if we consider per capita growth. It took America six and a half years—until mid-2014—to get back to its late 2007 per capita production levels. And in late 2016, per capita output was just 4 percent higher than in late 2007—nine years earlier. By this reckoning, the American economy looks to have suffered something close to a lost decade. But there was clearly trouble brewing in America’s macro-economy well before the 2008 crash, too. Between late 2000 and late 2007, per capita GDP growth averaged less than 1.5 percent per annum. That compares with the nation’s long-term postwar 1948–2000 per capita growth rate of almost 2.3 percent, which in turn can be compared to the ‘‘snap back’’ tempo of 1.1 percent per annum since per capita GDP bottomed out in 2009. Be-tween 2000 and 2016, per capita growth in America has averaged less than 1 percent a year. To state it plainly: With postwar, pre- 21st-century rates for the years 2000–2016, per capita GDP in America would be more than 20 percent higher than it is today. The reasons for America’s newly fitful and halting macroeconomic performance are still a puzzlement to economists and a subject of considerable contention and debate. Econo-mists are generally in consensus, however, in one area: They have begun redefining the growth potential of the U.S. economy down-wards. The U.S. Congressional Budget Office (CBO), for example, suggests that the ‘‘po-tential growth’’ rate for the U.S. economy at full employment of factors of production has now dropped below 1.7 percent a year, imply-ing a sustainable long-term annual per cap-ita economic growth rate for America today of well under 1 percent. Then there is the employment situation. If 21st-century America’s GDP trends have been disappointing, labor-force trends have been utterly dismal. Work rates have fallen off a cliff since the year 2000 and are at their lowest levels in decades. We can see this by looking at the estimates by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for the civilian em-ployment rate, the jobs-to-population ratio for adult civilian men and women. Between early 2000 and late 2016, America’s overall work rate for Americans age 20 and older un-derwent a drastic decline. It plunged by al-most 5 percentage points (from 64.6 to 59.7). Unless you are a labor economist, you may not appreciate just how severe a falloff in employment such numbers attest to. Post-war America never experienced anything comparable. From peak to trough, the collapse in work rates for U.S. adults between 2008 and 2010 was roughly twice the amplitude of what had previously been the country’s worst postwar recession, back in the early 1980s. In that previous steep recession, it took America five years to re-attain the adult work rates recorded at the start of 1980. This time, the U.S. job market has as yet, in early 2017, scarcely begun to claw its way back up to the work rates of 2007—much less back to the work rates from early 2000. U.S. adult work rates never recovered entirely from the re-cession of 2001—much less the crash of ’08. And the work rates being measured here include people who are engaged in any paid employment—any job, at any wage, for any number of hours of work at all. On Wall Street and in some parts of Wash-ington these days, one hears that America

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7875 October 5, 2017 
has gotten back to ‘‘near full employment.’’ For Americans outside the bubble, such talk must seem nonsensical. It is true that the oft-cited ‘‘civilian unemployment rate’’ looked pretty good by the end of the Obama era—in December 2016, it was down to 4.7 per-cent, about the same as it had been back in 1965, at a time of genuine full employment. The problem here is that the unemployment rate only tracks joblessness for those still in the labor force; it takes no account of work-force dropouts. Alas, the exodus out of the workforce has been the big labor-market story for America’s new century. (At this writing, for every unemployed American man between 25 and 55 years of age, there are another three who are neither working nor looking for work.) Thus the ‘‘unemployment rate’’ increasingly looks like an antique index devised for some earlier and increas-ingly distant war: the economic equivalent of a musket inventory or a cavalry count. By the criterion of adult work rates, by contrast, employment conditions in America remain remarkably bleak. From late 2009 through early 2014, the country’s work rates more or less flatlined. So far as can be told, this is the only ‘‘recovery’’ in U.S. economic history in which that basic labor-market in-dicator almost completely failed to respond. Since 2014, there has finally been a meas-ure of improvement in the work rate—but it would be unwise to exaggerate the dimen-sions of that turnaround. As of late 2016, the adult work rate in America was still at its lowest level in more than 30 years. To put things another way: If our nation’s work rate today were back up to its start-of-the-cen-tury highs, well over 10 million more Ameri-cans would currently have paying jobs. There is no way to sugarcoat these awful numbers. They are not a statistical artifact that can be explained away by population aging, or by increased educational enroll-ment for adult students, or by any other gen-uine change in contemporary American soci-ety. The plain fact is that 21st-century America has witnessed a dreadful collapse of work. For an apples-to-apples look at America’s 21st-century jobs problem, we can focus on the 25–54 population—known to labor econo-mists for self-evident reasons as the ‘‘prime working age’’ group. For this key labor-force cohort, work rates in late 2016 were down al-most 4 percentage points from their year- 2000 highs. That is a jobs gap approaching 5 million for this group alone. It is not only that work rates for prime- age males have fallen since the year 2000— they have, but the collapse of work for American men is a tale that goes back at least half a century. (I wrote a short book last year about this sad saga.) What is per-haps more startling is the unexpected and largely unnoticed fall-off in work rates for prime-age women. In the U.S. and all other Western societies, postwar labor markets un-derwent an epochal transformation. After World War II, work rates for prime women surged, and continued to rise—until the year 2000. Since then, they too have declined. Cur-rent work rates for prime-age women are back to where they were a generation ago, in the late 1980s. The 21st-century U.S. econ-omy has been brutal for male and female la-borers alike—and the wreckage in the labor market has been sufficiently powerful to cancel, and even reverse, one of our society’s most distinctive postwar trends: the rise of paid work for women outside the household. In our era of no more than indifferent eco-nomic growth, 21st-century America has somehow managed to produce markedly more wealth for its wealthholders even as it provided markedly less work for its workers. And trends for paid hours of work look even worse than the work rates themselves. Be-tween 2000 and 2015, according to the BEA, total paid hours of work in America in-creased by just 4 percent (as against a 35 per-cent increase for 1985–2000, the 15-year period immediately preceding this one). Over the 2000–2015 period, however, the adult civilian population rose by almost 18 percent—meaning that paid hours of work per adult civilian have plummeted by a shocking 12 percent thus far in our new American century. This is the terrible contradiction of eco-nomic life in what we might call America’s Second Gilded Age (2000—). It is a paradox that may help us understand a number of overarching features of our new century. These include the consistent findings that public trust in almost all U.S. institutions has sharply declined since 2000, even as grow-ing majorities hold that America is ‘‘heading in the wrong direction.’’ It provides an im-mediate answer to why overwhelming ma-jorities of respondents in public-opinion sur-veys continue to tell pollsters, year after year, that our ever-richer America is still stuck in the middle of a recession. The mounting economic woes of the ‘‘little peo-ple’’ may not have been generally recognized by those inside the bubble, or even by many bubble inhabitants who claimed to be eco-nomic specialists—but they proved to be po-tent fuel for the populist fire that raged through American politics in 2016. So general economic conditions for many ordinary Americans—not least of these, Americans who did not fit within the acad-emy’s designated victim classes—have been rather more insecure than those within the comfort of the bubble understood. But the anxiety, dissatisfaction, anger, and despair that range within our borders today are not wholly a reaction to the way our economy is misfiring. On the nonmaterial front, it is likewise clear that many things in our soci-ety are going wrong and yet seem beyond our powers to correct. Some of these gnawing problems are by no means new: A number of them (such as fam-ily breakdown) can be traced back at least to the 1960s, while others are arguably as old as modernity itself (anomie and isolation in big anonymous communities, secularization and the decline of faith). But a number have roared down upon us by surprise since the turn of the century—and others have redou-bled with fearsome new intensity since roughly the year 2000. American health conditions seem to have taken a seriously wrong turn in the new cen-tury. It is not just that overall health progress has been shockingly slow, despite the trillions we devote to medical services each year. (Which ‘‘Cold War babies’’ among us would have predicted we’d live to see the day when life expectancy in East Germany was higher than in the United States, as is the case today?) Alas, the problem is not just slowdowns in health progress—there also appears to have been positive retrogression for broad and heretofore seemingly untroubled segments of the national population. A short but electri-fying 2015 paper by Anne Case and Nobel Eco-nomics Laureate Angus Deaton talked about a mortality trend that had gone almost un-noticed until then: rising death rates for middle-aged U.S. whites. By Case and Deaton’s reckoning, death rates rose some-what slightly over the 1999–2013 period for all non-Hispanic white men and women 45–54 years of age—but they rose sharply for those with high-school degrees or less, and for this less-educated grouping most of the rise in death rates was accounted for by suicides, chronic liver cirrhosis, and poisonings (in-cluding drug overdoses). Though some researchers, for highly tech-nical reasons, suggested that the mortality spike might not have been quite as sharp as Case and Deaton reckoned, there is little doubt that the spike itself has taken place. Health has been deteriorating for a signifi-cant swath of white America in our new cen-tury, thanks in large part to drug and alco-hol abuse. All this sounds a little too close for comfort to the story of modern Russia, with its devastating vodka- and drug-binging health setbacks. Yes: It can happen here, and it has. Welcome to our new America. In December 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that for the first time in decades, life expectancy at birth in the United States had dropped very slightly (to 78.8 years in 2015, from 78.9 years in 2014). Though the decline was small, it was statistically meaningful—rising death rates were characteristic of males and fe-males alike; of blacks and whites and Latinos together. (Only black women avoid-ed mortality increases—their death levels were stagnant.) A jump in ‘‘unintentional in-juries’’ accounted for much of the overall up-tick. It would be unwarranted to place too much portent in a single year’s mortality changes; slight annual drops in U.S. life expectancy have occasionally been registered in the past, too, followed by continued improve-ments. But given other developments we are witnessing in our new America, we must wonder whether the 2015 decline in life ex-pectancy is just a blip, or the start of a new trend. We will find out soon enough. It can-not be encouraging, though, that the Human Mortality Database, an international consor-tium of demographers who vet national data to improve comparability between countries, has suggested that health progress in Amer-ica essentially ceased in 2012—that the U.S. gained on average only about a single day of life expectancy at birth between 2012 and 2014, before the 2015 turndown. The opioid epidemic of pain pills and her-oin that has been ravaging and shortening lives from coast to coast is a new plague for our new century. The terrifying novelty of this particular drug epidemic, of course, is that it has gone (so to speak) ‘‘mainstream’’ this time, effecting breakout from disadvan-taged minority communities to Main Street White America. By 2013, according to a 2015 report by the Drug Enforcement Administra-tion, more Americans died from drug overdoses (largely but not wholly opioid abuse) than from either traffic fatalities or guns. The dimensions of the opioid epidemic in the real America are still not fully appre-ciated within the bubble, where drug use tends to be more carefully limited and rec-reational. In Dreamland, his harrowing and magisterial account of modern America’s opioid explosion, the journalist Sam Quinones notes in passing that ‘‘in one three-month period’’ just a few years ago, ac-cording to the Ohio Department of Health, ‘‘fully 11 percent of all Ohioans were pre-scribed opiates.’’ And of course many Ameri-cans self-medicate with licit or illicit pain-killers without doctors’ orders. In the fall of 2016, Alan Krueger, former chairman of the President’s Council of Eco-nomic Advisers, released a study that fur-ther refined the picture of the real existing opioid epidemic in America: According to his work, nearly half of all prime working-age male labor-force dropouts—an army now to-taling roughly 7 million men—currently take pain medication on a daily basis. We already knew from other sources (such as BLS ‘‘time use’’ surveys) that the over-whelming majority of the prime-age men in this un-working army generally don’t ‘‘do civil society’’ (charitable work, religious ac-tivities, volunteering), or for that matter much in the way of child care or help for others in the home either, despite the abun-dance of time on their hands. Their routine,

instead, typically centers on watching— watching TV, DVDs, Internet, hand-held de-vices, etc.—and indeed watching for an aver-age of 2,000 hours a year, as if it were a full- time job. But Krueger’s study adds a poign-ant and immensely sad detail to this portrait of daily life in 21st-century America: In our mind’s eye we can now picture many mil-lions of un-working men in the prime of life, out of work and not looking for jobs, sitting in front of screens—stoned. But how did so many millions of un-work-ing men, whose incomes are limited, manage en masse to afford a constant supply of pain medication? Oxycontin is not cheap. As Dreamland carefully explains, one main mechanism today has been the welfare state: more specifically, Medicaid, Uncle Sam’s means-tested health-benefits program. Here is how it works (we are with Quinones in Portsmouth, Ohio): [The Medicaid card] pays for medicine— whatever pills a doctor deems that the in-sured patient needs. Among those who re-ceive Medicaid cards are people on state wel-fare or on a federal disability program known as SSI. . . . If you could get a pre-scription from a willing doctor—and Ports-mouth had plenty of them—Medicaid health- insurance cards paid for that prescription every month. For a three-dollar Medicaid co- pay, therefore, addicts got pills priced at thousands of dollars, with the difference paid for by U.S. and state taxpayers. A user could turn around and sell those pills, obtained for that three-dollar co-pay, for as much as ten thousand dollars on the street. In 21st-century America, ‘‘dependence on government’’ has thus come to take on an entirely new meaning. You may now wish to ask: What share of prime-working-age men these days are en-rolled in Medicaid? According to the Census Bureau’s SIPP survey (Survey of Income and Program Participation), as of 2013, over one- fifth (21 percent) of all civilian men between 25 and 55 years of age were Medicaid bene-ficiaries. For prime-age people not in the labor force, the share was over half (53 per-cent). And for un-working Anglos (non-His-panic white men not in the labor force) of prime working age, the share enrolled in Medicaid was 48 percent. By the way: Of the entire un-working prime-age male Anglo population in 2013, nearly three-fifths (57 percent) were report-edly collecting disability benefits from one or more government disability program in 2013. Disability checks and means-tested ben-efits cannot support a lavish lifestyle. But they can offer a permanent alternative to paid employment, and for growing numbers of American men, they do. The rise of these programs has coincided with the death of work for larger and larger numbers of Amer-ican men not yet of retirement age. We can-not say that these programs caused the death of work for millions upon millions of younger men: What is incontrovertible, how-ever, is that they have financed it—just as Medicaid inadvertently helped finance Amer-ica’s immense and increasing appetite for opioids in our new century. It is intriguing to note that America’s na-tionwide opioid epidemic has not been ac-companied by a nationwide crime wave (ex-cepting of course the apparent explosion of illicit heroin use). Just the opposite: As best can be told, national victimization rates for violent crimes and property crimes have both reportedly dropped by about two-thirds over the past two decades. The drop in crime over the past generation has done great things for the general quality of life in much of America. There is one complication from this drama, however, that inhabitants of the bubble may not be aware of, even though it is all too well known to a great many resi-dents of the real America. This is the ex-traordinary expansion of what some have termed America’s ‘‘criminal class’’—the pop-ulation sentenced to prison or convicted of felony offenses—in recent decades. This trend did not begin in our century, but it has taken on breathtaking enormity since the year 2000. Most well-informed readers know that the U.S. currently has a higher share of its popu-lace in jail or prison than almost any other country on earth, that Barack Obama and others talk of our criminal-justice process as ‘‘mass incarceration,’’ and know that well over 2 million men were in prison or jail in recent years. But only a tiny fraction of all living Americans ever convicted of a felony is actually incarcerated at this very mo-ment. Quite the contrary: Maybe 90 percent of all sentenced felons today are out of con-finement and living more or less among us. The reason: the basic arithmetic of sen-tencing and incarceration in America today. Correctional release and sentenced com-munity supervision (probation and parole) guarantee a steady annual ‘‘flow’’ of con-victed felons back into society to augment the very considerable ‘‘stock’’ of felons and ex-felons already there. And this ‘‘stock’’ is by now truly enormous. One forthcoming demographic study by Sarah Shannon and five other researchers es-timates that the cohort of current and former felons in America very nearly reached 20 million by the year 2010. If its es-timates are roughly accurate, and if Amer-ica’s felon population has continued to grow at more or less the same tempotraced out for the years leading up to 2010, we would expect it to surpass 23 million persons by the end of 2016 at the latest. Very rough calculations might therefore suggest that at this writing, America’s population of non-institutional-ized adults with a felony conviction some-where in their past has almost certainly bro-ken the 20 million mark by the end of 2016. A little more rough arithmetic suggests that about 17 million men in our general popu-lation have a felony conviction somewhere in their CV. That works out to one of every eight adult males in America today. We have to use rough estimates here, rath-er than precise official numbers, because the government does not collect any data at all on the size or socioeconomic circumstances of this population of 20 million, and never has. Amazing as this may sound and scan-dalous though it may be, America has, at least to date, effectively banished this huge group—a group roughly twice the total size of our illegal-immigrant population and an adult population larger than that in any state but California—to a near-total and seemingly unending statistical invisibility. Our ex-cons are, so to speak, statistical out-casts who live in a darkness our polity does not care enough to illuminate—beyond the scope or interest of public policy, unless and until they next run afoul of the law. Thus we cannot describe with any preci-sion or certainty what has become of those who make up our ‘‘criminal class’’ after their (latest) sentencing or release. In the most stylized terms, however, we might guess that their odds in the real America are not all that favorable. And when we consider some of the other trends we have already mentioned—employment, health, addiction, welfare dependence—we can see the emer-gence of a malign new nationwide undertow, pulling downward against social mobility. Social mobility has always been the jewel in the crown of the American mythosand ethos. The idea (not without a measure of truth to back it up) was that people in Amer-ica are free to achieve according to their merit and their grit—unlike in other places, where they are trapped by barriers of class or the misfortune of misrule. Nearly two dec-ades into our new century, there are unmis-takable signs that America’s fabled social mobility is in trouble—perhaps even in seri-ous trouble. Consider the following facts. First, accord-ing to the Census Bureau, geographical mo-bility in America has been on the decline for three decades, and in 2016 the annual move-ment of households from one location to the next was reportedly at an all-time (postwar) low. Second, as a study by three Federal Re-serve economists and a Notre Dame col-league demonstrated last year, ‘‘labor mar-ket fluidity’’—the churning between jobs that among other things allows people to get ahead—has been on the decline in the Amer-ican labor market for decades, with no sign as yet of a turnaround. Finally, and not least important, a December 2016 report by the ‘‘Equal Opportunity Project,’’ a team led by the formidable Stanford economist Raj Chetty, calculated that the odds of a 30-year- old’s earning more than his parents at the same age was now just 51 percent: down from 86 percent 40 years ago. Other researchers who have examined the same data argue that the odds may not be quite as low as the Chetty team concludes, but agree that the chances of surpassing one’s parents’ real in-come have been on the downswing and are probably lower now than ever before in post-war America. Thus the bittersweet reality of life for real Americans in the early 21st century: Even though the American economy still remains the world’s unrivaled engine of wealth gen-eration, those outside the bubble may have less of a shot at the American Dream than has been the case for decades, maybe genera-tions—possibly even since the Great Depres-sion. The funny thing is, people inside the bub-ble are forever talking about ‘‘economic in-equality,’’ that wonderful seminar construct, and forever virtue-signaling about how per-sonally opposed they are to it. By contrast, ‘‘economic insecurity’’ is akin to a phrase from an unknown language. But if we were somehow to find a ‘‘Google Translate’’ func-tion for communicating from real America into the bubble, an important message might be conveyed: The abstraction of ‘‘inequality’’ doesn’t matter a lot to ordinary Americans. The re-ality of economic insecurity does. The Great American Escalator is broken—and it badly needs to be fixed. With the election of 2016, Americans within the bubble finally learned that the 21st cen-tury has gotten off to a very bad start in America. Welcome to the reality. We have a lot of work to do together to turn this around. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. C
OHEN ), a distinguished member of the Transportation and In-frastructure Committee. Mr. COHEN. Mr. Chair, the other day, a young man who lives in my neighbor-hood came over, and he asked me to try to teach him how to drive a car. And I told him: Son, it is real easy to drive a car. It is just kind of like these budget proposals you will see in Con-gress. If you want to go forward and do things down the road, you put the car in D, like Democrat, for drive, and your car will go forward. But if you want to go backwards and reverse back to the 1950s, you put it in R, like a Re-publican. He learned quick, and that is what these budgets are about. If you want to

go forward, you go with the Demo-cratic budget—forward on building highways, school construction, broadband expansion; research, re-search on the deadly diseases that are killing each and every one of us and our children in time to come, and re-search by the National Institutes of Health that are cut by the budget. There is nothing more important that can be in the budget than moneys for the National Institutes of Health, yet they are being cut. Cancer, Alz-heimer’s, AIDS, stroke, diabetes, all are going to come at us and our rel-atives. Some will say, and I said this one time before, and Mr. Kingston on the other side said: Well, our children and our grandchildren will have to pay for it. Who do you think is going to get the cures and the treatments? Our children and our grandchildren and generations to come. And they cut research. They cut op-portunities for America. You talk about taxes and the debt, the Repub-lican plan gives billionaires the biggest cuts in history, over $50 billion with es-tate tax elimination for people like the Koch brothers and the Waltons and all those folks, and that money will never come back. The alternative minimum tax is eliminated. That is the only thing that made clear that President Trump paid any taxes in the only tax return we know about. If it weren’t for that, he wouldn’t have paid anything. We are talking multimillion- and billion-dol-lar tax cuts for the richest that create deficits in the future, but that is okay when it is giving money to those who already have it. Franklin Roosevelt was right. You judge a society not by what it does for those who have an abundance, but you judge it by what it does for those who have the least. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I do want to say to my good friend and col-league from Tennessee that I think the D stands for debt for Democrats, and I think the R stands for Republicans and recovery. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. W
OMACK ), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee and the Appro-priations Committee. Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Chair, I thank the distinguished chairwoman of the Budg-et Committee for her outstanding work. My friend from Tennessee talks about driving forward. I think we need to pump the brakes. You are driving right off a cliff with this budget. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition. It is my strong belief that our Nation has a debt crisis on its hand, and I am as-tonished by how many people on the other side of the aisle, Mr. Chairman, just refuse to acknowledge the prob-lem. It is as if the problem doesn’t exist. Under their plan, taxes are going to be raised nearly $3 trillion. We are going to continue to raise spending to the tune of over $6 trillion. We will have a meager $2.6 billion in deficit re-duction, by the way, compared to our budget that does well over $6 trillion in deficit reduction. Our Nation is $20 trillion in debt, and it is a complete absurdity to think that we could begin to relinquish this proc-ess if we enacted such a burdensome budgetary proposal that is being of-fered by our friends on the other side of the aisle. This budget would also diminish our national security apparatus. It would end the global war on terrorism fund by 2019. Let’s go ahead and telegraph that we are going to end the global war on terrorism fund by 2019. The only people who I know who would support that would be our adversaries. It seeks to promote the collapsing Affordable Care Act by keeping those burdensome mandates in place. This resolution before us right now refuses to do anything about the runaway enti-tlement programs that are the primary drivers of the deficit and debt in the country. Mr. Chairman, their budget just will never balance. Never. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. SIMPSON ). The time of the gentleman has expired. b1030 Mrs. BLACK. I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Arkan-sas. Mr. WOMACK. It will give no rec-onciliation instruction so that we can finally get control and protect for long- term sustainability the social safety net program that many depend on. The bottom line is, you either ac-knowledge we have a deficit and a debt crisis, or you do not. And if you believe as I do, you will refuse this budget, and you will support ours. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. N
OLAN ), a distinguished member of the Agriculture Committee. Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee, I rise in support of the Democratic budget alternative and in opposition to the Republican budget that has been proposed. It has been often said that gracious living and good politics is all about gratitude. Paying something forward is how you show your gratitude. Quite frankly, the simple truth about this Republican budget is that it rolls back a century of progress. It sets the stage for the dismantling of Social Se-curity, which lifted more people out of poverty than anything, and for Speak-er R
YAN’s plan to turn it over to Wall Street. It sets the stage for turning Medicare over to the insurance industry—Medi-care that provided our elderly with in-surance and life opportunities that heretofore had not existed. This century of progress that this budget rolls back includes clean air and water. It includes healthy, safe working places and conditions. It in-cludes an opportunity society that in-vests in our people. And guess what? In a little over a century, we doubled life expectancies. Wow, what a marvelous accomplish-ment. We created the best and biggest mid-dle class in the history of the world. We became a model for the world; jobs with living wages and healthcare bene-fits and pension benefits. This Republican budget proposes to roll back that entire century of progress. It is nothing about paying it forward. It is nothing about paying things back. It is about rolling back a century of progress, and we can not let that happen. That is what the Democratic budget is really all about, investing in people, investing in infrastructure, investing in America, and investing in people’s jobs and living wages, and in their ben-efits. That is how you show your grati-tude, and we have got a lot to be grate-ful for. Let’s vote and enact this Democratic budget proposal which invests in Amer-ica, which invests in people, which in-vests in opportunities. That is what this debate is really all about. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I yield 21⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. J
OHNSON ), who is a member of the Budget Committee. Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Chair-man, I saw recently, and I remember Ronald Reagan said something when he finally got his tax reform package done back in 1986—why it took so long and why it was so difficult. And at the end the day, he said: You know, the law-makers and the policymakers forgot one important factor in their calcula-tions that brought us to this point; they forgot to include what the Amer-ican people have to say about this. That is what is happening here today, Mr. Chairman. The American people have told us they want eco-nomic growth. They want opportuni-ties for their kids and their families, a better quality of life. They want Wash-ington to live within its means and stop taking more and more and more from them out of their paychecks. So let’s do a little bit of comparison. Let’s look at, my colleagues, the Dem-ocrat budget. It raises taxes by $2.7 trillion, compared to the CBO January baseline. That is almost $3.8 trillion more than revenue levels in our House Republican budget. It increases spend-ing by $6.2 trillion, compared to the Republican budget over that 10-year period. It increases the debt held by the public by $3.9 trillion, almost $4 trillion relative to the House Repub-lican budget. And what is important, Mr. Chair, it never balances. There is not even an attempt to balance; not to mention that there are no reconciliation in-structions that would give us an oppor-tunity to deal with healthcare and other economic growth reforms. Mr. Chairman, this is not a respon-sible budget that is being offered by

our colleagues on the other side. I urge my colleagues to oppose it and to sup-port the House Republican budget later today. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. J
ACKSON LEE), a dis-tinguished member of the Budget Com-mittee. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Kentucky for his astute analysis on what the American people really want. I thank the manager, the chairwoman of this bill, and I acknowledge the posi-tion that they take. But what America really wants is for Washington, for America, for the gov-ernment, to stand by them in their time of need. I am very grateful to be part of a party that is not about politics but is about values. We are the better choice party. We offer a better deal on this project that we have worked so hard on called the American budget. The American budget, in contrast to our friends on the other side of the aisle, recognizes, as I visited the Na-tional Institutes for Health, that 80 percent of their budget that we are going to lose goes for research and re-searchers—looking those researchers in the eyes when they explain the re-search in medical science to help save lives, and to know that the Republican budget cuts the NIH, the Centers for Disease Control, and takes up the TrumpCare that cuts trillions in Med-icaid and $500 billion in Medicare. That is the story of this bill. Then, as my good friend from Ten-nessee (Mr. C
OHEN ) indicated, we invest in infrastructure, and we help this young man, not only with his healthcare but with education. Do we realize how many jobs go unable to find individuals in this country? Hundreds of thousands because of the lack of training. So if my friends want growth, you know how you get growth? You invest in the American people. Or you tell the American people when tragedies strike, whether it is the Virgin Islands, or Puerto Rico, or Florida, or Texas, or tragically, in Nevada, that you will stand by them. You provide them with the infrastructure to be able to over-come. Not the Republican budget, because the Republican budget is giving tril-lions in tax cuts, and the distribution of those moneys will not see the front door of low-income, moderate-income, middle class working Americans. That is the distinction between the Democratic budget. It increases oppor-tunity through a higher minimum wage. It believes in equal pay for equal work. It knows that immigration re-form will bring in billions of dollars. It will create opportunities for work. Then, of course, we know that the Democratic budget strengthens our healthcare, and it provides that her So-cial Security, her Medicare, will not be in jeopardy. The Medicare trust fund will not lose with a Republican budget and the trillions of dollars of tax cuts, her life, as she continues to seek some balance of good life will be lost. We are the right direction. We are for the American people. We are standing by the American people with the Democratic budget. I ask my col-leagues to vote for the Democratic al-ternative. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentle-woman from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX), the chairman of the Education and the Workforce Committee. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my colleague from Tennessee, the chair of the Budget Committee, for the wonderful work she has done on bringing us to this position. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this substitute amendment. As chair of the Education and the Workforce Committee, my priority this Congress is to ensure that our policies promote a climate of job creation through economic growth, a sound fis-cal policy, and a global economic com-petitiveness. Our budget helps achieve all of these priorities by laying the foundation for a robust and comprehensive simplifica-tion of our burdensome Tax Code. The Democrat substitute not only fails to do so but would decimate America’s workforce. Our budget reforms our broken Tax Code so that it works for every Amer-ican at every income level, regardless of where they live or how much money they earn. The top U.S. tax rate for individuals has been as high as 90 percent and as low as 28 percent. At the same time, in-come tax revenue has remained fairly steady, despite these sharp rate swings. It turns out that the biggest driver of Federal revenue is not higher tax rates but economic growth. In fact, a sizeable majority of econo-mists point out that a broad base and low rates are key in a tax system that fosters economic growth and competi-tiveness. Legislators on both sides of the aisle agree on this basic principle, and history has shown it to be true. Instead of raising taxes, we should, instead, embrace the policies contained in this budget resolution that encour-ages economic growth, like reducing regulatory burdens, welfare reform, and comprehensive tax reform for all individuals, not just a select few. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Chairman, I re-serve the balance of my time. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. S
ANFORD ), a member of our Budget Committee. Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chairman, I rise, as well, in opposition to the substitute amendment, and I do so because I am struck by the ways in which you can, at times, agree on the diagnosis but disagree on the cure. I think we would all agree, Repub-licans and Democrats alike, that we have a real problem in the way that wages have indeed stagnated over the last 30 years. A lot of my Democratic colleagues are nailing it in terms of that diagnosis. The question though, is the cure. And the question there is: Can we fix that problem by raising taxes by $2.7 tril-lion? Can we fix that problem by in-creasing spending by $6.2 trillion? Can we fix that problem by increasing the debt by $3.9 trillion and, in essence, having a budget that never balances? I would argue, no, and I would say, instead, what we have to look at is the basics, which we have been dancing around, which is the mathematic for-mula that says: Savings drives invest-ment, which drives productivity gain which, ultimately, impacts standard of living or wages. And what we don’t focus on enough is this notion of the investment part of investment; if you want to increase productivity, you have got to increase investment. In fairness to my Democratic col-leagues, part of that is public invest-ment, but another part is private. What my colleague from Virginia was just getting at a moment ago was, for 50 years, regardless of tax rate, 90 or 28 percent, the take to government has been about 18 percent of GDP very con-sistently. So what I would argue is we, indeed, need more public investment, but we also need private investment to go with it. And if we don’t watch out, what is being contemplated with this Democratic substitute is a process that will ultimately crowd out that much more in the way of private investment so key to increasing productivity. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Kentucky has 31⁄2minutes re-maining. The gentlewoman from Ten-nessee has 1
1⁄4minutes remaining. Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, in closing, it is clear that we have a very different budget and a very different understanding of the challenges facing our country. We see that so many Americans are work-ing harder and longer and can’t remem-ber the last time they got a raise. We know families are worried about how to pay for college, or if their par-ents’ retirement is secure, or if they will ever be able to afford to stop work-ing. And we know that trillions of dol-lars in tax cuts for millionaires and large corporations will turn these fears of hardworking Americans families into reality. b1045 Just a few minutes ago, my Repub-lican colleague from Ohio talked about what the American people want. On many of those things, we agree. But I know one thing the American people don’t want. They don’t want massive tax cuts for the top 1 percent of Ameri-cans. The Democratic budget rejects tax cuts for the wealthy. We invest in pro-grams that will grow our economy, cre-ate good-paying jobs, provide real sup-port for working families and real secu-rity in retirement. We make education

and childcare more affordable, and we support policies to help every Amer-ican get the healthcare that they need. Those are the priorities of our budg-et, and they are the priorities of the American people. I, therefore, urge my colleagues to support the Democratic alternative, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chair, I look into my children’s and grandchildren’s eyes, and I say: I want you to know that right now you owe $63,000 for your part of the debt of this country. What we are doing in Congress right now, if we were to vote on and accept this amendment, we would be increas-ing that burden on our children and grandchildren. I, for one, cannot do that, and I think that we have got to be responsible. We have got to look at how we in this country can get back to the place, as has already been said, that we ask fam-ilies and businesses to do, and that is to live within their means. Mr. Chair, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this amendment, and I yield back the bal-ance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute offered by the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Y
ARMUTH ). The question was taken; and the Act-ing Chair announced that the noes ap-peared to have it.

ALMER ), who is a member of the Budget Committee. Mr. PALMER. Madam Chairman, I appreciate the hard work the Budget Committee has put forth to produce a budget that prioritizes our national de-fense and sets forth bold policy reforms that will get this country back on track to fiscal responsibility. Specifically, I am pleased to see that this budget commits to reducing the substantial amount of improper pay-ments throughout the Federal Govern-ment. The Government Accountability Office estimates that there were $144 billion—I want to emphasize $144 bil-lion—in improper payments in 2016 alone, and that is not even a complete estimate. In fact, 18 Federal programs did not report their improper pay-ments, so the total is undoubtedly higher. To make matters worse, since 2013, the amount we have been incorrectly sending out has been trending upwards. Instead of reducing our fraudulent pay-ments, the rate at which we pay them out has been increasing. Since 2003, there has been a total of $1.2 trillion in improper payments. Let me repeat, that is $1.2 trillion plus interest. b1115 Because we have been running defi-cits over that timeframe, we have lit-erally had to borrow that money to send it to fraudsters and others who

would not have received it. This is un-acceptable. As you can see from this chart, this represents improper payments for 2016 alone. It is money borrowed that we pay interest on to send to people who are not supposed to get it. We are bor-rowing money and adding to our debt through improper payments. This budget, for the first time, sets forth a bold strategy for cutting these payments in half over the budget win-dow, saving us $700 billion over our 10- year window. While I hope, in the near future, we can zero these payments out, I am thrilled to see that we are beginning to tackle a problem that is putting an ad-ditional strain on this country’s fiscal problems. Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this budget. Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Chairwoman, I yield myself 4 minutes. Madam Chairwoman, I suppose I should be saying thank you. I will get a huge tax cut under the Republican tax cut plan, as well the majority of those people sitting here—the majority of our colleagues in Congress—who are, like me, fortunate enough to be mil-lionaires already. Forgive me if I am in no mood to say thank you, because I was elected not just to represent millionaires, but to represent aspiring millionaires, work-ing families, seniors, and veterans. For all of them, for anyone who isn’t al-ready a millionaire, this budget is a slap in the face. With all of the problems facing our country right now, all the people strug-gling to get ahead, it is unfathomable to me that this Congress could look at people like me and say: Hey, that guy, let’s give him more money. In fact, let’s give all millionaires hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax cuts. Really, I am small potatoes. Presi-dent Trump, according to his financial disclosure, will get hundreds of mil-lions of dollars in tax cuts. Where is all that money coming from? If you are listening to this and you are not a millionaire, probably from you. To pay for our own tax cuts and the tax cuts for wealthy donors, Repub-licans are going to increase taxes on 45 percent of American families with chil-dren. That is just the start. Seniors, people with disabilities, and low-in-come families will see their healthcare cut. Poor seniors will lose benefits that help them keep food on the table and their homes heated in the winter. Vet-eran benefits, meals for hungry school-children, programs that make edu-cation affordable and job training available, investments that generate economic growth and create good-pay-ing jobs are all at risk in this budget. They are also cutting corporate tax rates, which we will be paying for by plunging our Nation into deeper and deeper debt, giving multinational gi-ants another advantage over small- and mid-size businesses in the name of per-petuating the myth of supply-side eco-nomics. Supply-side failed. They renamed it trickle-down, but nothing trickled down. Now it is job creators. When that fails, maybe they will call it ‘‘I get mine now; you get yours later— maybe.’’ But whatever they name it, it is a sham. This plan is a hoax on the American people, and it will make most people’s lives more difficult. So forgive me if I am in no mood to say thank you for the extra money in my pocket. With millions of Americans struggling and scraping to get ahead, and with my tax cut increasing their challenges, I cannot begin to justify my extra money, and, quite frankly, I cannot fathom how my Republican col-leagues are able to justify theirs. With this budget, Republicans aren’t just passing the buck, they are pock-eting it. Madam Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the Re-publican budget. Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. P
ELOSI ), the distinguished minority leader. Ms. PELOSI. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank him for his great leadership as the ranking member on the Budget Com-mittee in the House, and I thank all of the members of the Budget Committee for their great work to make the budg-et that was proposed earlier, the Yar-muth budget, a statement of our val-ues. That is exactly what a budget should be. A Federal budget should be a state-ment of our national values, and what is important to us as a country should be reflected in the priorities that we place into that budget. The budget be-fore us, proposed by the Republicans, is just the opposite of that. It is accom-panied by a tax proposal that they put in, one of the biggest transfers of wealth to the wealthiest people in our country in our country’s history. Every time they do it, they make it worse. I let you be the judge: Is a statement of our national values to cut a trillion dollars from Medicaid, cap and take Medicaid down a bad path, in order to give tax cuts to the richest people in our country? Is it a statement of our values to take a half trillion dollars out of Medi-care to give a tax cut to the wealthiest people in our country? Our distinguished ranking member has listed some of the things that would be cut if we went down this un-fortunate path posed by our colleagues on the other side. This is a budget that steals from the middle class. It steals hundreds of bil-lions of dollars from critical job-cre-ating, wage-increasing investments, in-frastructure, job training, and clean energy. It harms veterans, it cuts edu-cation, it abandons rural America, and it guts education. This is really a mystery to me. When you cut education, with the stiff com-petition we have, this is one of the worst budget decisions that you have made. Nothing brings more money to the Treasury than investing in edu-cation: early childhood, K–12, higher education, postgraduate, and lifetime learning for our workers. That is how you grow the economy. That is how you bring money to the Treasury, and not by cutting it in order to give tax cuts to the wealthiest people in our country. Is it a statement of values to cut edu-cation so that you have a tax cut that benefits 80 percent? I know you don’t want the public to hear this, and I can understand why. How could it be a statement of the val-ues of the American people to cut the education of our children in order to have a tax cut where 80 percent of it benefits the top 1 percent of people in our country? It is just not right. As they do that, the deficit hawks, who seem to be an endangered species on the Republican side of the aisle these days, are adding close to $2.4 tril-lion to the deficit, not counting debt service or interest on that national debt. Then they say: Oh, that is okay; we need to increase the national debt by trillions of dollars so that we can give tax cuts. Where do the tax cuts go? $2.6 trillion goes to corporate America. Guess what happens to the middle class. There are $470 billion in tax in-creases to the middle class, about a half trillion dollars in increases to the middle class, $2.5 trillion in tax cuts for corporate America. Again, it is add-ing so much to the deficit. Now they say: Oh, trickle-down eco-nomics is going to pay its own way. We will get that money back. Not so. It never happens. Nonsense. But don’t take it from me. No less a figure than Bruce Bartlett, who worked for Congressman Jack Kemp, a real supporter of supply-side economics— and, as was said, supply-side turn into trickle-down, et cetera. As a proponent of supply-side economics, he said: We never said it would pay for itself. We just advocate it as an economic ap-proach. But anyone who says, and this is from him, that the whole supply-side dynamic scoring pays for itself—part of this argument—is all nonsense. It is not true. He went on to say that it was bull—you finish the sentence. So, here we are at a place where we can increase the deficit, decrease job creation, hurt the middle class, benefit the top 1 percent, and add to the na-tional debt in historic proportions that will be very hard to collect from deficit hawks—if any of you exist over there. Instead, we have an opportunity today for a better deal for the Amer-ican people—better jobs, better pay, better wages, and a better future— where we lower costs for America’s working families and middle class fam-ilies, and where we prepare them with the tools for the economy of the 21st century.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7881 October 5, 2017 
I thank the distinguished gentleman from Kentucky, the chair of the Bour-bon Caucus, for his great leadership in bringing a better budget that is a statement of our national values, that supports American workers with re-sponsible tax reform, calls for parity between defense and nondefense, and strengthens the ACA and protects Medicare. Every time the Republicans come to the floor and try to stack the deck even further for their wealthy friends, we have to have this conversation. Democrats will fight these tax cuts and this unfortunate, deceptive budget that they have on the floor. I urge my col-leagues to start by voting ‘‘no’’ today and to continue the conversation with the American people to fight this un-fortunate path they want to take us down: the road to ruin. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. BLACK. Madam Chairman, I am going to be brief in my closing com-ments. I do want to ask my colleague to con-sider this: Are we proud of a country where we are leaving our children and grandchildren in further and further debt? During our discussion in this Cham-ber, we have shared our ideas for build-ing a better America, an America that we would be proud to entrust to future generations. While it requires con-fronting real challenges along the road ahead, it is, undoubtedly, worth the journey. First, our budget forces the Federal Government to live within its means, just like hardworking Americans and small businesses do on a daily basis. Second, our budget identifies waste-ful spending and finds much-needed savings and reforms for unsustainable mandatory spending. In fact, our com-mittee has put forward the largest re-form package for mandatory programs that has been seen in 20 years. Third, it calls for a robust funding of our military, ensuring the resources that will allow us to be ready and pro-tect our mainland. It also starts the process of restoring our military readi-ness, which suffered dramatically dur-ing the Obama administration. Finally, our budget is the golden key that unlocks progrowth tax reform and takes us one step further to the great ideas unveiled in the framework last week. Without question, our budget plan re-flects American values and shared pri-orities. I urge my colleagues to join me in their support for a win for all Ameri-cans, because doing so will begin to en-sure a brighter and better future for generations to come, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. All time for gen-eral debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 553, the Committee rises. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. N
EWHOUSE ) having assumed the chair, Mrs. W

PERSONAL EXPLANATION  
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I was ab-sent during roll call votes No. 556 through 557 due to my spouse’s health situation in Cali-fornia. Had I been present, I would have voted aye on the Yarmuth of Kentucky Substitute Amendment No. 4, and no on final passage of the Budget Resolution.

LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. M
CCARTHY ) for the purpose of inquiring of the majority leader the schedule for the week to come. (Mr. M
CCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. M
CCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, no votes are expected in the House on account of Columbus Day. On Tuesday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30 p.m. On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and noon for legislative business. On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. Last votes of the week are expected no later than 3 p.m. Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next week, a complete list of which will be an-nounced by close of business tomorrow. In addition, the House will consider S. 585, the Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whis-tleblower Protection Act, sponsored by Senator R
ONJOHNSON . Dr. Kirkpatrick was a psychologist who was fired from the VA medical center where he worked after raising concerns about patients’ medications. He committed suicide the day he was fired. This bill will enhance whistleblower protections while ensuring supervisors who retaliate against whistleblowers are punished. I look forward to the House passing this bill and continuing our work to fundamentally change the culture of the VA. Mr. Speaker, I also expect the House to make a motion to go to conference on the National Defense Authorization Act. Finally, Mr. Speaker, I expect the House to consider an additional supple-mental package to assist the ongoing recovery efforts following Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. I would ask him, Mr. Speaker, will the supplemental that the gentleman mentioned—which is, as I understand, approximately $29 billion, which will take care of forest fires in the West; $16 billion, as I understand it, in debt re-lief, which will raise the borrowing level for FEMA; and then, of course, money directly for the victims of the hurricanes. Can the gentleman tell me whether or not there will be any, what I will call, extraneous matters that might be controversial, or will this be a straight supplemental without con-troversy? We all want to make sure that we have the resources to help. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. The gentleman is correct. The White House has sent up a supplemental, and I do not believe this will be the last of the supplementals, based on the dam-age that has been done from the nu-merous hurricanes. But, yes, there will be more money for the Disaster Relief Fund to help throughout Texas, Flor-ida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Is-lands. As you know, too, the West had dev-astating forest fires, so there is rough-ly $577 million there. And the National Flood Insurance Program has hit a ceiling. To deal with all of the flooding that has gone on, we have to deal with that, as well. The Appropriations Committee has just received that last night. They are working through it now. I don’t intend on seeing other things with it. I look forward to the Member working with me on that to make sure we get it right from what the President has asked. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his thought that there will not be anything in there that would make it a partisan bill. I think, as the President sent it down, it is, obviously, something that we need to do quickly and in a bipartisan way. Mr. Speaker, the majority leader and I have talked about the Dream Act. Another week has gone by and, there-fore, the 6-month deadline is closer, and the President has urged us to pass legislation. Can the gentleman tell me what the expectations are to address the Dream Act? As you know, M
ICHELLE LUJAN GRIS-
HAM, the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, has filed a discharge petition on the bill sponsored by LU-
CILLE ROYBAL -ALLARD and I LEANA ROS- L
EHTINEN . Can the gentleman tell me what progress we are making on that? Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend. Mr. M
CCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Yes, we are dealing with the DACA situation and the situation along the border. As you know, the Speaker has put to-gether a task force. They have met nu-merous times. I have had dinner with the President just this week dealing with this issue, and you and I have talked, as well. I think the best way to solve this problem, to make sure we get to the root cause, we have to secure the bor-der, we have to deal with DACA, and, more importantly, I think we do it in a manner where we are all working to-gether. I am, as you know, not a fan of a dis-charge petition. I think the best way to handle this is continuing to work through the matter with the commit-tees—and on your side of the aisle, as well—to solve this problem. The Presi-dent gave us 6 months. I would like to get this done before then. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his answer. Let me, if I might, Mr. Speaker, sim-ply suggest to the gentleman, we cer-tainly understand, and this side agrees, we want to have secure borders. There is, obviously, a disagreement on the President’s proposal of a wall, I think, frankly, on your side as well as on my side of the aisle. I would hope that we would not, in effect, hold hostage the 800,000 students, workers, and young people brought here as children who know no other country. In my discussions with Mr. R
YAN, and his public comments have indicated, he is sympathetic to making sure that we address that issue. He urged, as you know, President Trump not to rescind DACA. The President did anyway. I am hopeful that we can deal with the DREAMers, which I think certainly has very robust support on both sides of the aisle, in my view, Mr. Leader. I hope we can deal with that without clouding it with an issue, i.e., the wall. Not security; security I think we can reach agreement on. But I am hopeful that we can do that. The DREAMers are extraordinarily anxious. I presume you have met with some of the DREAMers. They are real-ly very impressive people and are en-hancing our communities and our country. So I would hope that we could do that. I look forward to talking to you personally about how we move forward and, hopefully, move quickly. I would like to have done it by next week. As you know, I said that it would be nice to do it in this work period, to lay to rest the anxiety of the 800,000-plus people who will be affected. But, if we can’t do that, certainly I would hope that we could do it shortly after we get back after the next district work pe-riod.

HOUR OF MEETING ON TOMOR-ROW, AND ADJOURNMENT FROM FRIDAY, OCTOBER 6, 2017, TO TUESDAY, OCTOBER 10, 2017 Mr. M
CCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow; and fur-ther, when the House adjourns on that day, it adjourn to meet on Tuesday next, when it shall convene at noon for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for leg-islative business.

f 
b1200 BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH (Mr. GAETZ asked and was given per-mission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, it is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Every day, nearly 1,000 women in this country re-ceive a life-changing diagnosis that they will be affected by breast cancer. Nearly 200,000 of these diagnoses occur each year. One in eight women in our country will face breast cancer. Breast cancer has a devastating ef-fect on our families, taking away wives, mothers, aunts, uncles, sisters, and daughters. I wish I was a brilliant scientist and could develop a cure. I wish I was a ma-gician and could wave a magic wand and cure breast cancer, but I am just a Member of Congress. Actually, there are things this Congress could do to make breast cancer less likely, less deadly, and less painful. Cannabis has shown promise in can-cer research for over 2 decades. This re-search finally came to fruition in 2007, when Dr. Sean McAllister showed that cannabis-related compounds helped fight malignant forms of breast cancer. In the decade since, other research has confirmed and built on Dr. McAllister’s findings, and there is now conclusive research that shows that cannabis-re-lated compounds have antitumor prop-erties. Yet, despite these findings, scientists are going too slow. It is time for can-nabis research to begin, and we should declassify it as a schedule I drug. 
f 
LOCKING PEOPLE UP WITHOUT DUE PROCESS IS UN-AMERICAN (Ms. JAYAPAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, this week, Congressman A
DAM SMITH and I introduced the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act. This legislation is critical to dismantle President Trump’s mass deportation machine, to protect families, and to restore justice and due process to our broken immi-gration system. Our detention system brings huge profits for large private corporations. About 38,000 people are detained every single day at a cost to taxpayers of over $2 billion a year. Mr. Speaker, this bill is about two things: dignity and justice for families, pregnant women, people with serious illnesses, survivors of torture and vio-lence. It is unconscionable that we are detaining these people sometimes for months or even years. Congress can’t afford to sit on the sidelines anymore. It is time to make clear that locking people up without due process is not only unconstitu-tional, it is un-American. At a time when net migration is zero, when DREAMers are at risk of losing their DACA status, and the world reels from unprecedented numbers of refu-gees fleeing for their lives, we must act with compassion. I urge my colleagues to pass the Dig-nity for Detained Immigrants Act, and I thank the over 55 cosponsors who have already come on to this piece of legislation. f 
GUN CONTROL DOESN’T WORK (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, within minutes of the tragic shooting in Las Vegas, Democrats and the lib-eral media called for more gun control measures. A recent Washington Post op-ed de-scribes how one gun control advocate researched restrictive gun laws in Great Britain and in Australia, only to discover that gun buybacks and gun bans do not reduce mass shootings or gun-related crimes. She said: ‘‘The case for the’’—gun control—‘‘policies I had lobbied for crumbled when I examined the evi-dence. . . . But I can’t endorse policies whose only selling point is that gun owners hate them. Policies that often seem as if they were drafted by people who have encountered guns only as a figure in a briefing book or an image on the news.’’ This researcher concluded that more lives would be saved by focusing on in-dividuals instead of guns. We should ensure that background checks work as intended and prevent those with mental health issues from acquiring guns. This actually will do some good, as opposed to meaningless gun regulations. CONGRESS MUST REAUTHORIZE THE CHILDREN’S HEALTH INSUR-ANCE PROGRAM (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge the swift reauthorization of the Children’s Health Insurance Pro-gram. CHIP helps families provide care for their children. Throughout our Nation, it covers 9 million children and preg-nant women. In California, it covers 2 million children. And in my district, half of the kids get their healthcare from Medicaid or CHIP. Now, CHIP was implemented over 20 years ago, championed by two Senators on opposite sides of the political spec-trum, ORRIN HATCH and Ted Kennedy, and it has continued to receive strong bipartisan support. But because of in-action by the House of Representa-tives, because of the distractions by this administration, millions of our children may be denied coverage. They may not get to see their doc-tors for routine checkups. With the up-coming flu season, kids may not be able to get the necessary care when they are sick, and children with aller-gies may not have access to lifesaving medications and health services. If this Congress does not step up to fix this mistake before it is too late, children will pay the price of our inac-tion. Congress must take action to come together to pass CHIP for the millions of kids who continue to depend on us for this healthcare.

AMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. L
AMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I sit as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Indian, Insular and Alaska Native Af-fairs that deals directly with the juris-diction of Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, and other territories of the U.S. We had a very good briefing this week led by J
ENNIFFER GONZA´LEZ- C

Indeed, it has been on the way, and we need to just keep pushing to rebuild that infra-structure and push out into the islands where the need is still felt.

Mr. Speaker, many of us will be going home to our districts, facing constituents who will be asking the question: Why? It really is painful when fellow Amer-icans lose their lives. It is painful as we watch our soldiers go off into battle, and many of them do not come home in any other way but as a fallen soldier. This past week, Americans, who were not in battle but were enjoying the life and the liberty of this Nation, fell by a murderous actor. I think we will have to go home and comfort our constitu-ents, and we will also tell them what we are going to do. I don’t know why we have to climb this high mountain of understanding that laws can make a difference; not end all violence, but make a difference: legislation that says that guns have to be locked to save the lives of children; gun legislation that deals with banning armor-piercing bullets that would harm and injure our first responders; and then to get rid of the kits that this murderous individual utilized to make a semiautomatic an automatic. Mr. Speaker, I ask this Congress, to-gether, to begin to do work on gun safety that will save American lives. I go home to my district to meet with my constituents, and I am going to tell them that I am going to do something that makes sense for the American people.

UNDERSTANDING WHAT LATE- TERM ABORTION IS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-uary 3, 2017, the gentleman from Vir-ginia (Mr. G
ARRETT ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the ma-jority leader. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, the Chamber took up H.R. 36, a bill dealing with pain-capable un-born children; and a bill that, in its re-sult, would cause the United States to join the vast bulk of nations in the world wherein the termination of lives of children who are not only capable of feeling pain, but under what we under-stand to be the best science may, in fact, feel more pain because of the den-sity of the nerve tissue, as they are in this roughly fifth month of develop-ment. I guess four times in the brief time that I have been in this building, we have seen the Chamber erupt into ap-plause, oftentimes over partisan-per-ceived victories. The first time the Chamber erupted into applause is when my colleagues across the aisle were giddy with joy when a bill that would have ensured that the Department of Defense didn’t spend money to perform transgender procedures on soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines failed in the form of an amendment. Another had to do with healthcare. Another had to do with the return of Majority Whip STEVE SCA-
LISE. That was indeed a bipartisan eruption in applause. Then there was an eruption from this side of the Chamber when H.R. 36 passed, as there was a recognition that late-term abortion is barbaric and counter to the ideas put forth to the world when, in the Declaration of Inde-pendence, it was written that we hold certain truths to be self-evident, and among those was life. Too many people have failed to grasp the nature of what late-term abortion is, yet to grapple with the problem will require to understand what exactly that problem is. So to look at the other six nations in the world that allow the termination of life after 5 months, we see nations like Vietnam, North Korea, China, and the United States. Then to listen to the doctors who have performed these procedures de-scribe in what was literally excru-ciating detail how the procedure is per-formed, that an instrument is inserted into the uterus, and probing is done until something is found, and the in-strument is latched on, and then there is pulling, and out comes an arm or a leg or a piece of a head or a torso. Then, in fact, that unborn child, who science tells us can feel pain, dies by virtue of bleeding to death inside its very host. That is the nature of these procedures. Estimates tell us that if the United States joined the fast bulk of the na-tions on the planet in outlawing late- term abortions, somewhere between 14,000 and 20,000 children every year wouldn’t experience an unspeakable de-mise of literally being ripped from their host limb by limb and bleeding to death, all whilst, in the best estimates of scientists, feeling the pain of that death. To put that in terms of Virginia’s Fifth District, that is the population of Cumberland County twice every year, roughly. So there was applause from the Mem-bers who saw that the United States would join the ranks of the civilized nations in the world who put appro-priate value on life, Mr. Speaker, and disappointment from some on the other side of the aisle, other than a few brave individuals to be distinguished by de-parting from the herd and recognizing the value and sanctity of life thereto, and immediate news stories about how H.R. 36 was dead on arrival in the United States Senate. Mr. Speaker, it is my sincere hope that the American people will not let that be the case. I often speak of the history of the Fifth District of Virginia that gave us great Americans like Booker T. Wash-ington and Barbara Johns, Thomas Jef-ferson, John Marshall, James Madison, James Monroe, and Patrick Henry. As I thought about how to best ad-dress the need for action in the other Chamber, Mr. Speaker, I determined that there were no better words than those delivered by Patrick Henry from Virginia, slightly amended, on March 23, 1775, in St. John’s Cathedral as he addressed the second Virginia Assem-bly in Richmond, Virginia. So with all credit to the author, whom I paraphrase, I would read: Mr. Speaker, no man thinks more highly than I do of the patriotism and abili-ties of the very worthy people who have served and do serve in this Sen-ate. b1215 But different people often see the same subject in different lights; and, therefore, I hope it will not be a thought disrespectful to those Senators if entertaining, as I do, opinions of a character very opposite of many of theirs, I shall speak forth of my senti-ments freely and without reserve. This is no time for ceremony. The question before the Senate is one of an awful consequence to this coun-try. For my part, I consider it nothing less than a question of life or death, and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject, ought to be the freedom of debate. It is only in this way that we can hope to arrive at truth and fulfill the great responsibility which we hold to our creator and country. Should I keep back my opinions at such times through a fear of giving of-fense or political loss? I should con-sider myself guilty of treason and of cowardice, an act of disloyalty towards the majesty of our creator, who I re-vere above all earthly kings. Mr. Speaker, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes against painful truth and listen to the song of the siren until she transforms us into beasts. Is this the role of wise people engaged in a great and arduous struggle for life? Are we disposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes, see not, and having ears, hear not the things which so nearly concern their temporal salva-tion? For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth, to know the worst, and to provide for it. I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that is the lamp of experience, of his-tory. I have no way of judging the fu-ture but by the past. In judging the past, I wish to know for what has been the conduct of the abortion industry for the last 44 years to justify those hopes with which gen-tlemen are pleased to solace them-selves. The Senate, is that insidious smile which our petition has been received lately? Trust it not, sir. It will prove a snare at your feet. Suffer not your-selves to be betrayed with the promise

of later action. Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our petition comports with these nearly 60 million lives lost in this country alone, which cover our waters and darken our lands. Is taking an unborn life a work of love and reconciliation? Is subjecting to pain a 5-month-old child as no other nation save six on the Earth allowed to happen? Let us not deceive ourselves. These are the implements of death and destruction. I ask what means this perpetual delay of voting? What is its purpose? What is the force of inaction? Can gen-tlemen assign another possible motive for it than to ensure that it never oc-curs? Destruction? No, sir, destruction. They are set to send and perpetuate this loss of life, and have so long sup-ported this loss of life, and now an op-portunity presents itself to vote, and what do we have to oppose inaction? Mr. Speaker, we have our voices. Shall we try again and again? Shall we bring this bill back next year? We have been trying that for 40 years. Have we any-thing new to offer upon the subject? Nothing. We have held this subject in every light of which it is capable. It has all been, to this date, in vain. Shall we re-sort to entreaty and supplication? What terms shall we find that have not already been exhausted? Let us not, I beseech you, Mr. Speaker, deceive our-selves. We have done everything that we could do to avert this death that has claimed nearly 60 million lives and 14 to 20 million unborn lives after the age of 5 months in utero every single year. We have petitioned, we have remon-strated, we have supplicated, we have prostrated ourselves and have implored its inner position to arrest the tyran-nical hands of the abortion industry and its champions in Washington, and our petitions have been slighted. Our remonstrations produce additional death and insult. Our supplications have been disregarded, and we have been spurned with contempt from the floor of the Chamber of the opposing body. In vain these things we may in-dulge the fond hope of life and justice. If we support life, if we mean to pre-serve and violate this fundamental right for which we have been so long arguing, if we mean not basely to aban-don this noble struggle which we have been so long engaged in, in which we have pledged ourselves to never aban-don until the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained, we must hope the American people demand the Senate hold a vote. We must hope the American people demand the Senate hold a vote. An appeal to democracy and to the Lord of hosts is all that is left to us. Suffer not yourselves to be betrayed with a promise of later action. Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our petition comports with the near-ly 60 million lives ended. We can be heard in numbers across the fruited plain. A vote should be held for or against life. Let us have it. Let us have it. In this vein, sir, to extenu-ate the matter, gentlemen may cry: Later; later; next year. But there is no later. The killing has continued for over 40 years. The next gale that sweeps to the North will bring to our ears cries of the yet born. The House has voted. Why is the Senate idle? What is it that they wish? What would they have? Is political victory so dear or a title so sweet as to be purchased at the price of human life? Forbid it, Al-mighty God. Mr. Speaker, I know not what course others may take, but as for me, my hope is that there is a vote. My hope is that we stand for life. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

May our lawmakers focus on Your glory and not their own. Inspire them with Your presence so that their lives will reflect Your mercy and truth. Lord, give them the wisdom to trust Your plans and to desire for You to do as You please for our Nation and world. Forgive us when we depend primarily on our strength and ability to meet life’s challenges, forgetting that You are able and eager to help us.

TAX REFORM Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, during the Obama years, many of the hard-working men and women of Amer-ica’s middle class felt completely for-gotten. Paychecks often did not keep pace with rising costs. Opportunities for work could often seem bleak. For those men and women, the promise of a hard-earned retirement seemed to drift further and further away. For so many middle-class Americans, the last dec-ade meant a weak economy and a de-cline of opportunities. People of this Nation deserve better. They deserve larger paychecks, more jobs, and better opportunities to get ahead. This Congress is committed to help-ing the economy live up to its full po-tential once again, which is exactly why we are committed to passing tax reform. This is our once-in-a-genera-tion opportunity to overhaul a broken tax code that holds us back and replace it with something that actually works for the hard-working people of our country. It represents the single most important thing we can do today to get our economy back on the right track. Working together, President Trump, his team, and the tax-writing commit-tees in Congress have developed the framework that will help us get there. Here is what it envisions: For American workers, we want to make your taxes lower, simpler, and fairer. We want to take more money out of Washington’s pockets and put more in yours. Helping individuals and families suc-ceed is the first aim of tax reform. Helping businesses succeed is the sec-ond aim, so we can help create more jobs and keep them right here in Amer-ica. American businesses, both large and small, face an increasingly competitive global economy. We want to put Amer-ican businesses and workers on a level playing field because when they are, they can win. We want to help bring jobs and prof-its back home, and once they are here, we want to give businesses the right in-centives to keep them right here in America. We want to unleash the potential of the American economy—helping you keep more of the money in your pay-check, helping businesses grow and workers succeed, helping move the economy into high gear so we can sus-tain real prosperity into the future for America’s middle class. These are the kinds of ideas that should be shared by everyone, Repub-licans and Democrats alike. Our friends across the aisle supported the need for tax reform for many years. They used to advocate it loudly. But the tone seems to be different now. What changed? The President, or so it would seem. We know that our Democratic friends are under immense pressure from the hard left to oppose everything this President touches, but I hope they can resist that pressure and do what they know is right. After all, shouldn’t we all support cutting middle-class taxes, helping small businesses, and bringing jobs and investments back to our coun-try? I was always under the impression that Democrats wanted to end cor-porate offshoring, eliminate loopholes for the wealthy, and cut middle-class taxes. Well, these are all aspects of the current tax reform framework. So there is no need for our friends to in-vent reasons to justify opposing tax re-form. There is no reason to launch at-tacks on the tax reform framework based on made-up details that aren’t actually in it. Tax reform has been a bipartisan effort in the past. It can be, and it should be, again now. It is up to our Democratic friends to decide if they would like to engage in a serious way. I personally hope they will join us in advancing this impor-tant initiative for our country. I think we owe at least that much to the mil-lions of Americans who felt forgotten over the last decade. Tax reform can help move our econ-omy into high gear. It can help deliver more jobs, higher wages, and increased opportunities for the American people. The men and women of this country de-serve it, which is why I am committed

EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will pro-ceed to executive session and resume consideration of the Quarles nomina-tion, which the clerk will report. The legislative clerk read the nomi-nation of Randal Quarles, of Colorado, to be a Member of the Board of Gov-ernors of the Federal Reserve System for the unexpired term of fourteen years from February 1, 2004. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 10 a.m. will be equally divided between the two leaders or their designees. The Senator from Utah. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the nomination of Randal Quarles to help oversee the Federal Reserve System. Mr. Quarles is certainly eminently qualified to serve in this capacity in this important posi-tion. Through his long experience in public service and the private sector, Mr. Quarles has gained experience in fi-nancial regulation, economics, and the firsthand operations of financial insti-tutions. He also has a proven track record of leadership and policy man-agement. The Fed’s responsibilities are exten-sive, and they are varied, and the roles Mr. Quarles has been nominated for come during a unique period in the Fed’s history. The years ahead will be decisive for the development of the Federal Reserve, the American econ-omy, as well as domestic and inter-national financial reform. It is para-mount that the Fed be equipped with a well-rounded leadership team so it can meet the many challenges and opportu-nities of maintaining monetary and fi-nancial stability. I firmly believe that Mr. Quarles is an ideal fit to take on such responsibilities—for the success of the Federal Reserve and the good of our Nation. In closing, I applaud and strongly support the President’s nominee to help oversee the Federal Reserve Sys-tem. I know him personally. I know what a fine man he is. I know what an excellent leader he is. He will do a good job. Importantly, I would note that it is the intention to confirm Mr. Quarles to the position of Vice Chair for Super-vision—another essential role. It is critical that Mr. Quarles begin his work at the Fed as soon as possible. There really is no time to waste. He will do a great job. (At the request of Mr. SCHUMER , the following statement was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD .) ∑Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, I had expected to be able to vote today on the confirmation of Mr. Randal Quarles to be a member of the Federal Reserve. Instead, I am in Las Vegas, meeting with victims of and first re-sponders to the deadliest mass shoot-ing in modern U.S. history. On the question of Mr. Quarles’s nomination, I want to make clear that I would have voted ‘‘no’’ had I been present. While an official in the Bush administration Treasury Department in the lead-up to the economic crisis of 2007 to 2009, Mr. Quarles failed to take action to prevent the build-up of risk that ultimately led to hundreds of thousands of foreclosures and evictions in Nevada. In fact, Mr. Quarles during that period repeatedly maintained that the financial system was safe, that large banks were well-capitalized, and that the housing market was strong, notwithstanding clear signs of esca-lating risk. After serving in the Treas-ury Department, Mr. Quarles was the beneficiary of the second-largest ‘‘loss share’’ agreement in the Federal De-posit Insurance Corporation’s history. This agreement provided a taxpayer- backed guarantee and allowed Mr. Quarles to profit substantially off of the failure of a large bank. If confirmed, I hope that Mr. Quarles will exceed my expectations and be-come a strong advocate for a safe and resilient American financial system. However, I cannot in good conscience vote to confirm him given my concerns about his past record. Thank you. 
NOMINATION OF LEE FRANCIS CISSNA  
Mr. President, I had expected to be able to vote today on the confirmation of Mr. Lee Francis Cissna, to be Direc-tor of the U.S. Citizenship and Immi-gration Services, USCIS. Instead, I am in Las Vegas helping my constituents in the aftermath of the worst mass shooting in modern American history. On the question of Mr. Cissna’s nomi-nation, I want to make my opposition to his confirmation clear. I do not be-lieve Mr. Cissna to be qualified to lead the USCIS. This decision is based on his prior experience, as well as his tes-timony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Mr. Cissna stated during his confirmation hearing that he had a role on President Trump’s transition team and he offered his ‘‘technical as-sistance’’ in crafting some of the Presi-dent’s draconian immigration policies. Additionally, it is my belief that Mr. Cissna does not have the management experience necessary to oversee a large organization like the USCIS. If confirmed, I hope that Mr. Cissna will surpass my expectations and serve this country well as USCIS Director. The role of the USCIS in implementing and administering our immigration benefits is too important for any other result. I believe strongly in the impor-tance of immigrants to the culture and economy of the United States, and I hope Mr. Cissna’s actions as Director show that he agrees. However, I cannot in good conscience vote to confirm someone about whom I have so many concerns.∑ Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER  
The Democratic leader is recognized. 
LAS VEGAS MASS SHOOTING  
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, as we continue to grieve with the people of Las Vegas and families of the injured and the deceased, when I think of the pictures I see of those beautiful young people who had the best of life ahead of them, we ache for them. But our thoughts must turn to action so this doesn’t happen again. What can we do as a nation to change? Because surely when there are more mass shootings this year than there are the number of days this year, when we average more than one mass shooting per day, something has to change. I am sure that if you asked the griev-ing families whether they want the laws to change so this might not hap-pen again, the overwhelming majority would say yes, they would want us to do something. If we could talk to those brave souls who were killed and are now in Heaven, they would say: Do something. They wouldn’t say: Let’s wait. They wouldn’t say: Leave things alone. The fact that they were killed, the fact that there were so many in-jured—they wouldn’t think it is polit-ical to try to save their lives or pre-vent somebody else from dying the way they did. So when folks say: Don’t bring politics into this, that it is inap-propriate, I am sure the families of the loved ones who were lost would agree with me that it is appropriate and im-portant and necessary. Politics is where we are supposed to come together and debate the great problems of our time in order to find solutions to them. Politics is how we are supposed to make our country a better, safer, more prosperous place to live. And there is no more appropriate time than now to talk about the issue of gun violence. Yesterday, President Trump visited Las Vegas. I am glad he went to show our solidarity and remind everyone there that they have the full support of the Nation. But he didn’t talk about guns. There is a huge opportunity he

missed to lead this Nation in a reason-able, moderate debate on gun safety, but that opportunity is not over. The President still has the opportunity. All eyes are on the President to see if he will grasp the opportunity and lead the Nation to do something reasonable and moderate about guns and gun safety. President Trump, are you going to wait to hear what the NRA says first? Are you going to wait for the NRA to give you the green light? You ran your campaign saying you were beholden to no one. You fashion yourself as a strong man. Well, are you going to show that you are not beholden to any-one now? Are you going to show your strength now? Are you going to be the first Republican President in a genera-tion to buck the NRA? You know what the right thing to do is. I say to President Trump: Come out and say that you support and would sign a law to ban bump stocks—the modification used by the Las Vegas gunman to make his weapons auto-matic. That is small, and it is the right thing to do. Don’t wait for the NRA to make up their mind. Do it. Of course, banning bump stocks can’t be our only response. It is hardly enough. Even though we should do whatever we can in this body in obei-sance to the NRA, we must do more. Abandoning efforts to deregulate si-lencers would be the next step. The po-lice were able to figure out where the gunman was because of the noise from his gun in the Mandalay Bay Hotel. Let’s forget about implementing a national concealed carry reciprocity. My police officers in Times Square don’t want to let someone who has had no check, who might have a mental de-rangement like Paddock, come to Times Square—and they can’t do any-thing about it; that is what that law would do—or any other heavily popu-lated place, the downtowns of many of our big cities and even medium-sized cities, Disney World, baseball games, football stadiums. If this concealed carry reciprocity passed, crazy people could carry weapons concealed into any football stadium in America, and the police couldn’t check on them and see if they had a gun. We have to do these things. If you looked at what would be the most ef-fective way in stopping the daily gun violence that is doable, the most im-portant and attainable thing to do would be adopting universal back-ground checks. It is common sense, it is measured, it is prudent, and it would be really effective. The bill Senator M
URPHY introduced yesterday is one I have been involved with for a long time, and we should see if we can get enough support to pass it. We can and should talk about these issues more. It requires only a mod-icum of moral and political coverage. President Trump and Republicans in Congress ought to show that moral and political courage now by bucking the NRA and engaging in a reasonable de-bate about commonsense gun laws. Fully automatic weapons are already illegal, made so by a law signed by President Reagan in 1986. Banning bump stocks is entirely consistent with the books. Senator FEINSTEIN intro-duced a reasonable proposal. What are we waiting for, the NRA to give us a green light? That is so wrong. If the President and Congress are so beholden to the NRA that they can’t do the very bare minimum—banning a de-vice that allowed a shooter to kill 59 Americans with ease, a device whose ban would in no way infringe on the le-gitimate rights of gun owners—then our politics, our means of making this country a better and safer place, will have once again failed us. 
PUERTO RICO AND U .S. VIRGIN ISLANDS  
RECOVERY EFFORT  
Mr. President, turning to the human-itarian crisis in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, yesterday, once again, Congress received a request from the administration for a supplemental aid package that will go to help Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and other States hit by storms. It also includes some money for the Western States beset by wildfires. It is a good first step, but it is just the start of a long recovery and relief effort that will require additional aid from this Congress. While aid and re-sources are necessary now, these is-lands are just starting to assess the damage. Once they determine how dev-astating these storms actually were, we need to respond immediately to pro-vide additional support and funds to as-sist their recovery and rebuilding, just as we have done for past storms and disasters. On this package, I have three points. First, I am urging my colleagues to add additional and vital flexible fund-ing for recovery like the community development block grant. We gave CDBG to help Texas after Harvey. We can’t deprive Puerto Rico and the Vir-gin Islands of this money. Second, I am warning my colleagues on the other side—particularly those in the House—not to attach any extra-neous, ideological policy riders to this urgent aid package. Ideological policy changes to the Flood Insurance Pro-gram and forest management policies should come nowhere near this bill. They tried to do it last week in the FAA bill, and we had to send it back because of joint opposition, both sides of the aisle. Let’s not go through that again. I thank our chairman of the Banking Committee for helping in that regard. Third, it has become clear that Puer-to Rico’s recovery will be further hin-dered by its ongoing debt crisis. That crisis, coupled with the devastation from Hurricane Maria, has led to grow-ing concerns that the island will soon face a liquidity crisis. Simply put, the island is running out of money to pay for essential services like first respond-ers, not to mention funds for rebuilding and recovery. The funds we hope to in-clude in the disaster package are crit-ical, but we have to make sure the is-land has enough cash to start the proc-ess. In FEMA, local governments often have to lay out the money first and then they get repaid, but Puerto Rico doesn’t have the money to lay out so we have to deal with that issue to make it effective. With these issues in mind, we should act quickly on this supplemental aid, but it is just the beginning of Congress’s aid to rebuild. TAX REFORM  
Mr. President, finally, on the Repub-lican tax plan, I have so much to say about this plan. It is so awful in so many ways: huge tax cuts for the wealthy and the powerful, raising taxes on middle-class people—which I am going to talk about in a minute—blow-ing a huge hole in our deficit, and to fund the tax cuts for the rich, cutting Medicare and Medicaid by close to $1.5 trillion. We are all in favor of a serious tax re-form debate. We have mentioned our guidelines: no tax cuts for the 1 per-cent, no increase in the deficit, and do it in a bipartisan way. The Republican plan does just the opposite. That is why Democrats are so opposed. It lav-ishes tax breaks on the rich, pays for it by cutting Medicare and Medicaid, and leaves everyone in the cold, except the very wealthy. Today I want to focus on one provi-sion of the GOP tax plan: the repeal of the State and local tax deduction. The Republican plan raises taxes on mil-lions of middle-class families across the country by repealing the State and local deduction. Forty-four million Americans take that deduction. That is about one in eight. It is about one in four or five families who take that de-duction. One-third of all taxpayers take the deduction. It is almost one in three. They don’t just get a few pennies back. They get several thousand dol-lars off their taxes each year. It is not just a rarified group in States like Massachusetts, New York, and Cali-fornia. The reason it brings in $1.3 tril-lion is because it affects so many peo-ple throughout the entire country. If you do not believe me, look at the numbers. Look at these charts. I am posting the percentages for each State. Forty-six percent of the people in Maryland get an average deduction of $12,900. Connecticut gets 41 percent. I showed one of my colleagues that Vir-ginia is higher than New York. Thirty- seven percent get an $11,000 deduction. Massachusetts, Oregon. To my col-leagues from Utah, 35 percent of Utah taxpayers get an average deduction of $12,954. In Utah, they say: Well, the standard deduction makes up for it. With most families, the standard de-duction will not because we are taking away the standard exemption so it is a wash if you are a family of three. Let’s keep going. Minnesota and New York. I want to show my Republican colleagues how it would affect some of their States. Let’s take Georgia. One- third of all taxpayers get an average

break of $9,000. Look at these numbers, my colleagues. I am going to send them to every one of you. Look how it af-fects your State. Here we go. Iowa, 29 percent of all people get a $10,000 break, on average; Pennsylvania, 29 percent, an $11,000 break; Arizona, 28 percent, a $7,000 break. My friend from Idaho, I didn’t know he would be here, but his number on the chart—28 percent of Idahoans get an average of an $8,800 break. Do you want to take that away from them? The standard deduction doesn’t make up for it if you have one child or more. Nebraska, 28 percent get an $11,000 de-duction. By the way, these numbers come from a group that put it together, but it is from the IRS. These are IRS num-bers. South Carolina, 27 percent, $8,000; Missouri, 26 percent, $9,800; Ohio, 26 percent, $10,000. Kentucky, my dear friend the Republican leader, in his State, 26 percent of the people—one out of four—get that State and local prop-erty deduction, averaging $9,995. Do you want to take that away? Alabama, where our dear friend the Presiding Officer is from, gets 26 per-cent. One out of four of his constitu-ents get an average break of $5,900. Kansas, 25 percent, gets an average break of $9,400. I am saying these numbers because our friends on the hard right, who just want to lower their own taxes, are tell-ing everybody, oh, this is just in four States—Massachusetts, New York, California, New Jersey. No, it is across America. Let’s keep going. I am having a good time. I hope you all are. Oklahoma, 24 percent of the people get an $8,000 break. I think this is Mis-sissippi, 23 percent, gets a $6,300 break; Louisiana, 23 percent, close to one out of four, $6,700. Texas, the great State of Texas, where our majority whip comes from, 23 percent, close to one out of four Texans, get a $7,800 break. Indi-ana, 23 percent get an $8,700 break; Florida, 22 percent get a $7,300 break. Wyoming—it wouldn’t affect Wyoming because it is a rural State—22 percent get a $6,300 break. The State that is least affected is still very affected. South Dakota and West Virginia, only 17 percent of the people get a $9,000 break in West Vir-ginia and a $6,000 break in South Da-kota. North Dakota, Tennessee, and Arkansas—21 percent, 19 percent, 18 percent breaks, between $4,900 and $6,800. The Achilles’ heel of this bill—there are many—is State and local deduct-ibility. It kills the middle class and the upper middle income people. It doesn’t really affect the rich. They do not pay a lot of property taxes, the bulk of these deductions. They make their money in high-income places. They have a lot of stocks and a lot of bonds. It is the middle class and the upper middle class who get clobbered by this tax break. The standard deduction does not undo it because you lose the stand-ard exemption. Even if you are just a husband and wife without kids— Mr. President, I am going to ask unanimous consent that the debate be delayed for a few minutes. I know my colleagues are—well, I just need to fin-ish my remarks. I am almost done. The benefit of State and local de-ductibility affects every State, every city, every town, every municipality, and goes deep into the middle class and the working class. One other point I have to make, now realizing this, some of our Republican colleagues are saying we will modify it. Folks, there is no real way to modify the provision to eliminate State and local deductibility. If you want to give a choice that will not work—because for middle-class taxpayers, it is only the combination of their itemized de-ductions, such as State, local, mort-gage, and others, that make it worth it for them to itemize. If you have to choose between the mortgage deduction and your property tax deduction, it is a loser. So they say: Well, we will just do this for the very rich. Yet, as I mentioned, that is not where the money is. Where are you going to cap it? It is mostly a middle- class deduction. If you cap it, say, for people whose incomes are above $500,000 or $1 million, you don’t bring in much money. So it is a loser. You can-not fix it. Get rid of it. You cannot fix it. The plans that are being done still continue to hurt the middle class dra-matically. The Republican plan to repeal State and local cannot be fixed, modified, or tweaked around the edges. Each of the proposals does not work. It must be scrapped. The State and local deduc-tion affects everyone, even the almost one in five taxpayers in the lowest States where it affects the fewest peo-ple. It is just one of the many flaws in this broken, broken framework. Let’s start over. Don’t just do a Re-publican plan that appeals to the hand-ful of very wealthy corporations and very wealthy individuals. Work with us on a fair plan that helps the middle class, not the very wealthy. We are ready, but if you do the same thing that you did on healthcare in trying to do it by yourselves, I think that you will meet with the same fate that the healthcare bill did. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Massachusetts. Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator C
RAPO  and I both be allowed to speak for 5 minutes on the nomination of Randal Quarles. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, every time President Trump has the choice between standing up for American fam-ilies or standing up for wealthy banks and giant corporations, he chooses the rich guys. Time and again, he has promised that he would ‘‘never be beholden to the lob-byists or the special interests,’’ but he has appointed dozens of Big Business executives and lobbyists to senior posi-tions in his administration. During his campaign, he promised that he would not let the Wall Street guys get away with murder, but after he was sworn in, he loaded up his economic team with Goldman Sachs executives. Over and over again, he has promised to drain the swamp, but then he appointed an army of lobbyists and industry insiders to positions that oversee the industries that paid them for years. Randal Quarles is just the latest in this long line of corporate appoint-ments. He is President Trump’s nomi-nee to the Federal Reserve’s Vice Chair for Supervision. He has gone through the revolving door so many times that it is hard to keep up—from a big Wall Street law firm, to the Treasury De-partment, back to the Wall Street law firm, back, eventually, to the Treasury Department, then to a private equity fund, followed most recently by a trip to another private equity fund. Now Mr. Quarles is ready for another spin through the revolving door. The Vice Chair for Supervision of the Fed is one of the most important jobs in the government. After the 2008 cri-sis, Congress put the Fed in charge of supervising the biggest banks. That in-cluded banks and other financial insti-tutions that would bring down the whole financial system with them if they went under—the so-called ‘‘too big to fail’’ institutions. The Fed is what stands between millions of Amer-ican families and another economic ca-tastrophe that could rob them of their jobs, their savings, or their homes. After the 2008 crisis, Congress created the Vice Chair for Supervision position to lead efforts to supervise these giant institutions. There is no other position in government that has a more impor-tant role in stopping the next financial crisis. So what kind of supervision and over-sight does Mr. Quarles believe in? His motto seems to be, ‘‘Whatever the big banks want, give it to ’em.’’ Mr. Quarles has spent more than a decade in private equity and invest-ment management, where he has ar-gued repeatedly for weaker rules for giant banks, including relaxing the rules for stress tests that evaluate banks’ soundness, lowering capital and leverage standards, and repealing the Volcker rule. At his hearing before the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, I showed Mr. Quarles a 124-page list of financial rule rollbacks from a lob-bying group for the biggest banks in the country. I asked him to tell me which of those dozens of changes he disagreed with. He couldn’t name one— not one. The No. 1 thing that we need from a Vice Chair for Supervision is independ-ence from Wall Street—a demonstrated willingness to stand up to the wishes of

the big banks and protect the interests of working families. There is not a speck of independence in Mr. Quarles’ track record. Mr. Quarles’ time in government also raises red flags. As Under Secretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance, he was responsible for overseeing finan-cial institutions, markets, and regula-tions in the years leading up to the fi-nancial crisis. Let me say that again. Mr. Quarles was the Treasury official in charge of helping to oversee Wall Street in the years leading up to the crisis. Does anyone want to point out how that worked out? If Mr. Quarles had wanted to stand up to the banks, he could have found and fixed systemwide problems in the mar-kets before catastrophe struck. In-stead, in 2006, when the banks were making gobs of money off of risky bets that eventually crashed the economy, Quarles gave a speech in front of a roomful of bankers and said: ‘‘Fun-damentally, the economy is strong, the financial sector is healthy, and our fu-ture’’—the banks’—‘‘looks bright.’’ Less than 2 years later, the entire sys-tem exploded and cost Americans, col-lectively, about $14 trillion. Make no mistake about it, con-firming Mr. Quarles endangers the health of the economy. The last time that Mr. Quarles was in charge, he failed to act to protect the American people from the biggest recession since the Great Depression either because he missed the signs or because he delib-erately ignored them. Either way, that makes him the wrong person for the job. American families deserve a strong leader as the Vice Chair for Super-vision of the Fed who will fight hard to keep them safe. Everything we know about Mr. Quarles says that he will be fighting hard for the big banks. I will be voting no on Mr. Quarles’ nomina-tion, and I urge all of my colleagues to do the same. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Idaho. Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of the Hon-orable Randal Quarles to be a member of the Board of Governors of the Fed-eral Reserve System. Mr. Quarles has extensive govern-ment and private-sector experience dealing with both domestic and inter-national financial markets. He is no stranger to public service in his having previously served in multiple top posts in the Treasury Department. Mr. Quarles has also been nominated to serve as the Vice Chairman for Su-pervision, a role that has never been of-ficially filled. Instead, former Federal Governor Dan Tarullo has acted as the de facto Vice Chairman for Supervision in various ways, including by chairing the Federal Reserve Board’s Com-mittee on Supervision and Regulation, overseeing the Large Institution Su-pervision Coordinating Committee, and representing the Fed at the Financial Stability Board and in Basel, among other functions. In February, Chair Yellen committed in a hearing that she expected Presi-dent Trump’s nominee for Vice Chair-man for Supervision to have the same responsibilities that Governor Tarullo had, including heading the Federal Re-serve’s Committee on Supervision and Regulation and representing the Fed at the Financial Stability Board and in Basel. I expect Mr. Quarles to perform those same duties in the interim, and I look forward to confirming him to that posi-tion soon. Mr. Quarles has strong bi-partisan support and was voted out of the Banking, Housing, and Urban Af-fairs Committee with the affirmative vote of 17 to 6. If confirmed, he will play a key role in developing regu-latory and supervisory policy for the Federal Reserve System. I urge all of my colleagues to support Mr. Quarles’ nomination today and vote for his confirmation. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the Quarles nomination? Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, not too long ago—I believe this was 2011—a President came to a joint session of Congress and before the American peo-ple, he said what needed to be said about our Tax Code. He was pretty blunt. He said that our Tax Code is ‘‘rigged.’’ He said: ‘‘It makes no sense, and it has to change.’’ Of course, you can imagine, that was met with bipar-tisan applause in the House Chamber and across the country. The same President called on Demo-crats and Republicans to ‘‘simplify the system, get rid of the loopholes, and . . . lower the corporate tax rate’’—one that, I might add, ranks among the highest in the industrialized world. That President, like the rest of us, knows that our business tax rate is a self-inflicted economic wound because businesses figure out, How can I move money offshore and my headquarters offshore, and if I earn money overseas, how can I avoid bringing that back to the United States for better wages and more jobs and to build the business? That is all because of our self-destruc-tive Tax Code. But the President’s name—and I gave it away by saying the year the speech was given. The President’s name might surprise you, given the nature of the current debate in Washington. It was Barack Obama who said that, and the straight talk came from his 2011 State of the Union address. Let’s fast forward a few years. We have a new President from a different party beating the same drum. Presi-dent Trump has called our Tax Code a relic and a colossal barrier standing in the way of America’s economic come-back. He is right, of course, but so was President Obama. Tax reform doesn’t have to be par-tisan. In fact, it shouldn’t be because the ramifications are much more im-portant than just the politics and the scorekeeping of the day. The job cre-ators in my State of Texas are the ones who really understand what is at stake because they are living it. They are the ones who are getting slammed by our current system. Take Lisa Fullerton, for example, who owns a small retail business in San Antonio, my hometown. Ms. Ful-lerton is an accountant with 33 years of experience, who used to handle her own business’s tax compliance in-house. Eventually, though, the code became too complex, and enforcement became too punitive, and she couldn’t take that risk anymore. She said that her outsourcing of tax and employment functions now costs her small business roughly $280,000 more per year than it did in 2000. Lisa is far from the only one who is frustrated. Kurt Summers is the Presi-dent of Austin Generator Service, a small residential power company in the Texas capital. For him, a lower tax rate would mean the difference be-tween his company turning a profit or

a loss. It would literally make the dif-ference between being able to keep the doors open or have to lock them up permanently. He explained that any extra profits realized through tax sav-ings might enable his company to grow more aggressively. To him, the need for change is very simple. It means more hiring and more jobs. So Texans, like Alaskans and like all Americans, get the picture. But the picture is pretty messed up, and it doesn’t make any sense. Greg Brown, President of W.W. Can-non, an industrialized storage company in Dallas, says that compliance has gotten to be a truly herculean tax. It has gotten so difficult that he has had to outsource that to a CPA—again, be-cause it is so complex and people don’t want to risk the burden of not doing it right because of the punitive nature of the penalties. Darryl Lyons, CEO of PAX Financial Group, has done the same thing. He is harmed each year by the passthrough taxes on his small business income, which impair his ability to save for business emergencies, as well as to pay off his company debt. Lastly, in terms of my stories here, Andy Ellard, the owner and general manager of a machine company in Dal-las, regularly purchases expensive com-puter numerical controlled equipment to stay competitive in his industry. I have no idea what that is—computer numerical controlled equipment. He said that the tax ramifications of every purchase have to be considered. Almost every day, he asks: Can we expense it? Do we have to depreciate it? And if we do, over how long? Mr. Ellard isn’t shy with his words. He calls the complicated deduction scheme for business expenses ‘‘chaos.’’ Clearly, something needs to change. As I said at the outset, that has been acknowledged on a bipartisan basis by the current President and the past President. I even brought out some quotes yesterday or the day before from the Democratic leader, Senator S
CHUMER , making exactly the same ar-gument. The ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, the Sen-ator from Oregon, said that lowering the corporate tax rate will make Amer-ica more competitive globally and will bring money back home for jobs and in-vestment in our country. So it is im-portant for us to be consistent and, un-fortunately, they haven’t been. Things are starting to change. Last week, the so-called Big 6—led by Speaker R
YAN; Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin; K
EVIN BRADY , chair-man of the House Ways and Means Committee; and the Finance Com-mittee chairman, O
RRIN HATCH —re-leased a unified framework that con-tains core principles for reform. Among them are a simplified rate structure, the elimination of the alternative min-imum tax, and many itemized deduc-tions and incentives for companies to keep jobs on American soil. Perhaps most importantly, the framework rec-ommends what is widely agreed upon as overdue, which is lowering our un-competitive corporate rate, which puts American employers and workers at a disadvantage. Today, it is sad but true that we are divided on many issues in America. But as President Trump and President Obama have suggested, tax reform does not have to be one of them. I listened to our friend the Demo-cratic leader, Senator SCHUMER , this morning, calling for bipartisan tax re-form. They are going to have a chance to do that because, after we pass a budget resolution, I anticipate that in the Senate Finance Committee, Sen-ator H
ATCH will call up a base bill known as the chairman’s mark, which will be open for amendment in the Sen-ate Finance Committee. That is what people have been asking for, a chance to participate in the writing of the leg-islation in the committee and then to have it come to the floor for open de-bate and amendment. It is what we call regular order around here. But what I am hearing from our Democratic col-leagues is, yes, they want bipartisan legislation, but they don’t want to par-ticipate in the process of writing. It strikes me as pretty hypocritical. This shouldn’t be partisan, as President Obama and President Trump have dem-onstrated and as Democrats and Re-publicans alike have said time and again. We in Washington have no magic wand that will make our Tax Code sud-denly disappear, but that doesn’t ex-cuse us from working to make taxes and tax compliance a little less pain-ful. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Colorado. 
LAS VEGAS MASS SHOOTING  
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, last weekend a man camped out on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas. He stockpiled 23 weapons and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. He set up bipods and scopes. He brought a hammer to knock out the window. Then, on Sunday, he opened fire. He kept firing for 15 minutes, stopping only to reload and switch weapons. Over 15 minutes, he murdered 58 Amer-icans and injured more than 500. The day after the shooting, I was in Washington. I had seven or eight meet-ings, and not a single person in those meetings brought up the worst shoot-ing in modern American history—not one. I am not sure if it was two mass shootings ago or three when we started to accept this as a normal condition of American life, when we lost our belief that it was within our power to protect our fellow Americans at a country music concert or at a nightclub or at a movie theater or at a school. I know there are strong beliefs about guns in America—principled beliefs— but there are also steps that the over-whelming majority of Americans want us to take. There are 90 percent of Americans who think we need back-ground checks for every gun sale, in-cluding 74 percent of NRA members. There are 89 percent of Americans who think we should prevent the mentally ill from purchasing guns. There are 82 percent of Republicans who want us to bar gun purchases for people on the no- fly or terrorist watch list. Yet Con-gress has done nothing to respond to the American people. We did nothing after Aurora, after Newtown, after Or-lando—nothing. Unlike Washington, in Colorado, after the two mass shootings in Aurora and at Columbine, our legislators rose to the occasion and made tough choices after we suffered two of the worst mass shootings in our Nation’s history. After the massacre at Columbine, we closed the gun show loophole. After the trag-edy in Aurora, we strengthened our background checks in a Western State. Last year, those background checks blocked 8,704 people from buying guns. That may sound like a lot, but 380,000 people applied for guns in Colorado last year. That means just 2 percent of those folks who applied were blocked and that 98 percent were able to buy guns without a problem. Who were the 2 percent whom Colo-rado is blocking but whom this Con-gress fails to block? Among them were murderers and rapists and kidnappers and domestic abusers. No one could come to this floor and tell me Colorado is worse off because we have kept guns out of the hands of those people. The average wait time for those background checks is 12 minutes. That strikes me as a fair tradeoff to keep guns out of the hands of mur-derers and kidnappers and rapists. Yet here in Washington, despite now an an-nual tragedy—tragedy after tragedy— Congress has done nothing. We haven’t even done the simple things like close the gun show loophole or stop people on the terrorist watch list from buying weapons. This is not about taking guns away from people who have them. It is about keeping guns out of the hands of people who nearly everybody agrees should not have them. It is about stopping more people like the Las Vegas killer from modifying his rifles to become al-most fully automatic and far more deadly. I cosponsored a bill this week to ban those modifications, and I am encouraged that some of my Repub-lican colleagues seem to be open to that idea. I know we cannot stop every madman or every random act of violence in this country—we cannot—just as we cannot stop every murder from happening, but that does not mean we should not make them less likely or that we can-not take steps to limit their harm, steps that are backed by the over-whelming majority of Americans and that are fully consistent with the Con-stitution. I remember, after the shooting at the Pulse Nightclub, I was supposed to take my daughter to camp that day.

She was going to be away from us for a month. I can remember I did every-thing I could to keep her from hearing the news that day, as the numbers of fatalities increased during the course of the day, because I didn’t want her to leave us—she was about 12 at the time—with a sense of fear, the fear I felt and the country felt. I am so sorry my children and America’s children have to grow up in a country where mass shootings are common, where we are beginning to see them just as part of our lives. I heard somebody the other day on television say that is the price of free-dom. What a shame that somebody would say that in the United States of America. What a surrender that rep-resents to our children and to the vic-tims of these crimes. I didn’t grow up in that America, but conditions have changed. We have let it happen. The re-sult is, we now have an entire genera-tion of Americans—of our countrymen, our sons, and our daughters—who are growing up with a reasonable fear that they could be victims of a mass shoot-ing or that their moms or their dads might not come home one day. I think our kids have enough to worry about. They have every right to see a movie with their parents, to go dancing with their friends, or to see a concert on their one night off without having the fear of being shot down by people who have no business carrying such powerful weapons. They have a right to expect that this Congress will finally do something about gun vio-lence in our country—violence which is far greater than anywhere else in the industrialized world. In the wake of these horrific acts, as always, Americans spring into action. First responders secure the area and care for the wounded. Neighbors hold vigils to honor the victims and support grieving families. Journalists shed light on what happened and why. Citi-zens speak out to demand action from their elected officials. They are doing their jobs, and it is time for Congress to do ours. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. F
ISCHER ). The Senator from West Vir-ginia. 
TAX REFORM  
Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, last week, I rose to talk about the impor-tance of tax reform. I believe this is a policy issue we cannot talk about enough and that we cannot emphasize enough. So, today, I rise to talk about how important the reform is to our small businesses, and in the coming weeks, I will be up here to talk about other important aspects of tax reform. We are all from different States and other parts of the country, but we all know small businesses are a major eco-nomic driver in our country, as 95 per-cent of businesses in the United States are small businesses, and that number is even higher in my State of West Vir-ginia. Small businesses employ more than half of West Virginia’s workforce. Yet our small businesses face a mar-ginal tax rate as high as 39.6 percent. At the same time, their effective tax rate can vary widely. In fact, a CNBC survey showed that 22 percent of small businesses cannot really say what their effective tax rate really is. Think about that. If you are a small business that is a partnership or an LLC, then your prof-its are going to pass through to you and be taxed at the individual rate. There are currently seven individual tax brackets. Then you have credits and deductions. There is also a self-em-ployment tax, and the list goes on. On top of that, small businesses can have Social Security and Medicare taxes, a Federal unemployment tax, and em-ployment taxes. That is not even tak-ing into account taxes like a State- level income tax or property tax and more. That is why businesses and indi-viduals spend billions of dollars a year to comply with the Tax Code. That is more than 18 hours for every man and woman and child in the United States of America. If I could give a visual here, that is basically 3 million people working full time on taxes for small businesses at a cost of $195 billion. The point is, it is complicated. Our Tax Code is too complicated, and that is part of what tax reform is about— simplifying the Tax Code. If Congress can simplify the Tax Code just to cut compliance costs in half, think of how many significant resources that would free up that would be better used to grow the economy, create jobs, raise wages, and expand businesses. The National Federation of Inde-pendent Business, which represents 325,000 small businesses across this country, called this tax reform frame-work a good start, and it has urged us to take swift action. According to a survey by Paychex, 41 percent of small business owners want tax reform to be the very top priority. Whom will these reforms really help? We are going to have a long discussion on this. This is just part of whom they will help. They will help the small businesses that employ so many people in my home State of West Virginia. They will help people like Eric Hott, of EH Chocolates & More, from Hamp-shire County. Eric has a great story. Eric grew up on a farm in Kirby, WV. His mother was from Hornberg, Ger-many. While growing up, his grand-mother was always cooking something. After graduating from high school, Eric moved to Germany to begin a cul-inary apprenticeship. By 2006, he had a chef apprenticeship at a five-star hotel in Germany. He went on to serve at events like the G8 Summit and for guests that included the German Chan-cellor and his First Lady. After run-ning a patisserie in Germany, he moved to Switzerland, where he refined and perfected the art of chocolate-making. That sounds good to me. Then what did he do? He wanted to come home. He re-turned home to West Virginia. He went back to Kirby, WV, and started his own small businesses—first EH Chocolates & More and, later, Farm Fresh Produce. Both are growing and deli-cious businesses. Small businesses employ middle- class Americans who power this and other small businesses across the coun-try. We need more folks like Eric—lots more—who are willing to take the risk, who have a good idea, and who want to stay and work in their own homes in rural America and certainly in our State of West Virginia, which has had a major economic downturn. We need more Eric Hotts. We need to simplify the Tax Code for small businesses and let them focus on what they do best, which is refining their products, pro-viding their services, and providing jobs for people in their various areas. As much as any other policy that Congress can advance, tax reform will promote growth and provide job oppor-tunities across this great country. Across the entire country, only two in five distressed communities have seen any job growth during the past 5 years. Fully 50 percent of U.S. job growth has occurred in just 2 percent of our coun-try’s counties. We need to change that. We need to help small businesses that are major economic drivers in every part of our country. It is no wonder that small businesses have found it difficult to open, let alone succeed in many parts of our country. Because of our out-dated Tax Code, real wages for most workers have barely increased for dec-ades. By modernizing our Tax Code, we can create more opportunity and high-er wages for Americans. We can achieve a simpler system with lower rates that is good for business and workers and, from the description I just put forward, would be a good time saver and resource saver. The best thing about this in terms of small business is that it would lead to more jobs. Let’s create an environment that leads to more investment in our States and continues to grow and build jobs. These are the changes hard-working West Virginians and Ameri-cans are hungering for. In order to make West Virginia the best place to live and work, now is the time for tax reform. I look forward to working with my colleagues to make this a reality. Doing it will benefit so many—every-one in this country. I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

REMEMBERING ELDER ROBERT D . HALES  
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I rise today to honor the life of Elder Robert D. Hales, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Elder Hales passed away peacefully on Sunday, October 1, at the age of 85. He leaves behind his faithful wife Mary and their two sons, Stephen and David. Robert Hales was born and raised in a faithful household in Long Island, NY. He was an all-American boy who played baseball through college at the University of Utah but eventually trad-ed in his baseball uniform for a flight suit, serving in the U.S. Air Force as a jet fighter pilot. Elder Hales’s service as a military aviator would inform the rest of his life and certainly his entire ministry. He took with him the unit motto displayed on the side of his air-craft: ‘‘Return With Honor.’’ After his discharge from the mili-tary, Elder Hales entered the world of international business. In jobs around the world, he established a reputation as an enthusiastic leader who relished a challenge and dealt fairly with oth-ers. Because of these qualities, Elder Hales rose to become president of Paper Mate, a division of Gillette. Later, he assumed senior executive po-sitions at Max Factor Company, the Hughes Television Network, and Chesebrough-Pond’s Manufacturing Company. But Elder Hales never let work dominate his life, as so many ex-ecutives do. Despite the enormous de-mands on his time, he stayed faithful to the more important commitments he made to his family and to his Lord. So it was that Robert Hales, a busi-ness executive of international re-nowned, made an unusual decision in the prime of his life: He left the cor-porate world to give his all to the church. When Jesus said ‘‘Come, follow me,’’ Robert Hales left his nets straightaway and became a fisher of men. Elder Hales was called to become the presiding bishop of the church in 1985, overseeing the church’s vast charitable network. As bishop, he used the skills of a business executive not for profit but to help the least of those among us. In 1994, Elder Hales was sustained to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, a church position he held for 23 years until his passing just days ago. From this position as a watchman on the tower, he boldly proclaimed the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and he also spoke out on such pressing societal issues as reli-gious freedom. He saw that the erosion of religious belief in the United States was quickly devolving into social and political intolerance for religious peo-ple and institutions. But this pre-diction did not lead Elder Hales to de-spair, no; instead, he redoubled his ef-forts to edify the next generation—the young men and women who were in the preparatory period of life, as he termed it. His addresses and sermons were full of moral exhortation and practical ad-vice on living well. Don’t walk, run to holiness, he urged his brothers and sis-ters in faith. Elder Hales knew that ho-liness is an activity, a pursuit to which we must consecrate our whole lives running the race and enduring to the end. Through his example and through his words, Elder Hales taught that virtue is not just a good intention but a good deed reinforced and compounded by past deeds. Elder Hales urged young men and women to embrace the joys of adult-hood through marriage, child-rearing, and responsible citizenship. He knew that the way to true happiness lies in those sacrificial activities, not the self-ish lifestyles that tempt so many today. During one memorable address to the General Conference of the church, Elder Hales recounted the advice he re-ceived as a boy when he had been tempted to make a poor decision: ‘‘Robert,’’ his father had said to him, ‘‘straighten up and fly right!’’ From the testimony of his life, it is clear that Elder Hales honored his father’s advice in the Air Force, in the work-force, in the household, and in the church. Elder Robert D. Hales flew right. Now he has returned with honor to be embraced by his Heavenly Fa-ther. Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor and suggest the ab-sence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
RUSSIA INVESTIGATION  
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, I want to be able to give a quick update to this body on a conversation that started yesterday and has been ongoing for months about Russia and their in-terference in our elections and how they are trying to engage with us in a way that much of Europe has seen for decades but that we just haven’t seen in the United States. Yesterday, Senator B
URR and Sen-ator W
ARNER stood up and gave an up-date of where we are in the status of the investigation of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. They walked through some of the statistics. We have done over 100 interviews. We have 4,000 pages of transcript from those interviews. We have 100,000 docu-ments that we have gone through so far, and there is more to go. We have completed some areas where we have interviewed everyone who we could possibly interview in that area. In other areas, as we do one interview, they quote a couple of other people, and we chase down those individuals, and it continues. So parts of the inves-tigation are not done at this point, but some of it is. Several aspects are clear from the in-vestigation, though, again, it is not complete, and we will have a final doc-ument at the end. Some of the areas that are clear are that Russia was try-ing to use active measures to engage us in our last election. That part is very, very clear. The question comes for many people: Why would they do that? Quite frank-ly, this is the way Russia has worked for a very long time—this asymmetric warfare they do where they try to con-stantly interfere in other people’s thoughts and conflicts. They have done it across Europe for a long time. They are now doing it here. Some of this is a product of Russia’s having a very weak economy and try-ing to find some way to bolster them-selves up. In the last 2 years, the Rus-sian ruble has dropped 40 percent in value. As they struggle with low oil prices and struggle in the way they function with their government with the oligarchs and have a select group of people who can succeed and other folks who continue to struggle around the country and as they struggle under that system where they have fake elec-tions and such, they try to reach out to other countries and try to interfere in our elections to make us look like them. We have a free press that they try to engage in. We have free speech that they don’t have in Russia. We have freedom of religion, which they don’t have in Russia. We have the ability to be able to have disputes on political issues. They clearly don’t have that in Russia. If you disagree with leadership in Russia, you will end up in prison. If you disagree with leadership in the United States, you will end up on TV. It is very different to be in an open so-ciety like ours. But they reach into what we consider a strength and try to make it our weakness. We are going to try to get the facts out on this over the next several months as we work through this proc-ess. We are going to expose what Rus-sia is really trying to do. Do they use some overt propaganda networks like Sputnik Radio and RT? Is their Rus-sian propaganda on multiple cable and satellite channels throughout the United States? Their version of the facts are designed to create discord in our Nation. That is what they do. They also have ways that are not quite as overt. They reach in on social media platforms. They have their trolls in Russia who have thousands of fake accounts on Facebook and Twitter and other social media apps. They use those thousands of apps to search around any news in America and find a place where there is conflict in Amer-ica and then try to amp up the volume. To be clear, the Russians are not cre-ating conflict in America. We have plenty of it. We disagree on issues. Again, it is our free society. When we disagree on something, we disagree on

it publically and sometimes loud. That is who we are as Americans. We try to work things out, sometimes at a high volume. But just like two kids who are fighting on the playground in the fifth grade—remember those two kids that started a fight and their friends were watching them? Then, eventually, someone on the other side of the play-ground started yelling ‘‘fight,’’ and the crowd started forming. The Russians aren’t starting the fight. They aren’t even in the fight. They are the kids on the far side of the playground, trying to get more people to run to the fight. They are not starting the Twitter wars and the battles, but they look at where America is divided, issues like race. Their troll farms will try to find areas where we disagree, such as areas of race, and reach in and try to amplify the volume on that by repeating accu-sations and by trying to be even more hostile online. They are trying to stoke disunity in our Nation. It is important that we know that every time you see something with a high number of hashtag counts that goes up, it is not always Americans who are pushing that up. Occasionally, it is an outside body trying to raise the volume and make a conflict look even bigger than it already is in America be-cause they are into sowing discord. That is what they love to do. That is what the rest of the nations have seen them do. We should be very clear that the Russians are trying to continue to sow chaos into us. They have reached into our election systems. In the previous couple of weeks, the FBI notified 21 different States that during the last election season, the Russians tried to interfere in their election process as a State. Now, that doesn’t mean they did inter-fere. That means they reached in and tested systems. That means they tried to go into voter databases to see if they could access a voter database to see who was registered to vote. They tried to get into a secretary of State’s office in a local State to see if they could figure out how they do their elec-tions. That means they reached into systems in States to see what voting machines they used and if they tried to connect them in. They were trying to find out how they do elections, learn as much as they could about their proc-ess, and see how far they could get. Through all of our work, we have yet to find a single vote that was changed. The Russians didn’t get into voting machines. They didn’t alter the elec-tion in any way, but they were con-stantly probing through multiple States to see what they could get ac-cess to. Now, it is my belief that they are preparing for something else. They are trying to see what they could get ac-cess to in the last election to see if they could get back into it and do even more in the next election. We should be aware of that. We should be aware not only of their propaganda, but we should be aware that they are going after our elections to see if they can find a way, at the end of the election, to make us doubt the outcomes. What can we do about that? I will give you several ideas. One of them, I would say, is that we need to protect the primacy of States running the elec-tions. There is absolutely no need for the Federal Government to go to States and take over their election process. It is a constitutional protec-tion that those States have to be able to run their elections, but every State is also responsible to do it. Of the 21 States that I noted here that the Rus-sians tried to engage in, they couldn’t get to a single voting machine. The States are already doing a good job, but they need help. There is no reason the State of Okla-homa should have to work alone to be able to protect itself from the Russians trying to invade it in the cyber attack. They are going to need some allies to come along with them, but the States should still be able to run the system. There should be more sharing between the State and the Federal Government. There should be an opportunity for the Federal Government to be able to say to a State, earlier than 10 months after the election: Hey, you are being hacked. For the FBI to notify States a couple of weeks ago that they were hacked in the 2016 elections is a little late. When it is occurring, we need to have that engagement between State IT folks and Federal IT folks. We need to be able to have that conversation as it is ongoing so the State can take pro-tective measures as it is occurring. We need to have that cooperation between States and the Federal Government. We need to be able to help States come up with ways they can audit their sys-tem after the election is over. When every election occurs, you should be able to audit it and make sure the machines that were running the election actually were not hacked. You can verify that. In Oklahoma, we have optical scanners. You fill out a paper ballot. You run it through an op-tical scanner at the end of the election time, and they can count everything from the optical scanner. If there is any question, they can go back to the paper and actually do a hand count. We can literally audit our elections and their process. It is a safe system that we have set up in our State. Every State does it differently, but I would encourage every State to set up a sys-tem where they can audit their system. We know this year that the Russians were trying to engage in our election. It could be someone else who could do it. Any number of groups could try to interfere in our process. It is basic common sense to say we should have a system of elections we can actually audit. Perhaps Russia, in the days ahead, hopes that our Nation will be more like theirs. We will not be. We are the longest constitutional Re-public in the world. We still need the world. We still put out our values about free speech, free press, freedom of religion, and opportunities for indi-viduals to actually engage and to have conflict with their own government and to be able to disagree publically on things. We still can disagree with each other. We need to be aware that they want to turn us into them. I would hope for the sake of the Russian peo-ple, in the days ahead, that they could be more like us. Ronald Reagan told a story about a friend of his who had a conversation with a Cuban refugee fleeing from com-munism and oppression in Cuba in 1964. He said that his friend, this Cuban ref-ugee, said: 
If we lose freedom here, there is no place to escape to. This is the last stand on Earth. 
We are still a role model for the rest of the world. As much conflict as we have with each other, we are still a role model. I have no issue disagreeing at times with people on this floor. We can have our disagreements, but I don’t want the Russians to interfere in our disagreements. They can keep their business over there. In the days ahead, we will continue to expose the things they are doing. So they can back off and go bug someone else because we are akin to what they are doing. With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Ohio. 
EQUIFAX BREACH  
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I say to the Presiding Officer—and the Sen-ator who is about to become the Pre-siding Officer—I appreciated the work of you two together, in tandem, today for two nominees in front of the Agri-culture Committee. I thank you. (Mr. SASSE assumed the Chair.) Mr. President, I rise to talk for a mo-ment about a hearing yesterday, which the Presiding Officer sat through, too, with the outgoing CEO of Equifax. We know what happened with Equifax, yet we really don’t know entirely what happened. We know there was a breach of Equifax’s information, and 145 mil-lion Americans—more than half of the adult population in our country—had their data breached. Criminals will now have access to the data of far too many Americans. I am hopeful because I and Senator C
RAPO , the chairman of the committee, and others on the committee were pret-ty unhappy—not to speak for others, certainly, but we were pretty unhappy with Equifax’s performance yesterday because we didn’t get a lot of answers to a number of our questions. When you think about what we do with medical language, with our per-sonal medical information, we have laws to say that our personal medical information belongs to us. We, of

course, can share it with a hospital or a doctor or whomever we want, but our doctor can’t share it with other doctors without our permission. Our hospital can’t share it with other hospitals without our permission. But our per-sonal financial data doesn’t fall into those categories. We know how this happens. Equifax is a company that many have rarely thought about. A lot of people have never thought much about it, and many have never really explored who they are. Equifax is a company in At-lanta. There are three data agencies like this. They get your data without your permission. They get it from a utility company or from a bank or from somebody else. They have two jobs: to collect your data and then to protect your data, your personal finan-cial data. This company—this CEO has been paid $69 million over the last 3 years. The CEO we met with, who has retired, has been compensated very generously. Who knows if he will end up getting bo-nuses and golden parachutes and all? The American public has come to un-fortunately expect that these CEOs will abuse the public trust. Look at what happened at Wells Fargo, creating all kinds of accounts for people who didn’t even want those accounts, who didn’t even know they were having those accounts opened. And look at Equifax. In far too many cases, these compa-nies don’t protect our information the way they have promised they would. It makes all of us, the 145 million, subject to some kind of criminal activity in all kinds of ways—to violate our privacy and to take advantage of us financially and all the identity theft and all the things that come with that. If you were a student at Bowling Green State University who graduated and you miss a student loan payment after you have graduated, you get your credit dinged by Equifax. If you are a homeowner in Mansfield, OH, or in Ra-venna, OH, and you miss a monthly payment or a couple of monthly pay-ments, you get your credit dinged. You are held accountable by Equifax, but Equifax hasn’t really been held ac-countable much by anyone. The cynicism people in this country have toward our financial system, to-ward Wall Street—then we see Wells Fargo do what they have done; then we see Equifax do what they have done. It is time for Congress to push away these special interest groups that have far too much influence in this body. The White House has not been help-ful. The White House looks like a re-treat for Goldman Sachs executives, with all the people around the Presi-dent who do the bidding of Wall Street and protect far too many of these Wall Street firms and Wells Fargo and the Equifaxes of the world. I am hopeful that we will sit down in a bipartisan way and begin to figure out what to do here. Maybe we do con-sider the protections we have for peo-ple’s medical records—we ought to have the same protection for their fi-nancial records. It simply makes sense, and I am hopeful we can come to a so-lution. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PUERTO RICO RECOVERY EFFORT  
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today, as I have on so many occa-sions, to give voice to the 3.5 million Americans who call Puerto Rico home. Their lives have been turned upside down by Hurricane Maria, and now more than ever, they desperately need to be heard. I invite my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in am-plifying the voices of millions of Puer-to Ricans calling out for help and the millions here on the mainland who have yet to hear from their families. Here on the floor with me today are aerial photos of the destruction caused by Hurricane Maria, the astounding damage I saw firsthand when I toured Puerto Rico by helicopter on Friday, pictures largely taken by me. Take this collapsed bridge in the mu-nicipality of Utuado, situated in the central mountains of Puerto Rico. Every day, the 30,000 Americans who live in Utuado depend on these bridges to cross the beautiful rivers that run through it, but today those 30,000 Americans are secluded, waiting in the dark, and wondering when help will ar-rive. Images like these have stayed with me from the moment I left Puerto Rico, and I share them today because the people of Puerto Rico need our col-lective voices and support to stop this humanitarian crisis from devolving into a full-blown American tragedy. This is another example of some of the devastation of a large number of homes in a community. If we hope to overcome the monu-mental challenges before us, we need a full grasp of the reality on the ground. I thought that is why President Trump went to Puerto Rico this week—to get a dose of reality. Instead, the President continued to feed on his own warped version of reality. The President told the people of Puerto Rico that they should be ‘‘very proud’’ that the death count was only ‘‘16 versus literally thousands of people’’ who died in ‘‘a real catastrophe like Katrina’’—a real catastrophe like Katrina. And cer-tainly that was a catastrophe, but this is no less real for the people of Puerto Rico. Yet, moments later, the AP re-ported that fatalities in Puerto Rico have tragically risen to 44. And while I pray it is not the case, I fear that it may be even worse, because we have se-cluded communities that still have not gotten access, so we don’t know what is happening there. In short, the situation is perilous, and we don’t have a moment to waste. Like many, I had hoped that during his visit to Puerto Rico, the President would take the high road and set a new tone after his administration’s woe-fully delayed and inadequate response to Hurricane Maria. Instead, the Presi-dent took victim-blaming to a whole new level. He told emergency respond-ers and local elected officials: ‘‘I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you have thrown our budget a little out of whack.’’ Well, Mr. President, perhaps we have to dial back the budget-bursting, tril-lion-dollar tax cuts you want to give to billionaire families like yours, because it is going to take more than paper towels to help the people of Puerto Rico. In this country, we don’t turn our backs on Americans in need. We don’t complain about how much it costs to restore power to hospitals or rebuild roads in ruin that connect people to their government and essential serv-ices or get clean drinking water and food and medicine to the hungry and the frail. We are the United States of America, and we are there for each other, whether it is Texas after Harvey or Florida after Irma or New Jersey after Sandy or Puerto Rico after Maria. If you heard the President speak ear-lier this week, you would heard that everything is going great and that he in particular is doing the greatest job any President has ever done in the his-tory of the world. The administration will tell us that the majority of hos-pitals are open but leave out the fact that many are running on emergency generators at significantly reduced ca-pacity. They will leave out how the shortages of ambulances and fuel and functional roads have made getting to the hospitals nearly impossible. Even if you do find a way there, the hospitals might not have the medicine, supplies, or doctors you need. The administration will boast that it has set up 11 distribution points for food, water, and other necessities, but what good is a distribution center that takes hours to reach and is out of sup-plies before you get there? They will brag about how half of the people have access to running water but neglect to say that in some rural areas in the north, barely over 13 per-cent of people have access to running water. They will boast about all of the buildings being inspected—something that even the Governor of Puerto Rico questioned—but look at this image I took 5 days before the President land-ed. This is just 25 minutes outside of San Juan. Hurricane Maria destroyed many of the wooden homes that popu-late the island and weakened many of its immense structures, as the picture showed that we had up before. Here is an example of it. So you see that all of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6338 October 5, 2017 
these homes are destroyed. Some of them are not made in the same way. Here is a cement structure that is also totally destroyed. I saw the same sights across Puerto Rico in commu-nities near the capital, in the moun-tains, and along the coast. What does all this tell us? It tells us an unfortunate truth: that the admin-istration’s response to this crisis has been woefully inadequate from the start. For 2 weeks, Puerto Ricans cried out for help—help accessing clean water, help powering hospitals, help feeding families. Yet the President accused them—the victims of this historic nat-ural disaster—of being ingrates clam-oring for handouts. He dismissed the urgency of their situation, and he ef-fectively called the mayor of San Juan another nasty woman who should pipe down. Well, this is the mayor of San Juan, wading hip deep in water. Does this look like a woman who isn’t taking re-sponsibility? No. To me, it looks like a leader doing everything she can to save lives. I knew from the start that we weren’t getting the full picture, and be-cause the administration went out of its way not to provide support for a bi-partisan congressional delegation to visit the island, I decided to go myself. After all, it will be the responsibility of Congress to fund disaster relief and long-term recovery on these islands, and we need the facts in order to produce the right legislation. So last Friday, I boarded an Americans Air-lines flight to Puerto Rico. Now, let me be clear. I have visited the island of Puerto Rico I don’t know how many times over the past 25 years, both in my official capacity as a Mem-ber of Congress and personally to vaca-tion. It is no exaggeration to say that the island I saw on Friday is not the is-land I have known and loved. The lush, green, tropical landscape that comes to mind when we think of Puerto Rico was mostly devoid of life. I met with the Governor of Puerto Rico. I spoke to local law enforcement officials, first responders, and Federal FEMA officials. With the help of the Governor’s office and the Puerto Rico Joint Forces of Rapid Action—or FURA, as they are known on the is-land—I saw the damage by helicopter. I saw debris and mudslides and fallen trees on the inland streets, destroyed homes sprinkled with the occasional yet all-too-familiar blue of FEMA tarps. A dead green hue covered the landscape that was such a foreign sight to me that I caught myself thinking I was somewhere else. This was an all-too-familiar scene— the scene of a strong cement structure of a building, on the surface impervious to the strong winds of a hurricane, yet now on the verge of sinking into the Earth. The hurricane eroded so much land that in some inner parts of the is-land, landslides have become the new norm. The people who live here may never be able to return. Entire genera-tions of close-knit communities may never be the same. Despite these dire conditions, during my visit to Puerto Rico, I felt the spir-it of community and commitments shared by so many Americans across the island. After Hurricane Maria, they woke to devastation, no communica-tion, and the isolating affects of roads being cut off by fallen trees, electrical posts, and debris. As they wait and wonder when their government will come to their aid, they are doing ev-erything they can to survive. They have taken matters into their own hands. They are clearing roads, shel-tering relatives who lost their homes, and working together to care for the most vulnerable. So through it all, I saw the hard-working spirit alive in Puerto Rico that I see whenever I speak with Puerto Rican families there and across New Jersey, where so many of my constituents are mobilizing to send help as they anxiously wait to hear from their families. Like so many Americans, I too wor-ried about my family on the island. My brother faces health challenges, and I worried about his care. Fortunately, we had a brief moment to meet, and I was able to give him some supplies— help one person. But as tough as this situation was, he is one of the lucky ones. He lives in a suburb of San Juan which is relatively better off than the more remote, rural areas. Let’s look at a chart of our recovery status. Fifteen days after the storm ravaged the island, where does it stand? Well, 93 percent of our fellow Americans are still without power. I can tell my colleagues firsthand that the heat and the humidity from all of the water that came from Maria is sti-fling. It is oppressive. It is hard to breathe. Sixty percent of Puerto Rico has no cell phone service, meaning people have no way of connecting to their families on the island and outside of the island or calling for help if they needed it. If they did, we could have pinpoint accuracy of search and rescue missions. Day by day, fewer and fewer Puerto Ricans have access to clean, running water. From October 2 to October 3, the population with running water dropped from 29 percent to 13 percent. The truth is, this situation would be unacceptable in any major city on the U.S. mainland, but, as the people of Puerto Rico know all too well, they don’t get the same treatment as their fellow citizens on the mainland. The ugly truth is that for generations, Con-gress has treated the people of Puerto Rico not as our fellow Americans, not as people who have fought and bled for their country, like the famous Borinqueneers, an all-Puerto Rican in-fantry division, who received, recently, the highest decoration Congress gives collectively—the Congressional Gold Medal. They haven’t treated them as first-class citizens but as second-class citizens. Hurricane Maria didn’t create this disparity, but it exposed the long-standing inequities that have hindered the island’s success for generations. The people of Puerto Rico don’t receive equal Medicaid funding, Medicare cov-erage, or access to tax credits. They aren’t just numbers on a ledger; they are long-term care for a grandparent, treatment for a critically ill child, and a fair shot to make a living wage and raise a family. This didn’t happen overnight. These wrongs add up over time. As Governor Rossello said so eloquently: 
I invite you to reflect on why Puerto Rico is in the current state of disadvantage and inequality. It’s not something that happened just a few months or few weeks before this storm. It is a condition that has happened for more than a century in Puerto Rico. 
I invite you to reflect on the reality that even after the storm hit Puerto Rico, even when it was evident it was a disaster in the United States, only half of our U.S. citizens knew Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens. So when Hur-ricanes Irma and Maria slammed into Puerto Rico, these disparities, these in-equalities, were laid bare. None of this should have taken the Trump administration by surprise. We knew the storm was coming. We knew for days that a category 5 hurricane was on a collision course with Puerto Rico, just as communities across the island were picking up the pieces after Irma. We have known for years about the island’s aging infrastructure, like the downed power line pictured here. In short, all of us knew Hurricane Maria was a recipe for disaster that would leave 3.5 million Americans im-periled, disconnected, and in the dark. It should not have taken the adminis-tration 12 days to issue a disaster dec-laration—something I called for—for 100 percent of the island because, as I saw on Friday, there is no community in Puerto Rico untouched by this trag-edy. Focused leadership would have had a three-star general on the ground the moment the clouds parted, not 8 days after the storms struck. We needed medical evacuation vehi-cles and vessels, aid and relief delivery systems on standby, the USNS Comfort ready for immediate deployment— something I called for. Instead, the ad-ministration told us helping Puerto Rico is hard because it is an island in a big ocean—but it happens to be an is-land of 3.5 million U.S. citizens. We have no more time to waste. That is why it is so urgent that we take ac-tion now. If we could send 20,000 troops to Haiti, surely, we can get more boots on the ground saving American lives in Puerto Rico. We need more helicopters airdropping food and water to secluded communities. We need generators de-livered and the repair of communica-tion towers expedited. It is up to the President to mobilize every resource possible—to save lives, to get the lights turned on, to rebuild bridges, to reach secluded commu-nities, to reconnect families. We can’t

afford to waste any more time, not when lives are on the line, not when el-derly residents in nursing homes grow frailer by the moment, not when hun-gry American children have nothing to eat, not when communities are without clean drinking water for days on end. We need to keep the pressure on the ad-ministration. That is why I wrote the President, urging that he activate the Defense Production Act of 1950 so the military could more quickly deliver vast private sector resources to those in need. That is why my colleagues and I wrote to the White House and urged FEMA to waive disaster relief cost sharing be-cause, as the Governor told me: I have no revenue coming in. I have no rev-enue coming in, and the likelihood of revenue coming in, certainly in the short term, is not there. How do you acquire the 70 or 75 percent Federal as-sistance if you don’t have the 25 per-cent to put up? That is why we have written the USDA asking that they use all available resources to get food to the people of Puerto Rico. This is an all-hands-on-deck situa-tion for the Federal Government, but Congress also has a responsibility to act. That is why I sent a letter to Lead-er M
CCONNELL and Speaker R YAN urg-ing that they bring forward an emer-gency supplemental aid package and fund community development block grants for disaster recovery. It is up to us in Congress to immediately author-ize, not just the emergency funding needed to save lives in Puerto Rico but also the assistance needed for a full- powered recovery. We must give Puerto Ricans the tools to rebuild. That means making sure Puerto Rico’s financial control board gives the Governor the flexibility to spearhead this recovery. Board mem-bers of that control board should be on the island, assessing the damage, speaking to the survivors, allowing Governor Rossello to create a new budget that reflects Puerto Rico’s post- Maria reality. The damage, by some es-timates, could be as high as $90 billion, so adjusting expectations and enabling flexibility is absolutely critical going forward. I have said it before and I will say it again. The people of Puerto Rico must come before Wall Street creditors. As it turns out, this is one area where the President and I can find common ground. Just last night, he called for Puerto Rico’s debt to be wiped out. I hope all of us—the administration, my colleagues in Congress, and the fiscal control board—can work together to jump-start Puerto Rico’s recovery. That must include enabling flexibility, addressing the island’s crippling debt, and ensuring that pensions are pro-tected and paid. Imagine not getting your pension—no longer working, hav-ing no income, and then your pension is not protected. How do you make it? All of us in the Senate have a responsi-bility to stand with Puerto Rico. How we respond to this crisis will have pro-found consequences, not just for the Americans who live in Puerto Rico today but for generations to come. We need to pass a disaster package that matches the astounding damage suffered by the island. The photos I have brought to the floor today give a glimpse—not anywhere near the whole picture—of the devastation on the ground. It is not enough to reconnect a faulty, ailing power grid. It is time to be proactive and rebuild Puerto Rico so it is prepared for the next storm and for the 21st century. It is time to fix the underlying disparities which have hindered Puerto Rico’s success. Other-wise, we will simply be rebuilding a broken foundation. Let me close by saying, I remind my colleagues that Puerto Ricans are not just citizens of the United States— which, in and of itself, should speak to the compelling arguments we should be engaged in helping Puerto Rico as our fellow Americans. They have fought to defend our Nation from World War I to the War on Terror. Take a walk down to the Vietnam Memorial, and you will see Puerto Rican names engraved in that stone far in excess of the number of people proportionately to the Amer-ican population. Throughout our his-tory, Puerto Ricans have given their lives so they may remain part of the ‘‘land of the free.’’ To this day, more than 10,000 Puerto Ricans serve in every branch of the U.S. Armed Forces. Let’s also remember that beyond the 3.5 million citizens living on the island, there are 5 million Puerto Ricans liv-ing in our States, in our congressional districts, and in our communities. In the aftermath of this unprecedented disaster, these Americans deserve the same rights, the same respect, and the same response from their Federal Gov-ernment. That is what I told leaders from New Jersey’s Puerto Rican com-munity earlier this week—assembly-men and women, mayors, community leaders, and concerned citizens. We all remember how hard it was to secure the funding we needed to rebuild New Jersey in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy. We had to fight tooth and nail every step of the way, and, guess what, we had two U.S. Sen-ators from New Jersey and 13 Members of Congress, joined by our colleagues from New York—two U.S. Senators from New York and a whole host of congressional Members as well as from Connecticut, which was also affected. It was an incredible time here to try to get relief. Americans in Puerto Rico have no vote in the Senate, they have no votes in Congress, and the fight to rebuild Puerto Rico will be that much harder, but, as I have in the past, I intend to be their voice and their vote in the U.S. Senate. Now is not the time to pretend like recovery will be a piece of cake. No one—not the Governor, not the Presi-dent, not any one of us—should sugar-coat the human catastrophe playing out in Puerto Rico. It is time for hon-esty about the conditions on the ground, the challenges we face, and the actions we must take. Yes, Puerto Rico is an island in the middle of a very big ocean, but we are the most powerful nation on the face of the Earth. We have the most advanced military capabilities ever known and the most skilled Armed Forces in the world. We have to be there for 3.5 mil-lion Americans who are in need. We are the United States of America. We do the impossible. Give our men and women in uniform any mission, and they rise to the occasion. If we conducted the Berlin Airlift, set up tactical operations in the moun-tains of Afghanistan, built green zones in Baghdad in the height of the Iraq war, then surely we can save the lives of Americans in danger, and surely we can save those lives and help rebuild Puerto Rico. We must not rest until every American is safe and the work of rebuilding is done. I yield the floor. (At the request of Mr. SCHUMER , the following statement was ordered to be printed in the R

TAX REFORM  
Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I rise today to talk about what is really a ‘‘once in a generation’’ opportunity, and that is the opportunity we have right now to reform our outmoded and complex Tax Code and also, most im-portantly, to provide tax relief for our Nation’s families, farmers, and small businesses. Our Tax Code has not been updated since 1986. When you think about all that has changed over the last 30 years, you know that modern advances in technology have drastically revolu-tionized the way business is conducted. Today, the creation of the internet, substantially increased automation, and instant communications have cre-ated dramatic changes and in many ways have brought us closer in terms of communication and have inter-connected our global economy in ways we never could have foreseen back in the 1980s, when we last reformed our Tax Code. So it is past time—not time but past time—to modernize our outdated Tax Code to the 21st century. We must do so in order to ensure that American businesses can compete on the global stage, while providing tax relief to hard-working middle-class families who have been struggling to get and stay ahead over the last decade. The recently released tax blueprint proposes sweeping tax reforms that will benefit working families and small businesses throughout the country while promoting job creation, eco-nomic growth, and global competitive-ness. This country was built on hard work by individuals and families who strive each and every day to make ends meet to provide for their loved ones and to plan for retirement. The current Tax Code is complex and has many loopholes that do nothing to help our hard-working families keep more of their own hard-earned money. Our tax framework will help individuals and families in my home State and across this country to get ahead by gener-ating new jobs through sustained eco-nomic growth while lowering the over-all tax burden and putting more money back in the taxpayers’ pockets. We do this in a number of ways: by doubling the standard deduction, by eliminating taxes on the first $12,000 earned by an individual and $24,000 earned by a married couple, effectively establishing a zero-percent tax rate as the bottom bracket—the bottom tax rate. That means that nearly 81 per-cent of North Dakotans who claim the standard deduction could see a signifi-cant increase in their take-home pay. That is true of other States across the country as well. Further, we are con-solidating and lowering the tax rates across the board while simplifying the Tax Code to make it fairer for every-body. At nearly 70,000 pages long, it is no wonder that Americans currently spend 6 billion hours a year complying with the Tax Code. In fact, 94 percent of taxpayers choose either to pay some-one else or to use software to prepare their taxes because of the complexity of our Tax Code. Our goal for tax re-form is to allow the vast majority of Americans to file their tax returns on a single page—a simple calculation, something they can do themselves. We want to reduce the cost and stress that many Americans feel during tax sea-son. Further, our tax framework aims to create greater opportunities for small business owners, farmers, and others to help grow our economy and be more competitive than ever before. While we focus on a business friendly State in North Dakota—we have a very business friendly climate—the Federal tax con-tinues to place an undue burden on the nearly 71,000 small businesses that op-erate in our State, which is more than 95 percent of all of the employers in the State. Again, this is something that applies across the Nation. The driver of our economy, the backbone of our economy is small business. They are the job generators. They are the job creators. We have to do more to help them do what they do, which is to cre-ate jobs and to grow our economy. The same applies to our family farm-ers. My State alone has more than 30,000 family farms and ranches. Their marginal tax rate can reach as high as almost 45 percent, nearly twice the av-erage rate of the rest of the industri-alized world. That creates real chal-lenges. This tax framework follows the example we have set in our State by re-storing economic opportunity, by low-ering the tax burden, and by enacting a pro-growth tax code. Economists in general agree that high corporate taxes reduce wages to workers, raise costs to consumers, and reduce returns on retirement savings. That affects all of us. Maintaining high tax rates does nothing to improve the fairness of our system. It only punishes everyday citizens and reduces eco-nomic opportunities for all Americans. For far too long, our Tax Code has incentivized American companies to send jobs and investment overseas, in-stead of keeping them here at home— keeping that investment, keeping those jobs here at home. Consequently, large multinational corporations now hold approximately $2.6 trillion over-seas. That is money that could be repa-triated back to the United States for investment in American jobs here at home. Our framework would end the loopholes and the incentives that keep foreign profits offshore by moving to a territorial tax system and encouraging repatriation of these offshore funds, bringing that investment back to America. This is about getting the American economy going again and creating jobs and opportunity here at home rather than overseas. It is vital that we advance a com-prehensive tax reform that simplifies the IRS code and simplifies rates. Put-ting more money in the pockets of working individuals and families and empowering private investment will drive domestic job creation and in-crease wages through higher demand for labor and lower business costs. All the while we can ensure stable govern-ment revenues through a broader tax

base, a growing economy, and a more efficient tax system. That means that we will continue to be able to fund our priorities as we work to get our debt and deficit under control. Ensuring U.S. competitiveness in the global marketplace and providing tax relief to middle-class families will ben-efit both current and future genera-tions. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work together to get tax reform done for the people of my State of North Dakota, for their re-spective States, and for Americans across this entire country. With that, Madam President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Michigan. 
HEALTHCARE  
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, in many ways, the Children’s Health In-surance Program has been an out-standing example of what a bipartisan, democratic process can accomplish. Twenty years ago, President Bill Clin-ton worked with a Republican majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives to successfully pass the Children’s Health Insurance Pro-gram into law. That legislation passed with 85 votes in the Senate—an over-whelmingly bipartisan vote—to recog-nize the simple fact that all children born in this great country of ours should have healthcare coverage. The Children’s Health Insurance Pro-gram, along with our Nation’s commu-nity health centers, has more often than not seen great bipartisan support. As Members of Congress, we have al-ways come together and understood the importance of these programs, and we have done everything we can to en-sure that quality, cost-effective care is available to millions of Americans. Un-fortunately, as I stand here today, funding for both the Children’s Health Insurance Program and community health centers has expired. The Children’s Health Insurance Pro-gram, or CHIP, provides healthcare coverage to over 100,000 children in my home State of Michigan and more than 9 million children nationally. In addi-tion, community health centers serve as the primary medical home to over 600,000 Michiganders and more than 20 million individuals across our country. For people living in rural and under-served areas, their community health center is their doctor’s office and often their only choice when it comes to care close to home. We have already passed the deadline to extend the Children’s Health Insur-ance Program and the Community Health Center Fund. We have passed the time to act. We should not wait any longer to provide certainty to the millions of children and their families who depend on CHIP and to the Ameri-cans who will lose access to care if their community health center is closed. We are already seeing the impact of our inaction in the CHIP program. Sev-eral States have begun to warn that they may be forced to end enrollment of new children, cut back services, or end their programs altogether if we do not act soon. Independent experts esti-mate that at least 10 States could com-pletely run out of funding for their Children’s Health Insurance Program before the end of the year, while fund-ing for the remaining States’ programs would not be very far behind. This is not a responsible way to gov-ern. I have heard from physicians in my State, especially in rural commu-nities, who fear that this lack of action will mean great harm to the patients they serve. I have heard from pediatri-cians who know firsthand what the end of CHIP would mean for Michigan’s children. As our country grapples with what we can do to expand mental health treatment and address the ex-panding opioid epidemic, letting these programs lapse would be a huge step in the wrong direction. This unnecessary uncertainty has already forced some community health centers to con-template staff hiring freezes and lay-offs. It is certainly harming their day- to-day operations. It has made it dif-ficult for them to recruit new doctors, and it has made it harder for their of-fices to obtain loans to grow their practices and to serve more patients. Luckily, this is a problem we know how to solve. I am proud to have co-sponsored bipartisan legislation with Senators H
ATCH and W YDEN that would ensure funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program. I also sup-port similarly bipartisan legislation by Senators B
LUNT and S TABENOW to ex-tend funding for our Nation’s commu-nity health centers. I welcome the fact that the Senate Finance Committee held a markup yes-terday and was able to advance the bi-partisan bill to fund the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Now the rest of us in Congress need to do our job. Let’s bring both of these bills up for a vote because, quite frankly, we cannot afford to wait any longer. Our Nation’s children and millions of Americans who use community health centers as their primary medical home cannot afford to wait any longer. His-torically, these programs have not been controversial to reauthorize, and they should not be now. I am urging my colleagues to prioritize the children of our rural and underserved communities who will be hurt if we do not act soon. Let’s do what is right for our country’s children and families and pass this vital legisla-tion as soon as possible. Madam President, I suggest the ab-sence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.

TRIBUTE TO REVEREND DR . ALONZO B . 
PATTERSON , JR., AND MRS . SHIRLEY PATTERSON  
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wish to recognize an extraordinary in-dividual in my State, along with his wife. I would like to take a few min-utes today to recognize Reverend Dr. Alonzo B. Patterson, Jr., and Mrs. Shirley Patterson. During the first week of November, Anchorage is going to host 4 days of events to commemorate the service of two of our most beloved community leaders, the Reverend Dr. Alonzo B. Patterson and his wife, Shirley Patter-son. Next month, Reverend Patterson leaves the pulpit of Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church. This is a pulpit he has held for some 47 years. Mrs. Patterson, his wife of six decades, is to be recog-nized for her service as well. Anchorage is one of America’s great communities, and it is not uncommon to celebrate the retirement of a figure of Patterson’s stature, but 4 separate days of events—that is huge, and it is a testament to the respect our commu-nity has for the Patterson family. Think about this: Alaska has been a State for just 58 years. Reverend Pat-terson has had his pulpit for 47 years. And Shiloh is not Reverend Patterson’s first pulpit in Alaska; it is his second. He came to Anchorage after founding the Corinthian Baptist Church in Fair-banks. Reverend Patterson grew up with Alaska, and Alaska grew up with Reverend Patterson. Corinthian and Shiloh could appro-priately be characterized as African- American churches. But for the Afri-can-American community in Alaska, they are far more than churches; they are centers of Black history in Alaska. Zakiya McCummings interviewed Reverend Patterson earlier this year for an article published in the Anchor-age Press, and in that interview, Rev-erend Patterson explained: 
The church was, and always has been, the sanctuary in the Black community. It is the meeting place, the community center, the focus for support and help, the place you come to be important, the psychologist for your particular problem, the time to shout out your frustrations and the only place to be significant. You could be a Deacon or something in the church where in the rest of the community, you were just another Black person. The church was for us a panacea for many of the social ills that existed then and still have relevance. 
Given the central role Reverend Pat-terson has played in Alaska’s African- American community for most of our State’s existence, it is no surprise that he is regarded as a historian of Black culture in Alaska. Ms. McCummings observed that it is a responsibility that he doesn’t take lightly. Reverend Pat-terson told her: 
I feel like I have to be the keeper of our historical plight and to speak to each gen-eration in my time. It is a powerful responsi-bility because if I go to sleep on my watch,

then the next watch will have nothing to build on. . . . We’re responsible that the gate remains open for the next generation. 
Under Reverend Patterson’s watch, there was much progress. In the 1960s and 1970s, Reverend Patterson recalled, ‘‘much of Alaska was small family businesses, including the banks. If you were not part of that family or their friends, you had a hard time getting a job. Many of the jobs for African Ameri-cans were either construction or gov-ernment jobs.’’ Reverend Patterson proudly recalls the first Black principal of a State ele-mentary school, an African-American banker who was elected to the school board and subsequently to the Alaska Legislature, an African-American ac-tivist in the Fairview section of An-chorage who is regarded as the grand-father of the city’s public transpor-tation system. Today’s African-Amer-ican community is built on the founda-tion of these pioneers who endured. Make no mistake about this, Alonzo Patterson was no mere spectator to all of this progress. He was an agent of change, rooted in his observation, and he stated: ‘‘In ministry there are no limits except the ones we set for our-selves.’’ Under his leadership, Shiloh grew spiritually, physically, and fis-cally, and would include a church school, a television ministry, and a jail outreach ministry. On Shiloh’s 29th anniversary, the mortgage note for the original struc-ture was burned under the theme, ‘‘Burning to Build,’’ and groundbreaking for a new educational wing commenced. There was more building to come. The Martin Luther King Jr. Family Life Center was dedi-cated on May 23, 1993. In 2001, Reverend Patterson spun off a new nonprofit or-ganization, Shiloh Community Devel-opment, Inc., to serve youth, minori-ties, and the disadvantaged. Today Shi-loh Community Development is well known for its youth mentoring pro-gram called Young Lions of Alaska. He is a founder of Bridge Builders of Alaska, which celebrates the diversity of our communities and a powerful voice in Alaska’s annual celebration of Dr. Martin Luther King Day. In 2015, Reverend Patterson was the keynote speaker at the King Day ceremonies on JBER. At that ceremony, he warned his audience that Dr. King’s dream is at risk of dying. He said: 
This dream is at risk if nothing is done, and nothing is holding us back but ourselves. Stop waiting for miracles; believe in yourself to make society better. Each of us can do our part, by loving and respecting others. 
This is just one example of his power-ful voice. Reverend Patterson’s ser-mons were always inspiring, many leg-endary, and it explains why he is re-garded as a pastor’s pastor, growing not only his congregants but the gen-erations of ministers who will follow in his footsteps. As one who has joined in the congregation there at Shiloh on numerous occasions, I can attest that there was never a Sunday that I did not leave feeling inspired by the words of Dr. Patterson. They aren’t calling the appreciation festivities for Reverend Patterson a re-tirement ceremony. They are calling it a transition, probably because nobody believes Rev. Alonzo Patterson has any intentions of pursuing a future of lei-sure. Leadership and inspiration runs in Alonzo Patterson’s DNA. We wish him and Shirley well in their next calling, and we take comfort in the fact that their contributions to our community are far from over. No-vember marks a transition, not a re-tirement—and certainly not a eulogy— for this extraordinary Alaska family. On behalf of my Senate colleagues, I thank Dr. Patterson and his lovely wife Shirley for their good works, and thank them in advance for their con-tinued leadership. ALASKA AIRLINES ‘‘COMBI ’’ PLANES  
Mr. President, I know I have occu-pied a little bit of time on the floor this afternoon with a wide range of topics—from the tragedies that face many of our indigenous women to rec-ognizing a prominent leader of the Alaska community. Now I wish to share a little bit of Alaska’s history as we see a transition in aviation and transportation. It is really the end of an era in my home State. On October 18, just a few days from now, Alaska Airlines will fly the final run of the uniquely Alaskan combi plane before retiring them and updating the fleet. OK. She is going to make a floor speech about an airplane. Yes, I am going to make a floor speech about an airplane because this combi plane is a special Boeing 737–400, designed to carry up to 14,000 pounds of cargo and 72 passengers. It is called a combi be-cause it is a dual-use plane, a combina-tion of passengers and cargo. Alaska Airlines is the only major airline in the country to have these combi planes, and they were specifically designed for the special challenges of a very large State. Over their lifespan, they have delivered every imaginable thing via airplane in Alaska. You have all heard me talk about the size of our State. The sheer size of this State presents logistical hurdles unlike anyplace else. I keep saying we are one-fifth the size of the country, and 80 percent of our communities are not connected by road. When we think about how we move around in our State, a postage stamp placed in the middle of an average sheet of paper represents the area a person can reach in Alaska by coastline, river, road, or railroad. The rest is only reachable by plane. You just have to fly everywhere. This being the case, it only makes sense to try to efficiently deliver peo-ple and goods to hub communities in Alaska. Alaska Airlines is looking to serve. This is not a promotion for them; it is a recognition that they needed to figure out how to move peo-ple and freight, and they reconfigured the aircraft to do this. What makes these planes so special is, they can carry up to four large cargo containers. We call them igloos. These igloos load into the front portion of the aircraft, right behind the pilots. There is a simple divider between the cargo and the passengers. So they load the cargo up front, and the passengers come up the back on a set of steps, just like we used to do in the prejetway times. You load from the back, but your first 17 rows of a traditional air-craft would be occupied by cargo. If you have more cargo—if you are flying fish out from Cordova south or if you are flying your Iditarod dogs that have been dropped in Nome and need to get back to Anchorage and you need a lot of space for the animals, you have flexibility to move back and forth. These have flown all over the State, up to Nome, on the Bering Sea coast, along the Arctic Ocean, to the oilfields in Prudhoe, and, most famously, in the ‘‘milk run’’ area. The milk run got its name because Alaska Airlines literally delivered the milk to the communities along the way, as well as other food stuff—all manner of goods and pas-senger. It is something that if you are from the southeast, we all know about the milk run. We all complain about the fact that it takes about 5 hours to get from Anchorage down to Juneau, if you have to go through Yakutat and Cordova and stop at each one. That is just the way it is. You bounce down from Cordova, Yakutat, Juneau, Ketch-ikan. Finally, you hit Seattle. You run into your sports teams, families are coming and going. These are the work-horses that are not only moving the passengers, they are moving the gro-ceries, they are moving the mail, they are moving the medicine. They are moving it all. When I say it moves everything, we have built up a little bit of history about how things move around. We have moved cows. We have moved cars. The picture I like best is moving the herd of Santa’s reindeer. I think Santa was actually posed in this, but the reindeer were not. They needed to be able to move the reindeer so they hauled them in the front, situated them, and closed it off, and you have the passengers in the back. Whether you are moving reindeer, whether you are transporting an injured eagle to the Raptor Center in Sitka or letting the sled dogs hitch a ride back to An-chorage after they have made the thou-sand-mile trip to Nome, this is what we do. The invention of the combi plane really highlights the unique needs and the parameters of daily life in the State. We are a long way from the lower 48. You can barely drive to any of the communities. If you are going to move goods, if you are going to move passengers, you are on an airplane. Whether it is Essential Air Services, bypass mail, air freight, these are the backbones of commerce in Alaska. This is our interstate. It is the interstate in the air.

Thanks to the combi, we have been able to do this with regular, reliable scheduled service in areas where the weather would usu-ally chase off more. These are smaller aircraft. They can handle it all. The size of the combi allows them to land and take off in much more turbulent conditions than smaller propeller planes. So it is a kind of bittersweet time for some of us who have grown up around these aircraft. As we think about the ‘‘only in Alaska’’ type of things, it is encouraging to know that this develop-ment of retiring the combi planes—the proposal is to replace them with sepa-rate, full-sized passenger and cargo planes. As a result of the increased de-mand for goods and passengers, we need more space on planes to deliver both. If updating the fleet means that we need and get more business in Alas-ka, I suppose that is a good thing for all. There are many of us who are going to be bidding a fond farewell come Oc-tober 18, which is the last scheduled flight for the combi. It is also Alaska Day in our State. I thank Alaska Air-lines and those who fly these great planes and do so safely. They provide a level of service and have for so long. I thank them for what they have done over the course of so many years. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.

TAX REFORM  
Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, here is what is happening with so-called ‘‘tax reform.’’ Tonight, the Budget Com-mittee is voting on a budget resolution that does two things. First, it sets the spending limits for everything in the government—envi-ronment, energy, defense, healthcare, education, transportation, and so on. Second, it includes something called reconciliation instructions that basi-cally direct all of the committees to report back with legislation that either increases or decreases the Federal def-icit by a certain amount. This time around, here is what they are doing— asking the Senate Finance Committee to draft legislation to increase the def-icit by $1.5 trillion. Again, this is going to pass on a party-line vote, with Re-publicans prevailing, to increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion. This is what will start the tax reform process. That is not all. Republicans still haven’t given up on decimating our healthcare system. They are still try-ing to cut Medicaid and, this time, Medicare, and they are going to use this tax bill. They are going to cut $473 billion from Medicare at a time when our population is getting older and many seniors are already struggling. They are also going to cut $1 trillion from Medicaid. This is the program that pays for one out of every two births in this country. It helps millions of families who have loved ones in nursing home care. Last week, they tried to pass a healthcare bill that cut taxes. Now they are trying to pass a tax bill that will cut healthcare. Their proposal will, actually, increase the deficit by $4 trillion. That is 12 zeros. Here is what we could do with $4 tril-lion. We could completely rebuild half of the airports in the United States. We could put 20 million people through 4 years of college. We could pay off the debt for every student loan. Instead, the United States is going to be in the red by $4 trillion, but after they cut $1 trillion from Medicaid and one-half trillion dollars from Medicare, the party that has railed against the Federal debt and deficit will still add $2.5 trillion to the deficit. This is all so that they can give tax cuts to the richest people in the United States. I promise you, I understand that both parties are sometimes guilty of exaggerating and that sometimes both parties are guilty of relying on talking points and relying on carica-tures of the other side, but you couldn’t caricature this bill if you tried. This bill is already a caricature of what people say Republicans are all about, which is to shred the social safe-ty net and provide tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans. They are going to cut the corporate tax rate from 35 to 20 percent, and they are going to cut tax rates across the board, but the people who will actually benefit will be the people at the top. The Tax Policy Center, which is a non-partisan, highly respected group, has crunched the numbers, and they found that within 10 years, 80 percent of the benefits of this $4 trillion tax bill will go to 1 percent of Americans. Remember what is happening. We are borrowing a huge chunk of this, and whatever is not borrowed comes out of Medicare and Medicaid. So the pro-grams that pay for women to give birth in a hospital or for elderly people to get healthcare will be decimated, and the wealthiest Americans will pay less in taxes. This is bad policy, not just for the people who work hard but for the whole economy. I want to give you a specific example. Again, both parties rely on talking points, and both parties accuse each other of having the wrong set of ideas, but we have an example of what hap-pens when you do this. This bill is ac-tually modeled after what they did in the State of Kansas. The State govern-ment eliminated one of its business taxes, telling people that it would help the State’s economy. Instead, the econ-omy slowed down, which left them with even lower tax revenues. They had to cut government programs, like edu-cation, and now people do not want to send their kids to Kansas public schools anymore because they do not have the resources to educate their children. This is not a path that America should follow. Everyone needs to pay their fair share, and that includes big corporations and the people who are benefiting from the system and making millions of dollars every year, but in this proposal, they are the ones getting all of the tax breaks. Companies already have huge tax breaks. Some corporations end up pay-ing zero in Federal income tax every April 15 even though they are making healthy profits. They have teams of lawyers and accountants who help them dodge paying even a penny to the Federal Government. That is why cor-porate income taxes make up less than 10 percent of all of the revenue to the Federal Treasury. Meanwhile, at least 30 percent of the middle class will actu-ally pay more if the Republicans suc-ceed with their tax reform package. Think about this. Thirty percent of the middle class is going to see tax increases in their tax bills. Why? It is because they have to find some money to subsidize the tax cuts for the richest people. Some of the money will be found by borrowing; some of the money will be found by making cuts to Medicare and Medicaid; and some of the money will be found by increasing taxes on the middle class. One out of every two households with children will see its taxes go up under this plan. Increasing taxes for these people while decreasing them for big corporations is not a plan for economic growth. We have heard over and over that Republicans do not want to add to the deficit—I don’t either—but this is, literally, what they are voting to do tonight. Again, this is not a talking point. This is not a sort of rhetorical flourish. The bill, itself, provides for $1.5 trillion worth of deficit spending. Yet it is not deficit spending on the military; it is not deficit spending on disaster re-sponse; and it is not deficit spending on Medicare or Medicaid or Social Secu-rity or any of the social safety net pro-grams that they claim is the problem with the Federal budget. It is deficit spending for the purpose of a tax cut, 80 percent of which is going to 1 per-cent of the country. This is not con-servative—certainly not fiscally con-servative—and it will not help us to grow the economy. It is no surprise that this policy is bad, because, again, the process has been so bad. With healthcare, they ig-nored regular order. They obliterated the committee process. They ignored Democrats. They ignored the way the U.S. Senate is supposed to work, and they failed. One Republican Senator says that he will not vote for anything that adds one penny to the deficit. An-other Republican Senator said that he

will not do anything that does not cut taxes for everybody. It already does not meet that test. Members of Con-gress on both sides of the aisle—Repub-licans too—have promised not to cut Medicaid or Medicare. It violates all of those promises. If you did not like the ACA repeal be-cause it cut Medicaid, guess what. This cuts Medicaid more. If you made a promise to your voters not to cut Medi-care, you should be aware that this bill provides for one-half trillion dollars in cuts to Medicare. If you are railing against debt and deficits, this is the biggest budget buster that I have ever seen in my short, 5-year career in the U.S. Senate. During the campaign, the President of the United States promised not to cut Medicare, and the senior Senator from Arizona has called for regular order. This violates every procedural and policy principle that has been ar-ticulated on this Senate floor since I have been here. I do not see a way for-ward on this legislation when it has been conceived in a purely partisan way. It will only take us deeper into dysfunction. For the sake of the Sen-ate, let’s stop going down this path. Let’s restore regular order and work together on a bipartisan tax reform process. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

TRIBUTE TO PASTOR ALONZO PATTERSON  
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, near-ly every week I have been coming down to the Senate floor to recognize some-one in my State who has made a dif-ference for Alaska and really has made a difference for all Americans. It is my favorite part of the week to actually come down and talk about Alaska to my colleagues in the Senate, to the folks in the Gallery, to the press, and to the American people watching. It is what I refer to as our time to talk about the Alaskan of the Week. Many watching and on the floor and those who have visited our great State know that Alaskans think it is the most beautiful place in the world. There are natural wonders everywhere. We had a beautiful summer. We have resilient, warm-hearted, fiercely inde-pendent but accepting people. We have challenges in Alaska just like the rest of the country, but at the heart of our State are kind, generous people full of different cultures and backgrounds that we celebrate. Most people don’t know this about Anchorage, AK: My hometown is prob-ably the most culturally and ethnically diverse city in the country. We have places of worship all over the city and the State that reflect that great diver-sity of Alaska and America. One of the stalwarts of our faith com-munity for the past 47 years has been Pastor Alonzo Patterson of the Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church, and he is our Alaskan of the week. Every Sunday he fills his church with spirit, joy, and gospel music punctuated by ‘‘amens’’ that float through the church, down the street, and work their way into our community and into our hearts. That is what he has been doing for 47 years. For decades, those sermons have in-spired countless Alaskans to help feed the hungry, provide homes for those without, and strive to create a more just country, State, and society, and a more just community. Let me tell you a little bit about Pastor Patterson. He was born in Wil-son, LA, and raised in New Orleans. Like a lot of Alaskans, thousands of Alaskans, he joined the military and made his way up to Fairbanks, AK, in the 1960s, where he founded the Corin-thian Baptist Church, and he min-istered to the congregation there. Then, in 1970, he was called to Shiloh, one of the few African-American churches in Anchorage. He designed and rebuilt Shiloh at its current loca-tion, and under his leadership, Shiloh’s membership, its facilities, and its en-ergy took off. He has conducted thousands of mar-riages and baptisms. He has given thousands of eulogies, celebrated grad-uations and anniversaries, counseled countless couples, people who are grieving, people who are rejoicing, peo-ple who are suffering, and he has helped turn that into action—not just for the African-American community but for all people and all races in our community and in our State. Pastor Patterson told a reporter: The church was and always has been a sanctuary in the Black community. It is the meeting place, the community center, the focus for support and help, the place you come to be important, the psychologist for your particular problem, the time to shout out your frustrations and the only place to be significant. 
He continued: 
You could be a Deacon or something in the church where in the rest of the community you were just another Black person. The church was for us a panacea for many of the social ills that existed then and still have relevance. 
That is what he talked about. That is his heart and soul, how he saw his church and congregation. Thanks to Pastor Patterson and Shiloh, the city is a more inclusive place for all. He has helped heal those social ills for thou-sands of our fellow Alaskans. One of his friends, Celeste Hodge Growden, a member of the church, said: 
He and the church have led the way for a lot of things that have been accomplished here [in Anchorage]. Pastor Patterson al-ways says, ‘‘leaders lead.’’ That is the way he has lived his life. He is not in the back-ground. 
During election time, Pastor Patter-son organizes a huge ‘‘get out the vote’’ campaign. He was instrumental in get-ting a Martin Luther King memorial in Anchorage—a 10-year-long endeavor. She also talked about the groups he chaired, founded, and led beyond his congregation, including Bridge Build-ers of Anchorage, the March of Dimes Foundation, the Martin Luther King Jr. Foundation of Alaska, and the Interdenominational Ministerial Alli-ance of Anchorage. You know, with leaders like this, the list goes on and on. In addition to Co-rinthian Baptist Church in Fairbanks and Shiloh in Anchorage, Pastor Pat-terson also planted Eagle River Mis-sionary Baptist Church and Shiloh Mis-sionary Baptist Church of Palmer. I have been uplifted to the core when my wife Julie and I have gone to Shi-loh and listened to Pastor Patterson preach and listened to the beautiful— and I mean beautiful—Shiloh choir sing. It is a spiritual and energizing ex-perience like no other. I love attending services at Shiloh. On November 5, 2017, Pastor Patter-son’s 80th birthday, he will be giving his last sermon as pastor of Shiloh, and I certainly plan on being there. He is stepping down for Pastor Undra Parker, who will be the new and dy-namic leader of Shiloh—another great Alaskan, another veteran—and I know he is going to do a great job. But of course it is a bittersweet time for Shiloh’s parishioners because of the foundation Pastor Patterson built. The church, the singing, and the amens will continue on Earth and the church in Anchorage, AK, as it is in Heaven. God bless Pastor Patterson, his wife of 61 years, First Lady Shirley Patterson, and the congregation of Shi-loh Missionary Baptist Church for all they have done and continue to do for our community. Congratulations to Pastor Patterson for being our Alaskan of the Week. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about my Members on the other side of the aisle who are doing something that is just not helping the United States of America right now; that is, obstructing progress with re-gard to the new administration. I understand that right now my party is in the majority, and to be honest, I have been someone who thinks we should spend a lot more time here in the Senate, working in the Senate and getting things done. We have a lot of work to do. But I see that people back home can get frustrated with some of the lack of progress, and some of that we can address by spending more time in this body. Some of the questions that are com-ing out are about why things aren’t getting done. It is a good question. An-swers can be complicated, but what it mostly boils down to is that a lot of issues in this body—a lot—rely on con-sensus. The rules were carefully con-structed so that the minority has a say in the legislative process. For the most part, I believe that is a good thing. As a former President once pointed out, we are not a red or blue America; we are the United States of America. With that said, the people did elect us to come here and start getting

things done. Implicit in their votes for a new President and a new administra-tion was to be able to put people in the Federal Government to work, to focus on growing the economy, and to focus on rebuilding the military after a 25- percent cut over the last 8 years, to focus on better jobs and higher wages. Throughout history, whether it has been Republicans or Democrats, the minority party has understood this. When a new administration gets elect-ed, they start to put nominees in place, and the Senate takes action. We hold hearings and we have votes to put Sen-ate-confirmed officials in the Federal Government to work. If you don’t like the person, you can ask them tough questions in hearings and you can vote against them on the floor of the Senate or in committees. But what we are see-ing right now is pure obstruction. On every single nominee, the maximum amount of time is required before there is even a vote. This is something new. This is something different. In fact, the current minority leader said the fol-lowing words in 2013: 
Who in America doesn’t think a President, Democrat or Republican, deserves his or her picks for who should run the Federal Govern-ment agencies? Nobody. 
That was the minority leader in 2013. They were wise words then, but appar-ently he and his Members have forgot-ten those words. I have some facts here on the board. At this point in time, 10 months into President Obama’s Presidency in 2009, the Senate had allowed more than 318 nominees to be cast by a simple vote. The Senate only asked for a procedure known as cloture five times. Essen-tially, President Obama got elected, and the Senate Democrats and Repub-licans worked to get his team put in place. Yes, the Republicans did that. Certainly, I wasn’t here then. They voted against some of these nominees, and that is fine. But what they did was they let them come to the floor for a vote. In contrast to what I mentioned about President Obama’s first year in office, only 100 of President Trump’s nominees have been confirmed through voice vote. That is less than one-third of the courtesy given to President Obama 8 years ago. Cloture votes for Trump’s nominees have been required for 100 nominees. Remember, I just said there were five for Obama’s nominees 8 years ago. There have been 100 for Trump’s nominees, and only 63 have been allowed by simple voice vote. What does that mean? It means that each vote requires a 2-day waiting pe-riod and then another 30 hours of de-bate. That is what it means. The press won’t write about it. My friends in the press sitting up here in the Gallery won’t write about this. The contrast between the Trump treatment by the Senate and the Obama treat-ment by the Senate is incredible, and we don’t hear a word out of the press on this. And this isn’t partisan; this is just hurting the American people. There was an election, and now we need to fill the government with people who can run agencies. With all due re-spect to my friends on the other side of the aisle, they are not doing it. They are not allowing it. We had a vote on an Eighth Circuit judge last week. It had to go through cloture. We essentially spent the whole week on this—2 days and 30 hours. The judge passed the Senate by a 95-to-1 vote. It was a 95-to-1 vote. He wasn’t controversial at all so what was the point? The point was simply to delay. Again, here is the difference. Nomi-nations sent to the Senate are about the same. President Obama had more 8 years ago but not too many more. There were 520 versus 443 for President Trump confirmed. At this time during the Obama administration, there were 342. Trump has 163. So that is 66 per-cent for the Obama nominees 8 years ago and 37 percent for the Trump nomi-nees. The press will not write about it, but this is a disservice to Americans, whether you are a Democrat or Repub-lican. I will just mention a few. We have had nominees, such as the Assist-ant Secretary for Health in Health and Human Services. It came out of com-mittee several weeks ago. It is sitting on the floor. The Assistant Secretary of Health, it is not a controversial posi-tion for the company, but it is an im-portant position. I bet that person is going to finally get passage from the Senate at some point by a big super-majority, but we are delaying it. We are delaying it. I really would love it if the minority leader would come down, look at the American people, and just say: Here is why we are delaying. Here is why we are delaying. Explain it. They love to do this kind of stuff, procedural ‘‘dark arts,’’ thinking people aren’t watching. People understand this. The head of a leading Democratic think tank told the press they intend to hold up and tie up floor time on every single Trump administration nominee. Now, if that happens, if they take the time for every nominee—there are over 1,000 who need Senate con-firmation—and they take the entire amount of time they are allowed with cloture and other votes, if they don’t extend the courtesy that was extended to President Obama when he was try-ing to put his team in place, the Trump administration will never have a team in place. It will literally be 4 years. I hope today the press starts writing about this because the difference here in 8 years is quite remarkable and yet nobody is talking about it; that being that the minority leader and my col-leagues on the other side of the aisle stop obstructing what every other ad-ministration has had in terms of a courtesy, which is, if you win the elec-tion, whether you liked it or not, you work with the other side in the U.S. Senate to get your people in place—De-partment of Defense officials, Depart-ment of Transportation officials, De-partment of Health officials, Environ-mental Protection Agency officials. We have to get the country moving again, and the obstruction, which is unprece-dented, by the minority leader and un-fortunately many of my colleagues on the other side is only harming the American people. It is only harming the progress that the vast majority of Americans want, whether you are a Democrat or a Republican. I am hope-ful they are finally going to change and start moving forward nominations and letting us vote on them so we have an opportunity to actually get this coun-try moving again. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Minnesota. LAS VEGAS MASS SHOOTING  
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I would like to begin by talking about the recent tragedy in Las Vegas, the largest mass shooting in U.S. history, with at least 59 dead and more than 500 injured, including one Minnesotan who was injured and another who lost his life. So I join my colleagues in mourn-ing for the victims and their families. They are and should be our focus at this time, as well as making sure those who were hurt get the best medical care this country can give. As we look ahead, these events un-derscore the urgency to continue fight-ing for funding to better treat mental illness but also for sensible gun safety legislation, and I joined with some of my colleagues the day after the trag-edy in Las Vegas to call for those changes. No one policy will prevent every tragedy, but we need to come to-gether on commonsense legislation to save lives. One place we discussed this week where we could come together—be-cause we have in the past—is on back-ground checks. My colleagues Senator M
ANCHIN and Senator T OOMEY , who are two A-rated NRA Senators, have al-ready demonstrated that we can find bipartisan agreement on something as straightforward as background checks. I was very pleased they came together on this legislation, but the fact re-mains, the Senate’s failure to pass that bipartisan compromise was disheart-ening—one of my more disheartening days in the Senate because I began my day that day with the families of the Sandy Hook tragedy, with the parents who had lost their little kids, with the parents who had come to this building to advocate for a bill, the background check bill, that they knew wouldn’t have saved their child’s life, but they knew it would have saved others. What we have seen with expanded back-ground checks is they reduce suicides and they reduce domestic homicides by a fairly large number. Our constituents agree that we should be able to find some agreement here, as the numbers have consistently shown that Americans across the polit-ical spectrum, including gun owners, support proposals to require back-ground checks by wide margins. I have

a State, like the Presiding Officer’s, where there are a lot of hunters. It is a proud tradition in Minnesota so I look at all these proposals and I say to my-self: Does this hurt my Uncle Dick and his deer stand? For many of the ones I have looked at, the answer is clearly no, including the background check bill. When I talk to law enforcement in my State, they stress the need to have effective background checks to stop felons, people with severe mental ill-nesses, and others prohibited under current law from accessing guns. These efforts do not have to infringe in any way on Americans’ lawful right to own guns. Another sensible measure is Senator F
EINSTEIN ’s legislation to close a loop-hole that allows bump stop devices to convert semiautomatic firearms into weapons that work like fully auto-matic guns. Law enforcement officers have now recovered 12 of these devices from the Las Vegas shooter’s room. I am a cosponsor of that bill, and I am encouraged that some of my Repub-lican colleagues have agreed to look at this. I hope we can find a path forward in the weeks ahead, not only with regard to this particular focus, the bump stock device legislation, but also on some of the other bills like the back-ground check bill. 
HEALTHCARE  
Mr. President, I am here for another purpose today; that is, that we must get to work on other important busi-ness in the Senate. We need to reau-thorize the Children’s Health Insurance Program and come together on bipar-tisan fixes to the Affordable Care Act. No parent should ever have to worry whether their child will have healthcare, but funding for the Chil-dren’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, expired over this weekend. CHIP is one of the great bipartisan success stories. Both parties have come to-gether to support a program that pro-vides healthcare to millions of chil-dren. In Minnesota, these funds support coverage for 125,000 children. I heard from the children’s hospitals and clin-ics of Minnesota just last week about many of the families who count on this program. While States like mine are finding ways to make Federal funding last a bit longer, since ours has already expired, every single day Congress doesn’t act puts coverage of millions of children at risk. There is already bipartisan work un-derway to keep this program going. Senator H
ATCH and Senator W YDEN  have introduced a bipartisan bill to ex-tend CHIP for 5 years. In 2015, the last time we renewed this program, it passed the Senate with 92 votes—92 out of 100 votes. We should demonstrate that same bipartisan spirit again. The children in America are counting on us. We must act before it is too late or States like mine may be forced to make difficult choices about insurance coverage for some of our more vulner-able constituents. CHIP is one part of our healthcare system that is working. We should be doing everything in our power to pro-tect it. So let’s come together and pass this long-term reauthorization of CHIP. Mr. President, CHIP is not the only area where we should be able to come together on healthcare. The American people want us to work together on bi-partisan fixes to the Affordable Care Act. As I said the day it passed, it was a beginning and not an end. Any major piece of legislation like that needs im-provements and changes. Let’s work together on the bipartisan bills and ideas that have been put forward. Just like my friend Senator MCCAINsaid, we could do better working together—Re-publicans and Democrats. Senator A
LEXANDER and Senator M
URRAY have been holding hearings and discussions on commonsense solu-tions to bring down insurance costs over the past month. We had Governors here, and there were actually more Re-publican Governors in the room than Democratic Governors, as they em-braced these suggested changes which include reinsurance. I note Senator C
OLLINS and Senator N ELSON , a Repub-lican and a Democrat, have a bill to-gether that would do something on that front. I look at what has been done in Alas-ka—I see my colleague, Senator M
UR-
KOWSKI here—and what has been done in Minnesota when it comes to reinsur-ance, and we have seen some of the rates go down, not to where we need them to go, but there has been a de-crease in the amount of rates. We would like to see that on a national basis, and that is why I am such a strong supporter of Senator A
LEX-
ANDER and Senator M URRAY ’s work. Mr. President, finally, we need to be doing something on the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs. People such as Kim from Plymouth, MN, is strug-gling to afford her insulin because it has gone up three times. She keeps the injector with a few drops of insulin from day-to-day so she can get by. That is why I think we should have Medicare Part D negotiations. I have a bill that now has 33 cosponsors that lifts the ban that makes it illegal for 41 million seniors to negotiate the prices of drugs. Seniors can be a pretty stub-born and very vocal group. Why don’t we let them unleash their power and allow Medicaid to negotiate prices? Senator G
RASSLEY and I have a bill to stop pay for delay, where major pharmaceutical companies are paying off generics to keep their products off the market. I have a bill with Senator G
RASSLEY , Senator L EAHY , and Senator L
EE—the four of us lead the bill—the CREATES Act, which makes it easier to get more generic competition in the market. We also—M
CCAINand I, and Senator L
EEand I—have bills that allow for safe drugs to come in from other countries to again create more competition to bring the price down. When the prices of four of the top best selling drugs in America have gone up over 100 percent, I don’t think we can just sit here and do nothing anymore. I bring up these efforts because, for the most part, they are bipartisan—the work of Senator ALEXANDER and Sen-ator M
URRAY , the bills that have been introduced to do something on pre-scription drugs. Let’s get moving on that and let’s reauthorize CHIP. The last time it passed the Senate with 92 votes. Thank you. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Alaska. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST —EXECUTIVE  
CALENDAR  
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Sen-ate proceed to the en bloc consider-ation of the following nominations: Ex-ecutive Calendar Nos. 323, 324, 325; that the Senate vote on the nominations en bloc, with no intervening action or de-bate; that if confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table en bloc; that the Presi-dent be immediately notified of the Senate’s action; that no further mo-tions be in order; and that any state-ments relating to the nominations be printed in the R
ECORD . The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. INHOFE. I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-tion is heard. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is my hope that we will be able to come to agreement with regard to the nomi-nees whom I have just asked for consid-eration. These are individuals who have been moved out of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to be named to the Federal Energy Regu-latory Commission. This is a Commis-sion that has been without a func-tioning quorum for months on end. They have just recently been able to achieve that quorum, but they are not yet to a full complement. We worked hard to reach an agree-ment with colleagues so these names could advance so the FERC could get to work in an expeditious manner. There is much to be considered. The work that has piled up, that has cost our economy, that has cost our country over these many months, as we have seen these delays when you don’t have a functioning FERC, has been con-siderable. We want to try to reach agreement, but I am disappointed that we are not going to be able to advance them this afternoon. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Oregon. 
WILDFIRE FUNDING  
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, 4 weeks ago, I stood here on the floor of the Senate and called for increased funding to fight the wildfires. This is just one of the dramatic pictures of Or-egon ablaze. It is thousands and thou-sands of acres.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6347 October 5, 2017 
I had the experience of driving rough-ly 350 miles in my State and never es-caping the smoke from the fires that were in every single corner and in every quadrant of the State of Oregon. We have seen the challenge of Mother Nature at work this year with Hurri-canes Harvey, Irma, and Maria hitting in Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico. But let’s not forget the incredible damage being done in Montana, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington by these extraordinary fires. Over the last decade, we have seen an average of 50,000 fires in America each year. They destroy and burn up more than 5 million acres, but this year the count is well over 8 million acres and counting. In Oregon, we normally have fires that burn, on average, about 500,000 acres, but this year we are well over 600,000 acres and counting. As a result of these raging fires, we have many communities that have been so powerfully impacted and so many forests destructively impacted. We should stop and ask: What can we do better in terms of our forests and our communities? That is why I am taking to the floor right now. The first thing we need to do is to end fire borrowing. This is where the U.S. Forest Service, in order to pay for fighting these fires, proceeds to borrow from every other account. This has be-come all too common. What are those other accounts? They are the haz-ardous fuels funds, forest management funds, forest restoration funds, forest conservation funds, road maintenance funds, and funds that are designed to prepare for future timber sales. All of that does a lot of damage to the preparation. So the fires are more resilient and aren’t susceptible to this type of firefighting. We have seen, on average in the last decade, a cost of fighting fires across the country of about $1.6 billion. But this year, we are over $3 billion—almost double. So even though the Appropriations Committee had wisely put in a buffer of several hundred million dollars to prevent fire borrowing, those funds were long ago wiped out. So there we were 4 weeks ago. I was working to say that now that we are over the allotted funds for the year, let’s immediately get more funds that can be used to backfill this shortage in September. I thank all of my col-leagues for the fact that those funds were included in the continuing resolu-tion. We successfully provided a bridge so that firefighting could continue and so that the fire borrowing was quickly repaid. But that is not a permanent solu-tion—to try to legislate or to backfill on a rapid basis. Indeed, when we have these kinds of fire seasons, it is like other natural disasters. It is like tor-nadoes and hurricanes and floods. So we need to have a FEMA-style backup for those worst ever fire seasons. That is what my colleagues Senator W
YDEN  and Senator C
RAPO —bipartisan team-work—have been putting forth. It is called the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act of 2017. It says that when we reach a certain level of funding for fighting fires, the balance will go to a FEMA- style fund. That is exactly the way it should be done. It has been estimated in the past that if just the top 1 percent or 2 per-cent of the worst fires were funded in FEMA-style fund, we would never have had fire borrowing in the past. But the most relevant kind of crisp and clean way to do that would be to adopt this bill Senator WYDEN and Senator C RAPO  have put so much work into and which I am certainly pleased to cosponsor. That would be very useful, and we should do that now. We should respond while the memory is fresh and, actually, while fires are still burning in State after State—cer-tainly burning in my home State of Or-egon. Then we should recognize, too, that this terrible fire year has done so much damage to so many communities. We have communities where the roads have been cut off. We have commu-nities where the tourists disappeared because of the smoke, or other eco-nomic enterprises had to shut down for an extended period. So as we assist those communities hit by Harvey and hit by Irma and hit by Maria, let’s also help those commu-nities that were hit by this year’s ex-traordinary fires. That would mean strengthening the Small Business Dis-aster Loan Program. That would mean taking the additional funding for the USDA Emergency Community Water Assistance Program, and, certainly, it would mean making additional com-munity development block grants available to the communities impacted by these fires. Let’s not forget those communities as we provide assistance in funding to the communities affected by the hurricanes. Then we also need to address the fact that many assets in our forests were scorched by these fires. There are trails that have to be repaired, roads that have to be repaired, watershed repairs to avoid landslides, facilities that were scorched and burned, and wildlife and fish management restoration, includ-ing critical sage grouse areas. I was up visiting the incredible wa-terfall, the Multnomah Falls. They were explaining that several of the trails have bridges—there are so many bridges on the trails in Oregon—and that the fire had burned some of the understructure. So from above it looked like the bridges were safe, but they weren’t safe. They can’t reopen those trails until they get support to do all these repairs. The Forest Service has estimated that it will take $150 million to restore the damage done to the Forest Service’s infrastructure. So we should make that happen as part of this bill. Then, we should turn to forest fire resilience. We have 2 mil-lion acres in need of fire prevention ef-forts in Oregon. Actually, we have far more of that in need of fire prevention, but we have nearly 2 million that have already passed through environmental approval for work to reduce the haz-ardous fuels that are on the floor of the forest, and we need to thin these for-ests. You can imagine that when you have clearcuts and those clearcuts are re-planted, the trees grow back very close together. In a short amount of time, those forests are very good for fires and very good for disease, but they are nei-ther good for ecosystems nor for tim-ber stands. So they have to be thinned, and that thinning can be done, in Or-egon alone, on nearly 2 million acres already approved through the environ-mental process. The challenge is to get more funds into that effort. That, too, should be part of this be-cause, whether you talk to an environ-mentalist or talk to somebody who wants sawlogs for the mills, they both know that if you thin these forests, you make them more resistant to fire. With better timber stands, you have better ecosystems, and you supply a steady supply of sawlogs to the mill. Let’s not reopen the timber wars of the past. Let’s work together with a win-win. I want to show this chart because it indicates the dramatic change of what has happened to the Forest Service budget. We can go back to 1995 and compare it to the year 2015. I want to focus particularly on the orange. The orange is the amount of money that was spent fighting forest fires, and 20 years ago, it was 16 percent of the For-est Service budget. But in 2015—2 years ago—it broke 50 percent. It was 52 per-cent of their budget. This year, it has certainly gone up much higher than that. So as the amount of funds spent on fighting fires has increased, it has dramatically reduced the amount of funds that support our maintenance and improvement of the forest. That is what is getting squeezed out. Let me put it differently. The more you spend fighting fires out of a single pot of money, the less money you have to prevent the fires. Everywhere I go they say: Can’t we do more on the front end so these forests are more resilient? If you think about how fire works, it really gets going if the trees are close together because one tree lights the next tree on fire. If you thin them, you slow that down. The fire goes from the ground, where there is brush, to the canopy, where there are branches, very easily if the branches are close to the ground. So you trim off those branches, separate the trees, thin them out, shave off the branches, cut off the branches, and suddenly you have a for-est that is much more resilient. There are those folks who have said: Let’s just get rid of the environmental rules. Let’s just clearcut everything. Let’s do 10,000 acres at a time. That is, by the way, 15 square miles. Let’s set those 15 square miles next to each other. Let’s just shave the Earth and wipe out the forests. That way, there will not be forest fires. Those are the timber wars of the past.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6348 October 5, 2017 
What we have seen is that we can bridge the divide between a good eco-system and a good timber stand by thinning the forest, by making them more like a natural forest, which is much more fire resilient. In the process of thinning, which has to be done peri-odically over time, we are also pro-viding a steady foundation for sawlogs for our mills. There is a mill in John Day, OR. I met with the folks there who were very worried. The workers there were very worried about that mill getting shut down. I was determined to do every-thing I could to save that mill. What ended up happening is that we found we couldn’t save that mill with a timber sale because a timber sale can’t com-mit to a load of logs over a 10-year pe-riod. The owner of the mill couldn’t commit to the cost of new machinery if he didn’t know he would get logs for an extended period of time. So we discov-ered that we could, though, through a forest health contract—through a stew-ardship contract—enable a steady sup-ply of thinned logs to make it to that mill and make sure that mill stayed open. Not only did it keep it open, but it added workers to that mill. That is the type of win-win solution that we need. There is another way of looking at the cost of fighting fires. Here we see, in 1995, 16 percent of the budget going to fight fires; in 2017, 56 percent. Let’s look into the future. An original esti-mate was that we would reach 67 per-cent by 2025; now the new estimate, based on the changing dynamics in the forest, is that we will get to over two- thirds of the budget fighting fires by the year 2021—four fire seasons from today. That is how big the issue is. That is why we need funds from the front end to be able to thin these for-ests. This is simply common sense. If you are the private owner of a pri-vate forest, you wouldn’t dare let this forest retain this high propensity for fires and disease. You would thin the forest. You would make it a better tim-ber stand; you would make it a better ecosystem. And that is what we need to do. We have also seen that another way of looking at the changes is how the staffing levels have changed over the last two decades. If we look at just two decades ago, we can see that in 1998 there were about 18,000 individuals dedicated to managing the forest lands and just 5,700 dedicated to going out and fighting blazes. Now we have come into the future, and we see now that the number of people fighting fires is larger than the number working on all of the other forest programs. We have to commit to doing far more on the prevention end. If we let this summer’s crisis go without securing funding to thin those forests that have already gone through the environmental proc-ess, we are making a huge mistake, and it is going to cost us more because there are going to be even more fires in the future. So not only do we spend more out of the National Treasury to fight them, but we will have less healthy timber stands to fuel our econ-omy. Let’s end the fire burn. Let’s provide the funding to restore the fire service assets that were burned, the scourged assets. Let’s provide assistance through community development block grants and small business loans to as-sist the communities that were scourged by these fires. Let’s pass Sen-ator W
YDEN and Senator C RAPO ’s bill, which proceeds to create a FEMA-like structure to back up the worst fire sea-sons, and certainly, certainly, abso-lutely, let’s invest in prevention on the front end by thinning these forests and getting the flammable buildup of forest branches off the floor of the forests. Those are positive things we can do. At this moment in Houston, in Miami, in Puerto Rico, people are thinking, what can we do to better pre-pare for the next storm surge? What can we do to be better prepared for the next hurricane? Well, we know for sure that we are going to have fires across the Northwest in Montana, in Idaho, in Oregon, in Washington every summer, and they are simply getting worse. We must ask ourselves the same question: How do we change this rhythm? How do we operate this differently and better? That is our responsibility in this Chamber, and that is the set of things we can do to have a far better outcome in the future. I urge all of my colleagues to support these five efforts as we support funding for Texas and Florida and Puerto Rico. Thank you. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. B
LUNT ). The majority leader is recog-nized.

PUERTO RICO AND U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS RECOVERY EFFORT Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, over 2 weeks ago, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were devastated by Hur-ricane Maria. This was less than a month after the islands felt the im-pacts of another powerful storm, Hurri-cane Irma. Hurricane Maria has left a wake of destruction across the islands. In Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Is-lands, too many Americans remain without power, clean drinking water, or a method of communicating with their relatives and first responders. Last week, I met with leaders in the Puerto Rican community in Chicago to discuss local efforts to provide aid. This week, I met with a delegation from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Is-lands to discuss relief efforts and what we can do at the Federal level to help them rebuild. The stories they shared about friends and family in Puerto Rico were heartbreaking. These people, our fellow American citizens, are fac-ing a life and death situation. Sadly, the lives of at least 16 people have been claimed. The situation in Puerto Rico is dire, and aid cannot wait. The 3.5 million people who live on the island of Puerto Rico are our fellow U.S. citizens, and it is our duty to provide aid to them in their time of need. Yesterday, Congress received a sup-plemental aid request from the admin-istration to provide much needed dis-aster relief to our fellow Americans. Now, Congress must come together to help these Americans rebuild homes and businesses, restore critical infra-structure, and access life-sustaining supplies. Providing emergency disaster assist-ance to people in need is not a local issue. It is an American issue. Just as I expect my colleagues to come to the aid of the State of Illinois when we are faced with a natural dis-aster and just as Congress came to the aid of Hurricane Harvey victims a few short weeks ago, the people of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands expect us to rally behind them as they work to respond to Hurricane Maria. I urge my colleagues to quickly pass a clean aid package that will help all Americans whose lives have been im-pacted by these natural disasters. Any supplemental appropriations bill that includes aid for States impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma must also include aid for Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and western States that have been devastated by wildfires. I was heartened to hear that the Illi-nois National Guard has deployed teams to provide telecommunication assistance, food, water, tents, and cots to Puerto Rico. I was also glad to see that individual assistance is now avail-able for all 78 of the municipalities on the island, ensuring all individuals in Puerto Rico can receive assistance from the Federal Government. The Federal response to this disaster has taken far too long, and we must do more to help our fellow American citi-zens during this humanitarian crisis. In Congress, our top priority should be making sure the people of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands have the funding they need to rebuild and re-cover. We cannot delay providing this much needed funding any longer. It has been tragic to see thousands of shipping containers held at ports, which have been full of critical, life- sustaining supplies that are not reach-ing those most in need. There continue to be reports of families in Puerto Rico who are stranded and isolated. We must prioritize quickly distributing supplies to reach every individual in the days, weeks, and months to come. The U.S. citizens who live in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands are at risk of running out of food, water, and fuel. It would be unconscionable for us to abandon them in their time of need. Our thoughts are with the many peo-ple who have lost their loved ones, their homes, and other property. I want to recognize the hard work of the volunteers, local officials, and Federal employees that have come forward in this time of need and pitched in at every level. We can and should do more to help the people of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands rebuild and recover. I have no doubt that the people of Puer-to Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands will be able to clean up and rebuild, and they will be stronger for it. The entire Nation must come together as an American family to give them the aid and support they need at every step along the way. f 
FOR-PROFIT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there are a lot of issues roiling our Nation these days. I want to talk about an issue that may not get all the head-lines, but that has seen dramatic and troubling changes this year: our Na-tion’s higher education policy. Over the last several weeks, Sec-retary of Education Betsy DeVos has continued her assault on students and their families. Previously we had seen her rescind reforms that would improve customer service for students and hold student loan servicers accountable for their treatment of borrowers; rescind a pol-icy prohibiting debt collectors from charging borrowers 16 percent fees to bring their loans out of default; halt the processing of borrower defense loan discharge applications from students defrauded by for-profit colleges and throwing out rules intended to help students get the discharges to which they are entitled to under law; rewrite the gainful employment rule, which is meant to protect students from pro-grams for-profit colleges that saddle students with too much debt compared to their income; propose eliminating public service loan forgiveness, which helps students afford to serve their communities, States, and country while repaying their student loans; propose dumping $38 billion in addi-tional student loan interest on needy students by eliminating subsidized un-dergraduate loans; and propose freezing the maximum Pell grant award so that their award covers even less of what it costs a student to attend college. That is just the beginning. Several weeks ago, I joined Senators B
ROWN , MURRAY , and W ARREN in call-ing on Secretary DeVos to appoint a credible, well-qualified, independent chief enforcement officer to lead the Department of Education’s enforce-ment unit.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6350 October 5, 2017 
The unit was created after the col-lapse of Corinthian to improve over-sight of higher education institutions and enforcement of Federal laws. Robert Kaye, a respected investi-gator and consumer expert from the Federal Trade Commission, was se-lected to be the first chief. Kaye left the post in March. Secretary DeVos allowed this critical position to remain vacant for more than 4 months until earlier last month, when she finally announced the ap-pointment of Dr. Julian Schmoke, Jr. At first glance, Dr. Schmoke meets none of the requirements for the job that my colleagues and I set out in our letter. As chief enforcement officer, Dr. Schmoke will be charged with ensuring that institutions of higher education are following Federal laws and regula-tions. This will mean paying special atten-tion to an area that poses the most risk to students and has demonstrated systemic abuse: for-profit colleges. These are the colleges that enroll 9 percent of all postsecondary students in America, but take in 17 percent of all Federal student aid and account for 33 percent of all Federal student loan defaults. Beyond the infamous Corinthian and ITT Tech examples, there are countless examples of for-profit colleges defraud-ing students, whether it be Ashford, Westwood, or DeVry. Last year, DeVry agreed to pay the Federal Trade Commission $100 million for defrauding students and agreed to a separate settlement with the Depart-ment of Education. Guess who Dr. Schmoke previously worked for? You guessed it, DeVry Uni-versity. In fact, there are reports that DeVry is still under investigation by the very unit Dr. Schmoke has been appointed to lead. How is that for the fox guard-ing the henhouse? If that wasn’t enough, there is no discernable evidence on Dr. Schmoke’s resume of any experience conducting or overseeing investigations. Shortly after his appointment, I joined Senators B
ROWN , W ARREN , B
LUMENTHAL , and W HITEHOUSE in writ-ing to Dr. Schmoke raising these con-cerns and asking him to meet with us. We are still waiting. As Betsy DeVos orchestrates a cor-porate takeover of the Department of Education by for-profit interests, State attorneys general and other Federal agencies are even more important in providing aggressive oversight to pro-tect students and taxpayers. Betsy DeVos is doing what she can to disrupt that, too. On September 1, the Department of Education provided notice to the Con-sumer Financial Protection Bureau that it was terminating its existing data-sharing agreement with the CFPB. The Department took exception ‘‘to the CFPB unilaterally expanding its oversight role . . .’’ into areas that the Department viewed as within its juris-diction. The CFPB has been a leader in pro-tecting student borrowers harmed by Federal loan servicers like Navient and predatory lending practices by institu-tions like Corinthian and ITT Tech. This political stunt makes clear that Secretary DeVos would rather initiate a turf war than work with other Fed-eral agencies to fulfill the Federal Gov-ernment’s collective oversight respon-sibilities. In announcing Dr. Schmoke as the new chief enforcement officer, Sec-retary DeVos said, ‘‘Protecting stu-dents has always been my top pri-ority.’’ Well, Madam Secretary, your actions just don’t back up that statement. Nearly every time you have had the opportunity to stand up for students, their families, and taxpayers, you have turned your back on them. Commonsense protections for stu-dents and taxpayers shouldn’t be a par-tisan issue. Secretary DeVos, I urge you to aban-don this assault on students and in-stead work with us to strengthen America’s system of higher education, to deal honestly with wrongdoing by for-profit colleges, and to increase op-portunities for all Americans. f

CONFIRMATION OF ERIC HARGAN ∑Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, I had expected to be able to vote on the confirmation of Mr. Eric Hargan, to be Deputy Secretary for Health and Human Service, HHS. Instead, I am in Las Vegas to grieve with and assist my fellow Nevadans in the aftermath of the worst mass shooting in modern American history. On the question of Mr. Hargan’s nom-ination, I want to make my opposition to his confirmation clear. I do not be-lieve Mr. Hargan to be qualified to be a leading member of HHS. This decision is based on his prior experience, his work and statements opposing the Af-fordable Care Act, as well as his state-ments regarding the extension of the State Children’s Health Insurance Pro-gram. Deputy Secretary Eric Hargan would be the highest ranking appointee at HHS, making him responsible for implementing and enforcing the Af-fordable Care Act, ACA, going forward. Considering the fact that the adminis-tration has repeatedly and consistently sought to undermine the ACA, I fear that someone with Mr. Hargan’s views will only aid and abet this reckless game the administration is playing with Americans’ healthcare. I hope that Mr. Hargan will surpass my expectations and serve this country well as Deputy Secretary at HHS. The role of HHS Deputy Secretary in imple-menting and administering the efforts of strengthening our healthcare system is too important for any other result. I believe strongly that Americans de-serve affordable and accessible healthcare coverage, and I hope Mr. Hargan’s actions as Deputy Director show that he agrees. However, I could not in good conscience vote to confirm someone about whom I have so many concerns. Thank you.∑ f

POLICY JUSTIFICATION  Japan—AIM–120C–7 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAMs) The Government of Japan has requested a possible sale of fifty-six (56) AIM 120C–7 Ad-vanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAMs). Also included are containers, weapon support and support equipment, spare and repair parts, U.S. Government and contractor engineering, technical and logistical support services, and other related elements of logistical and program support. The total estimated program cost is $113 mil-lion. This sale will support the foreign policy and national security of the United States by meeting the security and defense needs of a major ally and partner nation. Japan con-tinues to be an important force for peace, po-litical stability, and economic progress in the Asia-Pacific region. The proposed sale will provide Japan a critical air defense capability to assist in de-fending the Japanese homeland and U.S. per-sonnel stationed there. Japan will have no difficulty absorbing these additional muni-tions into the Japan Air Self-Defense Force. The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military bal-ance in the region. The principal contractor will be Raytheon Missile Systems, Tucson, Arizona. There are no offset arrangements proposed in connec-tion with this potential sale. Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the assignment of U.S. Govern-ment or contractor representatives to Japan. There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-fense readiness as a result of this proposed sale. 
TRANSMITTAL NO . 17–42 Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act Annex Item No. vii (vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 1. The proposed sale will involve the re-lease of sensitive technology to the Govern-ment of Japan related to the AIM–120C Ad-vanced Medium Range Air-to-Air (AMRAAM). The AIM–120C AMRAAM is a radar guided missile featuring digital tech-nology and micro-miniature solid-state elec-tronics. AMRAAM capabilities include look- down/shoot-down, multiple launches against multiple targets, resistance to electronic countermeasures, and interception of high flying, low flying, and maneuvering targets. The AMRAAM All Up Round is classified CONFIDENTIAL, major components and subsystems range from UNCLASSIFIED to CONFIDENTIAL, and technology data and other documentation are classified up to SE-CRET. 2. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the infor-mation could be used to develop counter-measures or an equivalent system which might reduce system effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with similar or advanced capabilities. 3. A determination has been made that Japan can provide substantially the same de-gree of protection for the sensitive tech-nology being released as the U.S. Govern-ment. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and national secu-rity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-tification. 4. All defense articles and services listed in this transmittal have been authorized for re-lease and export to Japan. f AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE PREVENTION ACT Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

BIN, LEAHY , CORTEZ MASTO , VANHOL-

UCKWORTH , M ENENDEZ , and B ALDWIN  for cosponsoring this legislation. Their support for this bill is deeply appre-ciated. Just days ago, in Las Vegas, NV, we experienced the worst mass shooting— in terms of the number of victims—in our Nation’s history. There are now at least 58 dead and nearly 500 wounded as a result of that attack. The grief and pain of so many victims and their loved ones is over-whelming and all too familiar to gun violence victims and survivors all across America. What makes this mass shooting par-ticularly devastating is that the shoot-ing was done by a single gunman. With-in minutes, the gunman exacted dev-astating firepower on hundreds of peo-ple, terrorizing concertgoers and an en-tire community. How was this possible? While facts are still being uncovered, we know that this particular gunman had amassed a vast arsenal. He had at least 23 firearms and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in his hotel room among which were 12 semiauto-matic rifles enhanced with ‘‘bump- stock’’ devices. These bump-stock devices are typi-cally used to turn semiautomatic rifles into functional machine guns, capable of shooting hundreds of bullets per minute. A semiautomatic rifle’s rate of fire is usually 45 to 60 rounds per minute. With a bump-stock device attached, these semiautomatic weapons can fire up to 700 rounds per minute. Bump- stock devices are readily accessible. They can be purchased online or at a store by anyone for merely $100. Anyone who has seen YouTube video clips of semiautomatic rifles outfitted with these devices knows just how dev-astating they are. The number of bullets that can be sprayed into a crowd within minutes is staggering. Because they are so dangerous, auto-matic machine-gun-like weapons have been categorically banned in America since 1986 under the National Firearms Act. This law was a direct response to the Prohibition Era’s mobster crimes dur-ing which machine guns were used to kill their victims at a deadly rate. One seminal event during this period was the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre of 1929. That tragic day was marked by the murder of seven men in a garage on the North Side of Chicago. The massacre was the culmination of a feud between an Irish American gang and another gang led by Al Capone. Organized crime was rampant during that era, and fully automatic weapons were the weapons of choice for gangsters. Indeed, the men who committed the St. Valen-tine’s Day Massacre used Thompson submachine guns, known as ‘‘Tommy guns,’’ to mow down their victims. The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre, which remains in infamy, clearly dem-onstrated that elected leaders must do something about this violence and get these fully automatic guns out of the hands of killers. As a result, the National Firearms Act was enacted in 1934. When origi-nally passed, it heavily regulated ma-chine guns, imposing a tax on the mak-ing and transferring of machine guns and other lethal weapons. It also im-posed a special occupational tax on those engaged in the business of im-porting, manufacturing, and dealing in firearms regulated under the National Firearms Act. It also required the registration of all machine guns and other guns regulated under the National Firearms Act with the Treasury Secretary. Later, in 1986, the National Firearms Act was amended to ban all future automatic weapons from private pos-session, except for those legally owned and registered as of May 19, 1986. Therefore, today, automatic weapons are generally banned for civilian use— and rightfully so. They are absolutely lethal weapons of war and have no business being in our homes, our schools, our businesses, and our streets. Notwithstanding this outright ban, there is a loophole in the law that al-lows bump-stock devices to configure legal semiautomatic weapons so that they can function like a fully auto-matic weapon. This loophole must be closed. If automatic weapons are banned, these devices should be banned. There is no functional difference between automatic weapons and a bump-stock enhanced semiautomatic weapon. Such devices are simply not needed to hunt

or to use in a private home for self-de-fense. Like we saw in Las Vegas, these bump-stock devices allow those with a motive to kill to use fully legal fire-arms to wreak havoc and kill large numbers of people within minutes. The bill I have introduced is straight-forward. It closes the loophole that al-lows civilians to purchase and use de-vices that convert semiautomatic weapons into machine guns. Specifi-cally, it bans the sale, transfer, impor-tation, manufacturing, or possession of bump fire devices, trigger cranks, or anything that accelerates a semiauto-matic rifle’s rate of fire. The bill further provides an excep-tion to this ban, by allowing for the lawful possession of these devices by law enforcement and the government. Those who violate the ban would be subject to the same penalty available to those who illegally possess a ma-chine gun under current law. Closing this loophole should not be a partisan issue. Anyone who has seen footage from the shooting in Las Vegas should recognize that weapons that are altered to emulate automatic gunfire should not be permitted in our commu-nities. In my view, this bill is a modest pro-posal. It was one that was included in the Assault Weapons Ban legislation that I proposed 4 years ago, which we failed to pass in 2013. Tragically, had that legislation been enacted in 2013, it could have perhaps saved lives in Las Vegas. Indeed, when the police dispatcher was first contacted in Las Vegas at 10:09 PM local time, it took 11 minutes until the last shots were fired and the suspect was neutralized. Think of that for a moment. If auto-matic gunfire had been impossible for the gunman, less shots would have sprayed through Las Vegas that night, and less people may have died. That is extraordinarily sobering. I recall standing here on this floor nearly 4 years ago, urging my col-leagues to adopt the assault weapons ban, pleading that it could possibly save lives. That was on the heels of one of the darkest days in American history, when 20 beautiful children and 6 edu-cators had their lives taken at Sandy Hook Elementary School. It is an abso-lute travesty that Congress refused to act back then. It is my strongest belief that when our Nation is faced with dire situa-tions—like sickness, or job stagnation, or human trafficking—it is our job, our solemn oath as lawmakers, to try to solve these problems. We utterly forsake that solemn oath when we simply do nothing; when we yield to cynicism or to a single lob-bying faction. If we do not act today, we are failing the American people. We are failing our communities. We are failing re-sponsible gun owners. I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill. We must act. Now is the time. IRAN NUCLEAR AGREEMENT Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, the United States is facing an urgent nuclear crisis with North Korea. Presi-dent Trump should not trigger another nuclear crisis with Iran. North Korea’s nuclear program pre-sents a clear and direct threat to the United States. Our top military offi-cial, General Dunford, testified last month that North Korea has the capa-bility to strike the U.S. mainland with an intercontinental ballistic missile. North Korea has ramped up the pace of its ballistic missile tests, firing two ICBMs over Japan in recent months. Just last month, North Korea con-ducted its sixth test of a nuclear weap-on, the largest yet. Meanwhile, President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are engaged in nuclear brinkmanship. Trump has threatened to ‘‘totally de-stroy’’ North Korea, has tweeted that North Korea ‘‘might not be around much longer,’’ and has rebuked his own Secretary of State for attempting to find a diplomatic solution. With each reckless pronouncement, Trump’s threats could bring the United States closer to a war that would put at risk millions of lives, including tens of thousands of American soldiers. Confronted with the North Korean nuclear threat, President Trump is seeking to provoke another nuclear cri-sis, this time in the turbulent Middle East. He has repeatedly threatened to withdraw from the agreement that the United States and the international community forged to prohibit Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. He has called the Iran deal an ‘‘embarrass-ment,’’ ‘‘the worst deal ever,’’ and has vowed to ‘‘rip up’’ the agreement. In making those threats, Trump is put-ting our security and credibility at risk. The Iran deal is working. It has verifiably shut off Iran’s pathways to a nuclear bomb, imposed tough con-straints on Iran’s nuclear program, and subjected Iran to the most comprehen-sive inspection and monitoring regime ever negotiated. How do we know? We know from Donald Trump himself. Just 2 weeks ago, President Trump found Iran in compliance and waived nuclear-related sanctions on Iran. In fact, the Trump administration has twice certified Iran’s compliance with the deal, acknowledging that adher-ence to the agreement is in the vital national security interests of the United States. Our State Department, our Defense Department, and our intel-ligence community have all assessed that Iran is in compliance with the nu-clear agreement. Most importantly, President Trump has presented no evi-dence to Congress, as he is required to do by law, of any potential Iranian breach of the deal. In fact, the adminis-tration has yet to brief the Senate on its strategy for Iran, despite weekly re-quests from my colleagues. Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, Trump has suggested that he will refuse to certify Iran’s compliance with the deal by October 15, the next deadline. This will effec-tively kick the deal’s fate to Congress, which will then have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose the nuclear-re-lated sanctions on Iran waived under the deal. Make no mistake: Trump’s reasons for not certifying Iran’s compliance are based on politics, not national secu-rity. He wants to tear up an agreement that has prevented Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, simply because it was negotiated by a democratic adminis-tration. Trump has threatened to do this without offering any alternative plan to block Iran from getting a nu-clear bomb. In the absence of any evidence of an Iranian violation, Trump and his team are manufacturing reasons not to cer-tify the deal, citing issues not ad-dressed in the nuclear agreement, such as Iran’s sponsorship of regional ter-rorism, its ballistic missile tests, and its human rights violations. Iran is subject to sanctions for those malign activities. Since the Iran deal has been implemented, the United States had designated over 100 individ-uals and entities for sanctions. Con-gress passed a new law this July, that I cosponsored, sanctioning Iran for these aggressions. It is worth under-scoring this point: Donald Trump has yet to issue instructions to his admin-istration on how to implement that sanctions law. In short, the Iran deal has not pre-vented the United States from taking measures to hold Iran accountable for its destabilizing actions elsewhere. It has, however, prevented Iran from con-ducting those same actions with a nu-clear weapon. That is where our focus should continue to be. A nuclear-armed Iran would be a far greater menace in the region than a nonnuclear Iran. The truth is, if the United States had tried to expand the nuclear agreement to also address Iran’s ballistic missile tests and its regional terrorism, there would simply be no deal. Russia and China would not have agreed to its terms. Preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon was the only point on which all parties were united. Critics of the deal who argue otherwise are not being straight with the American peo-ple. In a world of alternative facts, that point is worth reiterating. No deal, in-cluding this one, contains everything we want. That is the nature of a nego-tiation. Unilaterally withdrawing from the agreement will not produce a bet-ter deal today. In fact, we have much less negotiating leverage today. The United States does not have the back-ing of our allies and partners around the world for withdrawal. Our partners have been crystal clear. They will not renegotiate the deal while it is work-ing. Without that international back-ing, we have no leverage with Iran. This brings to bear another, equally important, point. This administration

is already putting American credibility at risk; if we manufacture a specious excuse for abandoning the Iran agree-ment, our word will mean little. That will make it nearly impossible to nego-tiate a diplomatic solution to the nu-clear crisis in North Korea, already an extremely challenging prospect. Put simply, our allies, partners, and adver-saries would have no reason to trust the United States. That is why Secretary of Defense Mattis, when asked whether it was in the national security interest of the United States to stay in the Iran deal, said, ‘‘Yes, Senator, I do.’’ I want to end by outlining the choice we face right now. The choice we face right now is between a deal or no deal. It is between cutting off Iran’s path-ways to a bomb or allowing Iran to push forward with its nuclear weapons program. It is between maintaining U.S. leadership in the world or empow-ering our adversaries. It is a choice be-tween diplomacy or heading down a path toward war. For these reasons, I urge President Trump to certify Iran’s compliance with the nuclear agreement by October 15. If he fails to do so, I urge my col-leagues in the Senate to preserve the deal.

HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleagues and all Americans in celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month and the innumerable contribu-tions of the Hispanic American com-munity. There is much to celebrate. Although Hispanic Americans comprise 18 percent of the U.S. population, Latino-owned businesses, by some esti-mates, are responsible for approxi-mately 86 percent of this country’s small business growth. What is more, their economic influence is unrivaled by any other demographic since the baby boomers, representing a $1.5 tril-lion segment of the consumer market, according to a recent Stanford Univer-sity state of Latino entrepreneurship, and perhaps, most notably, Hispanic Americans play an increasingly impor-tant role in our democracy, with a record 27 million Latinos eligible to vote in last year’s election. It has never been clearer that His-panic Americans represent an impres-sive cultural and economic force. Ulti-mately, however, their value to this country is not in their statistics. It is in their character. A love for family, a commitment to community, and an un-paralleled penchant for hard work are the tenets of Hispanic heritage. They are also the building blocks of Amer-ica. This is no coincidence: Hispanic Americans helped build and sustain our Nation. They are an irreplaceable thread in the fabric of American soci-ety. With their knack for innovation, with their fearless pursuit of better lives, and sometimes with their bare hands, they have shaped this country from the ground up, and we are all the better for it. While we use this month to reflect on their dignity and importance to this country, this year, in particular, the Hispanic American community is best served through actions not just words. Congress must pass the Dream Act. President Trump’s order to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA, Program has shaken the His-panic American community and most American to their core. Dreamers were brought to this country as children, with no decision in the matter. More importantly, they are quintessentially American in every way, except for their immigration status. They have lived, played, worshipped, and gone to school alongside our children most of their lives. They are our children’s classmates and neighborhood friends and teammates. They are the college students studying at the library. They are the young serviceworkers at our fa-vorite restaurants, studiously saving up for next semester’s tuition. They are young men and women in uniform, serving in harm’s way, defending our freedoms. Dreamers were raised here, and most know no other home except the United States of America. If Congress does not act to protect them, the President’s ac-tions will force many of them out of work, into hiding and into poverty. This will not make America stronger. What makes America stronger are the Dreamers themselves. Their spirit, character, and will to overcome rep-resent what is best about our country. We should be proud to call them our own. We shouldn’t be sending them un-derground or into exile. There is another urgent matter de-manding our full attention: hurricane relief for Puerto Rico. The pictures coming from Puerto Rico are heart-breaking. The devastation that has hit the island as a result of Hurricane Maria deserves the same commitment and support that would go to any other location in the United States. Puerto Rico’s 3.4 million residents are Amer-ican citizens, and they should be treat-ed just the same as residents of Flor-ida, Texas, and Louisiana. The Senate should quickly take up the emergency supplemental appropriations request as soon as possible after the Columbus Day recess. Voting rights, access to quality, af-fordable healthcare, higher education, tax reform, these are also issues criti-cally important to Hispanic Americans because they are the issues important to the country. There is no breathing room between the two. Our national in-terests are their personal interests, so their interests must also be ours. Americans are a diverse group; we do not all look the same or worship in the same way. We are, each and every one of us, united by far more profound things: a love for the freedoms this country affords us; respect for the power and peace we derive from our di-verse communities; and an unshakable belief in every person’s right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. What makes us Americans is our moral fiber and our shared love for the United States. Any other litmus test is a dis-criminatory one; yet every day, and sometimes at the hands of our own government, Hispanic Americans are tested and questioned, profiled, and met with suspicion, out of sheer igno-rance and baseless prejudice. Still, they march on. They meet the chal-lenges of systemic discrimination with grace, grit, and courage. Indeed, the Hispanic American community often reflects the best of America, even when America offers less than its best in re-turn. Now more than ever, Hispanic Herit-age Month must be about standing up and declaring support for Hispanic Americans. Now more than ever, Con-gress must use its collective voice to magnify their voices, to affirm His-panic Americans’ rightful place in this Nation and to proclaim a commitment to representing their interests right here in this Chamber. We must begin fulfilling that com-mitment by immediately passing the Dream Act. But our commitment must extend further. We must support more equal representation of Hispanic Amer-icans in our society, including in Con-gress. We must address the healthcare disparities that disproportionally af-fect the Hispanic community, an issue that begs Congress to work together toward more universal, affordable cov-erage. We must acknowledge the dif-ficulties Hispanic American students face in affording college. Finally, we must stand firm against the tidal wave of bigoted rhetoric that has flooded the national dialogue in recent months. Whenever and wherever Hispanic Americans are degraded, belittled, or oppressed, basic morality demands that we speak up and speak out. Tolerance and respect, like a muscle, require ef-fort and exercise. We must not allow these values to atrophy on our watch. Diversity and inclusion are American virtues and proud features of Hispanic heritage alike; we must now, and al-ways, be their steward.

TRIBUTE TO MARY GAUTREAUX Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I wish to indulge in a bit of bragging. I know every one of us in this Chamber has that one or two staffers who are the Jacks or Janes of all trades of their operations. My longtime loyal friend and staffer, who has served the great State of Or-egon for over 20 years in my office as a fellow, a field representative, and now deputy State director, Mary Gautreaux celebrates her 70th birthday on October 17. I want to recognize her enormous and long-lasting contributions over the past two decades in my office to mak-ing Oregon a better place to live and enjoy. Mary brings a lifetime of expertise to the natural resources issues that play such an essential part in Oregon’s economy and quality of life. Not only

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6354 October 5, 2017 
does she know these issues but she has lived these issues and passed on her love of them to her children, Ryder, Myria, Callie, and Lucas, as well as her five grandchildren. Before joining my office in the 1990s, Mary served in the U.S. Forest Service. In those days, Mary planted trees and fought fires to support her young fam-ily. While the work was seasonal, to start, she quickly made an impression on the U.S. Forest Service and became a full-time employee. Then I was lucky enough to get her as a fellow in 1994 in my DC office when I was still a member of the House of Representatives for the proud 3rd Dis-trict of Oregon and still had rugged good looks and a full head of hair. She worked in my DC office for a year and had just moved back to Or-egon when I realized my office was bet-ter for her presence, so I hired Mary to work as field rep in Oregon. I may not know much about a lot of things, but I can recognize an excellent teammate, and Mary was a natural fit on ‘‘Team Wyden.’’ When I was elected to the U.S. Sen-ate for the first time in 1996, I made a promise to do a townhall meeting in every county in Oregon every year I was privileged enough to represent the good people of Oregon in Washington, DC. In the last 21 years, she has been with me at almost every one of the 800- plus townhalls I have held each year in each of Oregon’s 36 counties. At almost every one of those town-halls, I have at some junction pointed to Mary and said, ‘‘Folks, give Mary a call about this issue. She works nights and weekends—never hesitate to call.’’ It does not matter the issue; Mary al-ways answers the phone. She has been going the extra mile with and for Or-egonians in every nook and cranny of our State, both literally and figu-ratively. Literally, Mary has traveled with me and solo to countless meetings in grange halls, diners, and farmhouses all across Oregon, and there has never been an issue too big or too small for her to take on. One way to explain the praise Mary has earned is to say that Oregonians know Mary as a public servant always willing to listen and find solutions that benefit all of Oregon and Oregonians, not just the ones that vote for me. She lives by my promise to be the ‘‘Senator for all of Oregon,’’ and Oregonians know it and appreciate her for it. My appreciation and Oregon’s appre-ciation for Mary goes deeper than that accurate and well-deserved summation. The deeper truth is that anybody who knows Mary knows she is an original and unforgettable force of nature— fierce on behalf of Oregonians, bold in her problem-solving, always willing to help, and just as ready with a smile to lighten any situation. She has a gigantic heart matched only by her passion for public service and protecting the natural treasures we Oregonians all hold dear. The bottom line is I have been very fortunate to work with her, to call her friend, to have her as an integral mem-ber of Team Wyden, and I look forward to many more years of her public serv-ice to the people of Oregon and her friendship to me and my family.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO DONALD AND RITA GALLES ∑Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the St. An-thony Tri-Parish Catholic School Foundation’s 2017 honorees, Donald Galles and Rita (Murphy) Galles. The foundation supports the wonder-ful work of the St. Anthony Tri-Parish Catholic School. The school is dedi-cated to achieving academic excellence in a faith-filled community and living a life committed to Christian service. Since 1927, the school and staff have provided a high standard of academic achievement and Christian values. The school provides strong religious and educational leadership to the Casper community. On October 12, 2017, the foundation will be hosting the sixth annual Joy Breakfast and celebrating the school’s 90th anniversary, nearly a century of educating students. Every year at this event, the foundation honors individ-uals who have made outstanding con-tributions to the school and exemplify the values of the Catholic community. Don Galles and Rita (Murphy) Galles are perfect for this honor. Both the Galles family and the Murphy family have a long history of supporting Catholic education and serving as role models to our community. John and Mari Ann Martin, Susie and the late Mick McMurry, and Joe Scott will also be recognized at the breakfast for their invaluable contribution and dedication to the St. Anthony’s Tri-Parish Catho-lic School Foundation. Rita is a caring nurse and dedicated mother. As a native to Casper, WY, she attended St. Anthony’s Parochial School and graduated from Natrona County High School in 1947. Rita then attended the St. Joseph’s School of Nursing in Denver, CO, and started her nursing career. As a nurse, she touched so many lives by caring for the sick and injured. While in Denver, she mar-ried Dr. Joseph Murphy at the Blessed Sacrament Church on November 24, 1953. They were married for 51 years and had 12 children: Patrick, Mary Ann, Donald, Kevin, Mark, Sheila, Michelle, Rita, Kathleen, Maureen, Robert, and Anne. Rita enrolled all 12 of her children in St. Anthony’s in order to ensure they received an excel-lent academic and religious founda-tion. With this strong background, her children have collectively spent more than 75 years in post-high school edu-cation. Donald is a decorated veteran, ac-complished businessman, and loving family man. Like Rita, he is a native of Casper, WY, and attended both St. An-thony’s Parochial School and Natrona County High School. After high school, Don joined the U.S. Army’s 100th Infan-try Division in France. He proudly fought for our country on the front lines during World War II. Don was se-riously wounded while fighting in France. For his brave service to our Nation, Don was awarded the Silver Star, the Nation’s third-highest award for valor. He also received a Bronze Star, Purple Heart, and Combat Infan-try Badge. After the war, Don attended and graduated from Creighton Univer-sity in Nebraska. It is there that he met Ann Christensen, who later be-came his wife for 55 years. They re-turned to Casper and raised six chil-dren: Tom, David, Dona, Laura, Karla, and Jeff. Many of their children at-tended St. Anthony’s. In Casper, Don had a successful career as a partner with a local oil and gas firm. He is also active in the community as a member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American Veterans, the Knights of Columbus, and a lifelong member of St. Anthony’s Catholic Church. The Galles and Murphy families were joined together in 2005. In the presence of their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, Don and Rita were married at St. Anthony’s Catholic Church on December 29, 2005. As the place where they first met as children, the church holds great memories and a deep personal connection for them both. Over the years, Don and Rita have generously contributed their time and resources to both the church and school. They have also given back to our community in numerous other ways. For example, Don and Rita made an essential donation to purchase land and a building to expand the Casper Seton House, which assists homeless mothers and children. Their kindness, devotion, and generosity are true re-flections of their character and the val-ues they have passed along to their family. It is with great honor that I recog-nize these outstanding members of our Wyoming community. My wife, Bobbi, joins me in extending our congratula-tions to Donald and Rita Galles for re-ceiving this special award.∑

TRIBUTE TO JOHN GABRIEL ‘‘GABE’’ SMITH ∑Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a Marylander, John Ga-briel Smith, whose courage not only broke barriers for himself but also ad-vanced the cause of the betterment of humanity. We celebrate and honor Mr. Smith, known as Gabe, because he was the very first African American to graduate from Gonzaga College Pre-paratory High School, located just a few blocks from the Capitol Building, with the class of 1954. Gabe was born in the turbulent times of the early 1940s in St. Mary’s County,

MD, where he and his two sisters were introduced to the ugly world of racism. His hard-working parents committed their children to a Catholic education and religious fellowship at St. Peter Claver, a predominantly African-Amer-ican church in rural Ridge, MD. As an eighth grader, Gabe decided to serve as an altar boy; little did he know that it would change his life and place him in the annals of American history. The head pastor of St. Peter Claver was a humble man by the name of Fa-ther Horace B. McKenna, S.J., a White Jesuit priest who had been serving the segregated and neglected African- American community in Southern Maryland for two decades. Father McKenna would later found So Others Might Eat, SOME, a ministry which continues to feed the hungry here in Washington, DC. One day, Gabe lis-tened intently as Father McKenna de-scribed the spiritual journey many men had taken on the way to priesthood. Gabe, who was interested in pursuing this vocation, asked Father McKenna how he could become a priest too. Fa-ther McKenna told Gabe that he would, at a minimum, need to learn Latin. Un-fortunately, there were no schools in St. Mary’s County or the surrounding areas that Gabe could attend which taught Latin, let alone provide the other instruction necessary to launch his vocation, so Father McKenna told him about a school in Washington, DC. where he could learn Latin and all the other requisites. That school was Gon-zaga College High School. Racial segregation was the barrier that would have prevented Gabe from attending Gonzaga, but that was about to change. Gabe often speaks about the angels who have been in his life, in-cluding Father McKenna, football coach Joe Kozik, and Archbishop Pat-rick A. O’Boyle, a man who quietly but diligently worked to break the racial divide here in the Nation’s Capital. Several years before the Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954 to end segregation, Archbishop O’Boyle ordered the integration of all Catholic schools and churches in the Arch-diocese of Washington. Thus, in 1951, John Gabriel Smith was one of the first African Americans to enter Gonzaga, one of the Nation’s elite prep schools. Gabe moved in with his sister, who lived around the corner from the school. He had observed and experi-enced abusive conditions under seg-regation in St. Mary’s County; thus, he was on guard among his peers at school. Fortunately, during his time at Gonzaga, his classmates welcomed him in the classroom and stood with him in the face of adversity and strife when they walked outside the school’s walls. As a member of the Gonzaga Purple Eagle football team, he encountered yet another angel in his life, a football coach named Joe Kozik, who stood by Gabe, along with his teammates. When-ever the Eagles played an opponent op-posed to integrated teams, Coach Kozik and his teammates always stuck to-gether like a family to overcome hate and ignorance. In June of 1954, the year of the Brown decision to end segregation in public schools across the Nation, Gabe com-pleted his education at Gonzaga Col-lege High School as the first African- American graduate. Poised with a thor-ough education, including a command of Latin, he entered Howard Univer-sity, where he choose to pursue a dif-ferent vocation and graduated with a degree in pharmacy. He became a phar-macist and worked for over 40 years, retiring just this past spring with Shopper’s Food Warehouse in Fort Washington, MD, where he spent most of his career. Gabe has been married to Mrs. Jea-nette Graves Smith for 50 years and has five children; his eldest, Pamela, passed away several years ago. Gabe is a proud Marylander and a proud resi-dent of Prince George’s County. He has long led his neighborhood association as president and served as an active member in good standing of the Mt. Ennon Baptist Church Men’s Ministry. Even though more than 60 years have passed since Gabe attended Gonzaga, he still comments, ‘‘I had angels who helped me through and they continue to be with me today.’’ To this day, Gabe sees his life as an example of the power of love in the pursuit of the greater good. Gabe’s life shows us that, despite dark times and dark moments, where there is light through our good deeds and good intentions, there is hope. John Gabriel Smith was the first of over 1,100 African-American students to graduate from Gonzaga College High School so far. He will leave an out-standing legacy for the State of Mary-land, the halls of Gonzaga, and for the United States as an example of what happens when we seek inclusion and love for humanity. He shows us that living by faith and love, everyone can succeed. I commend Gabe Smith for his leadership and life of service. ∑ ∑Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a Marylander, John Gabriel ‘‘Gabe’’ Smith, whose courage not only broke barriers for himself but whose courage advanced the cause of the betterment of human-ity. On October 14, he will be recognized at the Gonzaga High School home-coming by the Gonzaga Onyx, a group of African-American alumni of Gon-zaga, due to his achievement of being the very first African-American to graduate from Washington, DC’s Gon-zaga College Preparatory High School with the class of 1954. He was born in the turbulent times of the early 40s in St. Mary’s County, MD, where he and his two sisters grew up. His parents relied on hard work and diligence to pursue excellence and com-mitted their children to a Catholic education and religious fellowship at St. Peter Claver, a church with a pre-dominantly African-American parish in rural Ridge, MD. As an eighth grad-er, Gabe decided to serve as an altar boy; little did he know, it would change his life and place him in the an-nals of American history. He listened to Father McKenna de-scribe the ways that people had trav-eled to find God and become a priest. Interested in pursuing this vocation, he asked Father McKenna how he, too, could achieve it and was surprised when Father McKenna told him that he would, at a minimum, need to know Latin. Unfortunately, there were no schools in St. Mary’s or the surrounding areas that taught Latin, let alone the tools necessary to launch his vocation, so Father McKenna told him about a school in Washington, DC, where he could learn Latin and all the other req-uisites. That school was Gonzaga Col-lege High. Several years before the Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954 to end segregation, Archbishop O’Boyle ordered the integration of all Catholic schools and churches in the Arch-diocese of Washington. Thus, in 1951, he entered the halls of Gonzaga. Fortunately, during his time at Gon-zaga, his classmates stood with him in the face of adversity and strife when they walked outside the school walls. As a member of the Gonzaga Purple Eagle football team, he encountered additional support from Coach Joe Kozik who stood by him, along with his teammates. Whenever the Eagles would play an opponent that vehemently re-jected the idea of teams with African- American players, Coach Kozik and his teammates always stuck together like a family to overcome hate and igno-rance. In 1954, he completed his education at Gonzaga College High School as the first African-American graduate. Poised with his education and com-mand of Latin, he entered Howard Uni-versity and graduated with a degree in pharmacy, where he commanded his field for over 40 years, just retiring this past spring of 2017. He is now spending time with his wife and children. Gabe says that ‘‘he had angels who helped him through and they continue to be with him today.’’ He will forever leave an outstanding legacy for the State of Maryland and the halls of Gonzaga College High School. He was the first African American at Gonzaga, paving the way for over 1,100 esteemed African-American alumni to follow in his footsteps.∑

a Navy Commendation Medal for sav-ing the lives of 250 fellow marines at the Battle of Iwo Jima. After his mili-tary career, Fred opened his own pri-vate law practice and taught college- level classes at Colorado College and the University of Colorado. During a time when women rarely at-tended college, Amy received her B.A. in elementary education from National University and went on to receive her M.A. in reading education from North-western University. Prior to her mar-riage to Fred, Amy taught first and second grade. A two-time military widow, Amy lost her first husband, Bob Noran, as a result of injuries sustained during the Battle of the Bulge in WWII. Amy and Fred were married on April 14, 1951. A proud supporter of her hus-band’s career, Amy put aside her teach-ing career to be a full-time officer’s wife and mother to their daughter. Amy and Fred went on to live an in-credible life together, traveling, rais-ing their daughter, Susan, and volun-teering with many organizations. Fred passed away on December 27, 2011, and Amy went on to live near Susan in Mis-soula, MT, before passing away on No-vember 29, 2016. I send my condolences to the friends and family of Fred and Amy, as they are both greatly missed. They will be laid to rest together in Arlington National Cemetery. ∑

TRIBUTE TO BRADEN MATZINGER ∑Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this week I have the distinct honor of rec-ognizing a young Montanan named Braden Matzinger for his compas-sionate heart and entrepreneurial spir-it in helping our State recover from a devastating wildfire season. The 2017 wildfire season has impacted many communities in Montana. The fires consumed nearly 1.3 million acres of land. Over the summer, two fire-fighters lost their lives while pro-tecting the people of the Treasure State. The bravery and commitment demonstrated by all the folks involved with the firefighting effort has gen-erated a sense of unity and support from Troy to Alzada. That sense of unity can be found in the actions of 9- year-old Braden Matzinger of Bozeman. Braden has raised donations for the Montana Wildfire Relief Fund at the last two Montana State University home football games. He sweetened his approach to charitable fundraising with a cup of free lemonade for all those making a donation. At the two football games, he raised over $600 in donations. Sometimes life throws us lemons. How we respond is a reflection of our character. The Montana values of char-ity, compassion, and entrepreneurship are alive and well in the character of our next generation of youngsters, and Braden is a prime example. Thank you, Braden, for seeing an opportunity to help, making a plan, and following through with your plan. To Braden’s parents, Jeff and Katie, thank you as well for raising such a high-quality young man.∑ f 
75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 164TH REGIMENT LANDING ON GUA-DALCANAL ∑Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, 75 years ago, on October 13, 1942, the men of the 164th Infantry Regiment, North Dakota Army National Guard, landed on Gua-dalcanal to make history as the first U.S. Army unit to offensively engage the enemy in either theatre during World War II. The soldiers, supplies, and the rifles they carried were welcomed by the be-leaguered First Marine Division that had been fighting on the island since August. The prize was the strategic airfield captured by the marines and coveted by both Allies and the enemy as a key location to champion air and naval superiority in that area of the South Pacific. On Guadalcanal for only 12 days, the trained but untested soldiers were thrust into the second battle for Hen-derson Field on the night of October 24. The 3rd Battalion trudged up muddy slopes to fight shoulder to shoulder with Lt. Col. Chesty Puller’s marines as waves of Japanese threatened the thin line protecting the airfield. The next day, having proved its mettle, the 164th Infantry remained in charge of that line as the marines moved to an adjacent location. The Japanese at-tacked the 164th sector on the night of October 26, incorrectly believing the new Army troops could not hold the line. The 164th held firm at the loca-tion that became known as the Battle of Coffin Corner, earning the respect of the marines in the form of a Navy Presidential Unit Citation. The lineage of the 164th Infantry Regiment carries significant history as North Dakota National Guard infan-trymen were called to serve in the Spanish American War, the Philippine Insurrection, Mexican Border Incident, World War I, World War II, and the Ko-rean war. The regiment ceased to exist in 1955, its companies reorganized to engineer units, but the esprit de corps of the combat soldiers has remained in-tact. On the 75th anniversary, to the day, of the regiment’s landing at Guadal-canal, the 164th Infantry Association will hold its last annual reunion, end-ing a tradition that began in 1945. On Saturday, October 14, the 164th Asso-ciation will host a public event to rec-ognize the service and heritage of the unit that was so important to the his-tory of the North Dakota Army Na-tional Guard, the State of North Da-kota, and the United States of Amer-ica. Eight veterans of Guadalcanal will attend this event, ages 94 to 98, and they will represent all members of the regiment, living or remembered, as this important chapter of North Da-kota military history ends.∑ RECOGNIZING FIGARETTI’S RESTAURANT ∑Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Figaretti’s Restaurant in the scenic northern panhandle of my home State of West Virginia. Figaretti’s was recently named the best Italian restaurant in West Vir-ginia. In my home State, this honor means so much more than just good food. It is a testament to our State’s value of family, heritage, and tradi-tions. Some people may think our love of history means we cling to the past. It is the exact opposite. In an age where the future seems so uncertain, where we have access to more information and more choices than we know how to process, West Virginians know their priorities. What has stayed constant throughout history is our commitment to our loved ones, keeping our tradi-tions alive, and passing our knowledge of our diverse heritage on to the next generation. The future of West Virginia and the entire country is at the fore-front of our minds. These are the val-ues that have made West Virginia stand out in our Nation, and these val-ues are also present in the legacy of ex-cellence at Figaretti’s. In 1944, Sicilian immigrant, Anna Figaretti, started making spaghetti sauce for her neighbors while her hus-band, Giuseppe, worked in the local mine in Clarksburg. Soon, with support and encouragement from her commu-nity and help from her five sons, Anna’s spaghetti sauce became avail-able in local grocery stores and eventu-ally in her own restaurant. Today the restaurant is owned by the third generation of the family. It is my honor to congratulate Dino Figaretti, his wife, Michelle, and his son, Enzio, for this special recognition. Gayle and I have enjoyed the company of the Figaretti family at the beloved Wheel-ing location and have shared many great meals and conversations with Tony, Sr., and Tony, Jr. I value their friendship so very much. Owning a business is one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences, and doing it as a family makes it all the more special. It is my honor to recognize and cele-brate the Figaretti family and the Wheeling community for this well-de-served honor.∑

Ermalee was married to Wally Hickel for 65 years until his death in 2010. She is buried next to her husband in Anchorage Me-morial Park, standing up, facing Wash-ington, just as Governor Hickel was. This is the way the power couple of post-Statehood Alaska desired to be re-membered. Standing up for Alaskans to

Washington, DC. A powerful symbol not only to Alaskans, but Washington, that the battle for Alaska’s sov-ereignty is far from over and that the Hickels, in spirit, stand with Alaskans as we wage this battle to conclusion, however long that may take. Wally and Ermalee’s son, Jack Hickel, remembers these words ex-plaining why his father wanted to be buried standing up. ‘‘He said, if they don’t do it right he’s going to crawl out of his grave and straighten them out. He thought they were going to screw everything up. He wanted to keep his eye on them.’’ Now there will be two pair of eyes gazing east. Ermalee, I should warn you, has two pretty tough eyes. She was widely known as ‘‘more beautiful than a but-terfly, but tougher than a boot.’’ The history books will mention that Ermalee was twice the first lady of Alaska, as well as the wife of a Sec-retary of the Interior. They might mention that she was a strong woman, but that really doesn’t tell you much about the person, and there is really much more to the story. Ermalee was born to Lewis and Aline Strutz. The Strutzes moved from Mon-tana to Anchorage in 1924. They bought a house downtown and raised six kids in that house: four girls and two boys. Anchorage was a pretty small town in the day, but it had plenty of life. As a high school student, Ermalee did it all. She was a softball player, editor of the school paper, and quite popular. She never missed a dance. She ushered at the movie theatre and, unique to An-chorage, worked at a cannery. Upon graduation, she went to work on the local base as the secretary to a mili-tary officer, a very important job for an outstanding individual. The Strutz girls were like that—popular, success-ful, from a really good family. Wally Hickel, on the other hand, ar-rived in Anchorage from Kansas in 1940 with all of 37 cents in his pocket. His family was in insurance, but he left Kansas to pursue his passion in boxing. That led him to California, and when it didn’t work out, Wally booked a ticket in steerage on a vessel headed to Alas-ka. He replenished his bank account by winning a $125 purse at a boxing tour-nament conducted during Fur Rondy, the Anchorage winter carnival. Wally married a local girl, Jannice Cannon, who went to school with Ermalee. Wally and Jannice had a son, Ted. Jannice tragically died in 1943 at the Mayo Clinic. Wally returned to An-chorage, a single dad, and took a job inspecting aircraft on the ramp of Alaska airbases. In 1945, Ermalee and Wally were mar-ried in a small Catholic Church and went on to build a family. It was a tough time for the both of them. Wally still had to pay off Jannice’s medical bills and worked a second job as a bar-tender and a bouncer to make ends meet. Wally subsequently quit his job on base and told Ermalee that he figured it out. Anchorage was growing and con-struction was its future. Turns out, he was right. The family found stability and a modicum of wealth. That gave Wally the freedom to pursue his inter-est in politics. Over time, Wally’s in-vestments in Anchorage’s growth pro-vided a strong financial foundation for the family. Throughout it all, Ermalee was a steadfast partner—managing the house, putting chains on the tires of the car to take the kids skiing, even ironing the pants of her hero, Charles Lindbergh, when he came to Juneau to address the Alaska Legislature. Lind-bergh asked Ermalee if she would get ‘‘the help’’ to press his pants. Turns out Ermalee was ‘‘the help.’’ ‘‘Ermalee was calm, empathetic and insightful. Wally turned to her and fol-lowed her counsel. She guided and pro-tected him, out of sight,’’ wrote An-chorage author and historian Charles Wohlforth. She read to schoolchildren and visited with elders in the Pioneer’s Homes. She visited the soup kitchens and the juvenile detention facilities. She fought for benefits for the disabled, raised awareness of fetal alcohol syn-drome, and sought to protect seniors from scammers. She did it all without ever seeking credit. Ermalee was al-ways gracious and lovely to me. Wohlforth headlined his column re-membering Ermalee Hickel’s legacy with the words ‘‘Ermalee Hickel led Alaska, too.’’ She did with dignity and grace from the beginning to the very end. It is an honor and a pleasure to share this story of an Alaskan life well lived with the Senate today. ∑

RECOGNIZING THE CAROLINA YOUTH DEVELOPMENT CENTER’S NEW PARTNERSHIP ∑Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I would like to recognize and congratulate the Carolina Youth Development Center, Cummins, Inc., and the Hootie and the Blowfish Foundation on its new part-nership to provide youth aging out of foster care an independent living tran-sitional house. The Carolina Youth De-velopment Center has been a blessing to our State for over 200 years with their bold mission. They work tire-lessly to empower and equip South Carolina’s most vulnerable children by providing a safe environment, edu-cational support, and career readiness. Carolina Youth Development Center has an impressive 227-year history of serving the community’s most vulner-able children and families, dating back to its founding as the Charleston Or-phan House in 1790. The agency re-mains steadfast in its commitment to youth in foster care and continues to lead the way, changing lives and trans-forming communities.∑

TRIBUTE TO BILL JOHNSTONE ∑Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor a man who has done so much for Montana. Bill Johnstone, a native Montanan, graduate of Montana State University, and retiring chair-man of D.A. Davidson, has dedicated his life to improving Montana. His work at D.A. Davidson has helped countless Montanans financially pre-pare for the future. Whether it is help-ing Montana families plan for retire-ment, small business owners strategize about the future, or municipalities meet their financial needs, Bill has been there for them, but Bill’s good work expanded beyond the private sec-tor. While running a thriving company that employs more than 1,300 employ-ees, hundreds of them Montanans, Bill has always invested his time and re-sources in Montana. He serves as a member of the board of regents to the Montana University system and has spent years improving schools across Montana. Bill has also served on the Inter-national Heart Institute in Missoula and as the chairman of the Great Falls Public Schools Foundation, helping to raise funds for our public schools. His dedication to his company, his family, and his community makes Bill a model Montanan. Helping move Montana forward is a common theme in Bill’s family, his fa-ther, William A. Johnstone, served the education community for nearly 30 years and retired as acting president of Montana State University. It is clear Bill has instilled hard work and public service in his children as well. His son Anthony is an associate professor of law at the University of Montana and former solicitor general of the State of Montana and his son Jesse is the founder and president of a digital mar-keting agency in New York. As Bill retires, his legacy at D.A. Da-vidson will live on and his lasting im-pact on Montana as a whole will con-tinue to grow. Thanks for the 17 years at D.A. Davidson, Bill, and for your service to Montana. I wish you, your wife, Andrea, and your kids Anthony and Jesse nothing but the best in re-tirement.∑ f

During her 6-year tenure, CRMC has been a nationally recognized leader in ocean and coastal management. One of the shining jewels of CRMC’s work has been its innovative Special Area Man-agement Plans, or SAMPs.

groundbreaking ocean SAMP, the first formally adopted ocean spatial plan in the country, pay real-life dividends. In developing this plan, CRMC engaged a diverse group of stakeholders and laid the groundwork for cooperation among a multitude of regulatory agencies. This effort and CRMC’s continued en-gagement in the process paved the way for the successful development of the Nation’s first offshore wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island. The CRMC has also helped Rhode Is-land towns and residents understand the increasing effects of sea level rise and storm surge. Using the latest cli-mate change predictions and state-of- the-art modeling, CRMC, in coopera-tion with the University of Rhode Is-land and others, developed an online tool, STORMTOOLS, that gives anyone with an internet connection free access to information that can be used to help decide everything from what neighbor-hood to buy a home in to where to site a new stormwater treatment plant. CRMC is now developing a coastal en-vironmental risk index that can show Rhode Island homeowners individual-ized flood risks in 3–D. In addition to her service on the CRMC, Mrs. Livingston has served Rhode Islanders as a board member of the Jamestown Tax Assessment Board of Review and on the board of the Girl Scouts of Rhode Island and the James-town Education Foundation. She also continues to serve as treasurer for the Opera House Theater & Performing Arts Center in Newport and on the ad-visory boards of the Dorcas Inter-national Institute of Rhode Island and the Providence Children’s Museum. Mrs. Livingston is a passionate and committed leader, and I am grateful for her many years of service to our State’s CRMC.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. F
RANKEN ): S. 1927. A bill to amend section 455(m) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 in order to allow adjunct faculty members to qualify for public service loan forgiveness; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-sions. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I reintroduced the Adjunct Faculty Loan Fairness Act, a bill that would enable faculty working less than full-time to participate in the Public Service Stu-dent Loan Forgiveness Program. Contingent faculty members are like full-time instructors. They have ad-vanced degrees. They teach classes and spend many hours outside the class-room preparing for class. They hold of-fice hours, grade papers, and give feed-back to students. They provide advice and write letters of recommendation. Students rely on them. Since most ad-juncts have advanced degrees and, as the 63 percent of graduate degree re-cipients who borrow have an average of almost $59,000 in student loans, they are among the 44 million Americans with student debt.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6362 October 5, 2017 
The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is meant to encourage grad-uates to go into public service by offer-ing student loan forgiveness for eligi-ble Federal loans after ten years of full-time work in government or the non-profit sector. Public service fields like nursing, military service, and pub-lic health qualify. And many education jobs qualify, including full-time work at public universities and part-time work at community colleges in high- needs subject areas or areas of short-age. But other faculty members, those who work part-time, are not eligible for loan forgiveness because the law re-quires an annual average of 30 hours per week to qualify for the program. For adjunct faculty working on a con-tingent basis—many of whom may only teach one or two classes while holding down other part-time jobs to make ends meet—this requirement can be difficult or impossible to meet, even when they are putting in more than 30 hours of work each week. The number of faculty hours given for each class is calculated differently at different schools. Some schools give one hour per hour in the classroom while others actually take into consid-eration the time required outside the classroom. So, even as these faculty members are working hard to provide quality instruction for their students, often without the option of moving into a tenured, full-time position, their public service is not recognized by the current Public Service Loan Forgive-ness program. The Adjunct Faculty Loan Fairness Act of 2017 would solve this by amend-ing the Higher Education Act to ex-pand the definition of a ‘‘public service job’’ to include a part-time faculty member who teaches at least one course at an eligible institution of higher education. They would still have to meet all the other require-ments to qualify for the public service loan forgiveness program, including making 120 on-time payments while employed at a qualifying institution, and they could not be employed full- time elsewhere at the same time. I be-lieve it corrects a major flaw in the current system and rewards individuals for their contribution to public service rather than penalize them for the num-ber of hours they work. This bill would benefit someone like Brittany, an adjunct professor in southern Illinois. Brittany finished her graduate degree in 2013 and still has over $70,000 in student loan debt today. This debt has prevented her from at-tending law school, her longtime dream, and makes it challenging to put money aside for her retirement. This debt is also putting her children’s fu-ture at risk—Brittany will still be pay-ing off her own loans when it is time for her now four-month old child to at-tend college. This bill would ensure that Brittany, and thousands like her, could secure their family’s financial fu-ture by earning credit towards the Public Service Loan Forgiveness for loan payments made while teaching, regardless of the fact that she isn’t full-time faculty. Unfortunately, for all their contribu-tions to their colleges and the students they work with, adjunct faculty like Brittany often don’t have the same em-ployment benefits or job security as their colleagues. The number of classes they teach every semester varies. To make ends meet, these professors often end up teaching classes at more than one school in the same semester, get-ting paid about $3,000 per class and making an average annual income that hovers around minimum wage. This also means that, in some parts of the country, they spend as much time com-muting as they do teaching. Nationally, over half of all higher education faculty work on a contingent basis. In the past, these were a minor-ity of professors who were hired to teach an occasional class because they could bring experience to the class-room in a specific field or industry. Over time, as university budgets have tightened and it has gotten more ex-pensive to hire full-time, tenure track professors, higher education institu-tions have increasingly relied on ad-juncts. From 1991 to 2015, the number of part-time faculty in the U.S. increased two and a half times from 291,000 to over 743,000. At the same time, the per-centage of professors holding tenure and tenure-track positions has been steadily decreasing from 45 percent of all instructors in 1975 to only 29 per-cent in 2015. The number of full-time instructors, tenured and non-tenured, now makes up less than half of all pro-fessors on U.S. campuses. Today, a ma-jority of the 1.5 million faculty em-ployees at public and non-profit col-leges and universities in the United States work on a part-time, contingent basis. Illinois colleges rely heavily on ad-juncts. In 2015, 52 percent of all faculty at all Title IV degree-granting institu-tions in the state—more than 31,700 faculty employees—worked on a part- time basis. This is a 32.4 percent in-crease in part-time faculty in Illinois compared to a 7 percent increase in full-time faculty since 2002. This bill does not fix the growing re-liance by our higher education system on part-time professors who are under-paid and undervalued. But it would en-sure that members of the contingent faculty workforce are no longer un-fairly excluded from the loan forgive-ness program for public servants. I would like to thank my colleague, Sen-ator A
LFRANKEN from Minnesota, for joining me in this effort. I hope my other colleagues will join us to ensure this program benefits faculty members who provide our students with a qual-ity education. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent that the text of the bill be printed in the R
ECORD . There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows: S. 1927 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

Section 455(m)(3)(B)(ii) of the Higher Edu-cation Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087e(m)(3)(B)(ii)) is amended— (1) by striking ‘‘teaching as’’ and inserting the following: ‘‘teaching— ‘‘(I) as’’; (2) by striking ‘‘, foreign language faculty, and part-time faculty at community col-leges), as determined by the Secretary.’’ and inserting ‘‘and foreign language faculty), as determined by the Secretary; or’’; and (3) by adding at the end the following: ‘‘(II) as a part-time faculty member or in-structor who— ‘‘(aa) teaches not less than 1 course at an institution of higher education (as defined in section 101(a)), a postsecondary vocational institution (as defined in section 102(c)), or a Tribal College or University (as defined in section 316(b)); and ‘‘(bb) is not employed on a full-time basis by any other employer.’’. 
By Mr. FLAKE: S. 1937. A bill to authorize appropria-tions for border infrastructure con-struction, to provide conditional resi-dent status to certain aliens, and to amend the Immigration and Nation-ality Act to include grounds of inad-missibility and deportability for alien members of criminal gangs and cartels, and for other purposes; to the Com-mittee on the Judiciary. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Border Security and Deferred Action Recipient Relief Act, which I am introducing. This bill offers solutions to the seri-ous problems facing us with regard to border security, while at the same time addressing the needs for a legislative solution for those issues faced by the children who were brought here through no fault of their own. With respect to the border, this bill provides $1.6 billion in funding for bor-der security measures that the Presi-dent requested and the House has al-ready approved in a bipartisan vote. As an Arizonan, I am more than familiar with the steps we need to take to in-crease border security. We have a bet-ter situation on the border than we have had in a while, but there are still measures that need to be taken. In addition to the appropriate bar-riers that will aid in preventing illegal crossings, we need access roads that ac-tually get to the border. If there is one issue I hear from property owners, ranchers, Border Patrol agents, and others near the border, it is that they need better access. We have had an issue with regard to roads that are used by the Border Control that are paid for by the county. It is a situation that needs to be resolved, and it will benefit all of us who travel near the border. This bill addresses that. The road issue was also raised by the GAO. I requested a study on behalf of my constituents,

along with my colleagues, to see what we could do with the roads and access situation. GAO came back with rec-ommendations, and this would imple-ment some of the recommendations. The bill also aids law enforcement by ensuring the swift deportation of indi-viduals determined to be members of violent gangs and drug cartels. I would also like to thank Congress-woman B
ARBARA COMSTOCK for her leadership on this issue by sponsoring the Criminal Alien Gang Member Re-moval Act, which passed the House. With respect to the children brought here through no fault of their own, this bill takes a measure that has already earned bipartisan support in the House of Representatives, the Recognizing America’s Children Act, which provides a solution for the DACA kids. These young immigrants were brought here as children and simply know no other country. For all intents and purposes, these young people consider themselves Americans. If we can protect these DACA recipients and provide solutions to better secure our borders at the same time, that is a win-win. The President and Congress both want to improve border security. We both want to respond to the threat of dangerous gangs and drug cartels. We both want to arrive at a legislative so-lution for the rescission of the DACA Program that benefits those who want to contribute to their communities and to the American dream. This bill is the best way to thread the needle and de-liver what the President has asked for, what the Congress wants, and what my constituents in Arizona deserve. These issues are far too important for us to delay. To be clear, I will work with anyone to support any number of proposals that accomplish these goals, but I be-lieve that the straightforward ap-proach of the Border Security and De-ferred Action Recipient Relief Act, which I am introducing today, is the best chance we have to put this bill on the President’s desk. 
By Ms. HEITKAMP (for herself, Mr. T
ESTER , Mr. F RANKEN , Mr. H
EINRICH , Mr. M ERKLEY , and Ms. W
ARREN ): S. 1942. A bill to direct the Attorney General to review, revise, and develop law enforcement and justice protocols appropriate to address missing and murdered Indians, and for other pur-poses; to the Committee on Indian Af-fairs. Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss and bring awareness to the obligation that we have to never forget what is happening to way too many Native American women in this country. For too long, the disproportionate in-cidents of violence against Native American women have gone unnoticed, unreported, or underreported, and it is time to address this issue head-on. That is what I intend to do today and in the remaining days of my time in the Senate, until we actually get a bill passed. There is no official database or re-quirement for information collection regarding the number of missing and murdered Native women. In most cases, the only records of them are records that have been provided to us by the families and friends of the vic-tims. It is critical that Congress push the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI to work with Tribal communities to come up with culturally appropriate protocols for responding to cases of missing and murdered Native women. I would like to take this time to honor Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind, whose story has been told on the news in North Dakota and nationally and who has been on the forefront of my mind since introducing this bill. On August 19, Savanna, a 22-year-old member of the Spirit Lake Tribe, who was 8 months pregnant, went upstairs to her neighbor’s apartment in Fargo, ND, after being invited to try on a dress for alterations. While she was there, what awaited her in that apart-ment were truly horrific acts of vio-lence. Although Savanna’s baby daugh-ter survived and is now safe with her father and grandparents, that was the last time anyone who loved Savanna saw her alive. After 8 days of searching for Savanna by the family and the community, her body was finally found by chance by kayakers in a nearby river. Her body was wrapped in plastic and duct taped. Her death was an incredible tragedy and, unfortunately, one that happens way too often to Native women. While the news of Savanna’s death was heard around the world, thousands of indigenous women are murdered and disappear each year, with many of those cases being ignored or forgotten. Over my decades in public service, I have worked with Tribal communities on issues that involve violence against Native women. In response to those talks and to this latest tragedy, today I am introducing legislation that would help tackle the barriers to bringing justice for missing and murdered Na-tive women across the country. My bill, which is named after Sa-vanna, would work to improve Tribal access to Federal databases for missing persons. It would promote interjuris-dictional collaboration by establishing protocols for responding to cases of missing and murdered Native Ameri-cans, and it would require the collec-tion of data related to missing and murdered Native women. Native women are an inherently vul-nerable population whose voices are still not heard by most people in power. Across rural North Dakota, women living on reservations face unique challenges when dealing with violence. Lack of access to emergency services, lack of access to law enforce-ment officers, lack of access to an AMBER Alert system, and confidential victim services that are not provided— these all act as barriers to women get-ting the help that they desperately need. Unfortunately, there is no official database or mandated database collec-tion on the total number of missing and murdered Native women in our country. This has added to not know-ing what the actual magnitude of this epidemic really is and has resulted in several Tribal members sending me stories and handwritten lists of the names of missing and murdered women that people have gathered just from their collective memory. I would like to share some of the sto-ries that I have been so honored to re-ceive from family members. Telling these stories—and giving me the abil-ity to tell these stories—is not easy be-cause every time you tell the story, you relive the story. These tragedies still hurt deeply. Even years after the murder, they still absolutely relive that experience. I know they have given me these stories to tell for one simple reason: because they pray and they hope and they dream that giving me these stories may change the out-come for some other family. I am going to start by talking about these wonderful women—these beau-tiful women. Up at the far right-hand corner with her beautiful baby is Stella Marie Trottier-Graves. Stella Marie was born and grew up in Belcourt, ND, and was a member of the Turtle Moun-tain Band of Chippewa. She spent many years traveling the world with her hus-band, who served in the U.S. Air Force, and their three children. The family lived in Florida, Germany, Japan, and Arizona. Everywhere they went, Stella quickly made friends and proudly shared her Chippewa culture. She was loved and adored by all who met her for living an adventurous and fearless life. In July 2009, Stella and her family moved back to Belcourt, ND, and she started to attend Turtle Mountain Community College. On September 16, 2010, Stella and her cousin were at the local bar when she decided to stay be-hind with other people they knew. Ac-cording to witnesses, Stella left with another couple to continue the evening out. Stella’s body was later found in a male Tribal member’s pickup in an open field on the reservation. It wasn’t until 13 days later that the family was officially notified by law enforcement of Stella’s death. Throughout the investigation, there were a lot of rumors and misinforma-tion, which made it difficult to find the murderer or the murderers. People who were with Stella the night of her death said that they were never questioned, and information provided was never followed up on. No one has ever been charged or convicted for this murder, and the last hours of Stella’s life re-main unknown. Stella was an incredible woman who was loved by all who knew her. Her family, her children, and her Tribe de-serve justice. Monica Wickre is pictured here with those beautiful earrings and the red

shirt. Monica was a 42-year-old mother of three who was born and raised in Belcourt on the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa reservation and lived near Aberdeen, SD. After a night out with friends on April 7, 1993, Monica never returned home. Her relatives grew concerned when they had not heard from or seen Monica for several days. Eventually, the family filed a missing persons re-port and started to talk to friends and neighbors. The detective assigned to the case worked closely with the com-munity and the family and assured them he was working diligently on this case. In June of that year, a canoeist found Monica’s badly decomposed body in the James River outside Aberdeen. Throughout the next several years, new detectives were assigned to the case, each having to basically start over and work with limited notes, interviews, and evidence from the pre-vious investigators. A couple of times, the police told the family that they had a suspect or were close to arresting someone for Monica’s murder, but there was never enough information to charge the suspect. This has resulted in nearly 25 years of heartache for Monica’s family and her friends. Monica’s family wants justice for their daughter, sister, and mother, and they all want closure. Although the case is no longer active, the family continues to bring awareness about Monica’s case in the hope that someone will come forward with information that will, in fact, help solve it. Monica Lisa Two Eagle is the woman with the dark hair in the floral print shirt. She was a member of the Rose-bud Sioux Tribe and one of 14 children. She was kind, caring, and athletic. In the winter of 1979, Phil Two Eagle saw his sister Mona Lisa, who was in her early twenties, leave the siblings’ house and get into a red-and-white pickup with a couple of men. Mona Lisa never returned. In the following days, the family and local law enforcement searched for her on horseback. Taking it upon them-selves, they searched for her on horse-back. About 2 weeks after she went missing, Mona Lisa’s father and broth-er found her frozen in a pasture near their home. She had been beaten, pos-sibly raped, and left alone in a blizzard. Rumors ran wild that family and law enforcement tried to solve the crime, but, even to this day, no one was ever convicted or even charged. The two men who were last seen with Mona Lisa all those years ago are still run-ning free, while the family lives every day with the lack of justice. Lakota Rae Renville, the woman in the black-and-white photo, is the last victim I want to talk about. I want to thank her family, who are here today and who have honored me and trusted me with her memory. I want to help them understand how grateful I am, but I also want them to know that sharing her story will help raise aware-ness about the crimes of missing and murdered indigenous people. Lakota was a member of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Dakota Bands of North and South Dakota, who, despite being shy and reserved, had a solid group of friends who supported her and even helped her excel in school. After graduation, Lakota spent time taking care of her family, especially her nieces and nephews. In 2005 Lakota met a man online and unexpectedly relocated to Missouri, unbeknownst to her family. With most details still unknown 12 years later, the family is left with more questions than answers. What they do know is that she was forced into sex trafficking and manipulated against her will. In October of 2005, Lakota’s family was called and told that her body was found badly beaten, wrapped in carpet padding and a blanket in an open grav-el pit in Missouri. Local investigators brought in and subsequently let go doz-ens of suspects and, to this day, have not brought her murderer to justice. Lakota was never given a chance to become a mother or pursue that bright future that surely lay ahead of her. She was robbed of a life she had yet to ex-perience, a life that was certain to be filled with love from her family and deep appreciation from her family. These are not isolated cases. This goes on every day in America. I want to make a point of how dis-couraging it, so many times, when you see events unfolding where it may be that a young girl goes missing in a Car-ibbean island and the world is turned upside down looking for her or when we hear a story of someone who comes from maybe a more affluent and wealthy family who goes missing and we turn over every stone to find them. Yet that is not the story for very many indigenous women. When you look at the importance of what we do today, probably the most important thing we can do is to tell these stories, and from telling these stories we have an opportunity to real-ly change. We can’t ignore that fre-quently for Native people, they are not wrong to believe that they are the for-gotten people of this country. Way too often, the first Americans become the last Americans. Under the Savanna’s Act, the Attor-ney General, in cooperation with the Secretary of the Interior, must consult with the Tribes on how to improve Tribal access to Federal criminal infor-mation databases, such as the National Crime Information Center and the Na-tional Missing and Unidentified Per-sons System. We need to ensure that Tribal law enforcement has up-to-date information on missing Native women and better communication—in fact, es-sential—with Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies and Tribal law enforcement agencies so cases like the ones you have heard of today don’t go unnoticed or uninvestigated. Jurisdictional issues are a huge bar-rier in Indian Country to responding to and prosecuting crimes committed on Tribal lands. Standardized protocols must be established in order to give a quicker response to Native women going missing. The complexity of juris-diction on Tribal lands can slow down an investigation, but it is not an ex-cuse. It can waste crucial time at the beginning of an investigation or a case, but it is not an excuse. If we do not act rapidly, we know we lose precious time to prevent homicides and to bring a woman safely home and help apprehend the perpetrators. In one case study alone done by the National Institute of Justice, 97 per-cent of Native women experience vio-lence by a non-Native perpetrator. This number emphasizes what I have long said, that historical trauma is a major factor of violence against Native women, and perpetrators feel that Tribal lands give them a free pass from the law. This can no longer be toler-ated, and jurisdictional issues must be addressed. It cannot be the excuse for inaction. Although we don’t know the total number of missing and murdered Na-tive women, it is clear, from all of the stories and from the statistics that we do have, that the rates at which Native American women experience violence is intrinsically related to the likeli-hood of their going missing, being mur-dered, and forced into sex trafficking. Here are just some of the statistics collected by the National Institute of Justice, the Government Account-ability Office, and the Centers for Dis-ease Control and Prevention regarding violence against Native women. In 2016, 5,712 cases of missing Native women were reported to the National Crime Information Center, and 125 of those cases were in my State of Dakota alone. On some reservations, Native women are murdered at more than 10 times the national average. I want to repeat that. On some reservations, Na-tive women are murdered at more than 10 times the national average. American Indians and Alaskan Na-tives are two times more likely to ex-perience rape or sexual assault com-pared to all other races. In 2010, we found that the U.S. attor-neys declined to prosecute nearly 52 percent of violent crime that occurred in Indian Country. Homicide is the third leading cause of death among American Indians and Alaskan Native women between 10 and 24 years old. These high rates of violence, includ-ing domestic violence, sex assault, and human trafficking, must stop. We must work together to combat domestic vio-lence and human trafficking in Indian Country. Just last week, the Indian Affairs Committee held a hearing to discuss the lack of services provided for Indian Country regarding the horrific acts of violence and human trafficking of Na-tive women. Just yesterday, while questioning one of the officials at the Department of the Interior about the need to do training in human traf-ficking at our casinos, he simply said:

I thought you were going to ask me about Indian gaming. I quickly said: I am asking you about Indian gaming be-cause all of this works together. If we do not work together in every institution of the Federal Government, in every institution of the State gov-ernment, and in every institution of Tribal government, we will never make progress in providing the security that we have in this building, and the secu-rity that we enjoy as White women will never be realized for women living on the reservation in Indian Country. We cannot let this continue. There are countless more stories like Savanna’s, Stella’s, Mona Lisa’s, Monica’s, and Lakota’s that we will never know. It is time for Congress to recognize this epidemic and take ac-tion to prevent these stories and find out just how many stories there really are. It is time to give voice to these voiceless women. It is time to bring their perpetrators to justice and give a voice to the families who are strug-gling even today—sometimes decades later—to understand how this can hap-pen in America. They seem to be sec-ond-class citizens. I think that is what we know. I am working with very many of my col-leagues on the other side. This isn’t a partisan issue. I have been joined by my wonderful colleague from the great State of Alas-ka. I think the first time we ever met, this was the topic of conversation: What is the security for Indian chil-dren, security for Indian women, and Alaskan Native women? We knew be-cause both of us have traveled exten-sively in our States and spent a lot of time in the indigenous populations. When family members ask us why this is happening, we frequently don’t have an answer. I know that in my State jurisdic-tional issues provide some barriers to actually getting this done, but that is an excuse. We need to do better. With that, I want to yield the floor to my wonderful colleague from the great State of Alaska, who once again is joining me and leading her side of the aisle to bring attention to these issues. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I want to acknowledge and thank the Senator from North Dakota. She has been a champion for the Native people, the indigenous people around the coun-try, including in my State of Alaska. Whether it is working to address the issues related to childhood trauma, which so many of our young Native children face, or the issues relating to domestic violence, sexual assault, and human trafficking—these are scourges that we see directed, unfortunately, at so many of our Native women in the State of Alaska, in the State of North Dakota, and around the country. She has cited the statistics. I think sometimes we just get numb by the statistics. When you are told that you are four times the national average, that sounds bad. But what does that mean? When you put a face to it, when you hear the tragedy repeated through the stories, these are not just statistics that we are speaking of. These are real women. These are our sisters. These are our neighbors. These are our friends, and these are human beings who deserve to be respected in their lives but also respected in other tragic deaths. How we work to address these difficult issues needs to be a focus and a priority for us. So I appreciate what the Senator from North Dakota is doing in bringing attention to our Nation’s lackluster— and that is kind of a polite term here— response to the tragedy of missing and murdered Native women and girls. I am proud to lend my voice to the proposition that Congress, in the exer-cise of our trust responsibility to our Native peoples, has a responsibility to do more. You would think that that trust responsibility demands us to be paying even closer attention, and yet it seems that we just withdraw from that, that that responsibility is not acknowledged. Now, it is not often here in the United States that we benchmark our treatment of indigenous peoples against Canada, but in this case, there is actually a compelling difference be-tween Canada’s national response to the tragedy of missing and murdered Native women and our seeming indif-ference here in the United States. Down in southeastern Alaska, right across on the Canadian side, lies a town called Prince Rupert. It is in British Columbia. The Alaskan ferry comes in from Washington State and stops in Prince Rupert and then moves into Alaska. Prince Rupert is also the terminus of Highway 16, and the locals refer to Highway 16 as the ‘‘Highway of Tears.’’ They refer to it as the ‘‘High-way of Tears’’ because it is a road on which Native women and girls have vanished for decades now. The question is, How many? Who is disappearing? Some would say as few as 12 and per-haps as many as 43. CBS News devoted a segment of its news magazine show ‘‘48 Hours’’ to the Highway of Tears. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau committed 54 million Cana-dian dollars to a national inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women and girls. I will admit that there is some controversy over whether the national inquiry is actually ful-filling its mission, but my point here is that Canada stepped up. They have ac-knowledged that this is an issue, that this is a problem, and they have re-sponded to the disproportionate vic-timization of Native women and girls, and they have done so in a tangible way. Here in the United States, as my friend and colleague has noted, we are more than a bit late in acknowledging that the problem even exists. Earlier this year, the Senators from Montana—both Senator D
AINES and Senator T
ESTER —were successful in designating May 5, 2017, through a reso-lution, as the National Day of Aware-ness on Missing and Murdered Native Women and Girls. The resolution re-cites that some Tribal communities face murder rates that are 10 times the national average, as Senator HEITKAMP  has noted. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, homi-cide was the third leading cause of death among Native women between the ages of 10 and 24 years and the fifth leading cause of death for Alaska Na-tive women between 25 and 34 years of age. So we are trying to raise attention and awareness. We are trying to shine a spotlight on this issue. I certainly think it is high time that Federal law enforcement answer the question, Why? Why is the murder rate for Native women so high, and why are we not addressing it in a comprehen-sive fashion? The Senator from North Dakota has pointed out that in many areas, jurisdictional issues are at play, and I agree. That is not an excuse. We acknowledge that we have challenges with jurisdictions. Let’s figure this out. Women are disappearing and dying. In Alaska, it is not so much jurisdic-tional issues; it is the fact that in far too many of our communities, we lack any law enforcement presence. We might have a VPSO—a village safety police officer—but they are not armed. They are very limited in terms of their ability to provide for levels of enforce-ment. More frustrating than so much of that is that women who have been victimized feel as though reporting doesn’t get them anywhere because there is no follow-through. There is no prosecution. There has been no effort that will allow them to have any level of recourse, much less justice, visited upon them. As we talk about these issues of ju-risdiction and law enforcement and the rates that we see, I think we need to be clear that the discussion today—the call for justice—is not driven by statis-tics and rates. It is driven by their faces. It is driven by the loss of peo-ple’s daughters, people’s siblings, peo-ple’s friends, including Savannah and Stella and Nicole and Mona Lisa. These are all real people, real women with names, with faces, with families. In Alaska, the face we so often asso-ciate with the lack of progress when it comes to addressing the issue of miss-ing and murdered Native women is the face of Sophie Sergie. This year marks the 24th anniversary of the death of Sophie Sergie from Pitkas Point. This is a Yup’ik village in southwest Alas-ka. On August 26 of 1993, Sophie was found dead in the women’s bathroom dorm on the University of Alaska Fair-banks campus. She was raped. She was shot dead. It is believed that her body remained in that bathroom for some 13 hours before it was found. The murder weapon was never recovered. That case is still a cold case 24 years later. But we don’t forget Sophie Sergie, just as

we don’t forget the women the Senator from North Dakota has shared stories about. We cannot forget these women. Unlike the tragedies along the High-way of Tears, we really don’t know how many Native women and girls have gone missing and murdered. That is a big part of the problem. But I will tell my colleagues that if you ask advo-cates for Native women, the answer comes back: It is no secret. We all know somebody. We all know some-body who has gone missing, somebody who has been murdered. That was the testimony of Tammy Jerue. She is the executive director for the Alaska Native Women’s Resource Center, and she testified before a con-gressional briefing last February. Tammy told the briefing that her orga-nization has documented as many as 50 names of women. When we think about it, numbers on that order were signifi-cant enough for Prime Minister Trudeau to commission a national in-quiry. So it causes us to ask the ques-tion, What about us? What number do we have to get to before there is a call to action, before we wake up and say: This is not acceptable. This is not ac-ceptable that our Native women are disappearing, are being murdered. Native women are asking why Fed-eral law enforcement has no protocol for addressing the crisis in our Indian Country, why there is a lack of coordi-nation among criminal justice agencies in this country to set aside the juris-dictional challenges and investigate these tragedies in an effective manner, and why there is a lack of victim serv-ices. In the Indian Affairs Committee, we had a hearing on human trafficking, sex trafficking. It was pretty revealing about the lack of victim services—spe-cific—that could be there to help our Native victims. Right now, the families of missing and murdered Native women in Alaska have to cover the cost of a traditional burial. They have to cover the cost of immediate long-term coun-seling, and so many other expenses they can’t afford. We maintain a vic-tims of crime fund here in this country to address these sorts of costs, but there is no dedicated Tribal funding stream. We have had some pretty bi-partisan efforts here in the Senate to establish one, but we haven’t even been able to do that bare minimum to pro-vide for the victims. The issue we are discussing today is tragic and frustrating. It is depressing. But to remain silent is to truly further marginalize Native women and girls, and that is unacceptable. Perhaps we are not going to devote tens of millions of dollars to a national inquiry; How-ever, it is high time that we acknowl-edge a problem that has failed to make headlines in this country, because you first have to acknowledge that a prob-lem exists to make headway in address-ing that problem. So, again, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for her strong and stead-fast advocacy on behalf of not only our Native women but our Native children, our indigenous peoples across this country. I appreciate all that is being done, and I look forward to working with her again as we try to shine a brighter light on a very tragic situa-tion.

UBIO) submitted the following resolu-tion; which was referred to the Com-mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. R ES. 286 Whereas access to quality education re-duces poverty, advances economic pros-perity, improves peace and security, and strengthens public health; Whereas the 2016 Global Education Moni-toring (GEM) Report, the globally recognized annual accountability tool on the status of education internationally, found that an es-timated 263,000,000 children and youth are out of school worldwide, with girls still more likely to be out of school than their male peers in most of the developing world; Whereas a 2015 GEM Report found that two-thirds of the world’s out-of-school chil-dren live in countries affected by fragility and conflict; Whereas a 2016 GEM Report found that sub- Saharan Africa remains the region with the highest out-of-school rates for all age groups and of the 61,000,000 out-of-school children of primary school age, 33,000,000, or more than half, live in sub-Saharan Africa; Whereas the 2011 World Health Organiza-tion’s World Report on Disability has found an estimated 90 percent of children with dis-abilities under age 18 in the developing world do not attend school; Whereas a 2012 GEM Report found that 250,000,000 primary schoolchildren are failing to learn basic literacy and numeracy skills, 130,000,000 of whom have attended at least four years of school; Whereas a 2011 GEM Report found that educating all students in low-income coun-tries with basic reading skills could lead to 171,000,000 people lifted out of poverty, a 12 percent drop in global poverty; Whereas a 1999 World Bank study on con-flict found every year of school decreases the chance of male youth engaging in violent conflict by 20 percent; Whereas a 2011 GEM Report reported that an educated mother is more likely to have her children vaccinated, and girls in school are three times less likely to be infected with HIV than their peers who are not in school; Whereas the Global Partnership for Edu-cation (GPE) is the only public-private glob-al partnership exclusively dedicated to edu-cation in the world’s poorest countries; Whereas GPE eligible countries are home to approximately 870,000,000 children and youth, which represent 78 percent of out-of- school children; Whereas GPE support resulted in 72,000,000 more children in primary school in 2015 than in 2002 and a 10 percent increase in primary school completion over that same period in GPE partner countries; Whereas GPE support to partner countries has achieved a 71 percent primary comple-tion rate for girls in 2014 compared with 56 percent in 2002; Whereas 60 percent of GPE’s spending is in countries affected by conflict or fragility and helped these countries to increase their primary school completion rates from 56 per-cent in 2000 to 69 percent in 2015; Whereas GPE incentivizes developing country governments to increase their own domestic financing for education, which has resulted in partner countries pledging $26,000,000,000 for their own domestic financ-ing during GPE’s 2014 replenishment con-ference; Whereas support for GPE complements the United States Government’s bilateral basic education programs by fostering coordina-tion among all key partners, ensuring the development of national education sector plans, and building on the commitment of developing country governments; Whereas, on April 20, 2017, GPE called on donors and developing country partners to fund a $3,100,000,000, three-year plan to sup-port 89 developing countries in improving the quality of and access to education for 870,000,000 children and youth and provide education plan implementation grants to 67 developing countries, covering 64 percent of out-of-school children; Whereas GPE is urging developing country governments to allocate 20 percent of gov-ernment expenditure to education and phil-anthropic and private sector donors to in-crease their contributions; and Whereas, with support from donors, GPE will be able to ensure 19,000,000 more children complete primary school, 6,600,000 more chil-dren complete lower secondary school, 1,700,000 more teachers are trained, 23,800 classrooms are built, and 204,000,000 text-books are distributed, bringing new hope to a generation of children and youth: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate— (1) affirms the leadership and commitment of the United States Government to improv-ing access to quality education for the poor-est and most marginalized children and youth worldwide, which is critical to global stability, economic prosperity, and poverty elimination; (2) supports the mission and goals of the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) to mobilize global and national efforts to con-tribute to the achievement of equitable, quality education and learning, with a focus on effective and efficient education systems and strong education financing; (3) recognizes that United States Govern-ment investments in bilateral basic edu-cation are complemented by GPE’s edu-cation systems approach and convening au-thority; and (4) encourages increased commitment and investment by the United States Govern-ment, international donors, private founda-tions, and private sector donors through the GPE to the global effort to ensure children and youth are in school and learning throughout the world.

HONORING SHELBY O’NEIL 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 5, 2017 Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Shelby O’Neil, a dedicated con-stituent of the 20th Congressional District. At just sixteen years of age, Shelby has found a passion for environmentalism that she has channeled in ways that are truly exceptional. In my district on the central coast of Cali-fornia, we understand the importance of con-servation and respect for the natural environ-ment we all enjoy. Among the many parks and recreation areas in the 20th district, our crown jewel is the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. This pristine stretch of coastline, while enjoyed in many ways by residents and tourists alike, also stands as an enduring re-sponsibility to the residents of the Central Coast to ensure its protection. Protected lands such as the sanctuary in our backyard are liv-ing postcards that we pass to future genera-tions. It is up to those future generations to shoulder that burden and rise to the respon-sibilities. Shelby has answered this call, and has risen to this challenge in truly impressive ways. Shelby has demonstrated sincere dedication to the cause of reducing ocean pollution and has built a framework with which to engage her peers, neighbors, and businesses in pro-tecting our local environment. She came to develop a passion for this cause by volun-teering at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, a world-renowned institution of marine biological research. During her time as a volunteer, Shelby quickly learned about the threat that pollution poses to the ocean. Determined to take action, Shelby founded her own nonprofit organization, the Junior Ocean Guardians. Under Shelby’s leadership, the Junior Ocean Guardians have planned several beach clean-up efforts and done classroom presentations at schools around the Central Coast to raise awareness and build support for the organiza-tion’s mission of protecting our oceans. In addition, the Junior Ocean Guardians are championing a new initiative called ‘‘No Straw November.’’ In my home state of California, a permanent ban has been issued on plastic bags due to the unnecessary pollution they cause in our oceans. However, there is still much work to be done in reducing other sources of plastic pollution. That is why I am so impressed with the Junior Ocean Guard-ians, who have taken on the goal of ending the use of single use plastic straws, which pose a serious risk to our diverse marine eco-systems on the coast of California. No Straw November represents an effort to raise the public’s awareness of the importance of plastic pollution by challenging participants to go an entire month without using a single use plastic straw. While there is much work to be done in the halls of Congress to address environ-mental pollution, real change begins by chang-ing our habits and behaviors. By challenging her community to make the small sacrifices necessary to sustain the beautiful natural habi-tats we all enjoy, Shelby is performing a vital civic duty, and her efforts set her apart as an example for her peers. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to add my name to the recognition of Shelby’s accom-plishments, and wish her the best in her future endeavors. I encourage all of my colleagues in the House to show their support by joining me in taking the No Straw November challenge.

IN RECOGNITION OF LUZERNE COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE ON THEIR 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 5, 2017 Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Luzerne County Community College, which is celebrating its 50th anniver-sary this year. LCCC was founded in 1966 by the Luzerne County Board of Commissioners as a public, two-year college to provide afford-able, accessible education for residents of Northeastern Pennsylvania and first began educating students in 1967. When the College opened in 1967, North-eastern Pennsylvania was facing a pivotal mo-ment in its history as the regional economy shifted away from coal industry jobs. The Col-lege responded to the demand for qualified, educated individuals to meet the needs of the area’s rapidly changing industrial framework. From a two-building location in Wilkes-Barre, LCCC moved to its permanent, 122–acre loca-tion in Nanticoke in 1974. In the early 2000s, LCCC began expanding its reach beyond its Nanticoke Campus to include Hazelton, Ber-wick, Elk Lake, and its newest location in downtown Scranton. Today, Luzerne County Community College offers associate degree, certificate, and di-ploma programs to over 5,000 students annu-ally. The community college option provides affordable college education to a diverse stu-dent body from recent high school graduates to adult learners who are returning to the classroom for the first time since high school. LCCC offers programs in Nursing, Criminal Justice, Business Administration, and Com-puter Information Systems. For many students, their education does not end with Luzerne County Community College. Many choose to continue their education at one of over 40 baccalaureate degree-awarding institutions with which LCCC has matriculation or transfer agreements. Many students in Northeastern Pennsylvania are set on a path-way toward success that begins with a strong educational groundwork from LCCC. The College is committed to remaining at the forefront in affordable, accessible edu-cation in the Wyoming Valley and continues to adapt and respond to meet the needs of the area’s growing and changing educational, eco-nomic, and industrial needs. f 
IN HONOR OF REVEREND ELIJAH SMITH, SR. 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 5, 2017 Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a dedicated man of God, com-munity servant, Civil Rights Leader, family man and friend of longstanding, Rev. Elijah Smith, Sr. Sadly, Rev. Smith passed away on October 2, 2017. His funeral service will be held on Saturday, October 7, 2017 at 1 p.m. at the St. Peter A.M.E. Church in Fort Valley, Georgia. Reverend Elijah Smith, Sr. was born on De-cember 28, 1939, in Fort Valley, Georgia, to the union of the late Mr. Samuel L. Smith and the late Mrs. Ola M. Johnson Smith. He was educated in the Peach County School System. On October 11, 1964, Reverend Smith re-ceived a calling that would change his life for-ever—he was called to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ. He acknowledged this calling at the Allen Chapel A.M.E. Church in Peach County. His first pastoral appointment oc-curred in 1967 in the Eastman Circuit in East-man, Georgia. He served in Eastman for four years. He was then assigned to the Allen Chapel and Mountain Creek A.M.E. Churches in Sumter County where he served for a total of 13 years. In 1984, he was assigned to the St. John A.M.E. Church in Columbus, Georgia. During this time, the church was destroyed by a tornado and he was instrumental in the re-building of the church at its current location on Steam Mill Road in Columbus. He served at St. John for ten years. Because of his legacy of service and his commitment to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, he was appointed by Bishop Donald George Kenneth Ming as the Presiding Elder of the Eastern District. He was at the time one of three presiding Elders in the Southwest Georgia Conference of thee Afri-can-Methodist Episcopal Church. At the time of his retirement as a Presiding Elder, he was senior Presiding Elder in charge of thirty-six churches. He also retired as a Civil Service Employee at Robins Air Force Base, as an electronic technician. He also was an entre-preneur, as he was the owner of D and S Flo-rist in Fort Valley, Georgia. Shirley Chisholm once said that, ‘‘Service is the rent that we pay for the space that we oc-cupy here on this earth.’’ Reverend Smith not only paid his rent, as a minister of the gospel, but he paid his rent with his many social and civic affiliations. During his lifetime, he re-ceived many awards to include: Jos´eph Ros- coe Campbell Freedom Award for service to the Concerned Citizens Movement for the Americus-Sumter County NAACP; Special Recognition Award for outstanding and dedi-cated service to the Americus Police Depart-ment and the Sumter County Community for

his spiritual guidance as chaplain; The Martin Luther King, Jr. Minister’s Community Service Award in recognition of outstanding and meri-torious service to the church and community from the Columbus; Georgia Chapter of Push; the Sixth Episcopal District (state of Georgia) sons of Allen Award of Support; one of the 50 Most influential African Americans in the Co-lumbus-Ft. Benning and Phenix City Area. He was also a lifetime member of the NAACP, since March of 1996. Reverend Smith served as a past President of the Americus-Sumter Branch of the NAACP. He was always push-ing African-Americans to use their political power at the ballot box to effectuate positive social change. Rev. Elijah Smith loved people and he al-ways fought for what was right. He was guid-ed by his love of God and his love of people. Mother Teresa once said that, ‘‘At the end of life we will not be judged by how many diplo-mas we have received, how much money we have made, how many great things we have done. We will be judged by ’I was hungry, and you gave me something to eat, I was naked and you clothed me. I was homeless, and you took me in.’ ’’ Rev. Elijah Smith used his life for good and to help others. He always be-lieved that the ‘‘time is always right to do that which is right.’’ On a personal note, Rev. Smith and his family have been dear friends to my wife Viv-ian and me for many years, and I will always value the support, encouragement and coun-sel that he imparted to me over the years. Rev. Elijah Smith was a great man and ac-complished many things in his life, but none of this would have been possible with out the love and support of his family. His legacy lives on through his wife, Janet, his children, step children, grandchildren and all of those that he touched in a special way. Mr. Speaker, my wife Vivian and I, along with the more than 730 000 constituents of the Second Congressional District of Georgia sa-lute and honor the life of Reverend Elijah Smith, Sr. for his commitment to spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ for over five decades and serving humankind. I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join us in extending our deepest condolences to Rev-erend Smith’s family during this difficult time. We pray that they will be consoled and com-forted by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks and months ahead.

TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT GEN-ERAL JAY SILVERIA, SUPER-INTENDENT, U.S. AIR FORCE ACADEMY, COLORADO 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 5, 2017 Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Lieutenant General Jay Silveria, the Su-perintendent of the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado, and include in the R
ECORD the tran- script of his powerful remarks. After five Afri-can-American cadet candidates found racial slurs written on the doors of their dorm rooms, Lt. Gen. Silveria gathered the cadets together and forcefully denounced the acts of racism in a speech that has gained national attention, with more than 1.7 million views on Facebook and over 22,000 shares on Twitter. Our nation was founded on the principles of equality and the inalienable rights of our citi-zens. Throughout our history Americans like Lt. General Silveria have fought to defend these rights. His remarks are the masterpiece of a true patriot and one we should all remem-ber and be inspired by as we continue to strive for E Pluribus Unum and a more perfect union. [Full Remarks, 28 September 2017] (By Lieutenant General Jay Silveria) Ladies and gentlemen, you may have heard that some people down in the prep school wrote some racial slurs on some message boards. If you haven’t heard that, I wanted you to hear it from me. If you’re outraged by those words then you’re in the right place. That kind of behavior has no place at the prep school, it has no place at USAFA, and it has no place in the US Air Force. You should be outraged, not only as an air-man, but as a human being. And I’ll tell you, that the appropriate response for horrible language and horrible ideas, the appropriate response is a better idea. So that’s why I’m here. That’s why all these people are up here on the staff tower, so let me have everybody who’s up here please pull forward to the rails. Also, there’s so many people here, they’re lining the outsides along the win-dows. These are members of the faculty, coaching staff, AOC’s, AMT’s, from the air-field, from my staff, from my headquarters, all aspects of the 10th Airbase Wing, all as-pects that make up USAFA and the United States Air Force Academy leadership is here. You heard from Brigadier General Goodwin, Brigadier General Armacost is here, Colonel Block from the athletic department is here, Mr. Knowlton is in Washington, DC right now. That’s why they’re here. That’s why we’re all here, because we have a better idea. Some of you may think that that happened down in the prep school and doesn’t apply to us. I would be naive and we would all be naive to think that everything is perfect here. We would be naive to think that we shouldn’t discuss this topic. We would also be tone- deaf not to think about the backdrop of what’s going on in our country. Things like Charlottesville and Ferguson, the protests in the NFL, that’s why we have a better idea. One of those ideas, the Dean brought people together to discuss Charlottesville because what we should have is a civil discourse and talk about these issues, that’s a better idea. We received outstanding feedback from that session at Charlottesville, but I also have a better idea and it’s about our diver-sity, and it’s the power of the diversity, the power of the 4,000 of you and all of the people that are on the staff tower and lining the glass, the power of us as a diverse group, the power that we come from all walks of life, that we come from all parts of this country, that we come from all races, we come from all backgrounds, gender, all makeup, all up-bringing. The power of that diversity comes together and makes us that much more pow-erful. That’s a much better idea than small thinking and horrible ideas. We have an op-portunity here, 5,500 people in this room, to think about what we are as an institution. This is our institution and no one can take away our values. No one can write on a board and question our values. No one can take that away from us. So just in case you’re unclear on where I stand on this topic, I’m going to leave you with my most important thought today: If you can’t treat someone with dignity and re-spect, then you need to get out. If you can’t teach someone from another gender, whether that’s a man or a woman, with dignity and respect, then you need to get out. If you de-mean someone in any way, then you need to get out. And if you can’t treat someone from another race or a different color skin with dignity and respect, then you need to get out. Reach for your phones. I’m serious, reach for your phones. OK, you don’t have to reach for your phones, I’m going to give you an op-portunity to reach for your phones. I want you to videotape this so that you can have it, so that you can use it, so that we all have the moral courage together, all of us on the staff tower lining the glass, all of us in this room. This is our institution, and if you need it, and you need my words, then you keep these words. And you use them and you re-member them and you share them and you talk about them. If you can’t treat someone with dignity and respect, then get out. f 
IN HONOR OF THE HONORABLE SAM FARR AND THE ELEVATION OF PINNACLES TO A NATIONAL PARK 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 5, 2017 Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my predecessor in this seat, the Honorable Sam Farr, for one of the most sig-nificant accomplishments of his public career. In 2012, he led a remarkable bi-partisan effort to pass legislation that elevated the Pinnacles National Monument to our nation’s 59th na-tional park. On Saturday, October 7, the Pin-nacles National Park Foundation will recognize Sam for this instrumental contribution to the conservation and interpretation of our nation’s natural heritage. Mr. Speaker, the Pinnacles is a truly re-markable place, but the Pinnacles National Park is more than its stunning scenery. The remnant of a 23 million-year-old volcano, the San Andreas fault carried the Pinnacles sev-eral hundred miles north to its present loca-tion. Its unique habitats form an island of bio-diversity that is home to numerous unique plant and animal species, including the Cali-fornia Condor and over 400 species of bees. It is also a place for people. The indigenous Amah Mutsun and Piknacih peoples lived amongst, traveled through, and revered the Pinnacles for thousands of years. The Spanish friars planted one of California’s first vineyards in the shadow of the Pinnacles. After Cali-fornia became part of the United States, local ranchers would take summer trips to the Pin-nacles caves to escape the heat. A rancher from one of those families, Schuler Hain, led a public campaign to have the Federal Gov-ernment protect the Pinnacles. That cul-minated in President Theodore Roosevelt des-ignating the Pinnacles a National Monument in 1908. In the 5 years since its elevation to National Park status, even more people have come to visit the Pinnacles. This has provided a re-markable boost for the surrounding commu-nities’ economies, who have seen increases in their hospitality business. Prior to arriving to Congress, I heard Sam tell the story that the idea to author legislation initially came during a Rotary meeting in a community near the Pinnacles. A Rotarian suggested that making the Pinnacles a National Park would help the local economy.

Sam took that idea, added the environ-mental conservation element, and crafted leg-islation that could garner widespread support. He found a Republican partner in our col-league J
EFF DENHAM . Together, they helped steer the bill through the House and ultimately to President Obama’s desk. Mr. Speaker, I know I speak for the whole House in thanking Sam for his years of serv-ice, and in particular for his efforts to des-ignate Pinnacles National Park. The Honor-able Sam Farr has given us a living postcard we can send to our children and grand-children. Our community is forever grateful for his service.

CONGRATULATIONS TO BOB FRASCA 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 5, 2017 Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, on Octo-ber 12, friends, partners and admirers of Bob Frasca are gathering in Portland to honor his career of over 50 years. Bob was a founder of one of America’s leading architectural firms, Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Architects. Since its humble beginnings, ZGF has grown to be one of the premier architectural firms in the world with 600 design professionals networked across six offices in the U. S. and Canada. Portland, across the country, and around the world, ZGF has received accolades and awards for its design work. The firm would not be where it is today with-out the leadership and influence of Bob Frasca. Bob graduated with a Bachelor of Architec-ture from the University of Michigan, and a Master of City Planning from MIT. He moved to Portland in 1959 and became the partner- in-charge of design for ZGF in 1966. Over the years, I have witnessed his significant impact in the Portland region with his emphasis on designs that build communities. He has played an important role in the evolution of Portland as livable city, thanks to his collaboration with others and his advocacy for the civic role ar-chitects and architecture play in making a great city. He was instrumental in the redevel-opment of Portland’s waterfront and defined the ‘‘heart’’ of downtown that later became Pioneer Square. His design influence is seen in the Portland skyline with projects like the Justice Center, the KOIN Tower and the Or-egon Convention Center, as well as Portland International Airport. His portfolio of user-driven buildings has been recognized for creating environments that foster health and innovation, dem-onstrated by the National Institutes of Health Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center, the Duke University Fitzpatrick Center for Inter-disciplinary Sciences, and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute Yawkey Center for Cancer Care. His work in urban contexts has contin-ued with projects such as Twelve West in Portland and 1200 Seventeenth Street in Washington, DC, and his international reach has touched U.S. embassies and consulates in Istanbul, Sofia, and Manila. With Bob’s leadership, ZGF’s design excel-lence and architecture raised the firm’s profile worldwide.

TRIBUTE TO LIANNE DENNSTEDT 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 5, 2017 Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to Lianne Dennstedt, who passed away in Flagstaff, Arizona on Monday, September 18, 2017. Lianne was the eldest daughter of Brenda Dennstedt, Vice President of the Western Municipal Water Dis-trict Board of Directors, and Shawn Dennstedt, a 24-year veteran of the San Diego County Sheriffs Department, as well as the older sis-ter of Jaimee Dennstedt. She will be greatly missed. Lianne attended Murrieta Valley High School in Murrieta, California, where she was a decorated cross country runner in addition to being an excellent student. Following her graduation in 2016 with a full International Baccalaureate diploma, she decided to attend Northern Arizona University (NAU) in Flagstaff, Arizona, due to its high scholastic standards. In her freshman year at NAU, Lianne selected Environmental Science as her major and made the Dean’s List both semesters. Just a few weeks ago, Lianne had just begun her sophomore year at NAU when she became ill with a severe sore throat. A week later, she was admitted to the hospital with meningitis, double pneumonia and renal fail-ure. Despite her strength, the unwavering sup-port of her family and dedicated actions by her medical team, Lianne lost her battle with this aggressive illness. I join the Dennstedt family in expressing my heartfelt appreciation to the doctors, nursing staff and team of medical specialists at Flagstaff Medical Center for their heroic efforts, kindness and compassion dur-ing this incredibly difficult time. I had the distinct privilege of knowing Lianne and her family for many years, and there are simply no words that soften the heartbreaking loss of Lianne’s loving and bright spirit. I ex-tend my heartfelt condolences to the entire Dennstedt family and her friends. Although Lianne may be gone, I know that the joy and happiness she brought to those around her will endure forever. f 
106TH NATIONAL DAY OF THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA 
HON. MIKE COFFMAN 
OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 5, 2017 Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the 106th National Day of the Republic of China. The annual celebration commemorates the start of the Wuchang Up-rising of October 10, 1911, which led to the collapse of the Qing dynasty in China and the establishment of the Republic of China on January 1, 1912. Double Ten Day is marked every year in Denver, Colorado with an honor-able reception organized by our local Double Ten Day Celebration Committee. I rise today to acknowledge Chairman, Dr. Paul C. Cheng and the volunteers who serve on the Double Ten Celebration Committee. Additionally, I would like to recognize the past Chairs of the Double Ten Celebration Com-mittee who have served since I have rep-resented the Sixth Congressional District; Nancy Tan, Nelson Ho, Ming Der Liu, Sylvia Edgar, Dr. Tai Dan Hsu, Lily Shen and Kevin Hsu, who have each year managed to expertly execute this important event in our community. The United States and Taiwan enjoy a long-standing relationship that stems from our shared values: democracy, the rule of law, and free enterprise. The Taiwanese-Ameri-cans living in Colorado bring a wealth of knowledge and entrepreneurial energy to our community, contributing in an integral way to its growth and success. Mr. Speaker, I offer my warmest and best wishes to the people of Taiwan on this 106th National Day of the Republic of China. I also extend my congratulations to Chairman Dr. Paul C. Cheng and the Double Ten Celebra-tion Committee on organizing another suc-cessful Double Ten Celebration for our com-munity in Colorado.

OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 5, 2017 Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 106th anniversary of the founding of Taiwan, also known as the Republic of China, which occurred following the Xinhai Revolution to overthrow the last im-perial Chinese dynasty. Taiwan has been nothing short of an eco-nomic miracle. Increased investment in infra-structure, education, and communications dur-ing the latter half of the 20th Century spurred rapid economic growth and elevated Taiwan to prominence as one of the ‘‘Four Asian Tigers.’’ Taiwan is home to Foxconn, one of the largest electronics manufacturers in the world, as well as other large technology companies such as ASUS, Pegatron, and Quanta Computer. The United States and Taiwan enjoy a strong, albeit unofficial, relationship, which is maintained by the American Institute in Tai-wan (AIT). On the commercial side, Taiwan is the U.S.’s 9th largest trading partner and the U.S. is Taiwan’s second largest trading part-ner. In 2016, U.S. trade with Taiwan totaled an estimated $84.9 billion. Cultural relations have also prospered in recent years. Travel from Taiwan to the U.S. has increased by 50 percent since Taiwan became a member of the U.S. Visa Waiver Program in 2012. My home state of Georgia also has a strong trade relationship with Taiwan. In 2013, the Georgia General Assembly passed a resolu-tion supporting a free trade agreement be-tween Taiwan and the U.S. Last year, Geor-gia’s exports to Taiwan generated over $420 million. Georgia’s position as a global logistics and transportation hub has attracted invest-ment from the Taiwanese auto parts industry. There are also a number of Georgia compa-nies spanning across multiple industries that have operations in Taiwan. As a member of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus, I would be remiss if I did not con-gratulate the people of Taiwan on their eco-nomic development in the last few decades. The hard work and ingenuity of the Taiwanese people are testaments to their economic suc-cess and flourishing democracy. I look forward to continued cooperation and goodwill be-tween our two countries in the years to come.

RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVER-SARY OF ST. GEORGE GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH OF SHREVE-PORT 
HON. MIKE JOHNSON 
OF LOUISIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 5, 2017 Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor for me to rise and recognize the 100th anniversary of the St. George Greek Or-thodox Church in Shreveport, La. For over a century, this congregation has blessed our community by spreading the love of God and continuing the tradition of giving back to one’s neighbors. In the beginning of the 20th century, some of the first Greek immigrants settled in Shreve-port, La., and recognized the need for greater unity among the small community of orthodox families. They then founded a congregation that would grow to what we now know as the St. George Greek Orthodox Church. The name, ‘‘Saint George,’’ was chosen in honor of the Saint George Church of New Ephesus in Asia Minor, which was destroyed during the Turko-Grecian struggle in 1917. Religious lib-erty is a core principle in the United States. While fleeing religious persecution, many Greeks found their new home in Northwest Louisiana. Today, the church is considered the heart of the region’s beloved Greek community and is distinguished by its rich and colorful artwork and architecture depicting insights of ortho-doxy. The congregation of St. George has a long history of generosity and compassion and includes some of our closest personal friends. The congregation has hosted countless chari-table events to support its three major philan-thropic organizations: the Ladies Philoptochos Society, the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association and the Daughters of Penelope. For over 60 years, the Philoptochos have held an annual pastry sale to raise funds for numerous charitable organizations, pro-viding aid to anyone who may need it. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the United States Congress and the people of Northwest Lou-isiana, I am privileged to recognize the St. George Greek Orthodox Church and celebrate over 100 years of their dedication to the bet-terment of our community. I, along with my wife, Kelly, pray the Lord continues to bless this congregation and their important min-istries. f

SOCIAL SECURITY WORKS , October 4, 2017. Hon. C
EDRIC RICHMOND , Chair, Congressional Black Caucus, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. D
EAR REPRESENTATIVE RICHMOND : We are writing to express our support for the FY18 Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) Alter-native Budget. Your budget outlines respon-sible priorities, including strengthening So-cial Security benefits, and demonstrates the CBC’s commitment to the best interests of the American people. The CBC budget alternative is the com-plete opposite of the cruel legislative pro-posals contained in the Republican FY18 House Budget Resolution. While the Repub-lican budget proposes cutting Social Secu-rity benefits and undermining Medicare and Medicaid, the CBC Alternative Budget works to improve Social Security and, more gen-erally, our economic security, for all of us, including seniors, people with disabilities, children, and other vulnerable Americans. The Congressional Black Caucus clearly understands that Social Security is a solu-tion to a number of challenges facing the na-tion, including our looming retirement in-come crisis. Most workers—especially Afri-can-Americans—have seen their wages stag-nate. They need insurance against the loss of wages in the event of death disability or old age, which Social Security provides, as op-posed to more retirement income savings, which are a far less effective solution. Social Security is the primary retirement income for 72 percent of African-American seniors; we must work to protect Social Security benefits from any cuts, and work to expand its modest benefits. The recommendation of the CBC Alter-native Budget to adjust the cost of living calculations by using the Consumer Price Index for the Elderly (CPI–E) would be a great start to strengthening our Social Secu-rity system. The current formula for the So-cial Security cost-of-living-adjustment (COLA) is slowly eroding the value of Social Security’s already modest benefits. Seniors and people with disabilities deserve a yearly raise that keeps pace with their actual costs of living, which are ever increasing due to the cost of pharmaceutical drugs and med-ical expenses. Thank you for introducing the CBC budget alternative. The American people deserve a budget that fully funds vital programs, and not one that makes cuts to pay for tax hand-outs for wealthy Americans. We look forward to working with you during the formation of next year’s CBC budget alternative to strengthen the proposal even further. Sincerely, N

OUNTY AND MUNICIPAL EMPLOY -
EES, AFL–CIO, Washington, DC, October 4, 2017. Hon. C
EDRIC RICHMOND , Chairman, Congressional Black Caucus, Washington, DC. D
EAR MR. CHAIRMAN : On behalf of the 1.6 million members of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), I strongly endorse the alter-native budget resolution proposed by the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC). The CBC budget represents the true needs of our na-tion and working families by supporting health care needs, basic living standards, nu-tritional assistance, job training, higher edu-cation and building better economic oppor-tunities for everyone. The budget decisions made by Congress each year are vital to ensuring that the economy is strong and that our communities are safe and prosperous. Unfortunately, H. Con. Res. 71, the budget approved by the House Budget Committee, promotes the same misguided, inequitable priorities as the budget proposed by President Trump. The GOP budget sets woefully inadequate spend-ing levels for critical public services and slashes $5.8 trillion over 10 years from non- defense discretionary programs and critical entitlement programs. It hurts vital human needs to significantly boost defense spending and provide massive tax giveaways to wealthy individuals and corporations. The CBC budget sets a better course by in-vesting in public services that all Americans rely on, preserving and improving the Af-fordable Care Act, cancelling budget seques-tration cuts, investing in infrastructure to create jobs and strengthen communities, in-vesting in education from the cradle through college, targeting investments to eradicate poverty, improving retirement security, strengthening the right to vote and creating a fair tax code to meet our nation’s needs. The CBC budget embraces American fami-lies and promotes job growth and economic prosperity. I strongly urge support for the CBC budget. Sincerely, SCOTT FREY, Director of Federal Government Affairs. 
SEIU, Washington, DC, October 4, 2017. D
EARREPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the 2 million members of the Service Employees International Union (‘‘SEIU’’), I write in support of the Congressional Black Caucus’s Alternative Budget for Fiscal Year 2018 (‘‘Al-ternative Budget’’). The Alternative Budget would make America’s tax system fairer, re-build the nation’s infrastructure, and invest in our communities and children through programs designed to lift millions out of poverty. The House Republican budget (H. Con. Res. 71) would cut programs like Medicaid, Medi-care, and Social Security in order the fi-nance tax giveaways to the wealthy and big corporations. The CBC’s Alternative Budget would require the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share, the Alternative Budg-et would also invest $1 trillion into a robust infrastructure program that would accel-erate the economic recovery and revitalize communities across the nation. Furthermore, the Alternative Budget would invest in community-focused pro-grams that are designed to lift millions out of poverty. These investments include re-storing funding to the Supplemental Nutri-tion Assistance Program (SNAP), expanding access to affordable housing, increasing ac-cess to affordable and quality education, and increasing funding for job training programs. Each of these provisions would focus on re-building the middle class and creating an economy that improves the lives of Amer-ican workers. The CBC’s Alternative Budget, along with the Congressional Progressive Caucus’s ‘‘The People’s Budget,’’ are better paths forward for America’s working families than H. Con. Res. 71. If you have any questions, please reach out to John Foti. Sincerely, J
OHNGRAY, Legislative Director. 
COALITION ON HUMAN NEEDS , Washington, DC, October 3, 2017. D
EAR REPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the Coalition on Human Needs, I strongly urge you to vote no on H. Con. Res. 71, the pro-posed FY 2018 Budget Resolution, and to vote for the substitute budgets advanced by the Congressional Progressive Caucus, Congres-sional Black Caucus, and the Democratic al-ternative budget resolution. The Coalition on Human Needs is an alli-ance made up of human service providers, faith organizations, policy experts, labor, civil rights, and other advocates for meeting the needs of low-income and vulnerable peo-ple. Our members understand that the eco-nomic security of millions of American fami-lies depends on building on the progress we’ve made in health coverage, jobs, basic living standards, and ensuring that our chil-dren are well-prepared for productive lives. But the majority’s proposed budget does not build—it breaks apart our engines of progress. It will make our nation weaker for decades to come. The most recent survey data on poverty in the U.S. shows the biggest two-year decline since the late 1960’s. Refundable tax credits for working families, SNAP/food stamps and housing subsidies have lifted multi-millions of people out of poverty. The decline in the proportion of our population without health insurance continued its decline in 2016, down to 8.8 percent. More people are working, and in general, low-and moderate-income house-holds have finally started to make income gains. The budget advanced by the House Budget Committee would be a dangerous backwards plunge, stripping trillions of dollars from programs that work to reduce poverty and create security and opportunity. Medicaid, Medicare, working family tax credits, nutri-tion assistance, education and housing as-sistance: these are just some of the services the budget would massively cut. The budget takes trillions in funding that supports eco-nomic security and progress and hands it to the wealthy and corporations in the form of enormous tax cuts. The primary goal of H. Con. Res. 71 is to allow huge tax cuts to be enacted with only a simple majority in the Senate. These tax cuts are claimed to be a critical element in increasing economic growth enough to make the tax cuts deficit neutral. Reputable economists are skeptical that the proposed tax cuts would boost the economy to the 2.6 percent average growth projected in the budget and acknowledge that tax cuts to cor-porations and the rich deepen the deficit. History supports this: the economy grew and unemployment declined more during the Clinton tax increase years than during the Bush era tax cuts. And the Kansas experi-ence with tax cuts is cautionary: revenues plummeted, with the tax take in 2016 $570 million lower than in 2013, even after count-ing increases enacted in sales and cigarette taxes. The economic growth that did occur from cutting taxes was estimated to bring in about $30 million, leaving the state very deeply in the hole. The state legislature has recently reversed course, unwilling to slash education budgets as much as the revenue hole would have forced. They saw that they were weakening their state. Congress should not inflict the same dangerous lesson on the entire nation. We urge you to reject H. Con. Res. 71 be-cause of its central choice: paying for tax cuts that overwhelmingly favor the rich and corporations with cuts to essential services. Our nation faces major challenges: reducing disproportionate poverty among children and helping children and young adults to ad-vance in education so they can meet the challenges in our economic future, pro-tecting seniors in their retirement, and re-building communities. Both the emergency needs of communities devastated by natural disasters and the similarly urgent threats from opioids and other epidemics, decaying infrastructure and inadequate public health and consumer protections demand a vigorous federal response. Instead of making these in-vestments, the House budget would cripple

the federal capacity to respond by slashing domestic appropriations by 44 percent com-pared with FY 2010 levels over the next dec-ade and making similarly extreme cuts in health care, nutrition, income assistance for seniors, people with disabilities, and working families. In addition to trillions of dollars in cuts and structural constraints to basic mandatory programs, the budget would fast- track $203 billion in cuts to domestic pro-grams over the next ten years through rec-onciliation rules. Cuts like these would reck-lessly weaken us; they are self-inflicted wounds. The proposed tax cuts will worsen inequal-ity and reward businesses that park their in-come offshore. Instead, Congress should in-sist that corporations and the rich pay their fair share. Please vote against weakening America, and instead protect and expand in-vestments as called for in the budgets pro-posed by the Congressional Progressive Cau-cus, Congressional Black Caucus, and the House Budget Committee Democrats’ sub-stitute. These three constructive alter-natives deserve your yes vote. Sincerely yours, D

INTRODUCTION OF A BILL TO RE-MOVE THE STATUE OF CONFED-ERATE GENERAL ALBERT PIKE 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 5, 2017 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to intro-duce a bill to require the removal of a statue of Confederate General Albert Pike, which is currently located on federal land near Judici-ary Square in the District of Columbia. This statue was authorized by Congress in 1898, and was paid for by both federal and private funds—the Freemasons, of which Pike was a member, donated the majority of the money needed to build and install the statue in 1901. I oppose tearing down Confederate statues, because I believe they should be moved to more appropriate settings, like museums, to avoid erasing an important part of history from which Americans must continue to learn. How-ever, Pike was a Confederate general who served dishonorably and was forced to resign in disgrace. Soldiers under his command were found to have mutilated the bodies of Union soldiers, and he was ultimately imprisoned after his fellow officers reported that he had been misappropriating funds. Adding to the dishonor of taking up arms against the United States, Pike dishonored even his Confederate military service. He certainly has no claim to be memorialized in the nation’s capital. Even those who do not want Confederate statues removed will have to justify according Pike any honor considering his history. After meeting with the Freemasons, I be-lieve that the best course of action is to re-move the statue and find a more appropriate place for it. The Freemasons themselves have said they ‘‘will support an action . . . to re-move the statue forthwith so that it shall not serve as a source of contention or strife for the residents of our community.’’ The Mayor of the District of Columbia and the D.C. Council also support the removal of the statue. My bill clarifies that no federal funds will be used to take the Pike statue down. I urge my colleagues to support this important legisla-tion. f 
COMMEMORATING THE 25TH ANNI-VERSARY OF ST. JOSEPH OF MARAMURES ROMANIAN ORTHO-DOX CHURCH 
HON. LOU BARLETTA 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 5, 2017 Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to help commemorate the 25th anniver-sary of St. Joseph of Maramures Romanian Orthodox Church. St. Joseph’s, the only Ro-manian Orthodox Church in Luzerne County, has grown from humble beginnings to become a beacon of faith in our community. In 1992, a small group of Romanians lo-cated in Hazleton, Pennsylvania decided to form a mission. With nothing other than faith and a desire to succeed, their mission became a reality. On April 19, 1992, with the blessing of the Romanian Orthodox Episcopate of America and His Eminence, Archbishop Nathaniel, St. Joseph’s first Divine Liturgy was officiated by Rev. Fr. Onisie Morar. Over the next year, the Mission held its services in various locations, including Emil and Dorina Horga’s property in Hazleton, where the first Resurrection Service was officiated, as well as St. Michael’s Ortho-dox Church in Freeland. By the grace of God and the kindness of others, such as Fr. Law-rence Baigger, all of the church’s services were officiated for its parishioners during this time. While services were held at St. Michael’s, the newly formed Mission began to organize and strengthen. The Mission Council and La-dies Auxiliaries Organization were formed and with them, so did the ability to obtain a per-sonal place of worship. In 1993, the Mission Council purchased the United Methodist Church in Hazleton, adopting the name of Palm Sunday Romanian Church. When the mortgage was paid in 1999, the parish changed its name to St. Joseph of Maramures Romanian Orthodox Church. Since then, through the dedication of its pa-rishioners, the parish has formed a strong community within itself, as well as with others in the surrounding areas. With the guidance of Fr. Cristian Preda, the parish has continued to preserve the traditions of the Orthodox Chris-tian faith, touching many lives in our commu-nity. Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing St. Joseph of Maramures Romanian Orthodox Church as it celebrates its 25th anniversary, and wishing its parishioners all the best in the years to come.

A HAPPY DOUBLE TEN DAY TO THE PEOPLE OF TAIWAN 
HON. STEVE KING 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 5, 2017 Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, Tuesday, October 10th is Taiwan’s National Day—also known as Double Ten Day. I would like to take this opportunity now to offer my early best wishes to the people of Taiwan. As my colleagues are aware, Taiwan is a close friend, as well as security and trade partner of the United States. Accordingly, the United States has declared its support for Tai-wan’s meaningful participation in international organizations where its membership is not possible. In my home state of Iowa, we are enthusiastic to build on our already strong trade ties. In 2016, Iowa’s exports to Taiwan reached $153.87 million, making Taiwan Iowa’s 5th largest export market in Asia. Iowa and every state in the nation would benefit from the signing of a free trade agree-ment between Taiwan and the U.S., which would eliminate tariffs on most products and increase Taiwanese demand and Iowa ex-ports. Though a small country with a popu-lation of 23 million, Taiwan has the potential to become a strong export market for Iowa and the U.S. Taiwan is a major importer of U.S. agriculture goods. Other sectors such as Iowa’s strong wind energy sector have poten-tial for bilateral cooperation as well. Mr. Speaker, again, I wish the people of Taiwan a Happy Double Ten Day. And I take this opportunity to echo the words of Barry Goldwater when he said, ‘‘I have great affec-tion for the Chinese people, their culture, their skills, and their potential.’’ f 
RECOGNIZING DANA FERREIRA 
HON. JEFF DENHAM 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 5, 2017 Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the commitment and dedication of my Senior Field Representative, Dana Ferreira. Dana served 15 years as an essential member of my team. Dana graduated from Hartnell College in 1989 with her Associate of Arts in General Studies. After graduating, she became a li-censed Insurance Agent for Marini Insurance Agency. Six years later, she joined my team while I worked for the California State Senate. In 2010, I was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives and she stayed by my side as District Scheduler and later as a Senior Field Representative. Dana has been an inte-gral member of my staff and instrumental in the successes of my district office. Dana has established solid and lasting rela-tionships in California’s 10th District as a pillar in our community. From Mayors to community leaders, she has entered the lives of many through her professionalism and personality. Since 2003, Dana has been profoundly in-volved in the Rotary Club, beginning in Sali-nas and then in Modesto. She selflessly volun-teers her time for many organizations and causes and has been recognized for many worthy achievements and accomplishments. One of Dana’s many preferred pastimes is attending concerts; she especially likes seeing her favorite band, Tesla.

U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS DISASTER RELIEF 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 5, 2017 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge this body to send urgent aid to the U.S. Virgin Is-lands, Puerto Rico, and all of our Caribbean neighbors in its federal response to this year’s devastating hurricane season. Hurricanes Harvey, Jose, Irma and now Maria have ravaged our southern border, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and our friends and neighbors in the Caribbean. Sadly, the pace of federal response in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico has been much too slow. Nearly three weeks after Hurricane Irma, a category 5 hurricane, decimated the Virgin Is-lands, residents are still having trouble receiv-ing appropriate aid and commodities. Now, nearly two weeks after another cat-egory 5 storm tore through St. Croix, the U.S. Virgin Islands’ three main islands have lost its economy, its physical infrastructure and scores of its people. Insufficient quantities of food and supplies, lack of power, extremely long fuel lines, and lack of communication and cell phone cov-erage have left the Virgin Islands utterly deci-mated. The Virgin Islands are in a humanitarian cri-sis, Mr. Speaker. No American citizen should be forced to endure these conditions, espe-cially not with the level of resources at the dis-posal of our federal government. My heart breaks for these families. I urge my colleagues and the Trump Administration to fund all necessary resources not only to ad-dress the urgent humanitarian crisis but also the sustained commitment support funding necessary to help rebuild and restore infra-structure necessary for their economy and people to move forward.

IN CELEBRATION OF 25 YEARS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN’S WILLIAM DAVIDSON INSTITUTE 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 5, 2017 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate 25 years of the University of Michi-gan’s William Davidson Institute (WDI). The Institute has helped shape businesses and so-cial welfare through its distinguished inter-national service and education. In 1992, Guardian Industries, an inter-national manufacturer of glass products, deter-mined the importance of establishing an edu-cational institute to contribute to the economic transformation that was occurring throughout the world as new market economies began to develop in previously socialist countries. They named it in honor of then Guardian Industries Chairman, President and CEO, William David-son. Mr. Davidson envisioned a world class in-stitute that helps ‘‘forge a path for those re-sponsible for economic change in emerging markets.’’ Since its founding, the William Da-vidson Institute has cultivated a repository of methods and resources for creating a market economy that is unmatched in its breadth and depth. From economic education to increased access to healthcare, WDI works with coun-tries and world leaders to analyze specific areas of need and to institute change. The Institute’s main initiatives include edu-cation, financial sector development, health care, performance measurement and scaling impact. Staff at the William Davidson Institute work alongside businesses, government agen-cies and other academic institutions to imple-ment initiative-based programs and economic change. Programs run by the Institute include: operating a community college initiative in Jor-dan that fosters business skills and vocational coursework, assessing equipment needed for a new hotel in Ethiopia, instituting wireless telecommunication service in rural commu-nities in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, and upgrading the University of Liberia’s ac-counting program to meet international edu-cation standards. The institute also serves as a partner to other international programs, in-cluding Goldman Sachs’ 10,000 Women Pro-gram that helps underprivileged women in Rwanda grow their self-owned small busi-nesses. Over the past 25 years, the William Davidson Institute has been a global leader in international economic development and social freedom. I know this Institute will continue to effect meaningful change in countries across the world. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the William Davidson Institute on its 25th anniversary. The Institute has been in-strumental in growing economies and empow-ering business leaders internationally. f 
COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNI-VERSARY OF LUZERNE COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE 
HON. LOU BARLETTA 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 5, 2017 Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to help commemorate the 50th anniver-sary of Luzerne County Community College. The College was founded in 1967 with just two buildings in Wilkes-Barre and 836 stu-dents, and has since become the largest col-lege in Northeastern Pennsylvania. As a student-centered learning institution, Luzerne County Community College gives stu-dents the tools they need to meet the world’s most daunting challenges through practical ac-cess to real-world skills, classroom diversity that embodies the human experience, and quality teacher-student contact. Seven years after its founding, the College moved to a permanent 122-acre campus in Nanticoke, which provided the necessary space to handle the increasing student popu-lation. Since 1974, the College has continued to expand its offerings to underserved areas throughout Northeastern Pennsylvania. It opened up sites in Hazleton, Berwick, Shamokin, Kulpmont, and downtown Wilkes- Barre. In 2008, Luzerne County Community College opened its Public Safety Training In-stitute. Two years later, the College expanded its main campus into downtown Nanticoke by opening the Joseph A. Paglianite Culinary In-stitute. The following year, it opened the Francis S. and Mary Gill Carroza, R.N. Health Sciences Center. Currently, the Luzerne County Community College offers 82 occupational programs, 24 liberal arts and transfer programs, and 10 credit-free career training programs. As of today, the College boasts more than 32,000 degree-holding alumni. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to recognize Luzerne County Community College as it cele-brates its 50th anniversary. On behalf of a grateful community, I wish to thank the Col-lege, its faculty, and its staff for their tireless service to the community and unwavering commitment to accessible education. f 
CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 
SPEECH OF  
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, October 4, 2017 
The House in Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union had under consideration the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 71) establishing the congressional budget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2018 and setting forth the appro-priate budgetary levels for fiscal years 2019 through 2027: 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of the Democratic Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute to H. Con. Res. 27, the House Republicans’ Congressional Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year 2018. Mr. Chair, House Republican budgeteers have a very poor track record when it comes to economic forecasts and projections. For years, they have based their entire leg-islative agenda and strategy on their belief that the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare would be a failure. The wish was father to the thought and they were wrong. Because of Obamacare more than 20 mil-lion Americans now know the peace of mind that comes from affordable, quality health in-surance that is there when you need it. House Republicans oppose increasing the minimum wage, claiming that it costs jobs. Wrong again. Every increase in the minimum wage has been accompanied by an expanding economy, especially during the Clinton Administration. House Republicans opposing comprehen-sive immigration reform claim that it will lead to lower incomes and lost jobs. Wrong again. Studies conducted by groups as far apart as the Chamber of Commerce and the AFL–CIO consistently show that comprehensive immi-gration reform will grow the Gross Domestic Product by $1.5 trillion over 10 years. Given this sorry track record of economic forecasting, it is mind-boggling that anyone could support another Republican budget that favors the wealthy over middle class families and those struggling to enter or remain in the middle class.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1336 October 5, 2017 
The Democratic Budget ANS represents a much better way forward to the economic prosperity and security that Americans want and demand because it: 1. Creates good-paying jobs by investing in cutting-edge research and innovation, edu-cation, and infrastructure—highways, broadband, school construction, and more. 2. Increases educational opportunities by enhancing the Pell Grant program and funds career, technical, and adult education, and supports initiatives to help borrowers manage their student debt. 3. Supports American workers and families through responsible tax reform that creates jobs, boosts economic growth, and ensures that the wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share. 4. Promotes economic growth, expanded opportunity, and better quality of life by sup-porting a raise in the minimum wage, equal pay for equal work, immigration reform, con-sumer safeguards, childcare, job training, and paid leave. 5. Protects a basic standard of living by funding for programs that ensure families can access nutrition assistance, find and afford quality housing in their neighborhood, heat and cool their homes when extreme tempera-tures hit, and supports strengthening and ex-panding the Earned Income Tax Credit and in-creased resources for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. 6. Defends and strengthens the Affordable Care Act and protects Medicare by rejecting both Trumpcare and any plan to turn Medicare into a voucher-like system that would increase costs for seniors. 7. Rejects the Republican budget’s 19 per-cent cut to diplomacy and foreign aid oper-ations and invests instead in all aspects of na-tional security, including our military and diplo-matic corps, foreign aid, homeland security, veterans, and law enforcement. The Democratic Budget ANS works FOR American families by giving them the tools to buy a home, send their kids to college and enjoy a secure retirement. Mr. Chair, the Democratic Budget rep-resents a better way. We Democrats understand that we are all in this together and that our current economic situation calls for a balanced approach be-tween increased revenues and responsible re-duction in expenditures. Our plan will protect and strengthen our re-covering economy, reduce the deficit in a re-sponsible way, while continuing to invest in the things that make our country strong like education, health care, innovation, and clean energy. Mr. Chair, this Republican budget is bad for America but it is disastrous for the people from my home state of Texas who sent me here to advocate for their interests. Let me highlight a few examples. 1. If the Republican budget resolution were to become the basis of federal fiscal policy, 3,435,336 Texas seniors would be forced out of traditional Medicare and into a voucher pro-gram. 2. Under the Republican plan to end Medi-care as we know it, Texas seniors will receive a voucher instead of guaranteed benefits under traditional Medicare. 3. For the 3,435,336 Texans aged 45–54, the value of their vouchers would be capped at growth levels that are lower than the pro-jected increases in health care costs. 4. Previous analyses showed that this type of plan would cut future spending by $5,900 per senior, forcing them to spend more out of pocket and diminishing their access to quality care. 5. Additionally, private insurance plans will aggressively pursue the healthiest, least ex-pensive enrollees, thereby allowing Medi-care—currently the lifeline for 3,187,332 Texas seniors—to wither on the vine. 6. If the Republican budget resolution is adopted by Congress, 206,304 Texas seniors would pay more for prescription drugs next year. 7. The Republican plan would re-open the donut hole, forcing seniors to pay the full cost of their prescription drugs if their yearly drug expenses are more than $2,970 for the year. 8. Seniors reaching the prescription drug donut hole would pay an average of $828 more in prescription drug costs in 2018 and approximately $13,000 more from now through 2027. 9. Under the Republican budget, the 2,445,462 Texas seniors who utilized free pre-ventive services currently covered by Medi-care in 2017 will face increased costs in the form of higher deductibles, co-insurance, and copayments for certain services, including even cancer screenings and annual wellness visits. 10. The Republican budget would slash $33 billion in nursing home care and other health care services for 754,500 Texas seniors and disabled persons who currently rely on Med-icaid for their long-term care needs. 11. The draconian cuts included in the Re-publican budget would have a devastating im-pact on the 1,191 certified nursing homes in Texas that serve nearly 100,000 seniors, with more than half relying on Medicaid as their pri-mary payer. As a result, nursing homes would be forced to slash services, turn away seniors, or close their doors. Mr. Chair, the Republican budget may be characterized in many ways—cruel, irrespon-sible, short-sighted, reckless—but ‘‘fair and balanced’’ is not one of them. In contrast, the alternative budget proposed by the Democratic Caucus is worthy of sup-port because it fairly balances the need for in-creased revenues and responsible reductions in expenditures with the imperative of making the necessary investments in human capital required to move our country forward. The Democratic Budget ANS will generate at least a million more jobs this year com-pared to the Republicans’ austerity first plan by making the investments needed to create jobs, strengthen the middle class, create greater upward mobility, and ensure oppor-tunity for our children and future generations. Mr. Chair, Democratic alternative budget maintains our commitment to Medicare, Med-icaid, and Social Security; expands the EITC for childless workers; and provides ample funding for early childhood education. Especially important to my constituents, and those of my colleagues representing Lou-isiana, Texas, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, is that the Democratic Budg-et ANS includes the funds approved by Con-gress as a down payment for assistance in re-sponse to Hurricane Harvey and supports fur-ther emergency funding related to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, along with other nat-ural disasters. It is said often, Mr. Chair, but is no less true, that the federal budget is more than a fi-nancial document; it is an expression of the nation’s most cherished values. As the late and great former senator and Vice-President Hubert Humphrey said: ‘‘The moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twi-light of life, the elderly; and those who are in shadows of life, the sick, the needy, and the handicapped.’’ It is for this reason that in evaluating the merits of a budget resolution, it is not enough to subject it only to the test of fiscal responsi-bility. To keep faith with the nation’s past, to be fair to the nation’s present, and to safeguard the nation’s future, the budget must also pass a moral test. Unlike the Republican budget, the Demo-cratic Budget ANS passes both of these tests with flying colors. The Republican budget calls to mind what Talleyrand said of the restored Bourbon dy-nasty after the abdication of Napoleon: ‘‘They had learned nothing and forgotten nothing.’’ Like the discredited Ryan Budgets of years past, this repackaged and warmed over TrumpRepublican Budget seems to know the cost of everything but the value of nothing. For these compelling reasons, I stand in strong opposition to the Republican budget and urge my colleagues to join me in sup-porting a much better deal for the American people, the Democratic Budget ANS.

INTRODUCTION OF THE CYBER BREACH NOTIFICATION ACT 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, October 5, 2017 Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, the data breach at Equifax, one of three major American cred-it-reporting companies in the United States, exposed the personal and financial information of up to 143 million Americans. The data breach gave hackers access to Americans’ highly sensitive personal and financial informa-tion, including Social Security numbers, birth dates, home addresses, driver’s license num-bers, credit card numbers, and credit dispute claims. The data breach occurred in May 2017, and, the agency became aware of the breach on July 29, 2017, but did not report it to the public until 40 days later. The delay in dis-closing the breach is concerning because al-most half of all Americans’ sensitive informa-tion could be in the hands of cyber criminals, who are willing and ready to use that informa-tion for identity fraud and other crimes. Cyber breaches like this one present a risk to privacy and individuals’ personal financial welfare. In 2002, I helped pass California’s data breach law requiring businesses and gov-ernment agencies to notify residents of data breaches. This notification law was instru-mental in ensuring the public was informed and could mitigate harm. It is imperative that breaches are reported in a timely manner for individuals to begin taking the appropriate steps in protecting their identities and financial information. That is why, today, I am introducing the Cyber Breach Notification Act to establish fed-eral standards modeled after California’s data

notification law and HIPAA’s data notification provisions, which is currently in place to notify individuals of data breaches. This legislation will require businesses to notify individuals af-fected by data breaches ‘‘in the most expe-dient time possible and without unreasonable delay.’’ Additionally, this legislation establishes a federal standard for data breach notification laws, but does not preempt current state breach notification laws or preclude states from creating more robust laws. This will en-sure that millions of Americans are given prop-er and timely notice after a data breach to begin to mitigate harm.
