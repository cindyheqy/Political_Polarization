UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. C
OURTNEY ) for 5 min-utes. Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, in a few moments this morning, I will be in-troducing a House resolution, a bipar-tisan House resolution, with Congress-man D
ONYOUNG from the State of Alaska calling on the Senate to, once and for all, ratify the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea Treaty. Mr. Speaker, this is a treaty which was negotiated by the Reagan adminis-tration back in the late 1980s. It is a treaty which has been endorsed by Democratic Presidents, Republican Presidents, Condoleeza Rice, and mili-tary leadership of all stripes, to create a system of rules of the road in terms of maritime disputes. As I said, the military leadership of this country has been adamant and consistent year in and year out about the need for our country to join 166 other countries in the world in terms of ratifying this treaty. As Marine General Joe Dunford said a short time ago, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff: ‘‘We undermine our leverage by not signing up to the same rule book by which we are asking other countries to accept.’’ Today, as this map shows, all the purple countries are those that have ratified the treaty, and the blue coun-tries are those that have not. The United States joins the following com-pany in terms of refusing to ratify this treaty: North Korea, Iran, Syria, Libya, and Venezuela. Now, again, this is a measure which has been debated over the years, and it has been, I would argue, sort of a Wash-ington, D.C., parlor game in terms of the theoretical impact that it may or may not have; but in recent months, the need to do this has become much sharper and clearer. This past week at the House Com-mittee on Armed Services, which I serve on, and I am the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces, Admiral Harry Har-ris testified. He is our commander of PACOM. He has all of Asia-Pacific, the region of the world where China today is blatantly violating maritime law by creating islands out of nothing, cre-ating landing strips and militarizing those new land masses in a clear at-tempt to, again, violate the U.N. Con-vention on the Law of the Sea Treaty by creating an economic zone that is going to interfere with the free passage of commercial traffic. Ninety-five per-cent of the world’s commodities go by sea. Their intentions are crystal clear. Admiral Harris, when he testified the other day, made it also very clear that ‘‘acceding to the convention’’—the Law of the Sea Treaty—‘‘gives us the moral high ground to criticize those countries that would seek to inhibit freedom of maneuver in the oceans and airspace around the world, including the Asia- Pacific region.’’ Interestingly, the following day, Gen-eral Philip Breedlove, the commander of NATO, European Command for the U.S., came in and without any prompt-ing testified to exactly the same policy position because what he is seeing in his region of the world is that a resur-gent Russia is militarizing the Arctic Circle, that they are using this, again, melting of the ice cap as an oppor-tunity to militarize that region of the world and try and control what is going to be a maritime passage, where both military assets and commercial traffic are going to move back and forth. General Breedlove, again, made ex-actly the same point: we need to get into the game. This was made crystal clear just a few months ago. The Gov-ernment of the Philippines, to its cred-it, has challenged China. They filed an application before The Hague, citing the Law of the Sea Treaty, that what they are doing in the South China Sea blatantly violates international law. The United States asked not to par-ticipate directly as a party, because we haven’t ratified the treaty, but simply to be an observer, to be a friend of the court to be able to contribute ideas and data—which our Navy has more than any other Navy in the world—and we were denied observer status because we have not ratified this treaty. So right now people are hard at work in The Hague writing the rules of the road in terms of maritime issues that are going to determine budgets. And, again, I am the ranking member of the

Subcommittee on Seapower and Pro-jection Forces, so this is driving a lot of decisions about building submarines and surface ships and stronger muni-tions because of what is happening in the South China Sea. It is also going to be driving the out-comes of what is happening with resur-gent Russia. Putin is not kidding around in terms of what he is doing in the Arctic Circle or in the North Atlan-tic. General Breedlove made that very clear. We are playing, right now, zone defense in terms of what is happening in that region of the world. It is time for the Congress to listen, if nothing else, to our military leader-ship and recognize the international Law of the Sea Treaty, which 166 na-tions in the world have ratified. It is time for the U.S. to get in the game, get off the bleachers, and be able to set those rules because it is going to deter-mine, for decades to come, decisions that this body is going to be stuck with if we are not part of that process. Again, our military leadership, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, our CNO of the Navy, the head of the Coast Guard, they have all been very clear and public about the fact that it is time for this Nation to get into the game and endorse the international Law of the Sea Treaty. I am very pleased that Congressman Y
OUNG is joining me in this effort. I urge all Members to support this reso-lution which will be filed this morning.

RESTORING AMERICA’S GIANTS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. F
OXX) for 5 min-utes. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to talk about a blight that nearly ren-dered the American chestnut extinct and recognize a teacher in Alexander County, North Carolina, who is helping to lead in the rebirth of these great trees. The American chestnut was once the dominant hardwood species in the Eastern United States. Prior to the Eu-ropean colonization of North America, American chestnut trees were found in vast stands from Maine to Florida, with the largest trees occurring in the southern Appalachians. When early European settlers ar-rived, the species was used in many dif-ferent ways, including providing tim-ber and tools. The edible nut was also a significant contributor to the rural economy. Families would collect the nuts to sell and eat, and they were also used as feed for livestock. Domes-ticated hogs and cattle were often fat-tened for market by allowing the ani-mals to gorge themselves on these highly nutritious nuts. Chestnut ripening coincided with the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, and turn-of-the-century newspaper clippings show traincars rolling into major cities that were overflowing with chestnuts to be sold fresh or roasted. The American chestnut was truly a heritage tree. However, the booming trade industry introduced fungal diseases that would change the species composition of east-ern North American forests. A root rot disease, thought to have caused mor-tality of chestnuts in low, moist areas infested southern populations of the American chestnut and constricted its natural range. This fungal disease was followed by the more commonly known chestnut blight, which spread through-out eastern hardwood forests at a rate of up to 50 miles per year. By the 1950s, virtually all mature American chestnut trees had suc-cumbed to the disease, and this catas-trophe became known as one of the worst ecological disasters in the United States. The American chestnut has been relegated to a minor understory component, existing as sprouts from old stumps and root systems. Today modern techniques are being used to bring the species back from near extinction, but the success of these efforts will be the result of dec-ades of genetic hybridization. The American Chestnut Foundation has embarked on an elaborate and time- consuming breeding program to de-velop a tree that can withstand blight and exhibit virtually every char-acteristic of the American chestnut of the past. By backcrossing the Amer-ican chestnut with the blight-resistant Chinese chestnut, the foundation has produced the Restoration chestnut. Last December The American Chest-nut Foundation planted four Restora-tion chestnuts on the campus of Alex-ander Central High School in Taylors-ville. Becky Dupuis, a biotech and biol-ogy teacher with Alexander County Schools, has partnered with the foun-dation to gather information about the health, diversity, and blight resistance of these trees. Her students will ac-tively participate in collecting data, documenting growth rates, and trans-planting American chestnut sprouts in Alexander County. Ms. Dupuis should be commended for raising awareness about the American chestnut and for her work to reintro-duce these giants to their rightful place in Alexander County and Amer-ica’s ecosystem.

SUPREME COURT VACANCIES IN ELECTION YEARS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. H
IMES) for 5 minutes. Mr. HIMES. Mr. Speaker, as you know, it has been the custom of the last couple of Congresses to open the Congress with a reading of the entire United States Constitution. I have gen-erally not participated in that because I am not all that comfortable with pub-lic displays of piety, and I am a big be-liever in the notion that what really matters is what you do, not what you say. Never has the spread between what we say and what we do been quite as wide as it is when we consider the ap-proach that my friends on the Repub-lican side have taken with respect to the absolutely essential constitutional duty of appointing a Supreme Court Justice. So I am going to break with my past pattern and read briefly from the Con-stitution, Article II, section 2, which reads: ‘‘He shall have power’’—that is refer-ring to the President—‘‘by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court.’’ And there it ends. He shall appoint Justices of the Supreme Court. There it ends. There is nothing there about he won’t do that in an election year. There is nothing there saying that if there is not enough time, he won’t ex-ercise his constitutional authority. There is nothing there that, maybe be-cause then-Senator BIDEN said some-thing 25 years ago, he won’t appoint a Supreme Court Justice. And yet my colleagues on the other side of the Capitol have said they won’t even offer the President’s nomination the courtesy of a meeting. And let’s be very clear. That is a profound abroga-tion of the constitutional duty that is set out in black and white in the Con-stitution of the United States. So let’s just spend a minute on the three objections that we are hearing from the Republicans on why the Presi-dent shouldn’t appoint and why they shouldn’t even extend the courtesy of a meeting to the President’s proposed ap-pointment to the Supreme Court. First and foremost, they say that it is an election year. The precedent would dictate that the President not nominate in an election year. Well, that is exactly wrong, and you can look it up. These are historical facts. I will just read quickly from SCOTUSblog, which a lot of people look at, in which Amy Howe, the edi-tor, says: ‘‘The historical record does not reveal any instances since at least 1900 of the President failing to nomi-nate and/or the Senate failing to con-firm a nominee in a Presidential elec-tion year because of the impending election.’’ The historical record does not reveal any instances. And then it goes on to list those that have occurred: President William Taft nominated Mahlon Pitney. Woodrow Wilson made two nominations in 1916—Louis Bran-deis and John Clarke. President Her-bert Hoover nominated Benjamin Cardozo. President Franklin Roosevelt nominated Frank Murphy. President Ronald Reagan, patron saint of my friends on the other side of the aisle, nominated Justice Anthony Kennedy. So the idea that there is no precedent is exactly wrong.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1049 March 1, 2016 
This brings us to the other argument, the second argument, which is that there is not time. I brought this graph-ic here to show that, for the last sev-eral Presidents, the average approval time was something like 2 months. The current President has some 300 days left in his term. Take a look at this one: approval time for Justices Alito, Roberts, Breyer, Ginsburg, and Thomas. If you add all of those individual periods of time together, you still don’t get the amount of time that the current Presi-dent has left in his term. This, of course, brings us to the argu-ably most laughable argument that we hear lately, which is that some 20-plus years ago, then-Senate Committee on the Judiciary Chairman J
OEBIDEN said something along the lines of perhaps then the President shouldn’t make an appointment because it was an election year. b1015 I don’t need to point out that, as much as I like and respect the Vice President, his words of 25 years ago do not carry constitutional force or the force of law. We shouldn’t spend a lot of time on that argument. So what is really going on here? If those are the best arguments against even extending the courtesy of a sen-atorial meeting to the President’s nominee, an unprecedented action, what is really going on? Here is what is really going on. It is a government shutdown. We have seen this before. When the rules we read at the opening of every Congress result in an outcome my friends on the other side of the aisle don’t like, they simply shut it down. They did that in October 2013. Between the days of October 1 and October 16, they shut down the Federal Government, an action that Standard & Poor’s estimated cost the U.S. econ-omy $24 billion, or fully 0.6 percent of our economic growth is gone because the Republicans wouldn’t accept the Affordable Care Act. Look, I get that. They don’t like it. But it has been passed in due course in this House, shown to be constitutional by the Supreme Court, and the answer was: No. We don’t like it. We are shut-ting down the government. Let’s not shut down the government over the Supreme Court.

COLOMBIA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Ms. R
OS-LEHTINEN ) for 5 min-utes. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to bring to the attention of this body the current negotiations tak-ing place in Cuba between the Colom-bian Government and the FARC, which is a U.S.-designated terrorist organiza-tion. That deal is dangerous for Colom-bia and for our U.S. national security. Let me explain. As a friend of the Co-lombian people, I have been a pro-ponent of widening and strengthening our bilateral ties with Colombia by supporting the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement. This agreement has helped many companies in my congressional district of south Florida strengthen their trade capa-bilities with Colombia. I have also supported Plan Colombia, a collaborative effort alongside the Co-lombian Armed Forces and security forces aimed at improving the security environment. Plan Colombia enjoys wide bipartisan support, resulting in a significant reduction in the cultivation of coca in years past, record disman-tling of labs, and drastically reducing kidnappings, which are an important source of revenue for the FARC. Despite great advances in the con-flict during the Uribe administration prior to President Santos, I have ex-pressed serious misgivings about the negotiation initiated by the Colombian Government with the murderous Cas-tro regime as a supposedly impartial mediator. Mr. Speaker, the Castro brothers run an impressive communist state, with complete disregard for human rights, due process, and a notorious history of supporting nefarious actors throughout the region. Using Cuba as a mediator in the ne-gotiation is misguided, at best. It is widely known that the Castro brothers have been great supporters of the ter-rorist group FARC, have allowed the FARC to use Cuba as a safe haven, and have even trained some FARC terror-ists in guerilla warfare tactics. Yet, despite knowing that the Castro regime has internationally voiced strong support for the FARC, even lending materiel and monetary aid to the rebels, we expect the Castros now to be acting as impartial mediators? Absolutely not, Mr. Speaker. With the Colombian Government ne-gotiating with the FARC and with Cuba as a mediator that is supposedly impartial, the pending agreement in-cludes no jail time for any of the FARC criminals. These criminals have kid-napped and tortured scores of Colom-bian citizens and have even held Amer-ican citizens hostage. No jail time. According to the agreement, if the FARC members admit to their crimes, they would be put in what is the equiv-alent of house arrest from 2 to 8 years—8 years is the maximum—and they would not serve any jail time and they will not be extradited to the United States to face any charges they have pending here. You heard that right, Mr. Speaker. This agreement could include a request to drop any arrest warrant and drop any extradition process from the United States that we have filed to prosecute members of the FARC. This is completely unacceptable, Mr. Speak-er. I am also concerned about provisions in the agreement that would allow members of the FARC to run for polit-ical office, as they would likely use the massive funds that they have from their illegal narcotics trade to finance their campaigns and further undermine what the Colombian people are trying to achieve by having a safe, secure Co-lombia again. Evidence has shown that, since the negotiations began with the FARC in Havana, coca cultivation numbers in Colombia have increased. From 2014 and 2015, we have seen an increase of drugs flowing from Colombia. Who do we think is responsible for that? The FARC. Who is making more money from narcotrafficking? The FARC. What I find most disturbing, Mr. Speaker, was the call by the Colombian Government to remove the FARC, an organization with American blood on its hands, from the U.S. State Depart-ment’s Foreign Terrorist Organizations List. Lastly, there are several unanswered questions about the implementation of this misguided deal. How will the FARC disarm? How will they surrender their weapons? What role will the United Nations play as it oversees the implementation of the process? Will the Obama administration continue its pattern of granting concessions and end up releasing FARC leader Simon Trinidad, who is serving time in our prison? Mr. Speaker, the United States must reexamine this agreement and urge the Colombian Government to address some of these grave concerns. We have a responsibility to our taxpayers to be good stewards of their funds as well as a moral imperative to support and seek justice for the victims of the FARC, not their perpetrators. f 
AIRCRAFT NOISE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. G
ALLEGO ) for 5 minutes. Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, on be-half of the people of Phoenix, I rise to demand an end to business as usual at the Federal Aviation Administration. In 2014, the FAA decided, without any input from civic leaders or members of our community, to implement new flight paths for aircraft from Sky Har-bor International Airport. The impact of this decision on local residents was swift and severe. Without warning, our communities were suddenly exposed to constant, deafening aircraft noise. As they run businesses, raise fami-lies, and struggle to sleep at night, Phoenix residents must now contend with the incessant roar of planes pass-ing overhead. Simply put, the new flight paths have deprived the Arizo-nans I represent of the peace and quiet they enjoyed before the FAA inter-vened. Unfortunately, the agency has only exacerbated this difficult situation by overlooking the objections of local residents and ignoring clear direction from Congress to reconsider these routes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH1050 March 1, 2016 
When urged by the House in the 2015 omnibus to ‘‘identify appropriate miti-gation measures’’ to address the prob-lem of aircraft noise in Phoenix, the agency disregarded the will of this body and took no meaningful action. That is simply unacceptable. The American people deserve a government that is responsive to their needs and accountable to their elected officials. We have seen the same pattern of in-difference repeated in cities across the country. But now, finally, leaders from both parties are demanding real reform at the FAA. Democrats and Republicans came to-gether to include the language in the fiscal year 2016 spending bill that will require the FAA to develop a plan to proactively address the concerns of Americans, including Phoenix resi-dents, exposed to high levels of avia-tion noise. In addition, legislation introduced earlier this month to reauthorize the FAA contains several key provisions that could help provide relief to Phoe-nix residents plagued by noise from passing aircraft. The bill will require the agency to review flight path changes if the FAA administrator de-termines that they have harmed com-munities in the vicinity of the airport. The measure will also compel the FAA to consider steps to mitigate air-craft noise-related concerns if re-quested to do so by a local community or airport operator. Finally, the FAA will be required to submit a report to Congress on how the agency intends to improve its woeful community outreach and engagement efforts. Collectively, these provisions rep-resent an important step forward, but they aren’t enough. Together with other members of the Quiet Skies Cau-cus, I am committed to strengthening this legislation as the process moves forward. Mr. Speaker, civic leaders, businessowners, and families in Phoe-nix have been ignored for too long. The flight paths over our city must change and so must the course of an agency that for too long has disrespected Con-gress and disregarded the needs of my constituents. Now is the time to pass legislation to ensure that local communities have a seat at the table when new flight paths are plotted. Let’s give local residents the ability to appeal routes that are undermining their quality of life. Mr. Speaker, on the issue of aircraft noise, the people of Phoenix are speak-ing loudly. They deserve to be heard.

HONORING CALVARY BAPTIST CHURCH ON ITS 150TH ANNIVER-SARY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. J
OLLY ) for 5 minutes. Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an institution that has served the people of Pinellas County, the people of Florida, and people in all corners of the world for 150 years. It is an institution that continues each day to serve our loving God. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Calvary Baptist Church in Clearwater, Florida, as it celebrates its 150th anniversary. In 1866, Reverend C.S. Reynolds and his wife Judith, along with a handful of Christ followers, founded the Midway Baptist Church in Clearwater Harbor, Florida. The church is considered to be the first organized church of any kind in what later became the city of Clear-water, and it was the very first Baptist Church in Pinellas County. During the 1920s, under the leader-ship of Pastor A.J. Kroelinger, the church undertook a major building project in the heart of Clearwater. The ornate rotunda was completed in 1926 and became known as one of the most magnificent buildings in the Southland. It stood as the home for Calvary Baptist Church and was recog-nized as a Clearwater landmark for nearly 80 years. Calvary’s history is a story of God’s grace and providence. It endured the ef-fects of both World Wars and the Great Depression. It continued to experience eras of significant growth under the leadership of Pastor O.E. Burton throughout the 1950s and 1960s and Pas-tor Bill Anderson, who led the church from 1975 to 2002. Since 2004, Pastor Willie Rice has led this vibrant church and its expanding outreach. The church is distinguished by its faithful adherence to the message of God’s love and the redemptive purposes in and through Jesus Christ. The church has served its local community and partnered with others through its historic affiliation with the Southern Baptist Convention, extending its in-fluence of compassion-based ministries around the world. Throughout its history, the body of believers who make up the church have been instrumental in founding and sup-porting many local ministries in the Tampa Bay area. These ministries reach into every facet of human experi-ence. Through partnerships with several community-based pregnancy centers, members of the church provide re-sources and support to struggling preg-nant mothers and their unborn chil-dren, honoring the sanctity of life. They provide clothing, food, and shel-ter to the homeless. The church is faithful each day to honoring our vet-erans. Calvary expresses the redemptive grace of our loving God by directly sup-porting individuals transitioning out of prison as well as recovering addicts. The support they provide to these indi-viduals helps restore dignity and pur-pose of life. The church ministers in many ways to the young people of the community through a vibrant in-house youth pro-gram as well as numerous community outreach programs. Calvary Christian High School opened its doors in the fall of 2000 with the goal of challenging all students to achieve academically to the highest levels of their God-given abilities. Another community outreach pro-gram provides school materials to dis-advantaged elementary students through the Adopt a Classroom project. Supporting children and families is a central element of a Christian life-style. It is central to the mission of Calvary Baptist Church. Internationally, Calvary provides fi-nancial and material resources and hundreds of volunteers to support dis-aster relief and recovery efforts world-wide. Through medical mission trips, the church provides much-needed care to communities in far reaches of the globe. With direct support and through global partnerships, Calvary assists in community development efforts throughout the world. In short, Mr. Speaker, Calvary Bap-tist Church in Clearwater, Florida, has become a part of the fabric of our Pinellas County community, enriching the lives of its members and neighbor-hoods. But far more important, Calvary con-tinues each day to share the message of the saving grace of the Christ in whom we put our faith and in whom we put our trust. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me today in recognizing Calvary Baptist Church of Clearwater, Florida, as it celebrates 150 magnificent years of ministry and service. f 
b1030 RECOGNIZING GRACE PRESTON, AWARD-WINNING BROCKWAY VOLUNTEER The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. T
HOMPSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recogni-tion of Grace Preston, a sixth-grader from the Brockway Area Elementary School, which I am proud to say is lo-cated in the Pennsylvania Fifth Con-gressional District. Grace was recently among two stu-dents in Pennsylvania to be honored with a Prudential Spirit of Community Award. This award is given to young people for outstanding acts of vol-unteerism. Grace has raised more than $4,000 in the past 3 years to improve the lives of animals in her community. She has done this through the sale of home-made dog treats, cat toys, and flea and tick repellent. She became interested in helping ani-mals after her family adopted a dog from a local shelter. Now, through her efforts, Grace has raised enough money to enable the local Humane Society to purchase a storage shed, as well as other supplies such as rabies gloves.

HONORING THE CAREER OF THE HONORABLE THOMAS J. M
CAVOY (Mr. KATKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the career of an esteemed public servant, the Honorable Thomas J. McAvoy. Judge McAvoy has now served as a Federal District Court judge in the Northern District of New York for the past 30 years. During my time as a Fed-eral prosecutor from the Northern Dis-trict of New York, I had the high honor of regularly appearing before Judge McAvoy. A native of New York’s southern tier, Judge McAvoy completed his under-graduate education at Villanova Uni-versity and continued on to graduate third in his class from Albany Law School. He continues to be a very valuable member of the local legal community, mentoring young lawyers through con-tinuing education programs and meet-ing regularly with young people through the Open Doors to Justice and Court Outreach programs. Throughout his 30 years on the bench, Judge McAvoy has tried over 900 cases and recently received the lon-gevity award for 50 years of service to the bar by the Broome County Bar As-sociation. Judge McAvoy has dedicated his life and career to making our com-munity a better place to live. Thank you, Judge McAvoy, for your outstanding public service to our com-munity and to our Nation.

WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH (Ms. FRANKEL of Florida asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speak-er, in honor of Women’s History Month, I want to recognize a remark-able woman from south Florida, my friend, Rosemary Barkett. Rosemary is an inspiring, humble woman with a joyous spirit and passion for justice who has devoted her life to service. Her story reflects the great-ness of diversity in our country. She was born in Mexico to Syrian im-migrants. At age 6, her family moved to Miami, where she started school knowing no English. As a teen, Rose-mary joined the Sisters of St. Joseph, becoming a nun and teacher. Eight years later she left the convent to pursue her own education and even-tually went on to law school, private practice, and a brilliant judicial career as a trial court judge, appellate judge, first woman on the Florida Supreme Court, and first woman to be Chief Jus-tice of that court. Today Justice Barkett sits on the prestigious Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in The Hague. My friend has broken down many barriers to achieve big dreams. This March we honor women like Rosemary Barkett, women of our past, present, and future who are making history. f 
KEEP TERRORISTS AT GUANTANAMO (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute and to re-vise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, last Wednesday The Post and Courier, under the leadership of pub-lisher Pamela Browning and editorial page editor Charles Rowe, editorial-ized: 
President Barack Obama has asked Con-gress to agree to close the prison at Guanta-namo . . . Governor Nikki Haley, Senator Tim Scott, and Republicans on the South Carolina delegation are right to reject his call . . . Even the President has to follow the law. In a world that has given rise to the Is-lamic State, it is hard to credit the argu-ment that the existence of Guantanamo in-cites terror. In a recent op-ed column for the Washington Post, Gordon England, a former Deputy Secretary of Defense, observed that some of the terrorists who have been re-leased from Guantanamo have returned to the same nefarious activities for which they have been jailed. Those who remain had a record of participating in terrorism, financ-ing terrorism, or outright leadership of ter-rorism activity, Mr. England wrote. In a little over 4 weeks, Mr. Obama is head-ed to Cuba for a state visit with the Castro brothers, who may be considered experts in the use of political prisons. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his actions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.

TIGER GRANTS (Mr. HIGGINS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, the De-partment of Transportation has an-nounced its eighth round of grants will be awarded under the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Re-covery, or TIGER, program. TIGER grants are awarded on a com-petitive basis to surface transportation capital projects. Weight is given to proposals that will have a significant local or national impact, generate eco-nomic development, and increase ac-cess to affordable transportation. Western New York has received TIGER grants totaling more than $39 million to restore access to Main

The TIGER program sends the mes-sage during this period of tragic under-investment in our infrastructure that America can still tackle the big projects that historically have grown our economy. I urge support of the TIGER program.

RETIREMENT OF TITUSVILLE POLICE CHIEF GARY THOMAS (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute and to re-vise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I have the deepest respect for the law enforcement men and women who are tasked with protecting the communities of Pennsylvania’s Fifth Congressional District. It is with deep respect that I congratulate Titusville Police Chief Gary Thomas on his upcoming retirement. Chief Thomas has served his commu-nity for nearly 26 years, after being hired as a patrolman in 1990. He is cred-ited with helping fight back against a rise in methamphetamine production in Titusville, which spread through northeastern Pennsylvania, starting in the late 1990s. He worked together with State police and the State Attorney General’s Office to crack down on this plague. More importantly, he enlisted the help of the Titusville community to fight back. After being promoted to police chief in 2009, he continued the battle against drugs—this time, against bath salts and synthetic marijuana—educating the public on what to look for. The ef-fort got results in the form of tips from the community, which helped cut down on abuse. Chief Thomas’ last day on the job is March 4. I wish him the best of luck in retirement, and I commend him for a job well done. 
f 
WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH: SALLY RIDE (Mrs. DAVIS of California asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speak-er, today I would like to celebrate the beginning of Women’s History Month by recognizing a woman from my home State of California, Sally Ride. Sally Ride personifies the Californian and American spirit of exploration and discovery. In 1983, she became both the first woman and the youngest astro-naut NASA has ever sent into space. Over the course of her distinguished career, Ride logged a total of nearly 350 hours in space, and she went on to serve on the committees that inves-tigated the Challenger and the Columbia shuttle disasters. After leaving NASA, she cofounded Sally Ride Science at UC San Diego, which develops educational programs to inspire middle and high school stu-dents, especially girls, about science. Sally Ride had a passion for science and space exploration that inspired generations of girls to pursue STEM. I had a chance to meet her and see how everyone reacted to her. She is exactly the kind of woman we should honor this month, one who achieved her own dreams and paved the way for others to do the same. f 
TERESA HAYWOOD’S STORY (Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute.) Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, the war on coal hurts every family in West Virginia. A local small-business owner affected by the war on coal is Teresa Haywood, who owns a floral shop in McDowell County. She is a true West Virginia coal voice. She writes to me: 
Our business has dropped majorly, and I am struggling day to day to just try to de-cide to pay the bills or to restock. People keep asking if I am going to keep my busi-ness open. It has gotten hard to survive, much less stay in business, when we have to cut on gro-ceries just to make the bills so we can have a home to live in. And then us losing our only Walmart in the county has just been another kick in the teeth. I have a teenage son who worries about finding a job every day because he doesn’t want to move from home and a college senior who won’t come back here because he knows there is nothing for him here. 
Mr. Speaker, these are the true West Virginia coal voices. The war on coal must stop.

ABORTION ACCESS AND WOMEN’S RIGHTS (Mrs. CAPPS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, as has been mentioned, today, March 1, marks the beginning of Women’s History Month. While there is much to celebrate, we must use this time to continue the fight toward full equality. That is why I rise today to reaffirm my support for a woman’s right to make her own deci-sions about her health and her family. This week the Supreme Court will hear arguments on yet another effort to undercut this freedom. By imposing unnecessary requirements whose sole purpose is to close reproductive health clinics, lawmakers continue to play politics with women’s health. Some of us remember the time before women had safe access to abortion care. Countless women made desperate decisions that put their health at risk. We cannot go back to that day. No one can fully know the circumstances that a woman who faces a decision to end a pregnancy is challenged by. We need to trust women and let them make their own decisions along with their healthcare providers, family, and faith, not politicians. f 
HONORING ISAAC OLEMBERG (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, this weekend I had the pleasure of being at Temple Menorah in Miami Beach at the Hadassah Inter-American Chapter Gala in honor of an old and close friend, Isaac Olemberg. Isaac is a pillar of the Jewish and south Florida communities and has greatly enriched our area as well as helped to strengthen the unbreakable bond between the U.S. and Israel. But I know that the work that Isaac was most proud of was working side by side with his wife, Nieves. Sadly, she passed away in 2014, but Sunday’s luncheon was an opportunity to honor her memory as well. Together with Isaac, Nieves helped found the Hadassah Inter-American Chapter in Miami. This couple truly embodied grace, kindness, and humil-ity. Nieves is missed, but her memory and legacy are carried on by Isaac; their children, Roberto, Lilly, Hannah, and Lisette; and their many grand-children. I am proud and humbled to call the Olembergs my friends.

b1215 WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH (Ms. MATSUI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, today we mark the beginning of Women’s His-tory Month. For centuries, women have broken through barriers to move our country forward. The progress that women have made has taken the courage of count-less trailblazers. In Sacramento, Eleanor McClatchy took over the family newspaper busi-ness at a young age. Eleanor had a background in theatre, but a lack of experience in the publishing business did not stop her from stepping up to the plate in 1936 to become president of the McClatchy newspapers. She led the company for 42 years, and under her leadership, the business grew signifi-cantly through the acquisition of addi-tional newspapers, radio, and television platforms. Eleanor’s story may be unique, yet it embodies the spirit of all women. In the face of challenges, we find a path forward. Let us honor women like Eleanor by opening up opportunity to future gen-erations of women because we all know when women succeed, America suc-ceeds.

RARE DISEASE DAY (Mr. DOLD asked and was given per-mission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, yesterday was Rare Disease Day, Leap Year, and researchers around the world have identified more than 6,000 rare diseases, half of which impact children. Last year, the House took a major step toward advancing rare disease re-search. I was proud not only to cospon-sor, but to help pass 21st Century Cures. 21st Century Cures is a bill de-signed to help the world’s best sci-entists find cures for the most deadly diseases that we face. But it is not just the researchers, it is folks like Pat Livney, who is a friend and an advocate working to help cure Charcot-Marie-Tooth disorder, and folks like Jeff Aronin and his team working to solve Duchenne’s disease. Mr. Speaker, every day, scientists across the country are using NIH grants to discover the causes, the symptoms, the treatments, and ulti-mately search for the cures for rare diseases. In honor of Rare Disease Day, I en-courage my colleagues to join me in calling for more funding for the NIH this year and every year so that NIH can cure many of these diseases and ul-timately save lives. And that is just the way it is.

WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH (Ms. HAHN asked and was given per-mission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-ognize Women’s History Month and the bold women pioneers who shattered glass ceilings and paved the way for women across this country to succeed. From the courageous women at the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention who came up with the audacious new idea of women’s rights, to the suffragettes who won the right to vote in 1920, we stand on the shoulders of the giants that came before us. But women’s history does not end there. From the first woman Speaker of the House, N
ANCY PELOSI , to the three women on the Supreme Court, to women candidates for President, bold women continue to break barriers. But there is work to be done. Women are still paid less for the same work as their male counterparts. We are more than half the population, but just 20 percent of Congress. The United States continues to be one of just three na-tions in the world with no paid mater-nity leave law. I know my daughter and my grand-daughters deserve the same opportuni-ties as my sons and grandsons. I am going to fight on behalf of the women across this country until that is a re-ality. HONORING OUR FALLEN POLICE OFFICERS (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Ash-ley Guindon was 28 years old when she reported for duty after being sworn in to the Prince William County Police Department the day before. On her first call, she responded to a domestic violence disturbance. She and her fellow officers rushed to the scene and, upon arrival, multiple gunshots came from the house. Officer Guindon was shot and mur-dered. Yet another one of America’s finest killed in the line of duty. Here she is, a photograph of her, taken the day she was sworn in. The next day, she was murdered. Officers David McKeown, 33, and Jesse Hempen, 31, were also shot, but did survive. Inside the house, the shooter’s wife had also been murdered by the outlaw. Before having her life coldly ripped from her, Guindon served in United States Marine Corps for 6 years. Officers who answer and respond to domestic violence calls respond to some of the most dangerous situations in America. Those who wear the badge protect the rest of us from the evil that lives among us. In the first 2 months of 2016, 14 police officers have been killed in the United States. Mr. Speaker, as her body was trans-ported, over a hundred of Guindon’s fel-low officers somberly lined the streets to pay tribute to one of their own. Death is the harsh reality that these remarkable men and women face every day. Officer Guindon risked her life re-sponding to a domestic violence call. Her life was stolen from her while on duty, her 1 day of service and career as a police officer. Officers like her are a cut above the rest of us, Mr. Speaker. They are a rare and remarkable breed of Americans. And that is just the way it is. f 
WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH (Ms. CASTOR of Florida asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to join the millions of Americans who will mark the annual celebration of March as Women’s History Month. During Women’s History Month, we celebrate the successes of America’s women throughout our history and the sacrifice of the bold women who broke down so many barriers. This year I would like to devote Women’s History Month to saluting our female veterans and military mem-bers who work to keep us safe. And even though the Department of Defense 3 months ago announced that females will now be able to serve in military combat roles, women actually have been serving in combat since the Civil War; like Army Specialist Brit-tany Gordon of St. Petersburg, Florida, who was the first woman from the Tampa Bay area killed in action in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2012 at the young age of 24. And like the many women who serve at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, whether it is at Air Mobility Com-mand, Special Operations Command or Central Command, you women are making history, and you are doing so while you are working to keep us safe. We are grateful for your service to this country during Women’s History Month and every year. f 
CLIMATE CHANGE (Mr. BENISHEK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, as a lifelong resident of Northern Michigan, I know how important it is to protect and conserve our precious natural re-sources. Northern Michigan’s economy depends on our Great Lakes and out-door spaces for tourism, agriculture, and sporting activities. Generations of people in my district have grown up experiencing the out-doors, from the shores of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, to Isle Royale National Park. However, we need to make sure that there is a balance and that we do not undertake rash and unproven regu-latory policies that are almost guaran-teed to negatively impact our economy in the hope of some potential, and often unquantifiable, environmental gain. All too often, the consequence of overly burdensome regulations here in America is the flight of manufacturing and industry to nations such as China and India. Mr. Speaker, these nations simply do not have the same level of protections or respect for the environ-ment that we have here in America. I fail to see how this benefits our planet’s environment. I know that far too often the result is American citi-zens losing their jobs. I hope we can join together to find commonsense and bipartisan ways to continue to protect our environment.

THE TRAGIC SHOOTING IN HESSTON, KANSAS (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay my respects to the vic-tims of the tragic shooting last week in Hesston, Kansas. Renee Benjamin, Joshua Higbee, and Brian Sadowsky each saw their lives lost too early at the hands of a cold-blooded killer. Another 14 people were wounded, and some critically, before authorities ar-rived on the scene at Excel Industries and brought the violence to an end. As someone who grew up just a few short miles away from there, near Yoder, Kansas, and whose father went to school in Hesston, Thursday’s shoot-ing, sadly, hit close to home for me. My wife, Brooke, and I want to send our condolences to the victims of this terrible tragedy and their families. We also want to thank the first re-sponders, police officers, EMTs, doc-tors, and nurses, who are all serving the Hesston community with skill and effectiveness in this time of need. Mr. Speaker, nothing that we do or say will ever be able to bring back the lives lost, but our prayers and support will hopefully be able to help the Hesston community recover and heal from this horrible tragedy.

WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH (Mr. THOMPSON of California asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of Na-tional Women’s History Month, the roots of which are in my district. It was in Santa Rosa, California, that the National Women’s History Project was founded, and I am proud to con-tinue the legacy of recognizing the many contributions women have made to our country by introducing the Na-tional Women’s History Month Resolu-tion. The theme of this year’s bipartisan Women’s History Month is honoring women in public service and govern-ment. And this year I am recognizing five extraordinary women in my dis-trict: Josephine Orozco, Maria Guevara, Evelyn Cheatham, Linda Parks, and Monica Rosenthal. Honoring women should not be lim-ited to 1 month out of the year. We need to work every day to make sure women have the same opportunities as men have to succeed because when women succeed, America succeeds. f 
RECOGNIZING VINNIE VAN GO GO’S (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to recognize Vinnie Van Go Go’s. For over 25 years, Vinnie’s has served quality food at affordable prices in Savannah’s downtown City Market area. Since its founding on February 16, 1991, Vinnie’s has continued to serve excellent ‘‘thin hearty crust Neapoli-tan pizza’’ to Savannahians and tour-ists from all over the world. Just like other Savannah mysteries, its founder and owner notoriously re-mains nameless as numerous Savannah myths revolve around his or her true identity and eccentricities. As a cash-only establishment, Vinnie’s has won multiple awards for its food, including best pizza in the State of Georgia by the Food Network in 2012. It also delivers by professional bicyclists to customers in Savannah’s downtown area. I am proud to recognize Vinnie Van Go Go’s achievement for 25 years as a successful, local and nationally recog-nized business.

WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Women’s History Month. This month is our chance to recommit ourselves to the principle that, when women succeed, America succeeds. Women make up almost half of all workers in America, and working mothers are the primary breadwinners in 40 percent of families. More than ever, women’s success is essential to our Nation’s economy. As we begin Women’s History Month in 2016, I encourage this body to mean-ingfully address the challenges that still exist for women and our families. I am pleased that the National Wom-en’s History Month Project is high-lighting two incredible Floridians as they honor women in public service and government: Nadine Smith, an LGBT civil rights activist and the ex-ecutive director of Equality Florida; and my good friend, Betty Mae Tiger Jumper, the first woman to chair of the Seminole Tribe of Florida and a Presidential adviser. I am so grateful for the contributions these extraordinary women have made to our country, and I am thrilled that they are being recognized in this year’s celebration. f 
EXPRESSING GRATITUDE FOR CAPITOL POLICE OFFICERS (Mr. M
CCARTHY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. M
CCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, 62 years ago today, in 1954, four gunmen entered the House Chamber and they opened fire. They wounded five Mem-bers of our body. As you know, you can still see a bullet hole in the desk on the floor and where they hit the ceiling of our Chamber. And on this day in 1971, a bomb ex-ploded in the Capitol in a Senate bath-room. No one was hurt, but it was a shock that another act of such violence could happen here. In both instances and every day since, our Capitol Police sacrifice and put their lives on the line to protect our visitors, Members, and staff here in the people’s House. It can be easy to forget the impor-tance and the quiet vigilance from those who keep us safe. Our Capitol Po-lice officers go unappreciated too often. Every day, but especially today, we should take some time and thank them for protecting the safety of everyone who visits and works in the Capitol.

RECOGNIZING CHARLOTTE CITY COUNCILMAN MALACHI GREENE (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to recognize former Charlotte City Councilman Malachi Greene, who departed this life on February 25. Although he was born in South Caro-lina, North Carolina was indeed his home. A graduate of Livingstone Col-lege, an HBCU in Salisbury, North Carolina, Malachi was a businessman, a teacher, public servant, and overall model citizen. I had known Malachi for many dec-ades and had the pleasure of working with him on numerous occasions. I ad-mired his steadfast dedication to im-proving the lives of others throughout his work at Bennett College and in the community. In later years, Malachi served two terms on the Charlotte City Council. Throughout his political endeavors, he maintained the ability to appeal to di-verse audiences and work with both parties to ensure that good policies rose above politics. Malachi Greene put his all into pub-lic service and was a voice for the voiceless. He truly loved his commu-nity and his people, and we loved him.

WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark the start of Women’s History Month and to honor all of the women who have shaped our country’s history. So many women have shat-tered glass ceilings along the way, like my friend Dolores Watkins Ennis, one of the first African American sec-ondary schoolteachers in my home-town of Flint, Michigan. While this month we celebrate all of the great achievements of women like Dolores, let us not lose sight of the barriers that women still face in this country. Women make up almost half of all workers. Working mothers are the pri-mary breadwinners for many American families, yet the fight for justice, for equal rights and greater opportunity is far, far from over. We need to promote policies that mean greater opportunity for women and their families, like commonsense sick leave and making child care more affordable. As a Nation, we have to make sure that women who are doing the same work as men get equal pay for that work. This country is a place where we should be building an economy that works for everyone, meaning all fami-lies. We owe it to our mothers, to our daughters, and to our granddaughters.

WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Women’s His-tory Month by highlighting the exem-plary life of Frances E. Willard. Frances Willard earned her place in history by pioneering the temperance movement, breaking barriers in the field of education and leading the movement to obtain women’s right to vote. Her suffrage arguments hinged on her feminist interpretation of Scrip-ture. She said: ‘‘God sets male and fe-male side by side throughout His realm.’’ Although Frances was born in Churchville, New York, in 1839, she quickly made her way to my hometown of Evanston, Illinois, where, among other things, she was the first woman college president in the country to con-fer degrees, the second president of the national Woman’s Christian Temper-ance Union, and a founder of the Na-tional Council of Women. In 1905, the great State of Illinois chose to honor her memory by making her the first woman whose statue ap-pears in the National Statuary Hall Collection. That statue still stands today—just a few feet from us—where she is now a constant reminder of the powerful role of women in American history. This Women’s History Month, let us honor the lives of women like Frances Willard who came before us to create equality for women by helping to give us the right to vote, and let’s do it by expanding that role. When women succeed, America suc-ceeds. f 
LYDIA MARIA CHILD (Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, the district I serve, the Fifth District of Massachusetts, is home to women who have shaped our Nation’s history. I would like to celebrate one of those extraordinary women in celebra-tion of Women’s History Month. When you hear the song, ‘‘Over the River and Through the Woods,’’ you are hearing the words of Medford native Lydia Maria Child, a 19th century nov-elist, poet, abolitionist, Native Amer-ican rights activist, and women’s rights advocate who pioneered early progressive activism with her groundbreaking work. In her fight for justice and equality, she wrote one of the earliest American historical novels, the first comprehen-sive history of American slavery, and the first comparative history of women. As we celebrate Women’s History Month and continue to strive for equal-ity and justice for all women, we take great pride in celebrating the contribu-tions of Lydia Maria Child and the other women leaders who have shaped our great country.

DANNIE A. CARR VETERANS OUTPATIENT CLINIC Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2814) to name the Depart-ment of Veterans Affairs community- based outpatient clinic in Sevierville, Tennessee, the Dannie A. Carr Vet-erans Outpatient Clinic. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH1056 March 1, 2016 
It is only appropriate that his service and his life also be recognized by desig-nating the VA community-based out-patient clinic in Sevierville, his home-town, the Dannie A. Carr Veterans Out-patient Clinic. H.R. 2814 satisfies the committee’s naming criteria and is supported by the entire Tennessee congressional delega-tion, veterans service organizations, including The American Legion, AMVETS, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Paralyzed Veterans of Amer-ica, and Blinded Veterans Association. I understand that the resolutions in support of this action and in honor of Specialist Carr have also passed the municipalities of Pittman Center, Sevierville, Pigeon Forge, Gatlinburg, and Sevier County in Tennessee. Once again, this bill is sponsored by my good friend from Tennessee, Dr. R
OE. He himself is an Army veteran and a senior member of the House Com-mittee on Veterans’ Affairs. I am grateful to him for his hard work and advocacy on behalf of our Nation’s vet-erans through his bill and through his valuable participation on our com-mittee. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 2814. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this legislation to name the commu-nity-based outpatient clinic in Sevierville, Tennessee, after Mr. Dannie A. Carr. Specialist Four Dannie Arthur Carr was born on June 30, 1947, and was originally from Tennessee. He served his country in the Vietnam war as a member of the U.S. Army and as an in-fantryman in B Company, 2nd Bat-talion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cav-alry Division. Dannie was a 1-year veteran of the Army when his tour began on Novem-ber 5, 1968. On July 3, 1969, he was killed from artillery fire under hostile conditions in Tay Ninh Province, South Vietnam. He was only 22 years old. He was awarded the Bronze Star for Valor and the Purple Heart. SP–4 Carr is buried at Zion Grove Cemetery in Tennessee, and each year he is memorialized on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on panel 21W, line 50. Dannie was just one of the many young men who fought and died for the freedom we hold most dear. Naming this facility is just one small way we can honor his memory and make sure that his sacrifice for our Nation will never be forgotten. I want to take this opportunity to thank all of the Vietnam veterans. When they came home from Vietnam 40 years ago, we as a Nation did not prop-erly recognize them, and we should have. Today we are finding that the largest portion of our veterans who are committing suicide are our Vietnam veterans. Many of those men and women were not integrated into the VA health sys-tem; yet if they could get the treat-ment that they need, we could reduce the incidences of suicide, which num-ber about 22 a day. Of this number, only three of these veterans are in the VA health system. It is our time for all of us to soldier up. We need to ensure that all of our veterans are enrolled in the VA sys-tem. So if you know a veteran, make sure to encourage him or her to reg-ister and actively seek help at the VA. If you know a veteran who served dur-ing the Vietnam conflict, make sure you let that veteran know that our country loves them and we really ap-preciate their service. Saying ‘‘God bless America’’ means that God has blessed America with the service of the Vietnam veterans. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. R
OE), a very important person to our committee. Dr. R
OEis an Army veteran himself from the First District of Ten-nessee, Johnson City. Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I thank both Chairman M
ILLER and Ranking Member B
ROWN for their kind remarks. It is a great honor to be here today, Mr. Speaker, as I rise to support H.R. 2814, which honors the sacrifice of a Vietnam war hero and names the VA clinic in Sevierville, Tennessee, after Specialist Four Dannie Arthur Carr. Four Specialist Carr was an unmar-ried soldier who was killed in action and left no children to carry his name. I can think of no higher honor than to lend his name forever to the Veterans Affairs facility in his hometown. The son of a Baptist minister and World War II veteran, Carr was born in June of 1947 in Sevier County, Ten-nessee. He attended Gatlinburg-Pitt-man High School, where he was a star basketball player. b1245 Carr entered the United States Army at the age of 20 in 1967 and proudly served B Company, 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, 1st Division. In combat, Carr displayed valor, having been awarded two Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star. He was killed in action by artillery fire on the day before Independence Day, July 3, 1969, at age 22. The heroism of Specialist Carr is well known and held in high regard throughout Sevier County. All the local municipalities have approved res-olutions supporting the naming of this Veterans Affairs community-based out-patient clinic after Carr. In Tennessee, aptly nicknamed the Volunteer State, we hold a proud his-tory of volunteerism in military serv-ice and ensure that the legacy of those who fought and died for this country is preserved. Naming this facility after Dannie Carr will do exactly that, preserve the legacy of an American patriot who bravely gave his life at such a young age. Mr. Speaker, I would like to note that this bill does not remove anyone’s name from the VA clinic in Sevier County. The facility I propose naming after Carr is a vacant medical facility that, through the leadership of Sevier County Mayor Larry Waters and Sevierville Mayor Bryan Atchley, we were able to secure a lease to the De-partment of Veterans Affairs for a whopping $1 per year. It is not cur-rently named after another soldier. Specialist Carr is an obvious top choice when considering this honor. I urge my colleagues to preserve the legacy of this brave American soldier, Specialist Dannie A. Carr, taken from this Earth at such a young age, and pass this legislation. Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. I would like to acknowledge that there are 1,000 Delta Sigma Theta vis-iting with us on the Hill today during Women’s History Month. I want to thank the families and thank the leadership for bringing this bill naming to us today, Mr. Dannie A. Carr. I want to once again thank the Viet-nam veterans for their service to this country. God has blessed America with their service. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, again I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. M
IL-
LER) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2814. The question was taken; and (two- thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-fornia (Mr. I
SSA), a fellow Army vet-eran. Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, of the several postal namings that we will be voting on today, in my humble opinion, none can recognize a more significant con-tribution than this one. Many will pay honor to those who have served their country, particularly those in the mili-tary. But this post office, located at the Mainside of Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, is being named not on be-half of one or two or five, but for the many, many, many marines who have deployed from Camp Pendleton since 1942. With over 42,000 marines and sailors currently stationed there and with its history in World War II, the Medal of Honor recipients whose names will ap-pear on the plaque at what is now a numbered Mainside post office will re-mind all of those who come to that base and come to that facility that people like Colonel William Barber, who received the Medal of Honor for actions at the Chosin Reservoir in Korea, and over 250 Medal of Honor re-cipients, more than any other base I know of in the world—it will represent those who gave their last measure, those who did for their colleagues and their comrades far more than any of us could imagine ever finding the courage to do. I hope the naming of this will finally allow us to name what we do not have enough roads for, we do not have enough signs for, we do not have enough post offices for, and that is to recognize that the base at Camp Pen-dleton and its post office, as a result of the authority of this committee, has put out corpsmen and marines for dec-ades who have served our country in a way that no other base could take such pride in. I hope that all who hear this will rec-ognize that we have named many post offices after an individual, but never after an act. And the act of heroism that earns the Medal of Honor is unpar-alleled to any American. I thank the chairman for his assist-ance, and I thank the ranking member for bringing this bill in a timely fash-ion. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. I, too, am pleased to join my col-leagues—in particular, my friend from California (Mr. ISSA)—in the consider-ation of H.R. 136. Camp Pendleton, located in southern California, is the West Coast’s largest expeditionary training facility for the U.S. Marine Corps. In the over 230 years of Camp Pendleton’s existence, hundreds of thousands of brave men and women have made great sacrifices there to protect our country. Many of these courageous marines and Navy corpsmen have posthumously received the Medal of Honor, our Na-tion’s highest award for valor, in rec-ognition of their extreme heroism and selflessness. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to commemorate the heroic actions members of our military take every day to defend our freedom. The Medal of Honor recipients who have passed through Camp Pendleton have earned our eternal gratitude. By naming this post office in their honor, we show them the respect they deserve. I urge passage of H.R. 136. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of this meas-ure introduced by Congressman I
SSAof California. Mr. Speaker, Camp Pendleton, in ad-dition to being a United States Marine Corps base in southern California that is home to 42,000 active marines and sailors, also has a distinguished his-tory. Many of our Nation’s servicemen and -women have been based out of Camp Pendleton since it was first opened during World War II. H.R. 136 designates the main post of-fice on base in honor of all of the brave warriors from Camp Pendleton units that have received the Medal of Honor. I urge Members to support this bill to name a post office for these distin-guished warriors. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. R
USSELL ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 136. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-ceedings on this motion will be post-poned. FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ACT AMENDMENTS OF 2016 Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2347) to amend the Federal Advi-sory Committee Act to increase the transparency of Federal advisory com-mittees, and for other purposes, as amended.

Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H.R. 2347, introduced by Congressman W
ILLIAM  ‘‘L
ACY’’ CLAY. H.R. 2347 was introduced by Representative C
LAY to help im-prove the governance and transparency of the Federal advisory committees. Congress acknowledged the merits of using advisory committees to acquire viewpoints from business, academic, and other interests when it passed the Federal Advisory Committee Act in 1972. While not necessarily well known, Federal advisory committees are small bodies of people who provide advice, guidance, or recommendations to Fed-eral policymakers on a wide range of topics. All told, in fiscal year 2014, 825 Federal advisory committees held 7,173 meetings at a cost to the American taxpayer of more than $334 million. While these committees undoubtedly provided a number of valuable insights, it is important that we continue to work to ensure that these committees produce the best value for the tax-payer. Unfortunately, some agencies note that the FACA requirements are cum-bersome and resource intensive, thus reducing the ability of the committees to focus on substantive issues in a timely fashion. Both governmental agencies and pri-vate groups say that the 1972 act does not do enough to require agencies to promote openness and transparency. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2347 works to ad-dress these problems and bring trans-parency to Federal advisory commit-tees and the Federal agency decision-making process. It also clarifies transparency of com-mittee membership by requiring mem-bers to be selected without political af-filiation, giving agency heads author-ization to require members to fully dis-close conflicts of interest and treating those individuals who regularly attend and participate in committee meetings to be considered as a member, even if they are not allowed to vote. H.R. 2347 classifies transparency of committee activities further by ensur-ing the committee’s advice, informa-tion, and recommendations are judg-ments of the committee and not the agency and, also, by requiring each agency to make available on their Web site the committee and its activities. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. I reserve the balance of my time.

EAR MR. CHAIRMAN : On October 9, 2015, the Committee on Oversight and Govern-ment Reform ordered reported without amendment H.R. 2347, the Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments of 2015, by unanimous consent. The bill was referred primarily to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, with an additional referral to the Committee on Ways and Means. I ask that you allow the Ways and Means Committee to be discharged from further consideration of the bill so that it may be scheduled by the Majority Leader. This dis-charge in no way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future refer-rals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be necessary, I would support your re-quest to have the Committee on Ways and Means represented on the conference com-mittee. Finally, I would be pleased to in-clude this letter and any response in the bill report filed by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, as well as in the Congressional Record during floor consider-ation, to memorialize our understanding. Thank you for your consideration of my request. Sincerely, J
ASON CHAFFETZ , Chairman.

EAR MR. CHAIRMAN : Thank you for your letter regarding the Committee on Ways and Means’ jurisdictional interest in H.R. 2347, the ‘‘Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments of 2015.’’ I wanted to notify you that the Committee on Ways and Means will forgo action on H.R. 2347 so that it may pro-ceed expeditiously to the House floor for con-sideration. This is conditional on our mutual under-standing and agreement that doing so will in no way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means. In addi-tion, the Committee reserves that right to seek conferees and requests your support when such a request is made. I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming this understanding with respect to H.R. 2347, and would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be in-cluded in the Congressional Record during Floor consideration of H.R. 2347. Sincerely, K
EVIN BRADY , Chairman. 
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. Let me first thank my colleague, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. R
US-
SELL), as well as the majority party for working with us to get this bill to this forum and to get it ready for passage. I rise in strong support of the Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments. I have introduced this bill in each of the last four Congresses, and I am hopeful that this time the bill will make it to enactment. b1300 The Federal Advisory Committee Act is one of our core open government laws. FACA is intended to ensure that advisory committees provide objective advice and operate with transparency. Over time, however, agencies have im-plemented FACA inconsistently and judges have created loopholes in the law. This bill closes the loopholes that allow agencies to get around the Act. Currently, agencies can avoid FACA’s requirements by conducting committee business through subcommittees. This bill makes it clear that FACA applies to subcommittees as well as to the par-ent committees. The bill also clarifies that a com-mittee that is set up by a contractor is subject to FACA if it is formed under the direction of the President or an agency. Under FACA, agencies would be required to disclose how advisory members are chosen, whether they have financial conflicts of interest if they are appointed to provide their own expertise, and who they work for if they are representing a specific inter-est. This bill includes changes to lower the cost of implementation based on discussions with the Congressional Budget Office. Specifically, the bill would include a more streamlined defi-nition of what would be considered a committee under the bill. This bill will make the government more accountable by shedding light on who is advising the government and on how one is advising the government. I thank my colleagues for their co-operation in this effort. This is a good government bill, and I urge its passage. Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-ance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I urge the adoption of the bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. ROS- L
EHTINEN ). The question is on the mo-tion offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. R
USSELL ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2347, as amended. The question was taken; and (two- thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

MAYA ANGELOU MEMORIAL POST OFFICE Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3735) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service lo-cated at 200 Town Run Lane in Winston Salem, North Carolina, as the ‘‘Maya Angelou Memorial Post Office’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3735 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. MAYA ANGELOU MEMORIAL POST OF-FICE.

GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-bers may have 5 legislative days to re-vise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. I rise in support of H.R. 3735, which was introduced by Congresswoman A
LMA ADAMS of North Carolina and is supported by the entire North Carolina delegation. The bill designates the post office located at 200 Town Run Lane in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, as the Maya Angelou Memorial Post Office. Madam Speaker, Dr. Maya Angelou held a distinguished career that earned her over 80 honorary degrees. She was an American author, poet, and civil rights activist. Dr. Angelou was born on April 4, 1928, in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1981, she moved to Winston-Salem, North Caro-lina, where she accepted the Lifetime William Neal Reynolds Professorship of American Studies at Wake Forest Uni-versity. For over 30 years, she served as a professor at Wake Forest University and became a community leader. Dr. Angelou made literary history with her 1969 acclaimed memoir, ‘‘I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,’’ when she became the first African American woman to make the nonfic-tion bestseller list. She served on two Presidential com-mittees: the American Revolution Bi-centennial Council, under President Ford, and the National Commission on the Observance of International Wom-en’s Year, under President Carter. In 1993, upon the request of President Clinton, Dr. Angelou composed a poem to read at his inauguration. That poem, entitled ‘‘On the Pulse of Morn-ing,’’ was broadcast live around the world. In 2000, President Clinton awarded Dr. Angelou the National Medal of Arts. She received recognition from the White House under the following Presi-dents as well. In 2005, Dr. Angelou

penned and delivered the poem entitled ‘‘Amazing Peace’’ for President George W. Bush at the Christmas tree lighting ceremony. In 2010, President Barack Obama presented her with the Presi-dential Medal of Freedom, the coun-try’s highest civilian honor. Dr. Angelou called Winston-Salem home, which became her final resting place on May 28, 2014. Madam Speaker, H.R. 3735 would name a post office in her honor, a post office located in the community she called home. I urge Members to support this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-vania. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 3735, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 200 Town Run Lane in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, as the Maya Angelou Memorial Post Office. Born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1928, Maya Angelou is best known for her literary talents as an author and poet. While the 1970 autobiography that re-counts her life, ‘‘I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,’’ remains her most notable work, Maya Angelou authored dozens of other award-winning novels, essays, and poems, many of which reflect on her own life and experiences as well as on broader social and political issues. Prior to her prolific literary career, Angelou also experienced success as a singer, actress, civil rights activist, and educator. Her many accolades in-clude the Presidential Medal of Free-dom, which was bestowed upon her by President Barack Obama in 2010. Dr. Angelou passed away in May 2014. Madam Speaker, we should pass this bill to honor the legacy of Maya Angelou and the countless contribu-tions her life and work made to the many facets of American society. I urge the passage of H.R. 3735. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I re-serve the balance of my time. Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-vania. Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gen-tlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. A
DAMS ), my fellow freshman colleague. Ms. ADAMS. I thank my colleague for yielding. Madam Speaker, I rise during a spe-cial month, Women’s History Month, to urge the passage of H.R. 3735, which is legislation to honor the life of Dr. Maya Angelou, an African American woman who broke barriers and served as an inspiration for so many young and old throughout this Nation. My legislation, H.R. 3735, designates the Center City postal facility at 200 Town Run Lane in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, as the Maya Angelou Memo-rial Post Office. Dr. Angelou was a distinguished au-thor, writer, poet, and activist, which earned her renowned success and over 80 honorary degrees. She became the first nonfiction bestselling African American female author for her 1969 memoir, ‘‘I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.’’ She was also the first African American woman to have a script filmed for the 1972 movie ‘‘Georgia,’’ which was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. In addition to her literary successes, Dr. Angelou became a prolific academi-cian. In 1981, she moved to Winston- Salem, North Carolina, which I am proud to represent. She accepted the Lifetime William Neal Reynolds Pro-fessorship of American Studies at Wake Forest University, and she went on to serve there for more than 30 years. Dr. Angelou received many accolades throughout her lifetime, including three Grammies for spoken word al-bums and two NAACP Image Awards. Her work has become the crown of American literature and has been rec-ognized by Presidents Carter, Clinton, and George W. Bush. In 2010, President Barack Obama presented her with our Nation’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Winston-Salem was Dr. Maya Angelou’s home and is her final resting place; so renaming this postal facility in her honor is a small, yet thoughtful, way to recognize her influence and to celebrate her life in the community she deeply loved. Dr. Angelou understood the impor-tance of history. She was historic in her own right. She understood who she was, what her history was, and she un-derstood her struggles. In her own words, she said, ‘‘History, despite its wrenching pain, cannot be unlived, but if faced with courage, need not be lived again.’’ Madam Speaker, it is my hope that my colleagues will join me in voting favorably for H.R. 3735 so as to rename the Center City postal facility in Win-ston-Salem, North Carolina, after Dr. Maya Angelou, one of our country’s greatest writers, inspirational thought leaders, and an overall phenomenal woman. Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN ). Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, it is always a big decision when you name a local post office after somebody. I think people should investigate Maya Angelou a little bit and perhaps Google ‘‘Maya Angelou’’ and look at other ar-ticles in places like the ‘‘American Thinker’’ or ‘‘The American Spec-tator.’’ Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-vania. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I urge the adoption of the bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3735, a bill to name a post office in Winston-Salem, North Carolina as the Maya Angelou Memorial Post Office. Dr. Maya Angelou’s illustrious legacy is be-fitting this well-deserved recognition. Multi-talented barely covers the depth and breadth of Maya Angelou’s accomplishments. She was an author, actress, screenwriter, dancer, civil rights activist, professor, and poet. Born Marguerite Annie Johnson on April 4, 1928, in St. Louis, Missouri, Maya Angelou is perhaps best known for her 1969 memoir, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. In 1971, Maya Angelou published the Pul-itzer Prize-nominated poetry collection Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water ’Fore I Die. Maya Angelou received several honors throughout her career, including two NAACP Image Awards in the outstanding literary work (nonfiction) category, in 2005 and 2009 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2010. During World War II, Maya Angelou moved to San Francisco, California, where she won a scholarship to study dance and acting at the California Labor School. Also during this time, Maya Angelou be-came the first black female cable car con-ductor in San Francisco, California. In the mid-1950s, Maya Angelou’s career as a performer began to take off, when she land-ed a role in a touring production of Porgy and Bess, later appearing in the off-Broadway pro-duction Calypso Heat Wave (1957) and re-leasing her first album, Miss Calypso (1957). As a member of the Harlem Writers Guild and a civil rights activist, Maya Angelou orga-nized and starred in the musical revue Cab-aret for Freedom as a benefit to raise funds for Dr. King’s Southern Christian Leadership Conference, Maya Angelou also served as the SCLC’s northern coordinator. In 1961, Maya Angelou appeared in an off- Broadway production of Jean Genet’s The Blacks with James Earl Jones, Lou Gossett Jr. and Cicely Tyson. While the play earned strong reviews, Maya Angelou moved on to other pursuits, spending much of the 1960s abroad, first living in Egypt and then in Ghana, working as an editor and a freelance writer at the University of Ghana. After returning to the United States, Angelou was urged by friend and fellow writer James Baldwin to write about her life experiences. Maya Angelou’s efforts resulted in the enor-mously successful 1969 memoir about her childhood and young adult years, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, which made literary his-tory as the first nonfiction best-seller by an Af-rican-American woman, making Maya an inter-national superstar. Since publishing Caged Bird, Maya Angelou continued to break new ground not just artis-tically, but educationally and socially. She wrote the screenplay for the film drama Georgia, Georgia in 1972—and made history as the first African-American woman to have her screenplay produced. Maya Angelou went on to earn a Tony Award nomination for her role in the 1973 play Look Away and an Emmy Award nomination for her work on the television miniseries Roots (1977). Maya Angelou also published several collec-tions of poetry, including Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water ’Fore I Die (1971), which was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. One of Maya Angelou’s most famous works is the poem ‘‘On the Pulse of Morning,’’ which she wrote especially for and recited at Presi-dent Bill Clinton’s inaugural ceremony in Janu-ary 1993, the first inaugural recitation since 1961, when Robert Frost delivered his poem ‘‘The Gift Outright’’ at President John F. Ken-nedy’s inauguration.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH1062 March 1, 2016 
Maya Angelou went on to win a Grammy Award (best spoken word album) for the audio version of the poem. In 1995, Maya Angelou again made history, this time for remaining on The New York Times’ paperback nonfiction best-seller list for two years—the longest-running record in the chart’s history. Seeking new creative challenges, Maya Angelou made her directorial debut in 1998 with Down in the Delta, starring Alfre Woodard. She also wrote a number of inspirational works, from the essay collection Wouldn’t Take Nothing for My Journey Now, to her ad-vice for young women in Letter to My Daugh-ter. Interested in health, Angelou has even pub-lished cookbooks, including Hallelujah! The Welcome Table: A Lifetime of Memories With Recipes and Great Food, All Day Long. Among her numerous accolades are the Chicago International Film Festival’s 1998 Au-dience Choice Award, Acapulco Black Film Festival in 1999 for Down in the Delta; and two NAACP Image Awards for Outstanding Literary Work The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a close friend, was assassinated on Maya Angelou’s 40th birthday, April 4, 1968, and from that year forward Maya Angelou refused to celebrate her birthday; instead, she would send flowers to Dr. King’s widow, Coretta Scott King, for more than 30 years, until her death in 2006. President Barack Obama has called Maya Angelou ‘‘a brilliant writer, a fierce friend, and a truly phenomenal woman,’’ who ‘‘had the ability to remind us that we are all God’s chil-dren; that we all have something to offer.’’ Madam Speaker, I can think of so many other reasons why Dr. Maya Angelou’s illus-trious legacy deserves this profound recogni-tion, but I leave you with these words from Dr. Angelou’s poem, Still I Rise: 
Leaving behind nights of terror and fear. I rise. Into a daybreak that’s wondrously clear. I rise. Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave. I am the dream and the hope of the slave. I rise. I rise. I rise!

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. I rise today in support of H.R. 1132, introduced by Congressman J
ERRY  M
CNERNEY of California. The bill des-ignates the post office located at 1048 West Robinhood Drive in Stockton, California, as the W. Ronald Coale Me-morial Post Office Building. Madam Speaker, Mr. Coale spent much of his life in public service and was incredibly involved in his commu-nity in Stockton, California. Born in Stockton, he attended the local schools there and graduated from Stockton College. He also earned his teaching certificate in the field of transpor-tation and distribution from the Uni-versity of California at Berkeley. A veteran of the Korean war, he served in the United States Army from 1952 to 1954 and was honorably dis-charged. Mr. Coale went on to serve in numerous capacities, supporting local government and public transportation. In fact, he served as a member of the Stockton Port Commission for 22 years. Madam Speaker, Mr. Coale was elect-ed to the Stockton City Council in 1983 and was subsequently elected to the of-fice of vice mayor in 1985, where he served for the next 5 years until 1990. He also served as chair of the San Joaquin County Council of Govern-ments in 1958, while representing the Stockton City Council as vice mayor. Mr. Coale was then appointed by the Stockton City Council to the Stockton Port District board of port commis-sioners in 1981 and served in that posi-tion until March of 2013. He also served in the San Joaquin County Council of Governments, rep-resenting the Stockton Metropolitan Transit District board of directors, the Stockton City Council, and the Stock-ton Port District board of port com-missioners. Mr. Coale was a former member and past chairman of the Stockton Salva-tion Army advisory board and a former gubernatorial appointee to the Atascadero State Hospital advisory board, serving for 8 years as the Gov-ernor’s appointee. A Thirty-third Degree Scottish Rite Mason, Mr. Coale was appointed to the Office of Personal Representative of the Sovereign Grand Inspector General of California for the Stockton Scottish Rite in April of 1992. He served in that position until May of 2003. He also served as a trustee of the California Scottish Rite Foundation during that time period. As a veteran, Ron also belonged to the Karl Ross Post of the American Le-gion in Stockton. Madam Speaker, Mr. Coale passed away in April of 2014 at the age of 81.

I urge Members to support this meas-ure. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-vania. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 1132, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 1048 West Robinhood Drive in Stockton, California, as the W. Ronald Coale Me-morial Post Office Building. Ronald Coale was born in 1932 and led a life of dedicated public service, begin-ning with service to his country during the Korean war. A member of the Stockton Metro-politan Transit District board of direc-tors beginning in 1973, Mr. Coale rather quickly took on a leadership role, chairing the board from 1975 until 1983. He later served local government and the transit sector through his positions as a council member and vice mayor for the city of Stockton, chairman of the Stockton Port Commission, a member of the San Joaquin Council of Governments board of directors, and worked on behalf of the California Pub-lic Utilities Commission and California Trucking Association. Mr. Coale passed away at the age of 81 in April 2014. Madam Speaker, we should pass this bill to recognize W. Ronald Coale’s in-spiring life of public service and to

CNERNEY. Madam Speaker, all the things I wanted to say about Mr. Coale have already been said, so it is going to be personal. I met Mr. Coale when I first got elected. He approached me and asked me if he could be on my service acad-emy advisory board. Of course, I didn’t know much about that at the time. I was glad to appoint him. He did a won-derful job. He always was there with a smile and a warm handshake. He did his best for the community. He did his best for our United States Army and the service academies. I really appre-ciated the opportunity to get to know him. He is missed. His family has always been very fond of their father and their husband and so on. I share that fond-ness, and I miss him. Mr. Coale has a great legacy, and I am proud that we are able to get a post office named after him. I urge my col-leagues to vote ‘‘aye’’ on this measure. Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-vania. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. R

GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-bers have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. I rise today in support of H.R. 2458, introduced by Congressman R
ICHMOND  of Louisiana. The bill designates the post office located at 5351 Lapalco Bou-levard in Marrero, Louisiana, as the Lionel R. Collins, Sr. Post Office Build-ing. Madam Speaker, Judge Collins made history by being the first African American to win an elected office posi-tion in the Jefferson Parish of Lou-isiana. He dedicated his life to making New Orleans a more just and equal community. Judge Collins was born in Harvey, Louisiana, and not only maintained his roots in the New Orleans area, but also contributed tremendously to the city. After serving in the United States Army and graduating from Howard University School of Law, Judge Col-lins returned to New Orleans and initi-ated his career as a pioneering civil rights attorney. He led groundbreaking cases that overturned discriminatory practices. He also integrated West Jef-ferson Hospital and Jefferson Parish Public Schools. In 1977, Judge Collins received an in-terim appointment from the Louisiana Supreme Court to serve as a judge. He was the first African American to do so. He was then reelected to serve a second term, during which his fellow judges elected to name him chief judge. He was the first African American to hold this position. Judge Collins broke further barriers, both in his courtroom decisions and in his personal accom-plishments. In 1988, Judge Collins passed away at the age of 60. Naming this postal facil-ity for the Honorable Lionel Collins will memorialize his groundbreaking achievements in civil rights and his lifelong dedication to the New Orleans community. I urge my colleagues to support the bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-vania. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am happy to echo and second the el-oquent words that were just said by my colleague on the other side of the aisle. Rather than repeat them or preempt the next speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. RICHMOND ). Mr. RICHMOND. Madam Speaker, I am honored to stand here today in sup-port of a bill to designate the Marrero, Louisiana, post office for Lionel Col-lins, Sr. We will name a number of post of-fices today, and I just want to state why it is important to me and why it makes a difference: because as a kid, when you pass buildings and you pass things that have names on them, it makes you go back and research who was that person and what did they do so great to get a building or a facility named after them. I hope that today when we pass this bill to name this post office after Judge Lionel Collins, that kids will get a chance to pass by and say: ‘‘What made Lionel Collins deserving of a post of-fice?’’ and ‘‘When I grow up, will I be deserving of a post office?’’ and ‘‘What is it I need do in my life to make a dif-ference?’’ When they go back and they do the research, they will see that Judge Lio-nel Collins was a pioneering civil rights lawyer. He dedicated his life to making Louisiana a more just and equal State for them. He was the first African American to win elected office in Jefferson Parish where he served as the judge in the 24th Judicial District in Gretna. Lionel had long roots in the metro-politan area. He was born in Harvey in 1927 and attended Gilbert Academy be-fore serving in the United States Army. After that, he went on to the es-teemed Xavier University, and then went on to receive his juris doctorate from Howard University in 1954. Throughout his career as a lawyer, Judge Collins played a major role in the civil rights struggle in the South. Beginning in 1957, Lionel led groundbreaking cases that helped to overturn practices of White-only jobs and higher pay for White employees at the Celotex Corporation. Lionel continued to successfully steer desegregation cases with the NAACP across Louisiana. His work in-tegrated West Jefferson Hospital and the Jefferson Parish Public Schools. His courtroom successes and courage in the civil rights initiatives earned him the role of Jefferson Parish’s first African American assistant parish at-torney in 1968. As already mentioned, in 1977, Lionel made history by receiv-ing an interim appointment from the Louisiana Supreme Court to serve as judge to the newly created Division L of the 24th Judicial District. He was re-elected to a second term and named chief judge by his fellow judges.

In addition to his civil rights work, Judge Collins served the New Orleans area community throughout his career. He served as a board member for the Urban League and Selective Service. As a testament to his life legacy, the Jefferson Parish School Board voted to rename Ames Montessori School in Marrero as Judge Lionel R. Collins Ele-mentary in 2011. I thank Chairman C

UMMINGS for bring-ing this bill to the floor and congratu-late Lionel’s family for this wonderful recognition.

GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-bers have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. RUSSELL. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-port of H.R. 3082, introduced by Con-gressman CEDRIC RICHMOND of Lou-isiana. The bill designates the post of-fice located at 5919 Chef Menteur High-way in New Orleans, Louisiana, as the Daryle Holloway Post Office Building. Madam Speaker, Officer Daryle Holloway was a 22-year veteran of the New Orleans Police Department and the father of three children. On June 20, 2015, Officer Holloway lost his life in the line of duty while transporting a suspect to the police station. Prior to his tragic death, Officer Holloway served his community for more than two decades. He attended Corpus Christi Elementary and grad-uated from St. Augustine High School, both located in New Orleans, the com-munity in which he served. Madam Speaker, Officer Holloway had deep roots in the community he served. Throughout his life, he contin-ued to attend the Friday night football games in support of the St. Augustine High School Purple Knights. His connection to the community was reflected in the way he approached his work. He became a police officer during the early days of community- oriented policing, an initiative where officers and residents worked together in order to combat crime and ensure safety. During his 22 years at the New Orle-ans Police Department, he not only protected the streets of New Orleans, but worked with children in the Cops for Kids summer camps. There, he again emphasized and maintained a healthy relationship among the police, youth, and their families. Madam Speaker, New Orleans will re-member Officer Holloway as a dedi-cated law enforcement officer and, more importantly, as a friend. Naming this post office after Officer Daryle Holloway will memorialize both his un-forgettable sense of humor and his life-long dedication to the city of New Orle-ans. I urge Members to support this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-vania. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, it is clearly a busy day in New Orleans. Much like the pre-vious bill, rather than speaking and simply repeating the eloquent words that were previously spoken, I would rather yield such time as he may con-sume again to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. R
ICHMOND ), my col-league, who proudly represents his State. Mr. RICHMOND. Madam Speaker, again, I will say that naming this post office in honor of a true public servant and a young man who grew up in the area, a young man who ultimately sac-rificed his life to make sure that other people would be safe, who dedicated his life to protecting and serving the resi-dents of New Orleans, will inspire other young kids in that same area, other young kids who grow up in that area, like I did, to look at police work as a life of service and with the possibility of going into law enforcement. That post office bearing the name for Officer Daryle Holloway, I think, will do just that. But Daryle was special. He was a big guy. He was the life of the party, but he knew at a young age that he wanted to be a police officer. Unfortunately, he was killed at the young age of 46 in the line of duty on June 20, 2015, while transporting a suspect to the police station. He was the father of three chil-dren. As mentioned earlier, he had very deep roots in the community. He at-tended Corpus Christi and was a grad-uate of St. Augustine High School. He joined the police force not too long after finishing high school and re-mained a passionate supporter of his alma mater. It was mentioned that he would be at the football games cheering on the Purple Knights, but what wasn’t men-tioned was that he was always the life of the party. Daryle did become a police officer in the early days of community policing in an effort to focus on officers’ en-gagement with residents in the com-munities they serve. He was a natural fit for the police department because he was friends with just about every-one in the city. He was drawn to police work because he genuinely wanted to help people and make New Orleans a safer place for all of us to live. Daryle served with the New Orleans Police Department for 22 years. In addition to protecting our streets, he spent 10 years working with children in the Cops for Kids summer camps, which help develop relation-ships between police, youth, and their families. Daryle also brought commu-nity policing into the Florida and De-sire housing developments. After his passing, many of those former residents and summer campers organized a vigil to honor the man they considered not only a police offi-cer but a friend. I would like to personally add that in my eighth grade year at St. Aug, Daryle Holloway, big Daryle Holloway, made sure that little CEDRIC RICHMOND  was protected from everyone in the school. He started his life of serving and protecting probably with me. What he did to mentor kids in the neighborhood and live his life so that he could be an example, especially for young men of color growing up in rough neighborhoods, to show how you carry yourself, responsibility, and com-mitment, and how to be a family man, how to be a great father, and how to be

a great son was truly a testament to Daryle Holloway. I know his mother, Olander Belfield Holloway, is probably watching us today. When I talked to her, she said: C
EDRIC , I just feel so special that peo-ple remember my son and remember the fact that he died in the line of duty doing what he wanted to do the most, and that was protect the citizens of New Orleans. Again, I would like to thank Chair-man C
HAFFETZ and Ranking Member C
UMMINGS for bringing this bill to the floor and to once again offer the Hollo-way family my sincerest condolences. I hope that this postal facility will serve as a reminder of Officer Holloway’s courage and compassion for genera-tions to come. Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-vania. Madam Speaker, clearly, as we just heard, Officer Holloway is exactly the kind of person that we should rec-ognize as a country. It is also a re-minder—and I say this representing hundreds, if not thousands, of Philadel-phia police officers in my district. It is a reminder of just how dangerous the job of being a police officer is in our so-ciety. It is quite clear that Officer Hollo-way paid the ultimate sacrifice to Lou-isiana and also to our country. He is worthy of this honor. I urge all those in this House to adopt this bill. Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-ance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-bers may have 5 legislative days to re-vise and extend their remarks and in-clude extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. RUSSELL. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-port of H.R. 3274, introduced by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. J
OHN-
SON). The bill designates the post office located at 4567 Rockbridge Road in Pine Lake, Georgia, as the Francis Manuel Ortega Post Office. Madam Speaker, Officer Ortega was a dedicated public servant who was trag-ically killed in the line of duty. He was born in New York City on February 27, 1980. He later attended Lawrence High School in Lawrence, Massachusetts. At the time of his death, he was pursuing an associate of science degree in crimi-nal justice from Griffin Technical Col-lege in Griffin, Georgia. Officer Ortega had two children, Frankey and Kaylie. He worked as a part-time officer at Pine Lake Police Department and as a full-time officer at Georgia Regional Hospital. His dedi-cation to peace and safety compelled Officer Ortega to regularly work 80- hour weeks. Tragically, on August 11, 2005, a sus-pect fatally shot Officer Ortega in front of the Pine Lake Post Office during a routine traffic stop. It is only fitting that this post office be named in honor of this dedicated public servant. Madam Speaker, Officer Ortega will be remembered for his commitment to justice and courage in the face of dan-ger. He desired to stand up for what was right and not what was easy, hav-ing made the ultimate sacrifice in giv-ing his life for the protection of his community. Naming this post office after Officer Francis Ortega will memorialize his passion for justice and tremendous dedication to the community of Pine Lake, Georgia. I urge Members to sup-port this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-vania. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. J
OHNSON ) in order to speak and elaborate a little more on Officer Ortega’s life and his sacrifice and service. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member, and I also thank the chair for bringing this bill forward. I also want to thank the members of the DeKalb County, Georgia, chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police, as well as the Georgia chap-ter of the Fraternal Order of Police, for helping us with this legislation. Madam Speaker, today I rise in sup-port of H.R. 3274, a bill to rename the Pine Lake, Georgia, Post Office in honor of a fallen police officer, Officer Francis Manuel Ortega. On August 11, 2005, Officer Ortega was tragically killed in front of the Pine Lake Post Office while conducting a routine traffic stop. Officer Ortega was shot and killed after stopping a vehicle for a minor traffic violation. As Officer Ortega communicated with dispatch, the perpetrator exited his ve-hicle and approached the police cruis-er. The perpetrator ignored Officer Ortega’s order to get back into his ve-hicle, and a struggle ensued. The perpe-trator pulled a gun, shot, and killed Of-ficer Ortega. The killer then ran into the post office and committed suicide. Officer Ortega was a part-time officer of the Pine Lake Police Department, and he was a full-time officer at the Georgia Regional Hospital. Officer Or-tega, like many men and women who choose law enforcement as a career, was not driven by the mere pursuit of wealth. Officer Ortega was motivated by the desire to serve others and to keep our communities safe. Unfortunately, because society doesn’t pay police officers the full value of their service, Officer Ortega was forced to work a number of part- time jobs. His dedication to peace and safety within the community com-pelled him to work, regularly, 80-hour workweeks. As the chair just men-tioned, he was a student pursuing a de-gree in criminal justice. Officer Ortega is survived by his par-ents, Francisco and Luz; his sister, Joann; and his children, Frankey and Kaylie. Officer Ortega made the ultimate sacrifice and gave his life to protect his community. I can think of no better way to preserve his memory and to honor his legacy than to dedicate this facility as the Francis Manuel Ortega Post Office Building. b1345 Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-vania. Madam Speaker, like we heard previously about Officer Holloway, Of-ficer Francis Manuel Ortega is clearly worthy of this honor. My heartfelt sympathies go to his family. I hope today it might bring them some small measure of comfort. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill. I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-bers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their re-marks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. I rise today in support of H.R. 3601, introduced by my colleague from Rhode Island, Congressman J
AMES  L
ANGEVIN . The bill designates the post office located at 7715 Post Road, North Kingstown, Rhode Island, as the Melvoid J. Benson Post Office Build-ing. Madam Speaker, Ms. Benson was born on February 13, 1930, in Jackson, Tennessee, and moved to North Kingstown, Rhode Island, in the 1960s. Once there, Ms. Benson dedicated her life to public service and to the people of the State of Rhode Island. In 1965, she began what would become a 25-year teaching career in the North Kingstown School Department. Ms. Benson then served in the Rhode Island State House of Representatives for 14 years and spent the subsequent 8 years serving on the North Kingstown School Committee. She served on the School Committee until 2014, when, at the age of 84, Ms. Benson made the decision not to seek reelection. Madam Speaker, all told, Ms. Benson spent nearly 50 years in public service. In February 2015, Ms. Benson was honored with a lifetime achievement award from the North Kingstown Democratic Town Committee. In continued appreciation to Ms. Benson, Representative LANGEVIN in-troduced H.R. 3601, which names a post office in her honor. The Melvoid J. Benson Post Office Building would be an important fixture showing the gratitude of many for Ms. Benson’s years of dedication to her community and her service to the State of Rhode Island. I urge Members to support the bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-vania. Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gen-tleman from Rhode Island (Mr. L
AN-
GEVIN ), my friend. Mr. LANGEVIN. I thank the gen-tleman for yielding. Madam Speaker, I am truly honored and pleased to rise today in support of H.R. 3601, a bill to designate the facil-ity of the United States Postal Service located at 7715 Post Road, North Kingstown, Rhode Island, as the Melvoid J. Benson Post Office Build-ing. As my colleague stated, for more than 50 years Mel Benson has been a consummate public servant, dedicating her time to educating our youth, fight-ing for social justice, building up our communities, and giving back to her friends and neighbors. Born Melvoid Estes on February 13, 1930, in Jackson, Tennessee, Mel grew up in the segregated South, but that did not stop her from pursuing an edu-cation and becoming active in politics. Her father worked for the railroad, and her mother was a teacher. Accord-ing to Mel, they both instilled in her the importance of education. ‘‘Every generation,’’ they said, ‘‘must do bet-ter than the last.’’ Mel took their advice to heart and made education a priority. She grad-uated from high school in 1947 and went on to receive her bachelor’s de-gree from Lane College in social science with a minor in education. Two years later she married her high school sweetheart, Arnathia ‘‘Ben’’ Benson, who joined the Navy after college. Mel taught her first class at an all- Black school in Madison County. How-ever, as a Navy wife, she wouldn’t stay in Tennessee for long. She and her hus-band were eventually stationed at Quonset Naval Base in North Kingstown, Rhode Island, which would become Mel’s new home and a commu-nity she would forever change for the better. After moving to Rhode Island in the 1960s, Mel taught in the North Kingstown school system for 25 years. She educated students at Hamilton El-ementary, the former Quonset Elemen-tary; Davisville Middle School; and Wickford Middle School. Every student she taught was touched by her wisdom and guidance. According to Matthew Leonard, chair-man of the North Kingstown Demo-cratic Town Committee, who had Mel as a teacher in the eighth grade, she possessed a wonderful gift. Her whole focus was education and children,’’ Matthew recounted. ‘‘She believed the future is in children, and our greatest goal is to continue on to the next generation.’’ She carried that belief all the way to the State house of representatives, where she became the first Black woman elected to the Rhode Island Legislature from the Second Congres-sional District and the second Black woman elected to the legislature from the entire State. According to Mel, she never thought of herself as a Black woman in the statehouse. She was there to do the work of the people. That is exactly what she did, proudly representing the town of North Kingstown for 14 years. I was fortunate enough to serve with Mel in the statehouse and she made a wonderful teammate and friend. She always spoke her mind and knew how to get things done. As State Senator James Sheehan put it, ‘‘Mel could be tough as bricks. When she was after something, she’d let you know it.’’ It was that passion that led to some of her proudest accomplishments as a member of the Rhode Island General Assembly, including her early involve-ment with the planning and develop-ment of Quonset Business Park and particularly the rehabilitation of the old Kiefer Park into modern housing. After a distinguished career in the statehouse, Mel was elected to the North Kingstown School Committee, where she served for 8 years, until 2014. At the age of 84, Mel decided not to seek reelection. But 2 years later, she still hasn’t lost her spark. Well known for her perseverance, wit, and unmistakable candor, Mel has touched the lives of countless Rhode Is-landers—my own included—and people still love to regale in stories of the great Mama Mel. State Representative Robert Craven, who has known Mel since 1974, de-scribed her as someone who just rel-ished the opportunity to be involved in people’s lives and make a difference in every capacity, as a wife, a mother, a schoolteacher, a State representative, and a School Committee member. Beth Cullen, who considers Mel like a mother, characterized Mel’s impact upon our community perfectly: ‘‘She really taught North Kingstown a lesson that it doesn’t matter what you look like. It’s what you do; and she lived it every day.’’ Madam Speaker, I couldn’t agree more. Mel has truly dedicated her life

SECOND LT. ELLEN AINSWORTH MEMORIAL POST OFFICE Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4046) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service lo-cated at 220 East Oak Street, Glenwood City, Wisconsin, as the Second Lt. Ellen Ainsworth Memorial Post Office. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4046 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SECOND LT. ELLEN AINSWORTH ME-MORIAL POST OFFICE. 
(a) D ESIGNATION .—The facility of the United States Postal Service located at 220 East Oak Street, Glenwood City, Wisconsin, shall be known and designated as the ‘‘Sec-ond Lt. Ellen Ainsworth Memorial Post Of-fice’’. (b) R
EFERENCES .—Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the facility re-ferred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the ‘‘Second Lt. Ellen Ainsworth Memorial Post Office’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to the rule, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. R
USSELL ) and the gen-tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. B
RENDAN F. B OYLE ) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma. Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. D
UFFY ), my friend and colleague. Mr. DUFFY. I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for yielding. Madam Speaker, today I rise to rec-ognize Second Lieutenant Ellen Ainsworth of the Seventh District of Wisconsin for her bravery, sacrifice, and service to her country during World War II. Second Lieutenant Ainsworth grew up in the Wisconsin farming commu-nity of Glenwood City, where she is still recognized for her service and her sacrifice. Ellen was well known around town as a caring young woman who loved to sing. She had a beautiful voice. Folks in town saw her as a leader and a go- getter. When duty called, she selflessly answered that call of duty. In 1942, she entered the United States Army Nurse Corps after graduating from nursing school at the Minneapolis Eitel Hospital. She was first deployed to Tunisia and then, shortly after, to Italy, where she was assigned to the 56th Evacuation Hospital. Although the risk was high, it did not stop Lieu-tenant Ainsworth from honorably serv-ing her country. On February 10, 1944, Lieutenant Ainsworth’s hospital tent came under heavy artillery attack in an area many described as hell’s half acre. Under heavy enemy fire, Lieutenant Ainsworth disregarded her own well- being, evacuating 42 patients to safety, only stopping when she was hit by shrapnel from an exploding ordnance. Lieutenant Ainsworth succumbed to her wounds 6 days later. At just 24 years old, she was the only Wisconsin servicewoman to make the ultimate sacrifice during World War II. Ainsworth was buried in the Sicily- Rome American Cemetery and Memo-rial in Italy. Lieutenant Ainsworth was post-humously awarded a Silver Star, a Pur-ple Heart, and a Red Cross Bronze Medal. A portrait of her currently hangs in the Pentagon as a testament to her bravery in the face of chaos and destruction. The courageous actions of Lieuten-ant Ainsworth are witnessed today by the children of the soldiers who she saved, who would not be here if not for her heroism. She personified the honor and dignity through sacrifice that so many of her fellow Wisconsinites dis-played during World War II. Her death was a tragedy for the small town of Glenwood City. Over 72 years later, Lieutenant Ainsworth still has a large presence in that community. A health clinic, a veterans home as well as the American Legion post in her hometown have all been named in her honor. Madam Speaker, it is my honor to sponsor H.R. 4046, a bill that names the Glenwood City Post Office after Lieu-tenant Ellen Ainsworth. It will stand as a reminder of the bravery of one American from Wisconsin’s Seventh Congressional District. Please join me to recognize this most deserving hero and Wisconsinite as we name the post office at 220 East Oak Street, Glenwood City, Wisconsin, the Second Lt. Ellen Ainsworth Memorial Post Office. b1400 GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-bers may have 5 legislative days to re-vise and extend their remarks and in-clude extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I also support this important piece of legislation introduced by the gen-tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. D
UFFY ), my colleague and friend. Rare is the in-dividual, such as Second Lieutenant Ellen Ainsworth, who served in the Army Nurse Corps. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-vania. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, but I will be brief. One of the nice things about doing this is getting to hear the stories of or-dinary Americans who make tremen-dous sacrifices. And clearly, Second Lieutenant Ainsworth was an extraor-dinary American who made such a sac-rifice. I am proud to support this resolution, and I urge its adoption. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Madam Speaker, I urge the adoption of this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. R

MOMENT OF SILENCE TO RECOG-NIZE AND HONOR THE ‘‘HESSTON STRONG’’ OF HESSTON, KANSAS (Mr. POMPEO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. POMPEO. Madam Speaker, last week, a gunman shot his way across south central Kansas, and then inside of Excel Industries in Hesston, Kansas, killed three people and injured over a dozen. It is impossible to make sense of such violence and suffering. Renee Ben-jamin, known by her friends for her ‘‘infectious personality’’; Joshua Higbee, a loving father who family and friends said ‘‘would give the shirt off his back for you’’; and Brian Sadowsky, a passionate Kansas City Royals fan who coworkers said stayed behind to help the wounded escape were simply doing their jobs taking care of themselves and families. The loss of these three innocent people is something that no one in Hesston or our larger community will ever forget. The lives of those who loved them are changed forever. I was not surprised to see so many people working side by side the day after the attack trying to mend what happened less than 24 hours before. Ev-erywhere I went, there were helping hands. This is so typical of the people of Hesston and Harvey County that I know so well. Their actions amidst this tragedy are a true reflection of what the Scriptures tells us: ‘‘Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.’’ There was remarkable power in the work of law enforcement officials and city leaders, including Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton and Hesston Mayor David Kauffman. Excel Industries, where the shootings took place, is blessed by the steady leadership of President Paul Mullet, who, along with his team, will lead the Excel Industries family through this tragedy. We remember, too, all the first re-sponders, the Hesston Police Depart-ment, Harvey County Sheriff’s Office, the FBI, and the Kansas Bureau of In-vestigation, all of whom acted hero-ically to save lives and secure the scene, and the leaders at Newton Med-ical Center, Wesley Medical Center, and Via Christi in Wichita, who cared for the injured. We can never thank them enough. The community has rallied around the words ‘‘Hesston Strong.’’ They have been, they are, and I know they will continue to be strong. May God bless the entire Hesston community. Madam Speaker, I ask that the House pause for a moment of silence in honor of those impacted by the tragic events in Hesston, Kansas. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would ask all in the Chamber to rise in a moment of silence.

GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of S. 1596, in-troduced by Senator R
OBPORTMAN of Ohio. The bill designates a post office that is located at 2082 Stringtown Road in Grove City, Ohio, as the Specialist Joseph W. Riley Post Office Building. Mr. Speaker, on November 24, 2014, United States Army Specialist Joey Riley gave his life serving his country as part of Operation Enduring Freedom in Kabul Province, Afghanistan. Specialist Riley was just 27 years of age. A native of Grove City, Ohio, he graduated from Grove City High School in 2005. Specialist Riley made the honorable and brave decision to enlist in the United States Army in June of 2012. In March 2013, Specialist Riley was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 3rd Bri-gade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Di-vision, at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He became a decorated soldier with awards and decorations, including the Bronze Star Medal, the Purple Heart, the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, the Afghan-istan Campaign Medal with a Cam-paign Star, the Global War on Ter-rorism Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, the Overseas Service Ribbon, the NATO Medal, the Combat Infantry-man Badge, and the Parachutist Badge. Mr. Speaker, it is my hope that we will name the post office in his home-town to memorialize the courage and sacrifice of the United States Army and this fine paratrooper, Specialist Joey Riley. I urge Members to support this bill to name a post office in honor of this sol-dier. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of S. 1596. Joseph Riley, a native of Grove City, Ohio, excelled in football at Grove City High School. Following his graduation in 2005, he went on to play football at Capital University. In 2012, as was mentioned, Joseph joined the Army and was assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division, stationed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Specialist Riley showed a special concern for the people of Afghanistan, believing that the fight was worthwhile in order to improve the lives of others. Specialist Riley’s life was tragically cut short when a suicide bomber at-tacked his vehicle in Kabul, Afghani-stan, killing him and seven others. Remembered by friends and col-leagues as a superb paratrooper and the kind of friend everyone hopes for in their lives, Specialist Riley’s honors, as mentioned, included the Bronze Star Medal, Purple Heart, Combat Infantry-man Badge, and Basic Parachutist Badge. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to honor the courage and selflessness exhibited by Specialist Joseph Riley and to memorialize the sacrifices he made for our country.

LIEUTENANT COLONEL JAMES ‘‘MAGGIE’’ MEGELLAS POST OF-FICE Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 1826) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 99 West 2nd Street in Fond du Lac, Wis-consin, as the Lieutenant Colonel James ‘‘Maggie’’ Megellas Post Office. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 1826 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. LIEUTENANT COLONEL JAMES ‘‘MAGGIE’’ MEGELLAS POST OFFICE. 
(a) D ESIGNATION .—The facility of the United States Postal Service located at 99 West 2nd Street in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, shall be known and designated as the ‘‘Lieu-tenant Colonel James ‘Maggie’ Megellas Post Office’’. (b) REFERENCES .—Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the facility re-ferred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the ‘‘Lieutenant Colonel James ‘Maggie’ Megellas Post Office’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to the rule, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. R
USSELL ) and the gen-tleman from Missouri (Mr. C
LAY) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma. 
GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Oklahoma? There was no objection. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of S. 1826, in-troduced by Senator R
ONJOHNSON of Wisconsin. The bill designates the post office at 99 West Second Street in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, as the Lieutenant Colonel James ‘‘Maggie’’ Megellas Post Office. Our colleague and fellow member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Representative G
LENN GROTHMAN , introduced a House companion bill, but we are pleased today to be taking up the Senate version, as it will get to the President’s desk faster. Retired United States Army Lieuten-ant Colonel Megellas is a highly deco-rated veteran of World War II and an individual whose story is one of re-markable bravery. He graduated from college in 1942, ac-cepting a commission as a second lieu-tenant in the United States Army, where he served—courageously, I might add—as an elite paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne Division. One of the most remarkable stories about Lieutenant Colonel Megellas comes during service in the Battle of the Bulge, where he single-handedly de-stroyed a German Panther tank and saved the lives of many of his men. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to sup-port this bill and name a post office after this true American hero. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. Mr. Megellas was born and raised in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, and was com-missioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army following his graduation from Ripon College in 1942. As was mentioned, serving as a para-trooper in the 82nd Airborne Division during World War II, then-1st Lieuten-ant Megellas courageously led his pla-toon in the Battle of the Bulge. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to commemorate the strong leadership

Lieutenant Colonel James Megellas ex-hibited in his courageous defense of our country during World War II. I urge the passage of S. 1826. I reserve the balance of my time. b1445 Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Wis-consin (Mr. G
ROTHMAN ), my friend and colleague. Mr. GROTHMAN. First, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma and my col-league from Missouri for saying such nice things about Lieutenant Colonel Megellas. I also thank Senator J
OHN-
SON, who did a good job of getting this through the U.S. Senate. Mr. Speaker, as has been said, Lieu-tenant Colonel Megellas was born in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, and went to school in Ripon, Wisconsin, before he joined the military. He was truly a hero of the Greatest Generation. His most notable battle experiences in-cluded action in the Italian mountains near the Anzio beachhead, his combat jump into Holland as part of the Oper-ation Market Garden, his crossing of the Waal River under heavy German fire in broad daylight, and the Battle of the Bulge in January of 1945, when he singlehandedly destroyed a German Mark V Panther Tank and led his pla-toon on one of the most distinctive ac-tions of the war without there being a single American casualty. We have also offered a private bill that tries to get Mr. Megellas the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Battle of the Bulge. Today, Mr. Megellas lives in Colleyville, Texas, with his wife, Car-ole. I have met him and it was just tre-mendous. Currently he is 98 years old. In a couple of weeks he will be 99. He is as sharp as a tack and is agile. I am very honored to be able to introduce this bill, and I just can’t look forward enough to the day in Fond du Lac when I will see Lieutenant Colonel Megellas’ name up there at the post office on 2nd Street. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, that was quite a description of Mr. Megellas at the young age of—about to be—99. He should be an inspiration to us all. I urge the passage of the bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of the bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call for the immediate passage of S. 1826, a bill to rename the post office located at 99 West 2nd Street in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, as the Lieutenant Colonel James ‘‘Maggie’’ Megellas Post Office. It is my great honor to recognize Lieutenant Colonel James Megellas (Ret), and to call Maggie a constituent of the 24th District of Texas. In 1942, Maggie accepted an ROTC com-mission as a second lieutenant in the infantry and shortly thereafter faced combat in Italy. Notably, in January 1945, Maggie and his pla-toon advanced toward Herresbach, Belgium, and came upon 200 German troops who were advancing out of town. In an act of selfless-ness and bravery, Lt. Col. Megellas sprinted toward a German tank as it took aim at his fel-low soldiers. He disabled the tank with a gre-nade, then dropped another into the tank eliminating the threat his men faced from the combat vehicle. Lt. Col Megellas has been honored with many awards, including the Silver Star and the Distinguished Service Cross. Lt. Col Megellas is beyond deserved of having this post office location named in his honor. I continue to commend Maggie on serving his country with honor and bravery, as a shining example of courage and as a member of the greatest generation America has known. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the 24th Congres-sional District of Texas, I ask all my distin-guished colleagues to join me in recognizing the sacrifice and bravery of Lt. Col Megellas and urge for the swift passage of S. 1826. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. R
USSELL ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 1826. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-ceedings on this question will be post-poned. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn.

WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH (Ms. D
ELAURO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Ms. D
ELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Permanent Commission on the Status of Women, Connecticut’s leading force for women’s equality. Formed under State statute in 1973 to study and improve the economic secu-rity, health, and safety of Connecticut women, the Commission undertakes vital work to eliminate gender dis-crimination in its many forms. They have helped to shape the debate around issues that impact the lives of Con-necticut women and their families, and it has created public policy that makes a difference. Notably, it had a leader-ship role in creating the first family and medical leave protections in the country and, in Connecticut, in becom-ing the first State in the Nation to pass paid sick days. I have focused much of my time in Congress on these issues and I have often turned to the Commission for guidance and for support. It is with great pride and with my deepest thanks that I rise today to celebrate their work.

OPERATION RESPECT The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-uary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Cali-fornia (Mr. GARAMENDI ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, today is a different subject than I usu-ally discuss in the course of these Spe-cial Order hours. Normally we come down here and we talk about how we are going to create jobs, how we are going to make better opportunities for people through education. We talk about making it in America, rebuilding our infrastructure, manufacturing, and the like. Yet, today, there is something else on my mind, and it happens to be an issue that I first came across in ele-mentary school. On the school grounds at Mokelumne Hill Elementary School—a three-room school that was built in the late 1800s— there were not many kids, but there was always one kid who seemed to be picked on. I am not exactly sure why that young boy was the one to be picked on, but he was bullied. As the years go by, I suspect we for-get about those things, but we know that the children are always listening. They are listening to each other on the school grounds and they are likely to join in this bullying and in picking on some kid on the grounds. That hap-pened at Mokelumne Hill Elementary School many, many years ago. As our own kids were growing up, my wife would always say, ‘‘Remember the children are listening. They are listen-ing to what you have to say and they are going to copy what you say.’’ In the year 2000, I was with my wife at a concert here in the Washington area, and Peter, Paul and Mary were performing that night. Towards the end of the performance, Peter Yarrow said, ‘‘I have a new song, and I would like you to pay careful attention to this song. This song is really important to me.’’ I suppose his other songs dealing with wars and peace were equally im-portant, but he highlighted this par-ticular song. The song was ‘‘Don’t Laugh At Me.’’ Don’t call me names. Don’t make fun of me because I am short or tall or wear glasses. After the performance was over, we were invited to go out to dinner with Peter that night. He asked, ‘‘What did you think of the song?’’ I said, ‘‘It reminded me of my school,’’ because people were laughing at that kid. He said, ‘‘I want you to do some-thing.’’ He said, ‘‘I want you to take this song and make it into a national movement against bullying so as to try to teach our young children to stop bullying.’’ I told him I didn’t have time for that, as we were returning to California after the 2000 election. He said that doesn’t make any sense because Cali-fornia has the same problem. I learned right away you don’t say no to Peter Yarrow, so I began to work with him on a program that became

known as Operation Respect. I worked with him for about 3 to 4 years, and then I moved on and Operation Respect moved on. It is now found in 22,000 schools across the United States. It is a simple program. You can find it online. It is Operation Respect. You can download the song. You can download the text. It is there. There are 22,000 schools across the United States that are trying to help our young children understand what bullying means. Bullying means that 160,000 Amer-ican children do not go to school each day because they are afraid. They are afraid to endure another day of bul-lying—verbal, sometimes physical— from their peers. Twenty-two percent of teenagers in a National Study of Adolescents reported that they had been bullied or victimized. The reasons for bullying are many. Usually it is about looks, as 55 percent say it is about looks; it is about body shape— too big, too tall, too fat, too slender— at 37 percent; and race at 16 percent. Students who experience bullying are at an increased risk of experiencing poor adjustment at school, sleep dif-ficulties, anxiety, depression. Also, stu-dents who engage in the bullying be-havior are at risk of having academic problems, substance abuse, and violent behavior later in their adolescence and adulthood. In surveys, approximately 30 percent of young people admit to bullying oth-ers, and 70 percent of young people say that they have seen bullying in their schools. I did when I was growing up. Seventy percent of schools’ staffs say that they see it. Eighty-one percent of students who identify as LGBT were bullied last year based on their sexual orientation. What does it mean? It means that certain lives are seri-ously disrupted and that there is un-happiness and depression in those lives, but it also means violence. Do you remember Columbine? The perpetrators were frequently harassed by athletes and other stu-dents before coming to school, and then they came to school with firearms and explosives, killing 13 and injuring 21. Do you remember Virginia Tech? Seung-Hui Cho was picked on and bullied by his peers before he killed 32 people in 2007. In Santa Barbara, California, the shooter wrote a 130-page manifesto about how he had been severely bullied in high school, and he killed six and in-jured 14. There are those who are violent to others and who are equally violent to themselves. 12-year-old Rebecca Sedwick suffered from cyberbullying. She received messages over social media, and she killed herself. In Mon-tana, an 18-year-old with learning dis-abilities committed suicide. Another shot himself in the chest after endur-ing bullying and hazing from the high school football team. He was pushed into lockers, punched in the head. He quit the football team after the first week, telling his dad, ‘‘I am being picked on at school,’’ in the suicide note he left that night. He shot him-self. He blamed bullying. The children are listening. They lis-ten to each other. They learn bullying and they carry it on. Operation Re-spect attempts to deal with this, as does Peter Yarrow’s song from Peter, Paul and Mary, ‘‘Don’t Laugh At Me.’’ Don’t laugh at me because I am tall, short, Black, White, young, old, or be-cause I wear glasses. Don’t laugh at me. The children are listening. Across America, what are the chil-dren listening to today? What are they listening to today by our leaders, by the people who purport to lead the strongest nation in the world? b1500 What are they hearing? My daughter is a kindergarten teach-er. Her kids come to class and are re-peating what they hear on television. They are calling each other a desperate person. They are saying to each other: ‘‘He’s a desperate person,’’ ‘‘He’s a sad person,’’ ‘‘He’s a pathetic person.’’ Kids come to class and are repeating what they heard on television: ‘‘He doesn’t even use his last name in his ads,’’ ‘‘He’s a sad person,’’ ‘‘He’s abso-lutely crazy,’’ ‘‘I mean, this guy is a nervous wreck.’’ I have never seen anything like it. They repeat what they have heard on television. So what are our kids learn-ing? What are they learning from peo-ple who want to be our national leader? Well, they are probably learning that you can say things like: ‘‘He’s the least talented. . . .’’, ‘‘He’s done poorly,’’ ‘‘He goes away like a little sheep.’’ Maybe our kids are talking to each other and they are repeating what they have heard on television: ‘‘You could see the blood coming out of her eyes,’’ ‘‘She’s a bimbo,’’ ‘‘Look at that face,’’ ‘‘Would anyone vote for that?’’, ‘‘Can you imagine that face on the next president?’’, ‘‘I mean, she’s a woman and I’m not supposed to say bad things, but really, folks, come on. Are we seri-ous?’’ The kids are listening, folks. The kids are listening to the national de-bate. For years, we have known bul-lying is a problem. We know it. We see it in the classrooms. We see the result of violence. We see the fact of disrespect. We know it leads to shootings. We know it leads to school shootings. We know it leads to suicides. Yet, on our national television every night people that want to lead this Na-tion are bullying each other. They are saying disrespectful things that are personal that don’t have a thing to do with policy, just as though it was a kindergarten school ground: ‘‘Now, I’ve watched a part of his little act and he’s a desperate guy,’’ ‘‘He’s not presi-dential material, I can tell you,’’ ‘‘He doesn’t have the demeanor,’’ ‘‘He’s a nervous Nellie,’’ ‘‘Putting on makeup with a trowel,’’ ‘‘He was so scared like a little puppy.’’ That is bullying. That is bullying. And if you were in kindergarten, you would be at the principal’s office. Our kids are listening. So what is the message? That it is okay to bully? It is okay to demean people? What is the message? 16,000 kids stay home from school each day because of bullying. And on national television? They pur-port to lead this Nation. So what are we to do? I guess we are going to have to take programs like Operation Respect, Operation Trevor, and other programs that try to help our children understand the result of bullying, what actually happens, not just to the children that are being bullied, but also to those who engage in bullying. So what are we teaching? What are we teaching our children? What Pan-dora’s box are we opening across this Nation when demeaning each other is the national discourse in how we select the next President of the United States? That it is okay to call your rival names? It is not about their policies, not about what we are going to do with our national security, but, rather, what makeup you might be wearing or the nature of one’s face. Calling each other unhinged, unstable, a liar, is this what we have come to? That night Peter Yarrow sang that song for the first time in concert: ‘‘Don’t laugh at me. Don’t call me names. Don’t make fun of me.’’ There are consequences. There are consequences. You tear a person down far enough and maybe you will win an election, but every child across this Nation is listening. They are listening. What are they going to do when they go to school the next day? Well, it is okay. We could call each other names. I can make fun at you. I could laugh at you. After all, it is on television: ‘‘Had one of those sweet little mustaches,’’ ‘‘Maybe to make sure his pants weren’t wet,’’ ‘‘Maybe he should sue whoever did that to his face.’’ Operation Respect. 22,000 schools across this Nation are trying to impart to our children that we all have value, that whether you are tall or short or fat, whether you are Black or White or whatever color, whatever you want to be in life, it is okay. It is okay. You are important. You have value. We are not going to de-mean each other. We are not going to bully each other. You are important. Whatever you are, whatever you may be, you are important. That is Oper-ation Respect. Trying to teach the young children in 22,000 schools to respect each other, to respect the differences, to under-stand and to learn that we all share space on this planet and that each one of us, whatever we may be, whatever we may think about the solution to the world’s problems, we have value.

turn the TV on. I will guarantee you that I will find a Presidential can-didate bullying another candidate just as though it was a school ground. I know that the children are watch-ing. I know that all that Operation Re-spect is trying to do and all of the other programs around this Nation that are trying to teach our children to respect each other, to not engage in bullying—I know that their work will be erased from the blackboard by to-night’s television. After all, it is Super Tuesday. And leading up to Super Tuesday, you and I know what we have heard. Is our Nation better for it? I don’t think so. Because I know that the chil-dren are watching, and I know some-how an awful message is going out across this Nation that it is okay to demean another person, it is okay to pick on somebody because of their makeup, because of the nature of their face, because they happen to be a woman. I fear the result of all of this. I don’t fear the policies. The policies come and go. We debate here on the floor more military, less military; more edu-cation, less education; the environment is good, climate change is real, climate change is not. That is legitimate. That is the way America ought to be. But to call a woman a bimbo or to say you peed your pants, what in the world is this all about? It is about our children. It is about our future and about telling us what it is okay to do. Well, it is not okay because the chil-dren are listening. Thank God we have organizations—Operation Respect and others—that are somehow trying to push back. They are not going to stop every violent act. At least some kid isn’t going to pick up a gun and walk into the school and start blasting away because he has been bullied. I yield back the balance of my time.

NATIONAL DEBT AND SPENDING The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-uary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Ar-kansas (Mr. W
ESTERMAN ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. WESTERMAN. I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include ex-traneous materials on the subject of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Arkansas? There was no objection. Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I was trained as an engineer. In my engi-neering training, we were taught that, before you can solve a problem, you have to identify and define the prob-lem. If you solve the wrong problem, you accomplish very little. I serve on the Budget Committee. On the Budget Committee, we take an in- depth look at all of government. As we examine the programs and as we exam-ine revenues and expenditures of the Federal Government, we see many issues that are of great concern to the future of our country. We see threats to our safety and our security. We see overreach and hassles created by the very government that is here to serve. Mr. Speaker, there is a gargantuan issue facing our country that threatens all our futures. Our gross national debt, fueled by out-of-control spending, continues to grow and is past $19 tril-lion, which exceeds our gross domestic product. Today, while much of the country fo-cuses on primary elections, several of my colleagues from the Budget Com-mittee, including Chairman PRICE, wish to have an open and honest con-versation about this issue of debt and spending that you are probably not going to hear much about anywhere else. We not only hope to bring attention to this issue by defining the problem. We will propose real solutions to re-store fiscal order so that Americans can thrive and Americans—not the government or any one person, but Americans—can make America all that she can be. If we delve into the major fiscal issues facing our country, it becomes obvious that we have an enormous spending problem. I have a chart here. This chart shows us where we have been, where we were in 1965. It shows where we are today with the numbers through 2015. It also predicts where we will be in the future in 2026. The spending represented by the red on these pie charts is what is called mandatory spending. If you want to think of it this way, this spending is on cruise control. This spending is on pro-grams that were put in place by pre-vious Congresses. Really, if we didn’t even meet anymore, this spending in the red will continue to go on. The spending in the blue is the dis-cretionary spending. That is the money that is spent by appropriations that are done in Congress every year. The 12 appropriation bills that we hope to get back to regular order this year and pass each of those 12 bills out of the House and out of the Senate and put them on the President’s desk relate to the spending that is highlighted in blue on these pie charts. b1515 The omnibus bill from last year, that affected what is in the blue. It didn’t affect what is in the red. As you look at these charts, you can see that in 50 years we have had a little bit of a flip-flop. In 1965, we were right at two-thirds of our spending was dis-cretionary, which was controlled by the appropriations process, and right around one-third of our spending was mandatory. But over that 50-year period, we have seen tremendous growth in spending. We have seen that now over two-thirds of our spending is mandatory and less than one-third of our spending is dis-cretionary. So, when Congress meets and we debate these appropriations bills, we are only debating about one- third of the spending that takes place by the Federal Government. The real story is what is projected to happen in 2026, just 10 years from now. Over 50 years, we saw $17.8 trillion of increased spending in our gross debt. That is $356 billion a year. But in just 10 short years from today, the Congres-sional Budget Office projects that our gross debt will be $29.3 trillion. That will be a growth of over $11.2 trillion in a 10-year period. That is over $1 trillion per year that we will see in spending growth between now and 2026 if we stay on the path that we are currently on. Mr. Speaker, I hope to explain today why we can’t stay on this path. There are a lot of issues to look at. My col-leagues on the Committee on the Budg-et will look at the path that we are on, and they will look at different areas of this spending. We will provide solu-tions to how to avoid the future finan-cial crisis that is only getting worse. We are already in a financial crisis. When we look at what contributes to our national debt, to our gross debt, $645 billion this year will go to debt all because of mandatory spending. Our national debt, our gross debt, will in-crease $1.1 trillion. It is at about $19.3 trillion this fiscal year. Only part of that can be controlled through discre-tionary spending. We have to start ad-dressing the issues with mandatory spending if we truly want to address the fiscal condition of our country. This next slide breaks it down in a little bit more detail. Remember, red is mandatory spending and blue is discre-tionary spending. We see that under the discretionary spending, the part that we debate so vigorously in this Chamber, the part that makes all the headlines, most of that, or about half of that, is in defense, and then the rest of it is nondefense discretionary spend-ing. There are five areas—just five areas— that over two-thirds of everything spent in this country go to. As we saw on the previous chart, by 2026 those five areas will make up over three- fourths, will make up 78 percent of every dollar spent by the Federal Gov-ernment. Those five areas are: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, interest on the debt, and kind of a lump cat-egory of other mandatory spending. Right now Social Security is the largest expenditure of the Federal Gov-ernment at $882 billion per year. If we look at Social Security and Medicare, these are programs that working Americans have invested in that are very important but are headed to insol-vency. We have to fix them to preserve them for all of us who have contributed to them. The people who project the numbers show that by 2030, on the course we are on, Medicare will be insolvent. By 2034, Social Security will be insolvent. Mr.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH1074 March 1, 2016 
Speaker, the young people in our coun-try should be alarmed at this. By 2034 and 2030, these programs that we have all contributed to are projected to be insolvent if we don’t change course. If we look at Medicaid, it grew by double-digit percentage points last year, a lot of that because of the Af-fordable Care Act. If we look at other mandatory spending, these are our so-cial welfare programs. These were pro-grams that were put in place with good intentions but are getting poor results. Finally, the one that probably should concern us all the most is our interest on the debt. The Congressional Budget Office tells us that by 2025, if we don’t change course, interest on the debt will be a larger expenditure than Social Se-curity. As our debt continues to balloon and grow, the interest that we must pay on that debt will also balloon and grow, and that is why mandatory spending will become such a large part of all the spending and really make our discre-tionary spending somewhat minuscule compared to the gargantuan size of mandatory spending. I want to talk about just a couple of these areas. Some of my colleagues will talk about other areas as we move forward. If we look at some of our so-cial welfare programs and our Medicaid program, again, these programs were put in place for people who were truly in need. They were put in place for a hand up instead of a handout, but of-tentimes they have become just the op-posite of that. Some of these programs, instead of helping people out of pov-erty, they trap people in poverty. Now, Medicaid is a unique issue be-cause it was put in place for aged peo-ple, for disabled people, for blind peo-ple, people that we would all agree we need to help out and lend a helping hand, but now there are a lot of able- bodied, working-age adults—these are people 18–65 years old who are not dis-abled—who are receiving Medicaid ben-efits. We are seeing a lot of increase in cost there. We are seeing a lot of increase in cost in social welfare programs, such as SNAP. One area where we can address our budget, where we can address this looming fiscal crisis, is in our social welfare programs. Let’s look at what has happened just in the SNAP pro-gram. Since 2000, increased enrollment in SNAP programs has grown 171 percent. To say that another way, for every new job added since 2000—and that is 4.3 million of them—30.4 million people have been added to food stamps. That is seven people being added to the Food Stamp program for every new job that has been created in this country since 2000. Again, instead of lifting people out of poverty, many of our welfare programs are actually trapping people in pov-erty. If we look at some of the numbers on SNAP, 57 percent of able-bodied adult households have no earned in-come. These are people receiving the food stamp benefits. What is even maybe more alarming is 75 percent of the people receiving SNAP benefits, 75 percent of childless adult households have no earned income. That is 17.3 million people. That is a 252 percent in-crease since 2000 in this one demo-graphic of childless adult households who have zero income who are receiv-ing SNAP benefits. Only 50 percent of parent households have earned income. So what happens? What happens if we change the scenario? What happens when you move people from welfare to work? Well, Kansas tried a program. They tried a program to restore work re-quirements for able-bodied, childless adults in 2013, and they saw fantastic results from that. They saw a 50 per-cent immediate decline in enrollment when they enacted work requirements for able-bodied, working-age adults on this program. They saw a 68 percent long-term decline in enrollment, and they saw a 168 percent increase in work participation rates among the enroll-ees. They saw a 133 percent increase in average income of able-bodied, child-less adult enrollees. They saw a 55 per-cent increase in average income of able-bodied, childless adult enrollees. Mr. Speaker, a number that we can’t ever forget is that only 2.9 percent of full-time workers live in poverty. If we want to pull people out of poverty, we need to create an environment where people can work, where they can pull themselves out of poverty. We have also found that in these so-cial welfare programs like the SNAP program and like Medicaid, where you have got able-bodied, working-age adults on those programs, that the pop-ulations overlap. So if you are able to get people back into the workforce and help the SNAP program, you are also going to cut costs out of the Medicaid program. You get a double bang for your buck when you get people back in the workforce. We need to train people. We need to assist people to get back to work. That is what these programs were originally put in place for. We have got to get back to that. It has been said many times before, but I think it is worth reminding, that the best social program is still a job. Again, only 2.9 percent of full-time workers live in poverty in this country. If we implement work requirements for programs like SNAP, for people who are receiving Medicaid benefits, it will be on those who are able-bodied, work-ing-age adults. We are not going to put this requirement on disabled people. We are not going to put this require-ment on elderly people in nursing homes who are dependent on Medicaid. We are not going to put it on children or blind people. This is for able-bodied, working-age adults. We could save bil-lions of dollars in the Medicaid pro-gram by doing this. We can start to address these fiscal issues with one solution of requiring work for people who are receiving ben-efits that were put in place to help them get back to work. It worked in Kansas. It has worked in Maine. It has worked in other States. It can work all across our country. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. B
RAT), a very capa-ble and well-meaning and well-serving individual. Mr. BRAT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. W
ESTERMAN ) for yielding to me and for setting up this special session. It is the most important economic issue of our times. I have taught eco-nomics for 20 years or so, and I went to seminary before that. I ran on bringing economics and ethics to Congress, and that was usually kind of a joke in the stump speech, but most people catch it. It matters, linking economics and eth-ics together. There is no better issue from which to view this challenge as the issue before us today dealing with the monumental increase in mandatory spending. Congress has been monumentally ir-responsible. Promises were made that can’t be kept. Politicians sold out the future in favor of immediate gratifi-cation, and that future is now. We see headlines every day in the newspapers about promising more and making promises and not keeping them, but today the evidence is over-whelming. The major promise that has been made that has not been kept is balancing our budget. We promise pro-gram after program after program that we cannot pay for, and we have not kept our word. As we will show, the folks who will pay for this are the only folks who don’t have a lobbyist in this city, and that is our kids and the next generation. The U.S. Government has $19 trillion right now in total public debt out-standing. Debt per citizen currently stands at $60,000. That is separate from the chart here. We will get to that in a minute. The gap between Federal revenue and Federal spending over the next 75 years is about $118 trillion, according to Har-vard economics professor Jeffrey Miron. That number, $118 trillion, is roughly $368,000 per person in America today—$400,000, if you round up, per person in America today. b1530 The deficit is increasing as far as the eye can see. Today is Super Tuesday, and many people from across the Na-tion are going to the polls. They are, rightly, upset with the fiscal mis-management in this city over the last couple of decades. What are they upset about? Here are a few numbers. The deficit is increas-ing as far as the eye can see. It was $439 billion in 2015, and it is up—by a $105 billion increase—to $544 billion in 2016. That is just the deficit. That is the amount we add to the debt each and every year. By 2022, CBO, who are the folks who forecast the economic figures for the country—the deficit, the amount we

add to the debt in 1 year, will be $1 tril-lion. By 2026, it will be $1.3 trillion. In total, by 2026—not that far off—10 years away and high school graduates this year will be 28 years old—the debt will reach nearly $30 trillion. That is what we are handing to the next generation. We are having the pizza party and we are going to give the next generation the tab. More important than the debt—or at least a bigger economic number—auto-pilot spending is exploding. This is complex. Not many folks know about this issue. Many terms are linked: autopilot spending, entitlement spend-ing, mandatory spending. Sometimes these terms can be used interchangeably. Sometimes they can. You have got to get down in the weeds. And we will do that today. But, in general, autopilot spending is, as the gentleman before me just re-ferred, net interest payments, Social Security payments, Federal health pro-grams, Medicare, Medicaid, Obama-Care, Federal civilian military pen-sions, and welfare programs. In 1966, these made up 33 percent of Federal spending and 5.6 percent of GDP, the economy. In 2027, these pro-grams will make up 78 percent of Fed-eral spending and 18 percent of GDP, as Congressman W
ESTERMAN ’s graph showed. That is assuming that we will be able to borrow in the future. Another way to look at autopilot spending, on the graph right here, it shows that, in 1966, autopilot spending made up 33.9 percent of Federal rev-enue. But, by 2027, it will eat up 100 percent of Federal revenue. So you see the Pac-Man here is get-ting hungrier by the minute. The auto-pilot spending is 34 percent in 1966, 68 percent in 2006. Autopilots will con-sume all Federal revenues in 2027. Again, it is not that far out. Again, you can go to CBO—the Con-gressional Budget Office—and this is one of the primary graphs you will see in the first few pages at the Congres-sional Budget Office. So, in restatement, in just 11 years— 2027—1 year beyond the 10-year budget window—autopilot programs will con-sume all Federal revenue incoming. If you are paying attention, what does that mean? That means there will be zero revenue left for law enforce-ment, medical research, national de-fense, education, transportation, or even intelligence. The government will have to borrow 100 percent to finance itself, starting in 2027. More and more autopilot spending will be debt that is financed as well. Is this sustainable? Our friends on the other side are always talking about environmental sustainability. That is a great thing. But what about financial sustainability? What about the sus-tainability of our Nation? What about the sustainability of Western civiliza-tion? For an answer to that, you may look at the cradle of Western civilization. You can look to Greece. How is Greece doing when it comes to fiscal respon-sibilities? What happens to your coun-try when your debt load becomes too heavy? Significant problems emerge and it is very hard to return to a nor-mal, functioning economy. This is absolutely crucial to the sus-tainability of American civilization. It is critical that we address this problem for our children’s sake. We cannot do this without reforming Federal pro-grams and boosting growth by creating opportunities for people to support themselves. We need to restore civil society. After all, we are not just physically bankrupt. The government also has a moral, ethical, and spiritual deficit. Why is that? How can you see the ethical deficit? Many government poli-cies weaken families, as Congressman WESTERMAN just showed you on a graph. We weaken communities, churches, and other faith organiza-tions, clubs, associations, and even businesses. Small startups are not starting up. This is a tragedy. The only hope for the young kids is to enter business. There is no other way to make money. And we are cap-ping their futures. These critical insti-tutions just don’t provide resources and help our communities. They also foster responsibility, mutual account-ability, fellowship, and a sense of pur-pose in our society. How do you see the ethical deficit in other ways? It is pretty easy to see. The two major mandatory spending programs, Medicare and Social Secu-rity, will both be insolvent in 2034. That is about 18 years out. So our 18- year-olds will be 36 years old. The major programs that seniors rely on today will be insolvent in 2024, and by the time our kids retire, nothing is certain. That is a deficit in ethics. It is interesting that President John-son’s war on poverty hasn’t really eliminated poverty, at least as the gov-ernment measures it. It is striking that the massive increase in govern-ment spending tracks more closely with family breakdown and other con-cerning trends. Before the war on poverty—and this is fairly well known—began in the 1960s, self-sufficiency was going up, up, up. The percentage of those in poverty was going down, down, down, down, down. After the war on poverty begins and all the Federal programs go, that line flattens out and our progress on self- sufficiency comes to an end. We need to expand opportunities for productive work and fix welfare so earning income always makes people better off. We now spend half a trillion dollars on welfare programs. And what do we get? We get a flat line with no measur-able progress toward self-sufficiency where people can be proud of their work product and the incomes they bring home and the progress of their kids. Congress is managing too many pro-grams. States need the flexibility so that they can take on these respon-sibilities. That is the way our Founders intended things to be set up. All of human history was ruled from the top down until about 1800. All of human history was also marked by subsistence living. For all of human history, the average person made $500 per year to live on. We need to break away from this top- down approach before it is too late. The free market system has lifted us up from $500 a year closer to $50,000 per person per year. More recently, the Chinese and the Indians have moved their way out of top-down government toward free mar-kets. Chinese incomes in the past 20 years have gone from $1,000 a year to $9,000 a year. If you add up the Chinese population and the Indian population, we have 2.5 billion people on this planet that have seen the most massive increase in human welfare imaginable. That came about because they got rid of top-down, central government planning and they moved toward the free market system. The free market system is not per-fect because human beings are not per-fect, but there is no debate in the eco-nomic textbooks about all of human history versus the move toward human freedom. We all know that human free-dom is a great future and something we need to aim for. Even more important in politics these days is to ask yourself this ques-tion: Does this city, Washington, D.C., serve the powerful or does Washington, D.C., truly serve the poor? Look at the towers going up. Look at the consulting class. Look at the spe-cial interests. Look at the millions and millions of dollars that pour into this city. Does this city serve the powerful or the poor? Tonight, in elections across the Na-tion, I think you are going to see a re-sounding answer to some of these ques-tions. Let’s move government back to the people so that we can solve our signifi-cant debt problems, our mandatory spending problems, and give our kids hope for their own futures. Mr. WESTERMAN. I thank the gen-tleman from Virginia for his thought-ful input, his training, and his exper-tise. This is the kind of expertise that we need to rely on here in this body. Next, as Congressman B
RAT talked about the laboratories of democracy being the States, I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. P
ALMER ), who spent a career working with States all across this country and may possibly have a better under-standing of more State policies in more regions of the country than anybody else, certainly, that I know. Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from Ar-kansas for putting together this Spe-cial Order and for those excessively kind compliments. The budget should present a vision to the American people and should reflect

how the American people approach their own finances. As of late, we sim-ply have not governed according to the standards that the average American governs by. While we have reduced deficit spend-ing over the last few years, the fact is that we continue to spend more than we take in, adding billions more to our burgeoning debt. This budget provides us with an op-portunity not to repeat the mistakes of the past. Democrats and Republicans can find common ground to get our fis-cal house in order. I want to point out three common-sense solutions to the financial crisis that we face. First, we can reform the Medicare payment system. Medicare currently uses more than a dozen different pay-ment systems to set payment rates for medical items and services that the program covers for beneficiaries. The location where someone receives a service determines which payment system applies. Republicans and the President believes this should be cor-rected. According to the President’s own budget, a site-neutral system would save $10 billion over 10 years. Second, the General Accountability Office has identified $125 billion in im-proper payments made in 2014. This is where the government sends a check to someone not entitled to it. The GAO attributes about 65 percent of this to just three programs: Health and Human Services’ Medicare fee-for- service, Medicaid, and the Treasury’s earned income tax credit. Just three programs account for almost $81 billion per year in improper payments. Combined, if we are averaging about $100 billion a year in improper pay-ments over this 10-year window that we always talk about with the budget, that is $1 trillion. Some of these payments are being sent to dead people. Certainly, no one should be opposed to correcting this problem. The GAO points out that interagency communication is not at its finest, but also that there are major errors within the Social Security Ad-ministration’s death data. Some files show a person’s death preceding their recorded birth date. Others show age of death between 115 and 195. According to the ‘‘Guinness World Records’’ book, in the modern age, the oldest person ever lived to the age of 122. If Social Security’s records are cor-rect, they need to inform the Guinness World Records that someone outlived Ms. Jeanne Louise Calment by 73 years. If we could eliminate these erroneous payments just based on what was paid out in 2014, as I pointed out, that is over $1 trillion in 10 years. I think we can all agree that that would be a great start toward getting our fiscal house in order. Finally, Mr. Speaker, I am not an ad-vocate of more taxes, but we could do a better job of collecting those that are actually due. As of September 30, 2014, the Internal Revenue Service’s total tax debt inventory was $380 billion, which is a 23 percent increase since 2009. This is $380 billion in uncollected taxes. I think it is safe to assume that we would prefer not to have our hard- earned dollars taken from us, but I also think it is safe to assume that the av-erage person would be disgusted to hear that, while they are paying taxes, others are failing to pay theirs. One other thing that we could do in the area of tax reform, since I brought that up, is corporate income tax. It is estimated that there are more than $2 trillion in revenues that are being held offshore that could be repatriated to this country if we lowered our cor-porate income tax rate, which could, again, provide a substantial flow of revenue to help us address our deficits and pay down our budget. b1545 All this is to say that we need to be more efficient in collecting what we owe and spending what we collect. The budget process is where we can begin to get our fiscal house in order. Just in these examples, there are over $1 trillion in savings from elimi-nating waste, fraud and abuse, and making some sensible reforms. Not only can we balance the budget with-out increasing spending, we can have a surplus. Let’s work together and use these commonsense solutions to re-store our fiscal house. Mr. WESTERMAN. I would again like to thank the gentleman from Alabama for his comments. Mr. Speaker, you have heard from three freshmen Members today. Next I would like to yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. W
OODALL ), a more seasoned member of the Budget Com-mittee. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for his leadership on this issue. Say what you want to about fresh-men in this institution. I was elected with the vice chairman of the Budget Committee back in 2010, the largest freshman class in history, and it changed this place; changed this place. Largest freshmen class of Republicans and Democrats in history. You need new faces and new ideas. And what you all have done in terms of a Budget Committee at work has just been amazing. What I have here to contribute is a chart of CBO’s projections of GDP growth. And we have some of our Democratic colleagues here on the floor. I just want to say, and I hope folks hold me accountable to it, we can’t cut our way into prosperity. We just can’t do it. Cutting our way into prosperity isn’t going to happen. You cut budgets because there is bad spending in budgets. You don’t cut budgets because cutting is an end in and of itself. You cut things that are bad. You plus up things that are good. So much of the challenge that we have balancing this budget—we have done amazing things in terms of reduc-ing wasteful spending in the 5 years that I have been in this body. But the economy keeps declining, the regula-tion nation that is the new United States of America, draining produc-tivity. When I arrived, the CBO projected we would be growing at about 3 percent a year as a nation. The next year they revised it down to 2.9; the next year, 2.5; the next year, 2.3; this year, 2.1 per-cent growth; 2.1 percent growth. That looks like a downward trend. But every 0.1 percent of economic growth that is lost translates into about $300 billion of economic activity. If people don’t have jobs, they don’t pay taxes. If people don’t have jobs, they can’t contribute to the system. If people can’t contribute to the system, revenues go down. If revenues go down, budgets don’t balance. We have to grow our way out of this. We have to grow our way out of this, and that is a bipartisan challenge. There is not a man or woman in this room who doesn’t want to see more American jobs in this country, not one. There is not a man or woman in this room who doesn’t want to see our en-trepreneurs be the most competitive on the planet, not one. There is not a man or woman in this room who does not believe that Amer-ica’s best days are still going to be to-morrow. We cannot balance budgets by cut-ting discretionary spending. In fact, if we zeroed out discretionary spending, zeroed out the courts, zeroed out the parks, zeroed out the military, zeroed out everything, environment, every-thing people think of as government, and we only paid our Medicare bills, our Medicaid bills, our interest on the national debt, our mandatory spending programs, Social Security programs, that would consume virtually the en-tire revenue stream of the United States of America. We have to grow our way out of this, and that is a partnership issue that we can do together. What Mr. W
ESTERMAN is doing with his leadership on the budget provides that foundation. If you don’t know where you are going, you are not going to get there. We have to have folks who are providing that vision of where we are going. That is what our budget is. It is our one opportunity as a Con-gress to come together and talk about our collective vision, not the Repub-lican vision, not the Democratic vision, our vision, America’s vision. Unless we are looking at unemployment slides, a downward slope is not our vision. Our vision is more growth, more jobs, more economic activity. The kind of disciplined budget that Mr. W
ESTERMAN is talking about today will make all the difference in the world. I thank him for his leadership. I thank him for the time. It is a real honor to serve. Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for his comments.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1077 March 1, 2016 
This is an American problem. It is not a Republican problem or a Demo-cratic problem. It is a bipartisan debt that we all created, and it is going to take bipartisan solutions to fix this debt. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. R
OKITA ), the vice chair of the Budget Committee. Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Speaker, let me just say on the Record that I greatly appreciate the leadership of our newer members of the Budget Committee, es-pecially the member from Arkansas. I think the people of Arkansas were right to send him to Congress. Not only does he come ready to identify the spending problems that this country has, but he comes ready with solutions, too. And I think that is, in essence, Mr. Speaker, the definition of leadership. I thank the gentleman. I also thank the gentleman from Georgia who just spoke. He speaks so eloquently on so many subjects, a member of the Rules Committee. I am also very appreciative of his contribu-tion to the Budget Committee. He, of course, as we all are today, and almost every day, unfortunately, was talking about the debt. And let me just put it in a pictorial form. This is the new red menace, Mr. Speaker. Look at that trajectory. It goes nearly vertical. So the question is: How do you turn that big ship, that Titanic, if you will, so, number one, it doesn’t sink this en-tire country and, number two, it gets on a more meaningful, more productive course so that we can continue to be the world’s best hope in a 21st century world? Now, some, especially those on the other side of the aisle, will imme-diately turn to the fact that there are two ways to, in fact, solve this prob-lem. One is to control spending. The other is to grow revenue. Let me talk about the latter for just a second. The latter is a false choice because at 10,000 people a day retiring into unreformed social programs, that trajectory will not turn around, it will not plateau. No matter how much property you confiscate from the American people, Mr. Speaker, no matter how much you take in the form of taxes, with 10,000 people a day retiring in unreformed programs, can you get that to go down. So let’s look at that more closely. This is what the Federal Government confiscates from the American people to run itself. In fiscal year 2015, it was $3.25 trillion, revenue we took in to run the operations of just the Federal Gov-ernment. Mr. Speaker, the American people know we don’t have a revenue problem, we have a spending problem. The question should be what can’t you do? What can’t you do, Mr. Speak-er, with $3.25 trillion of property con-fiscated? More revenue is not the answer. Thankfully, the majority here in the House of Representatives doesn’t think it is the answer either. We know we can do better. We know we have to do better for the American people. We know we have to control the spending. That is why I am very proud to be part of a committee, the Budget Com-mittee, and part of a new crew that came, starting in 2011, that for every year we have put in a budget, a nar-rative, something that we don’t legally have to do as part of the budget proc-ess, but we took the extra step to put a narrative in our budget to give the solutions that are needed to correct this debt problem, reforming Medicare, reforming Medicaid, putting us on a track that will reduce that red menace, that will plateau it, and start pointing it downward over the next generation. We took the political risk to have that conversation with the American people, and we have done it every year since 2011. Some people called it the third rail of politics. Touch it and you will be politically electrocuted. Well, we touched it, Mr. Speaker. And we touched the next year, and the next year, and the year after that. And my hope and my pledge is, on this House floor, that we will continue to have that conversation with the Amer-ican people, backed up with votes that show, really, how to solve this prob-lem. Mr. Speaker, I will refer us to the spending that I am talking about. This chart was used before by the gentleman from Arkansas. I will refer to it again. Here is what is on autopilot. Here is what needs to be reformed. And if you look at one piece of that pie there, Medicaid, a solution for that has been in our budget for the last 5 years. In the remaining time I have, Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about that so-lution, a State flexibility grant, block grant, if you will. We have had that idea in our budget for the last 5 years. It is the idea that we in the Federal Government, we are going to get out of the business of Medicaid. We are going to get out of the business of deciding who is poor in terms of health care, what the poor need in terms of health care, or how the poor get it, that health care service. We are going to give it to the States, to individuals, to locally elected offi-cials, people who know their commu-nities better, in fact, than any Federal bureaucrat does; people who can deter-mine, given a finite amount of money from us, their money back, in fact, what the poor need, who the poor real-ly are, who the disabled really are, what they should get in terms of healthcare services, and how they should get it. Maybe, like the gentleman from Ar-kansas alluded to earlier, maybe there ought to be a work requirement for the able-bodied ones of them. Maybe there ought to be other conditions, but let the States decide what that would be, pressured, in a good way, by the fact that there would only be a finite amount of money coming from our budget. That would allow us to know exactly what we are in for, as a Federal Gov-ernment, exactly what we are giving out, and not a cent more, and would naturally incentivize the States to in-novate, to come up with better ways of service, to serve those who really need health care who can’t get it any other way. And those who, in fact, are gam-ing the system will be naturally forced off. The States are in the best position to provide that when they are properly incentivized with a finite amount of money that doesn’t grow over time. The Republican budget for the last 5 years, the one that has passed this House of Representatives, has done that very thing. We are on the right track. We need to continue these votes. We need to continue to have a budget. We need to continue to have stand- alone votes on these reforms to take this issue to the American people, espe-cially in a Presidential election year when, frankly, the candidates, I haven’t seen them talk enough about what is really on people’s minds, and that is how they are going to leave their children and grandchildren with a better life than they have, when we are knowingly saddled with $19 trillion in debt, a very hard thing to do. In fact, I think this is the first gen-eration in American history, Mr. Speaker, that is poised to leave the next generation worse off. I refuse to let that happen on this Budget Com-mittee’s watch, and that is why we are here today, that is why we are pro-viding the leadership. I thank the gentleman very much for his leadership. Mr. WESTERMAN. I thank the gen-tleman from Indiana for his remarks. I thank him also for his leadership on the Budget Committee. I thank him for his passion to see a better future for our kids and for our grandchildren. Mr. Speaker, having served in a State legislature before coming to Congress, I served in one where we had to balance our budget. And in our State legisla-ture, our single largest expenditure was, by far, Medicaid. Medicaid exceeded all the money that we spent on public education, higher education, and the Department of Corrections combined. We spent more money on this one Federal State program than we spent on all of edu-cation, and that we spent on our prison program. Mr. Speaker, there is an inverse in-centive for States to be good stewards of Medicaid money. In my State, we re-ceived $2.37 of Federal money for every $1 of State money that we spent. What my colleague from Indiana is talking about is giving States incen-tives to manage these programs. If the States had incentives to manage the programs in a better way right now, their hands would be tied by CMS. The Federal Government won’t allow the States to create programs and manage their Medicaid population the way that the States could if they had the opportunity to do that.

b1600 If we give these laboratories of de-mocracy across the country the ability to innovate and the ability to meet the needs of the people that they serve, then they will do that. Government has always been most effective when it is closest to the people. I served on a school board. I know that I had a lot more interaction with my constituents on the school board because I lived in the same community with them than I did as a State legislator or even as I do as a Member of Congress. We have to be able to give States more flexibility. We have to let them innovate and let them learn from one another across the country to use ideas that work one place and adapt them for another place. That is how we bring fis-cal stability back to our Federal budg-et, by allowing States to manage their State budgets better. As we look at these mandatory spending programs, as the gentleman from Indiana mentioned, the large part of this mandatory spending—nearly half of it—is all associated with health care. That is Medicare, which is $634 billion in 2015; Medicaid, $350 billion in 2015; and then other programs that make up about $47 billion. Those, com-bined, are greater than the one single largest expenditure, which is Social Se-curity, which we obviously need to re-form, not to punish people but to make it sustainable, to make it last for those who really need the program, and to make it last for all Americans who have invested in that program. The same thing for Medicare. If we refuse to make changes, if we continue to let the status quo be the current reality, then we will see all of these programs shrink and become in-solvent over time, and at the same time we will see our Federal debt con-tinue to bloom, and we will see the amount of interest we pay on the debt continue to grow. Now is the time for us to take action. Now is the time for us to not only produce a budget that balances, but to enact that budget and to follow that budget. Again, I would like to thank all the members of the Budget Committee who spoke on the issues today. We will be speaking on them more as we move for-ward. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

HUNGER IN AMERICA The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. A
BRAHAM ). Under the Speaker’s an-nounced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. M
CGOVERN ) for 30 minutes. Mr. M
CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight our important Fed-eral nutrition programs, and I rise today to remind my colleagues that we have a hunger problem in the United States of America. Mr. Speaker, there is not a single congressional district in this country that is hunger free. Every commu-nity—whether urban, suburban, or rural—faces hunger. One in seven Americans experience hunger, includ-ing 16 million children. We are the richest, most powerful country in the history of the world. It is shameful that even one child goes to bed hungry. In every community across the coun-try, there are dedicated, passionate local antihunger organizations that do incredible work to provide food assist-ance and support those struggling with hunger, from food banks to food pan-tries, to faith-based organizations, to community centers, to hospitals, and on and on and on. Charities do impor-tant, wonderful work, but they cannot do it alone. The demand is simply too high. Charities need a strong partner in the Federal Government if we are ever going to end hunger. The Supplemental Nutrition Assist-ance Program, or SNAP, which used to be known as food stamps, is our Na-tion’s premier antihunger program. It is effective and it is efficient, with an error rate of less than 4 percent, which includes both overpayments and under-payments. By the way, underpayments are when a recipient receives less than they are eligible for, and that happens often. Find me a Pentagon spending pro-gram with such a low error rate. The fact of the matter is SNAP is one of the most successful—if not the most successful—Federal programs that we have. The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Chil-dren, or WIC, provides nutritious foods, counseling on healthy eating, and breastfeeding support to more than 8 million low-income women and chil-dren at nutritional risk. WIC gives in-fants and young children the healthy, nutritious start that they need for crit-ical early development and lifelong learning. It is an incredibly vital pro-gram. The National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs and the Summer Food Service Program provide nutri-tious foods for millions of children and teens in educational and community settings. These important programs en-sure that our young people are ready to learn and that they can succeed. The Meals on Wheels program pro-vides home-delivered meals to millions of homebound seniors. Not only does Meals on Wheels improve senior nutri-tion, it also enables seniors to live independently longer while receiving daily check-in visits from volunteers. These are just a few of the vital Fed-eral antihunger programs that are the backbone of our fight to end hunger once and for all in this country. But, Mr. Speaker, one of the reasons why I am coming to this floor today is I am deeply worried that they are coming under attack by the Republican major-ity in this House. Unfortunately, it is fashionable right now to demonize Americans living in poverty and to belittle their struggles. We hear that all too often on this House floor. We hear that all too often in this Presidential campaign that is going on. The fact of the matter is it is hard work to be poor in America. It is not easy. Yet millions of families are struggling, trying to raise their kids and living on a paycheck that doesn’t provide enough to put food on the table. Mr. Speaker, a couple of weeks ago, I spent a night at a homeless shelter in Worcester, Massachusetts, called the Interfaith Hospitality Network. It is a family homeless shelter. As you know, there are not enough shelters that ac-commodate entire families. Usually families get split up. But what I wasn’t prepared for when I spent the night at this shelter was that every one of these families had at least one adult that was working. They were working in a job. They all had unique situations that put them in a very difficult situa-tion. But the fact of the matter is they were working. They were earning just enough that a lot of their benefits were reduced, but they were not earning enough to be able to put a down pay-ment on an apartment and afford rent. These are parents that love their kids every bit as much as I love my kids and my colleagues love their kids. They want to be good parents, but they are struggling. They are looking for a hand up, not a handout. They are look-ing for a little bit of assistance so they can get back on their feet. The bottom line is that their plight is not unique. I will tell my colleagues that their plight does not fall into a neat stereotype. Too often when people here in this Chamber talk about the homeless or the hungry, they talk about people who are addicted to drugs, or they talk about people who don’t work or who don’t want to work. That is not the reality. That is not the face of poverty in this country. It is much more complicated than that. And yet, to justify deep cuts in programs to ac-tually help people get back on their feet, we hear the false narrative re-peated over and over and over again, the demonization of these people who are struggling in poverty.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1079 March 1, 2016 
The rhetoric that we hear on the floor all too often is hurtful, and it is sometimes hateful. It is seeping into the discourse in this Congress, and it is seeping into some of the decision-making that is going on by the current leadership in this Congress. It seems like just now Republican leaders are finally coming around to the idea that they need to talk about poverty. We heard the Speaker say that he wants a national conversation about poverty. But I have got to tell you I am a little worried, because while we need this conversation and while we need to come up with solutions, I have this sinking feeling that something else is going on, that this so-called con-versation on poverty is really kind of a masquerade for cutting deeply into programs that will help put food and nutrition on people’s tables and pro-vide people the shelter that they need when they are struggling. I worry that this congressional task force that the Speaker announced, when I look at it, is made up of Members, all of whom have supported block-granting SNAP. What block-granting means is that States can do almost whatever the heck they want to do with the SNAP benefit. They don’t necessarily have to use it to provide people food. They can use it for other things; and, therefore, it puts that benefit at risk, especially during difficult economic times. But every one of the people who is on this task force has voted for Repub-lican budgets that support block-grant-ing. Every one of the people on this so- called poverty task force voted to cut SNAP by $40 billion during the last farm bill—$40 billion. Now, they would say: Oh, we are just trying to trim the program and make it more efficient. I would just say to my colleagues that the average SNAP benefit is $1.40 per person per meal per day—$1.40. I bet most of my colleagues who are calling for deep cuts in SNAP have no idea what the benefit is. They have no idea how inadequate the benefit is. In fact, it is so inadequate that most fam-ilies who are on SNAP end up having to rely on food banks, having to rely on churches, synagogues, and mosques at the end of the month to be able to put food on their table. It is $1.40 per per-son per meal per day. That is the aver-age benefit. Yet my colleagues, those who are on this so-called poverty task force, almost unanimously, on the other side of the aisle, voted to cut the program by $40 billion. I would ask my colleagues, what are you thinking? What are you thinking? We have an obligation to be there for the most vulnerable in this country. That is what government is supposed to be for. Donald Trump doesn’t need government. He is a zillionaire. He doesn’t have to worry about where his next meal is going to come from. Yet there are millions of people, millions of families in this country who do. They are looking for a little compassion. They are not looking for a handout. They are looking for a hand up so they can get their lives in order and they can progress. Mr. Speaker, we need to do better. I will just say one other thing, and then I am going to yield to my col-league from Virginia. There is another kind of nasty dis-cussion going on by my Republican col-leagues. They have a new proposal to drug-test SNAP recipients. The fact of the matter is this proposal has no basis in reality. It is nothing more than a mean-spirited attack on poor people to fire up their rightwing base. It is in-sulting. It is insulting. We have seen drug test laws in Flor-ida and Georgia struck down as uncon-stitutional and end up wasting tax-payer dollars to identify very few drug users. In fact, those receiving public assistance test positive for illicit drugs at a lower rate than the general popu-lation—at a lower rate than the gen-eral population. It doesn’t fit into the rightwing narrative of who comprises those who live in poverty in America, but it is the fact. It is the fact. Why aren’t Republicans in this bill calling for drug testing for wealthy CEOs and oil company executives who receive taxpayer subsidies? Why aren’t they calling for Members of Congress to undergo drug tests? After all, our salaries are paid by the taxpayers in this country. Why don’t you call for all Members of Congress to undergo drug tests? Maybe that might explain why we do some of the things we do here in this Congress. But, instead, again, they only pick on one sector of the population—poor people. They are the ones who are being blamed for the economy. They are the ones who are being demonized, and they are the ones who are being be-littled. It is beneath this Chamber and this House to engage in that kind of discussion. We need to be making real, meaning-ful progress to end hunger and poverty in this country. First and foremost, we need to protect and strengthen our im-portant Federal nutrition and antihunger programs. We need bold ac-tion that will help people rather than make hunger and poverty worse. That is why I continue to call for a White House conference on food, nutrition, and hunger to develop a holistic plan to end hunger in America, because I think we can do better. I think we need to get all of our Federal agencies and our State agencies to work better to-gether and to connect the dots so that we can deal with this so-called cliff that so many people struggling to get out of poverty hit when they start to make a little bit of money. b1615 We need to figure out a holistic plan with benchmarks that will actually end hunger. We have a lot of programs, quite frankly, that deal with different aspects of hunger, but I am not sure we have a plan that will actually end it. Here is the deal. Hunger is a political condition. It is solvable. We have ev-erything to solve it except the political will. One of the things we should be doing is developing that political will and not going down the road of demon-izing some of the most vulnerable peo-ple in this country. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. S
COTT), the ranking member of the Education and the Workforce Committee. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts not only for yield-ing, but also for his years of work fighting hunger. He is one of the strongest advocates we have in Con-gress in fighting the scourge of hunger. I want to thank him for all of those years of good work. It is my privilege to be the ranking member of the Committee on Edu-cation and the Workforce. In that per-spective, we played an integral role in the reduction of food insecurity and lowering the prevalence of debilitating health conditions, including obesity, diabetes, and others. Our committee is tasked with mak-ing sure all children have an equal shot at success. One important way is to en-sure that by providing healthy, nutri-tious meals. There is a Federal role in ensuring that every child has access to a quality education, regardless of where they live or their family’s income, and nu-trition is a part of making sure they can get that education. More than 60 years ago, when Con-gress enacted the first Federal child nutrition program—the National School Lunch Program—Congress ac-knowledged that feeding hungry chil-dren was not only a moral imperative, but also an imperative for the health and security of our Nation. The National School Lunch Program was actually a response from the mili-tary community who were complaining that so many of our young military age youth were unprepared for military service because they were malnour-ished. Regrettably today, we are faced with the same crisis that impacts our Na-tion’s national security. Too many of our children are now obese, too obese to enlist in our Nation’s military. One- third of the children in this country are overweight, and childhood obesity has tripled in the last 30 years. While all segments of the population are affected, low-income families are especially vulnerable to obesity and other chronic diseases because they end up eating unhealthy food. Unfortunately, the poorest among us have the least access to healthy foods, many times without a full-service gro-cery store or farmer’s market in their community. We still have a long way to go, but there have been positive signs of progress through the implementation of our child nutrition programs. Thanks to the introduction of strong-er standards brought about by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, en-acted just a few years ago, students

across the country are experiencing healthy school environments with more nutritious meal options. One area in dire need of increased ac-cess to child nutrition programs and nutritious meals they provide is Flint, Michigan. As everybody knows, the residents of Flint are struggling with the consequences of exposure to high levels of lead as a result of the city’s contaminated municipal water supply. Lead exposure is especially damaging to infants, toddlers, and expectant mothers and can cause behavioral and cognitive problems that last a lifetime. Although there is no cure for lead poisoning, research shows that a healthy diet, including zinc, vitamin C, iron, and calcium, can mitigate some of the harmful effects. Federal supplemental funding for nu-trition programs, especially the WIC program, would allow access to healthier diets. Funding for a nutrient-rich third meal, an extension of WIC benefits, to 10 years of age for all eligible children would go a long way to help the resi-dents of Flint, Michigan, deal with lead poisoning. Mr. Speaker, our committee is now working on a child nutrition reauthor-ization bill. With this reauthorization, we have a great opportunity to con-tinue to improve the way that children eat, to expand access to nutritious meals, and to end the crisis of child-hood hunger in this country. These efforts do not end with the school year or even the school day. Whether in schools, childcare settings, or summer programs, our goal should be to provide high-quality and nutri-tious food to all of America’s children. We have a choice to make. We can put money into these important pro-grams now and support healthy eating in our schools and other settings or we can cut corners and spend more money down the road on chronic diseases and other social services, putting the well- being of our children and our Nation’s security at risk. Make no mistake. Ei-ther way, we will spend the money. A few years ago medical expenditures to treat obesity in the United States were estimated to be $147 billion, 16.5 percent of all U.S. medical expendi-tures. Investing in the front end, by main-taining strong nutrition standards and increasing access to healthy meals, is obviously a better choice for our Na-tion. Mr. Speaker, I urge my fellow Mem-bers of Congress to continue to invest in our Nation’s future by moving for-ward, not backward, on issues of food insecurity and child nutrition. I want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts again for his longtime advocacy, for his efforts to reduce hun-ger and to provide better nutrition for our Nation’s children. Mr. M
CGOVERN. I thank the gen-tleman for his comments and for his leadership, and I thank him for point-ing out the links between good nutri-tion and good health. We actually will save money in the long run if we provide our people, our young people in particular, nutritious food. We can prevent diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure. If people aren’t moved by the human aspect of feeding the hungry and all they care about is the bottom line, they ought to join with us to make sure that these nutrition programs are adequately funded. In addition, you can’t learn in school if you are hungry. A breakfast and a lunch to a young child who is hungry is every bit as essential to that child’s ability to learn as is a textbook. We need to understand that. We need to stop nickel-and-diming these nutri-tion programs and understand that every dollar we invest, every penny we invest, pays us back in ways that can’t even be quantified, quite frankly. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-woman from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO ), a leader on this issue, a woman who is on the Appropriations Committee, who, again, has been a champion for many, many years on this issue of combating hunger in America. Ms. D
ELAURO. I thank the gen-tleman, and I thank my colleagues. I am so proud to join with you tonight And to Congressman M
CGOVERN , your unrelenting efforts to address the issue of ending hunger and doing it now, you have been singularly an individual who has never missed a beat in trying to ad-dress this issue and bring it to the floor and the public. And to my colleague from Virginia, who has taken his platform of the Edu-cation and the Workforce Committee and have had a focus on how, in fact, we improve the opportunities for our children and whether it is their health or their education, he is at the fore-front. I see we have been joined by Con-gresswoman G
WENMOORE of Wisconsin, someone who can talk about her own deep personal experiences with hunger and with the food stamp program and what it means to be able to work your way out of these efforts. She has done it to a fare-thee-well. Mr. Speaker, over 50 million people— nearly one in four—live in hunger in the United States. Don’t ever let any-body use the terminology ‘‘food secu-rity.’’ It is plain and simple hunger. Kids are hungry in the United States of America. Hunger exists in virtually every community in this country. So-cial safety net programs are vital tools for reducing the prevalence of poverty and hunger. The Supplemental Nutrition Assist-ance Program, SNAP—food stamps, yes—is one of the most powerful pro-grams that we have for ending child-hood hunger in the United States. It helps millions of hardworking Amer-ican families every year. SNAP works for those who need it most. It has been incredibly successful in alleviating hunger, lifting people out of poverty, and supporting our economy. SNAP continues to do more than any other government assistance program to lift Americans out of poverty. The numbers speak for themselves. In 2014 alone, the program lifted 4.7 million people out of poverty, includ-ing 2.1 million children. SNAP also lift-ed more than 1.3 million children out of deep poverty. What is deep poverty? It is 50 percent of what the poverty line is in this Nation. The program impacts children well beyond their childhood years. Research shows that, among children who grow up in disadvantaged households with access to SNAP, there is an 18 percent-age point increase in the likelihood of completing high school. There has also been evidence of sig-nificant improvements in overall health and economic self-sufficiency among women. SNAP is an extremely efficient pro-gram. More than half of all of the bene-fits go to households in deepest pov-erty, and over 70 percent of all benefits go to households with children. Despite what some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would say about fraud, waste, and abuse, the food stamp program has the lowest error rate of any Federal Government pro-gram, the lowest error rate. Based on this anecdote that it is rife with fraud, waste, and abuse, they would deny children food. The data speaks loud and clear about the lowest error rate of any Federal program. Of course, it is not just children. SNAP helps millions of seniors, people with disabilities, veterans, low-wage workers, and others. However, Speaker RYAN and other Republican House Members say that we spend trillions of dollars on these pro-grams and, yet, the poverty rate does not change. This is simply not true. I talked about the statistics earlier on in my comments. Without these critical safety net programs, more Americans would go hungry. As we have said, SNAP kept about 4.8 million people out of poverty, including 2.1 million children. The data belies what their conversa-tion is and the stories they want to tell and, quite frankly, fabricate around the food stamp program. The Republican proposals for SNAP include a push to enact block grants, which my colleague, Mr. M
CGOVERN , mentioned before, an idea that Jared Bernstein, former chief economist to Vice President B
IDEN called ‘‘one of the most destructive ideas in poverty pol-icy.’’ Let me mention some of the statis-tics that have been compiled by Chil-dren’s Health Watch in Boston, Massa-chusetts. If the SNAP benefits were reduced ei-ther through block granting or some other mechanism to reduce food stamp benefits so as to create instability in these households, this is what they say would be likely to occur: 23 percent would be more likely to have house-holds that are food insecure; 70 percent

more likely children would be food in-secure; 36 percent more likely to be in poor health if this happens; 70 percent more likely to be at risk for develop-mental delays—this is about our kids, about our children—12 percent more likely to be hospitalized; children in kindergarten through third grade would be more likely to have measur-ably lower reading and math test scores; and reduced SNAP benefits would decrease the likelihood of moth-ers having a baby with a healthy weight and of a low-birth-weight baby surviving. This is not J
IMMCGOVERN or G WEN M
OORE or B OBBY SCOTT or R OSA D
ELAURO making up these statistics. They come from an organization which tracks all of these measures. b1630 My colleagues, it would include drug testing policies for SNAP recipients and prohibitions for certain food pur-chases. What kind of priorities are these? We can’t continue to wage a war against food stamp recipients. Nobody is asking for any other recipients who get Federal subsidies to be drug tested. Let’s start with the Crop Insurance people. Let’s start with that. Let’s take all of the programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture where there is a subsidy and a recipient to that sub-sidy. Let’s get them all drug tested. We are going to continue to stand up against unconscionable attacks on America’s poor working families. I urge my colleagues to stand with us in ensuring that the Federal budget does not harm working families and chil-dren by decimating the hunger pro-grams in this Nation. Mr. M
CGOVERN. I thank the gentle-woman for her eloquent statement. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from Wisconsin (Ms. M
OORE ). Ms. MOORE. I thank the gentleman so much for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues in praising Mr. M
CGOVERN for his leader-ship on this issue. Of the many people who are hungry, none of them have the money to lobby folks—the kids, the disabled people, the seniors, the elderly—but we have a champion in this House, J
IMMCGOV-
ERN. With the few seconds remaining, I want to talk a little bit about our economy. We have a capitalist econ-omy, and it is countercyclical. The SNAP program works to provide a safe-ty net so that when we have a Hurri-cane Katrina or when we have a Hurri-cane Sandy, the food stamp rolls go up, and when there are jobs, the food stamp rolls go down. It ain’t broke, you all, so let’s not try to fix it. I am very, very disturbed that when the Budget Committee meets next week, it will try to make structural changes to the SNAP program, to throw it into a reconciliation process where only 51 Members of the Senate have to vote for it, out of this body, in order to change the structure of it so that it is not responsive to people dur-ing economic distress. I am concerned about the numbers of people who are going to ask for a waiv-er to limit the number of benefits, in a 36-month period, that those who are unemployed can receive. People who are unemployed don’t have any control over our economy. When unemploy-ment is up, the SNAP program, as it is currently structured, is responsive to unemployment, and we ought to stick to that. Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
f 
END HUNGER NOW (Mr. M
CGOVERN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. M
CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their eloquent statements here today. I think that they have reinforced the point that these nutrition programs work. SNAP works. It has one of the lowest error rates of any Federal program—less than a 4 percent error rate. That in-cludes underpayments, which means that beneficiaries don’t get what they are entitled to. It is a program that al-lows families to put food on the table. We need to be supporting these pro-grams. We need to be coming up with a holistic plan to end hunger. We need to raise the minimum wage so that people who work, like the majority of able- bodied people do who are on SNAP, don’t have to live in poverty. We can do so much better. I would just say to my Republican colleagues that, rather than doubling down on the cruelness with some of the proposals that have been brought forth before this House, you ought to work in a bipartisan way to actually lift people out of poverty so as to give people the hope and the ability to lead better lives. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-leagues to come together and find a way to end hunger now.

STOP ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-uary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. J
OLLY ) for 30 minutes. Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise this afternoon to talk about an issue that I started bringing up about 5 or 6 weeks ago and that I intend to talk about every week until we finally force ac-tion in this Chamber. For over 20 years, I have had the op-portunity to study this institution, an institution I believe very deeply in—in its ability to rise to some of our great-est national challenges and to solve some of the greatest problems we face. It was not until as a first-time can-didate then elected to office that I had the opportunity to experience a few moments that are very unique to actu-ally being in the Member’s chair. We have had a great debate over the decades about campaign finance re-form, about the role of money in poli-tics. It is a legitimate debate. It is a le-gitimate conversation with strongly felt views on both sides of the aisle, with solutions as diverse as the ideologies of our country—from greater transparency to greater limits, to fewer limits. Yet, as we have talked about the campaign finance construct in this country and as we have talked about proposed solutions, we have actually ignored one of the greatest blights on this body, itself. It comes not in the form of our campaign finance laws, but it comes in the form of the amount of time that Members of this body are ex-pected or are, in some cases, directed to spend in raising money. You see, the first way we begin to ad-dress campaign finance reform is by ad-dressing a needed congressional reform, a reform that touches not on the cur-rent laws of how campaigns are resourced, but on the current rules by which this body governs. As they were directed a few years back by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle—by their leadership— the expectation as a new Member of Congress for a day in D.C. is to spend 4 hours a day on the phone, raising money. The number-one activity, as was suggested to new incoming Mem-bers, was to fundraise, not to legislate. It is a very uncomfortable truth. As I said last week, it is very uncomfortable for me to talk about this amongst my colleagues, but we represent, each of us, 700,000 people back home who trust us. They trust us to serve, and in serv-ing, we are to give voice to their prior-ities. Dear folks, the priorities of our con-stituents is not fundraising. You see, there is a broad diversity of priorities— from border security, to immigration reform, to transportation, to tax re-form. I listened to colleagues in the last hour talk about balancing the budget. Others talked about programs that are critical to ending hunger here in the United States, but we will never solve these problems on behalf of the people who sent us here if we spend more time on the phone, raising money, than we do in legislating, in tackling these very problems that we have tried to give voice to. Last week I did share with this body the orientation card that was provided to some incoming Members a few years back. Today I have with me some quotes from retiring Members of Con-gress, from those on the way out the door or who have already left. The first one, you will notice, is a confession from a colleague on my side of the aisle, upon his retirement, who said that fundraising is the main busi-ness of Congress. The other one is from the retired Senate majority leader who said that a Senator has to raise $10,000 a day every day he is in office, every day for 6 years, simply to finance his reelection.

The last is from a colleague who, shortly after announcing his intention to retire, wrote a piece called ‘‘Confes-sions of a Congressman,’’ confessing to spending 4,200 hours on the phone, rais-ing money—4,200 hours that could have been spent doing his job. What do all of these quotes have in common? What do all of these individ-uals have in common? They are either retired or they are retiring. The cynic in me would suggest: Why do you wait until you have left this in-stitution to publicly lament the failings of having served while you were here? In fact, the cynic in me would sug-gest, in some cases, it is simply to sell a book—to ask the American people for more money, but this time for your own pocket, not for your campaign. What do we do about it? Why don’t we do something as sitting Members of Congress that has never been done be-fore? Let’s address this issue that creates such a quiet anger amongst Members of Congress—this obligation to fundraise—but that resonates as a very loud anger with the American people. You see, no Member on this side of the aisle or the other needs a poll to know that the American people are frus-trated with the amount of time Mem-bers of Congress spend in raising money instead of in doing their jobs. Together, with six or eight col-leagues here in this body—and I am grateful for their support of the legisla-tion I have introduced—we have intro-duced something I call the STOP Act. It is very simple. It is merely three or four pages. Every Member of this body can read it before he votes on it. The STOP Act, H.R. 4443, prohibits any Member of Congress from directly soliciting a contribution to his own campaign, to a PAC, or to his party. It leaves in place the campaign finance construct that has been approved by the Supreme Court. Whether you agree with it or not, it doesn’t touch the cur-rent campaign finance system. If an individual wishes to participate in an election, I believe that is polit-ical speech, and he is still able to par-ticipate by making phone calls, by waving signs, or by contributing. Cam-paign committees can still exist. It is simply the job of staff to ensure that campaigns have the resources nec-essary to run the campaign. This law would only apply to sitting Members of Congress. It would not apply to challengers. It would not apply to first-time candidates. It would only apply to sitting Members of Con-gress. It would be a direct prohibition on any Member of Congress who is di-rectly soliciting a contribution. Why? Because the message is very simple to Congress. You see, the STOP Act says: Get back to work. Do your job. It is why we were elected, to actually try to solve problems. In State legislatures, including in the State legislature in the State of Flor-ida, members are prohibited from di-rectly soliciting contributions while they are in session. In Florida, where we elect judges, we have a prohibition on the direct solicitation of contribu-tions, and 29 or 30 States across the country have that same prohibition. The message is very simple: you are elected to do a job. Spend your hours working, not asking people for money. I have heard a lot of responses since I introduced this bill. The contrast be-tween comments from the American people is stark compared to comments from many elected officials, many in this town. See, the American people get it and they say ‘‘thank you.’’ Of course, Congress should be spend-ing time doing its job, not spending time across the street, raising money. The American people get it. Folks in this town say, ‘‘You are crazy.’’ Some say, ‘‘I like fundraising.’’ One of the better comments—more intriguing— was that old habits are hard to break. Let’s break those habits. Let’s have a Congress that gets to work because, you see, this is not the best we can do. Do you want to know why we have not solved border security, gotten oper-ational control of the border, why we have not solved immigration reform, why we have not reached consensus, fi-nally, once and for all, on how to bal-ance the budget and put us on a path-way to prosperity, why we have not had a healthy debate on issues like an authorization to use military force? Where are we in terms of agreement or disagreement with the President’s foreign policy? Why have we not been able to consider a national right to carry reciprocity, protecting the Sec-ond Amendment rights of any indi-vidual who travels between States? Why have we not solved the VA healthcare problem in giving every vet-eran the complete choice of where he receives his health care? Why have we not moved legislation on behalf of law enforcement officers to enhance pen-alties for those who do harm to law en-forcement officers? It is because we have a part-time Congress and a full-time world. There is no way to suggest to voters that it is somehow okay to have a political cul-ture that prioritizes fundraising over legislating. Tone is very important here. While this is a hard issue to talk about, this is not intended to judge or to criticize my colleagues. b1645 In fact, colleagues in this body are operating lawfully under the system that has been set before us. But I am simply trying to change the system be-cause the American people will never understand, as they work 40, 50, 60 hours a week, why, according to some estimations, we have a legislature that spends 15 hours a week legislating and 25 hours a week raising money. It does not make a bit of sense. Now, I mentioned some of the com-ments that I have heard from others after I introduced this. There are two things you will hear from people who don’t want to talk about this—actu-ally, there are three. The first response is silence and the hope that you don’t make eye contact so you can avoid the question because there is no way to oppose the STOP Act. The second is this issue of, well, it is First Amendment. I should be able to ask somebody for money. The United States Supreme Court recently consid-ered that question in a case that dealt with a prohibition on judges directly soliciting contributions, and the Su-preme Court of the United States ruled that it was a reasonable restriction on elected officials to protect the integ-rity of the bench. Now, there was discussion about whether or not that could apply also to legislators, and there were questions about that. I would point you back to the fact that legislatures at the State level currently prohibit direct solicita-tion while they are in session. So my STOP Act, I believe, meets constitutional muster based on Su-preme Court rulings. But should there be any question, then we can simply make it apply to days that we are in session, hours that we are in session. Frankly, we could solve it most easily by simply passing a House rule, be-cause, you see, a rule that this body imposes upon itself survives any con-stitutional scrutiny. So I start by asking my colleagues to cosponsor the STOP Act, H.R. 4443. If we fail to move the STOP Act, let’s have an honest conversation within this body about the current blight that fundraising imposes on our ability to do work, because this is not the best we can do. Where are our solutions to the issues I mentioned of border security, of na-tional security, of balanced budget, of tax reforms, of VA health care, of pro-tecting law enforcement? Where are our solutions? They are not found at fundraisers. They are not found on the other end of a cold call that you make to ask for a contribution. The answers are found among the community of stakeholders that sent us here, those on the front lines every day of these issues, communities like mine in Pinellas County who gave me the public trust. Every day my first re-sponsibility and the responsibility of every Member of this Congress is to honor that public trust. You see, the answers are not in fund-raisers or on the other end of a fund-raising phone call. The answers are in our community and in the voices of our community as represented by elected officials here in this well. But we are not here. It is 4:45, and we are done for the day but for fundraising and but for making phone calls. Let’s get off the phone with donors. Let’s leave that to campaign organiza-tions, and let’s get on the phone with the constituents who have asked us to give voice to their concerns. Let’s find

the answers where they lie, not across the street in call suites, not at fund-raisers. We can do so much better, and we are fooling ourselves if we don’t re-alize that. If we take anything from the polit-ical landscape this year, it is that the American people are calling the bluff of folks who continue to mislead and misrepresent. It is misleading and it is misrepresenting when we promise that we are working on critical issues of the country when, in fact, we are not even in the office but we are across the street raising money. I would love to take on broader cam-paign finance reform. We all have strong opinions. Mine start first with protecting the First Amendment rights of anyone to participate in an election. We will never get to the bigger re-forms if we ignore this very basic truth that many in this body, as a result of the pressure of campaigns, spend more time asking you for money than asking you for solutions, more time fund-raising than legislating. I didn’t run to become a professional fundraiser. I ran to hopefully con-tribute to solutions that are des-perately wanted by the American peo-ple, solutions that require consensus across the aisle, but solutions that first and foremost require a commit-ment to serve, a commitment to tackle the hardest issues among us. I started by saying I believe deeply in this institution, and I do. This is the greatest legislative body the world has ever seen, but let’s honor that history. Just as when we took the oath of office to well and faithfully execute the du-ties of this office, let’s honor that, be-cause we are not faithfully executing the duties of this office when the Chamber is empty at 4:45 but the call suites across the street are full. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

PRAYER The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-fered the following prayer: Let us pray. Wise Creator, the architect of des-tinies, on this Super Tuesday 2016, when a dozen States hold their Presi-dential nominating contests, we look to You. You are the potter, and we are the clay. So mold and make the des-tiny of this Nation conceived in lib-erty. Let Your will be done. Lord, we acknowledge that Your thoughts are different from our thoughts and Your ways are far beyond anything we can imagine. For just as the Heavens are higher than the Earth, so are Your ways higher than our ways and Your thoughts higher than our thoughts. Give us the wisdom to not second-guess the unfolding of Your lov-ing providence, but help us to remem-ber that in everything You are working for the good of those who love You. Today, as You desire, use our law-makers and all those who love freedom as instruments of Your glory. We pray in Your powerful Name. Amen.

FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY AND COMPREHENSIVE ADDICTION AND RECOVERY BILL Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator G
RASSLEY , and I will meet with President Obama later this morn-ing. We will reiterate that the Amer-ican people will have a voice in the va-cancy on the Supreme Court as they choose the next President, who in turn will nominate the next Supreme Court Justice. In other words, we will observe the Biden rule. Americans have by now be-come well acquainted with that advice from the Vice President. Americans also know what both the current and future Senate Democratic leaders have had to say about judicial nominees when a different party was in the White House. They have heard the admonishment of the Senator from Ne-vada, Mr. R
EID, that ‘‘nowhere in [the Constitution] does it say the Senate has the duty to give presidential nomi-nees a vote.’’ They know the Senator from New York didn’t even wait until the final year of President George W. Bush’s term to declare that the Senate should ‘‘not confirm a Supreme Court nominee except in extraordinary cir-cumstances.’’ So look, let’s use this debate to dis-cuss ways we can work together to make progress for our country, such as tackling a drug crisis that is tearing communities apart in all 50 States. I was pleased to see colleagues join together to advance the bipartisan Comprehensive Addiction and Recov-ery Act just yesterday. I hope we will see that kind of cooperation continue. It is important for our country, and I look forward to discussing with the President how his administration can be helpful. f

FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Repub-licans, in an effort to try to cloud the issue regarding selection of the Su-preme Court replacement, usually don’t provide a full quote. For example, they keep talking about Senator B
IDEN, but they should give the whole statement of Senator B
IDEN, where he ended it by saying that ‘‘compromise is the responsible course, both for the White House and for the Senate. . . . [and] if the President consults and co-operates with the Senate . . . [on] his selections . . . then his nominees may enjoy my support, as did Justices Ken-nedy and Souter.’’ Yesterday the Washington Post pub-lished an editorial by Barbara Perry, a professor at the University of Virginia and an expert on the Supreme Court. It is among the finest law schools in all the world. That is the University of Virginia.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES1106 March 1, 2016 
In her opinion piece, Dr. Perry pushed back against Republican claims that Presidents have not historically nominated Supreme Court Justices during an election year. According to her, ‘‘14 Presidents have appointed 21 justices during presidential election years.’’ That is 14 out of 44 Presidents have appointed Supreme Court Justices in Presidential election years. That is about one-third of all U.S. Presidents who have appointed nominees during an election year. Amy Howe, an expert on the Supreme Court and editor at SCOTUSblog—Su-preme Court of the United States blog—agrees that past Presidents and Senates have considered election-year nominees. She writes: 
The historical record does not reveal any instances since at least 1900 of the president failing to nominate and/or the Senate failing to confirm a nominee in a presidential elec-tion year because of the impending election. 
Republicans are using one inappro-priate statement or excuse after an-other to explain why they shouldn’t have to do their jobs the taxpayers sent them here to Washington to do. Instead of making excuses, wouldn’t it be easier just to do the right thing? The right thing would be to give Presi-dent Obama’s Supreme Court nominee a hearing—a meeting before that—and a vote. We are simply saying: They should be doing their jobs. Some Republicans are already start-ing to see the light. Last week, the Re-publican Senator from Maine ripped the Republican leader for politicizing the current Supreme Court vacancy in the aftermath of Justice Scalia’s death. Again, among other things, here is what the Republican Senator from Maine said: 
I thought it was a shame . . . that instead of honoring his life and legacy and extending our condolences, already we are embroiled in a political fight. 
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie went a step further, urging the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold hearings. Governor Christie said: 
As I’ve always said, I believe that’s abso-lutely the right thing to do. People can vote up or down however they choose, but hear-ings should be held. There is no reason for them to not take on this nomination. 
Governor Christie is absolutely right. There is no reason for a Supreme Court nominee not to have a full hearing and a vote. There is no reason for Senate Republicans not to give a nominee to the Supreme Court a meeting, a hear-ing, and a vote. All we are saying is: Do your job. Montana Republican Congressman R
YAN Zinke published an editorial in the Missoulian, one of the largest newspapers in the entire State, urging the Republican leader to give President Obama’s nominee all due consider-ation. Here is what he said: 
It is unfortunate that partisanship took over the conversation before the Justice even was laid to rest. The partisan bickering and demands to ignore the Constitution that unfolded after Scalia’s death is an affront to his legacy. Scalia dedicated his life to serv-ing the Constitution. It is time for the Sen-ate to honor that service and carry out their constitutionally mandated duty to advise. The Constitution reigns supreme. . . . My colleagues in the Senate have an obligation to provide advice to the President on nomi-nees. So I urge others to look at what the Congressman from Montana said, what the senior Senator from Maine said, and what Governor Christie said. I agree with them that the Constitution reigns supreme. It simply is saying to do your job, among other things. In this situation there is no question what the Constitution mandates in times of Supreme Court vacancies. Ar-ticle II, section 2 of our Constitution clearly outlines the President’s legal authority to nominate Justices to the Supreme Court. It also defines the Sen-ate’s role in the nomination, which is to provide advice and consent. By de-nying their constitutional mandate, Republicans are refusing to do their job. Senate Republicans should give President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee a meeting, a hearing, and a vote, because, as Governor Christie said, there is really no reason not to do so. 
f 
BLACK HISTORY MONTH Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday marked the end of Black History Month, which we honored here in the Senate by adopting a resolution spon-sored by the junior Senator from New York, Mrs. G
ILLIBRAND . The father of Black History Month was Dr. Carter G. Woodson. Now, I real-ly didn’t know who Carter Woodson was, but there was a wonderful piece on public radio yesterday that outlined in detail this man, who had been a gar-bage man, who did menial labor, and I just didn’t realize how smart he was. His personal story is remarkable. Carter Woodson was born in Virginia to former slaves. He attended the Uni-versity of Chicago—not an easy school to get into, certainly in the early part of the last century, when you are an African American. He then went on to receive his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1912, making him the second African-Amer-ican man to do so. As a professor at Howard University here in Washington, DC, Dr. Woodson decided there was a need for Ameri-cans—Black and White—to better un-derstand African-American history. In 1926, Dr. Woodson organized the first week devoted entirely to African- American history. He coordinated lec-tures, panels, and hosted children’s plays that celebrated the lives of im-portant figures in Black history. He had a tough time. They couldn’t find places to meet. They wouldn’t allow Blacks in many meeting halls. But he found rooms at the YMCA, churches, and Black fraternity houses to meet and to celebrate African-Amer-ican history. He was relentless. Over the years, the celebration of Black his-tory grew and grew until President Ford decided to make it not a history week but a history month. He did that in 1976. So February is always recog-nized—since President Ford did that in 1976—as Black History Month. In addition to adopting this resolu-tion to honor Black History Month, I hope my colleagues will take a mo-ment to think about this great man, Dr. Woodson, who did so much to help Americans embrace Black history and the many contributions of African- American leaders, such as Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, W.E.B. Du Bois, and many others. But we must do more than just adopt a simple resolution honoring Black History Month. We should work to-gether to address the issues faced by Black Americans and all Americans today and every month of the year. It is the right thing to do. Mr. President, I see my friends on the floor. Would the Chair announce the business of the day. f

COMPREHENSIVE ADDICTION AND RECOVERY ACT OF 2015—MOTION TO PROCEED The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 524, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: 
Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 369, S. 524, a bill to authorize the Attorney General to award grants to address the national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and heroin use. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The Senator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Comprehen-sive Addiction and Recovery Act, known as CARA, of which I am proud to be a cosponsor. I want to begin by commending Senators W
HITEHOUSE and P
ORTMAN for crafting this vitally im-portant bill and also to thank Chair-man G
RASSLEY and Ranking Member L
EAHY for their leadership in the Judi-ciary Committee. The heroin and opioid crisis in this country is devastating to far too many families, including those in my State of Maine. This epidemic can be seen in emergency rooms, local jails, on Main Streets, and in homes throughout our country. In 2014, there were a record 208 over-dose deaths in the State of Maine, in-cluding 57 caused by heroin, and the problem is only getting worse. Last year, in the city of Portland, ME, 14 people overdosed in just 1 day. Two of them died as a result of those overdoses. This last weekend, the Bangor Daily News had a special segment of the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1107 March 1, 2016 
paper that chronicled the vivid and tragic story of a young man, Garrett Brown, whose spiral into addiction ul-timately resulted in his death from a heroin overdose. This epidemic is also having tragic effects on the most vulnerable in our society—the children and babies born to addicts. Last year in Maine nearly 1,000 babies were born drug-affected. That is about 8 percent of all births in our State. I have seen the videos of these babies in the neonatal intensive care unit. They are inconsolable. It is so tragic to watch them. Fortunately, the physicians and other health care providers in Maine have become very good at treating these babies, but I wonder what happens to them when they go back to their addicted mothers or fathers. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act takes the kind of multi-faceted approach needed to address this epidemic. I have said we need a three- pronged approach. First, we need to focus on education and prevention. That is education of the public at large, particularly our school children, but it is also education of health care providers and of law en-forcement as well. I remember vividly when I was a young student sitting through a presentation by a recovered heroin addict. I don’t know if that is done anymore in our schools, but I can tell you it had a marked impact on all of us who listened to him. None of us ever would have wanted to be in the po-sition in which he found himself as he struggled to recover from his addic-tion. I don’t understand how heroin has lost its stigma, but it clearly has, and it is creating tragic results for our country. So education and prevention are critical. Second is law enforcement. We need to do a better job of helping law en-forcement. I have had so many sheriffs tell me we cannot arrest our way out of this epidemic. We need to connect peo-ple who voluntarily come into our jails, and we need to connect them to treatment. Unfortunately, there aren’t enough treatment facilities or guid-ance counselors or substance abuse ex-perts or physicians and nurses and oth-ers with this expertise in many rural areas of our country, particularly in States like Maine, and I suspect in urban areas like Chicago where the service providers are overwhelmed with the number of people who need help. There has been a tripling of people in Maine who need help. Law enforcement has another critical role; that is, to work to interdict the heroin that is coming into the State of Maine—whether it originates in other States, or through ties to cities in Con-necticut and Massachusetts, where inner-city gangs are bringing heroin into Maine and swapping it for guns. There is this trafficking that is going on where addicts with no records are being used as straw buyers, buying guns for the gang members who then exchange the heroin for these weapons. We need to have a greater effort to keep heroin out of our country when it is coming from those international car-tels in Mexico as documented by the Portland Press Herald’s excellent in-vestigation into this matter. Of course, the third prong is treat-ment. We need more treatment facili-ties. We need the ability of not just paramedics but law enforcement to ad-minister the drug Narcan, which can reverse the effects of overdoses if it is administered in time. The bill before us takes that kind of multifaceted approach. It includes strengthening treatment programs, supporting law enforcement, and in-creasing education and prevention ef-forts. It would encourage States and communities to expand these efforts and to increase evidence-based treat-ments for substance abuse disorders. It would authorize heroin and meth-amphetamine task forces to support safe law enforcement agencies, and it provides grants for communities facing drug crises. This crisis is by no means confined to the cities in our States. It is in the most rural areas imaginable in my State. It affects suburbia, and it affects neighborhoods throughout our country. Part of the solution to this crisis in-cludes examining pain management and prescribing practices. I have heard from Maine families, from physicians, and from law enforcement about a dis-turbing pattern of a significant per-centage of individuals using heroin after abusing legal opioid medications. According to a recent report from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, prescription opioid abuse does indeed put individ-uals at a much higher risk of heroin use. In fact, nearly 80 percent of indi-viduals using heroin reported that they began on their road to addiction by abusing prescription pain medications. CARA would create a task force to review, modify, and update best prac-tices for pain management and pre-scribing pain medication. It would also expand the disposal sites for unwanted prescriptions through drug take-back programs, which is an important way for individuals to safely and securely dispose of their unused prescription drugs. I have long been a supporter of drug take-back programs, which have prevented tons of unused, unneeded or expired drugs from falling into the hands of children or drug dealers. At Maine’s most recent drug take-back day, authorities safely disposed of nearly 10 tons of unused drugs. Think about that. In a State of just 1.3 mil-lion people, in just one of these drug take-back days, 10 tons of unused drugs were collected and safely disposed of. The bill would also authorize grants for strengthening State prescription drug monitoring programs to help prevent doctor shopping. I have great sympathy for our county sheriffs who have talked to me about this problem. They tell me their jails are overwhelmed by those who are struggling with addiction. Jails are not designed to take the place of treatment centers. Yet sheriffs and police chiefs must train their officers to look for signs of withdrawal and to monitor mental health status. CARA would es-tablish a demonstration program to help identify addicted individuals who may benefit more from treatment than incarceration. Funding would also be authorized to purchase and train first responders in the use of Narcan, a drug that as I mentioned can reverse the effects of an overdose if administered in time, and a portion of this funding is designated to support rural areas in our country. There have been many discussions in this Chamber, in our committees, and in our caucuses about the heroin crisis. Last December, the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on which I serve held a hearing to exam-ine prescribing practices, expanding ac-cess to addiction treatment, reducing overdoses, and partnering with law en-forcement. Just last week, the Special Com-mittee on Aging—which I have the privilege to chair—examined opiate use among seniors and other Medicare par-ticipants, the potential for diversion of powerful pain killers and Medicare re-imbursement policies that may penal-ize physicians who, in their best med-ical judgment, decide not to prescribe powerful opiate pain killers and in-stead provide other kinds of pain relief for their patients. Yet because of the way the surveys are worded, under the Medicare patient satisfaction program, their hospitals can actually lose reim-bursement if it is found that a patient was not satisfied enough with control of their pain. Clearly, pain does need to be managed, but these questions are so biased in the way they are asked that they invite overprescription and the prescription of powerful pain killers when they may not be needed. I am not talking about individuals with cancer or end-of-life conditions for whom opi-ate pain killers may be exactly what is needed to relieve their pain, but we know there are better alternatives for many people who do not need that kind of pain relief. I am working with Sen-ator L
ANKFORD , Senator D ONNELLY , Senator C
ASEY , and others to see if we can come up with an amendment to this bill on this issue. It is clear we need to take a com-prehensive approach to this epidemic, and the bill before us is a vital step for-ward. It recognizes opioid and heroin abuse for the public health crisis that it has become, and it offers meaningful and effective ways to support commu-nities seeking to expand treatment pre-vention, law enforcement, and recovery efforts. Again, I salute the sponsors of this legislation. I am pleased to be a co-sponsor, and I urge all of our col-leagues to come together to support this much needed bill. My thanks to my colleague from Illi-nois for deferring to me.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES1108 March 1, 2016 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The assistant Democratic leader. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, before I speak on a separate issue, I would like to address the issue raised by the Sen-ator from Maine. Her experience in Maine is exactly the same as my experience in Illinois. There is no town too small, no suburb too wealthy not to have been touched by heroin overdoses and deaths. It is interesting—the Senator may be en-couraged to know that in one small town in downstate Illinois, when they were desperate when two or three teen-agers died in 1 week in a small town, they heard about a program in Gloucester, MA, where the chief of po-lice, reacting to what the Senator said earlier, realized that we just can’t keep arresting addicts. It is not working. He announced that if someone who was addicted came into the sheriff’s of-fice or the police department and re-ported their addiction, they wouldn’t arrest them; they would take them to a treatment center immediately. The next day, 27 teenagers showed up in this small town in downstate Illinois. Then, of course, the challenge was where to take them. In rural areas, it is a long drive. Some of them were not in good shape for a drive. But they went into treatment. What they told me after I visited the town was that something happened im-mediately: The jail was empty because the jail had been filled with petty criminals who had been stealing, bur-glarizing, trying to feed their habits. Now they were in rehab. So it made it a safer community and at least gave them a chance to straighten out their lives. One of the amendments I am offering with your colleague from Maine is about treatment. We decided a number of years ago, for fear that we would be warehousing patients, to limit sub-stance abuse treatment facilities under Medicaid to no more than 16 beds. Six-teen beds may work in a rural area; it certainly doesn’t work in the city of Chicago. We are not expanding it dra-matically, but we allow treatment fa-cilities to have up to 40 beds for resi-dential treatment for substance abuse. We don’t want to go back into the bad old days of warehousing, but we cer-tainly want to expand treatment be-cause the problem you have seen and I have seen is growing. As you noted, if we don’t move quick-ly on treatment, we can’t expect to turn it around. I thank the Senator for bringing this to our attention. The bill before us truly is a bipartisan bill, and it should be. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent to speak as in morning business. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. Without objection, it is so or-dered. 
FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY  
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 1 week ago the Republican majority leader made an announcement that stunned a lot of observers on Capitol Hill. Sen-ator MCCONNELL said that the Senate Republicans would basically turn their backs on what I consider to be a con-stitutional responsibility and that they would refuse to consider the nomina-tion to fill the vacancy of Justice Scalia, who recently passed away. In article II, section 2 of the Con-stitution, the Founding Fathers estab-lished a very clear process for appoint-ing Supreme Court Justices. Under the Constitution, the President ‘‘shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall ap-point . . . Judges of the supreme Court.’’ That is the language of the Constitution. It is explicit. The President has a constitutional obligation to send a Supreme Court nominee to the Senate, and the Senate has a constitutional obligation to con-sider the nominee. But the majority leader for the Republicans said last week that he would not give any con-sideration to a nominee sent by Presi-dent Obama—not a hearing, not a vote—and then he went so far as to say he will not even meet with that nomi-nee. This is a stunning abdication of the Senate’s constitutional responsi-bility. All of us, as Senators, walk down this aisle, stand over to the side, raise our right hands, and swear to sup-port and defend the Constitution of the United States and to bear true faith and allegiance to it. It is an oath each of us takes very seriously. The majority leader has tried to jus-tify his decision by noting that this is an election year. Well, it turns out it doesn’t take much constitutional study to realize that the Constitution applies to election years as well as every other year. There is nothing in the Constitu-tion that directs the President or the Senate to ignore their responsibility when there is a political Presidential campaign underway. I have searched the Constitution. There is no reference whatsoever to a Presidential campaign year absolving either the President or the Senate from their constitutional obligations. One of the great ironies of the deci-sion by the Senate Republican leader-ship was the way they reached it. Shortly after Justice Scalia passed away, Majority Leader M
CCONNELL  issued a statement saying: ‘‘The Amer-ican people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice.’’ Then last Tuesday he sum-moned the Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to his of-fice, and there he decided with them that they would deprive the American people of a chance to view a hearing on President Obama’s nominee to fill the Scalia vacancy. This is an unprece-dented obstruction of a Supreme Court nominee, and this decision to obstruct certainly wasn’t made by the American people. It was a unilateral, partisan de-cision made by a handful of Senators behind closed doors. The Republican Senators didn’t bring their decision out into the open, not to a hearing of the Judiciary Committee, which they chair; they did it quietly behind closed doors. But the American people heard what happened. Last Friday a letter was sent to the Republican members of the Judiciary Committee by the Leader-ship Conference on Civil Rights and Human Rights and 81 other national or-ganizations. I ask unanimous consent to have the letter printed in the RECORD . There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R

EARSENATORS : We, the undersigned orga-nizations, urge you to reconsider your un-precedented and destructive refusal to give fair consideration to any Supreme Court nomination until after the next President is sworn into office on January 20, 2017, as an-nounced in your February 23rd letter to Sen-ate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Your letter claims that your refusal to hold a hearing on—or to even meet with— any potential nominee is part and parcel to executing your ‘‘constitutional authority to withhold consent on any nominee.’’ This is a clear perversion of your constitutional du-ties as understood by almost every scholarly authority on the topic and by most Ameri-cans. It is a dereliction of your constitutional duty to handcuff the Supreme Court for two terms. Your proposed course of action would cause a constitutional crisis that would shake the very foundation of our democracy. We condemn this unprecedented overreach, and call on you to uphold the Constitution by giving fair consideration, including time-ly hearings and votes, to the next nominee to the Supreme Court. Under Article II, Section 2 of the U.S. Con-stitution, the President shall nominate a Justice to the Supreme Court ‘‘by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate.’’ This does not give a select few senators veto power over the President’s role in selecting and nominating a candidate. The Senate’s duty is to evaluate a nominee’s fitness and qualifications, not to pick the President making the nomination. Our legal system is based on the rule of law and requires stability and certainty. The course you have charted would mean that a new justice would not be confirmed until well into 2017 at the earliest. Shackling the court for two terms would undermine the rule of law, leave legal questions unresolved, and hamper the administration of justice across our nation. Refusing to consider any nominee, without due evaluation of his or her merits, creden-tials, and experiences, is a direct repudiation of your constitutional duties. We believe in upholding the Constitution. So should you.

Mr. DURBIN. The letter described the Republicans’ obstruction as ‘‘a clear perversion of your constitutional duties as understood by almost every scholarly authority on the topic and by most Americans.’’ The letter said that the Constitution ‘‘does not give a se-lect few Senators veto power over the President’s role in selecting and nomi-nating a candidate. The Senate’s duty is to evaluate a nominee’s fitness and qualifications, not to pick the Presi-dent making the nomination.’’ I agree with that statement. By uni-laterally refusing to give any consider-ation to any nominee made by this President, Senate Republicans are try-ing to stop this President from ful-filling his constitutional responsibility to nominate and appoint Supreme Court Justices under article II, section 2. They did it in secret in a back room, behind closed doors. Why are they so afraid to give President Obama’s nomi-nee a fair hearing? Are they concerned that if the nominee is well qualified and they turn that person down, it will reflect poorly on the Senate Repub-licans? The Senate Republican process of se-crecy and obstruction is inconsistent with the Constitution. It does a dis-service to the Supreme Court, to the President, and to the American people. I raised a point last week which is worth returning to. The argument is made that the next President should pick the nominee to fill this vacancy. The argument is made that the Amer-ican people, when they select the next President in November of this year— that we will be saying to the American people: You make the choice. You se-lect the President. And then you will know the Supreme Court nominee. Well, there may be some logic to that but for one thing: We have a President. He was elected in 2012 with a 5 million- vote majority. This is the fourth year of his Presidency. When you listen to the Republicans argue, you would think, wait a minute, Barack Obama was not elected for 4 years, only for 3 years and 2 months. They argue at this point in time that this President does not have the con-stitutional authority or responsibility to fill the vacancy of Justice Scalia. The American people spoke. It wasn’t all that close. By a margin of 5 million votes, they chose this President for 4 years, not for 3 years or 3 years and 2 months. He is the President, he has the authority of the Presidency, and he has that authority not given to him by God but by the American people. It is au-thority which should not be taken away by the Republican majority of the Senate. Their argument, ‘‘Wait for the next election’’—do you know what that means? It means that if they have their way, if they fail to do their job, if they don’t even have a hearing for President Obama’s nominee, don’t even bring it to a vote, and the vacancy con-tinues on the Supreme Court, it will be historic. The last time we will have left a vacancy of this duration on the Su-preme Court dates back to the Civil War. A nation at war with itself left a vacancy for more than a year on the Supreme Court. Now the Senate Repub-licans of 2016 want to leave a vacancy on the Supreme Court for over a year. There is no need for it, and the Con-stitution certainly makes it clear how this vacancy should be filled. There is no secret that there is a po-litical motive. The Senate Republicans hope Justice Scalia’s seat will be filled by a person they choose. This is a po-litical calculation they are willing to make, to take the heat for not fol-lowing their constitutional responsi-bility in the hopes that a President Trump will pick someone to fill this vacancy or some other Republican President in the future. That is what they are counting on. That is political. Politics shouldn’t trump the Con-stitution. Nothing should trump the Constitution when it comes to gov-erning the United States. Because it is an election year doesn’t mean Senators can take a yearlong break and ignore their own oath of office. It is time for the Senate Republicans to do their job. The President and the Senate must fulfill their constitutional responsibility in times of war, in eco-nomic depression, and even in an elec-tion year. Last week Majority Leader MCCON-
NELL reportedly told a group of House Republicans that there isn’t ‘‘a snow-ball’s chance in hell’’ that he would back down from his plan of obstruc-tion. Nevertheless, today President Obama has invited Majority Leader M
CCONNELL to meet with him in the White House to discuss the Supreme Court vacancy. They have also invited the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator G
RASSLEY ; the ranking Democrat, Senator L
EAHY ; and the minority leader of the Senate, Sen-ator R
EID. Why did the President offer this meeting? Because that is what always happens. When a President is about to consider filling such a historic va-cancy, he brings together the leaders of the Senate to discuss his thought proc-ess and perhaps to solicit names from them of potential nominees. Even when we have disagreed in the past and have Presidents and Senators from different political parties, they still extended that courtesy to one another. Presi-dent Obama is extending the majority leader that courtesy even if the major-ity leader has made it clear and pub-licly stated repeatedly that he will not even meet with, let alone consider, the President’s nominee. The President is setting a good exam-ple of what should be done in this cir-cumstance where the President follows tradition and the Constitution. I am glad the President is taking this seri-ously. I know he is in the midst of a careful, deliberative process to choose a nominee. The President should select an outstanding person who has the qualifications, a commitment to jus-tice, a deep respect for the role of the judiciary, and life experience that points toward integrity and good judg-ment. The President is doing his job as the Constitution requires. My Republican colleagues in the Senate should do their job as well. They should honor the process established in the Constitu-tion and give the President’s nominee fair consideration, a hearing, and a vote. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. F
LAKE ). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES1110 March 1, 2016 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, yester-day the Senate unanimously voted to advance consideration of the Com-prehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, commonly known as CARA, and that is because this legislation gets at a big problem. The abuse of heroin and prescription painkillers is devastating families and communities across the country, including Texas. The truth is, the problem is getting worse, not bet-ter. Deaths due to heroin and prescrip-tion drug overdoses have even sur-passed car accidents as the No. 1 cause of injury-related deaths nationwide. It is time for Congress to do some-thing significant to address this dis-turbing trend. This bill is a good exam-ple of how Republicans and Democrats, working on a bipartisan basis, can zero in on a problem that is harming our Nation and work together to address it. I am proud to cosponsor this legisla-tion, and I look forward to continuing to work on this bill and to voting on amendments that will actually im-prove it. Speaking of amendments, while this bill touches on how to battle drug addiction in this country, we need to do more to cut these drugs off at the source and keep them from getting into our country in the first place. The Senate Armed Services Com-mittee recently heard about the supply side of this equation—this primarily goes to the heroin coming from Mex-ico—when they heard testimony from the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper. In his testimony, Di-rector Clapper talked about how Mex-ico has ramped up the production of heroin in response to this growing de-mand in the United States. I know the Presiding Officer is also from a border State and has had fre-quent conversations with our Mexican counterparts. When we complain about the supply, they usually turn it on me and say: Well, what about the demand in the United States? The truth is, we have to get at both components—both the supply and demand. In 2014, drug cartels smuggled more than a quarter of a million pounds of heroin across our borders. This was done by the same transnational crimi-nal organizations that traffic human beings for sex or forced labor and who man the illegal immigration pipelines into our country. This is no longer a mom-and-pop operation. These are major criminal networks and organiza-tions that will do anything for money and, of course, are happy to make money from the heroin that comes across our border. If we are going to make significant strides in the fight against addiction and drug abuse, we need to take a crit-ical look at where the drugs are com-ing from and consider the strategies we can employ to keep them from even coming onto our soil. Unfortunately, even while the production and demand of these illegal drugs have been grow-ing, we have not done enough to com-bat it. Earlier I mentioned that the U.S. Southern Command—that is the com-batant command for the U.S. military that is south of Mexico and goes into Central and South America—has been given zero Navy ships to conduct counter-trafficking missions, and that is because our Navy fleet is simply too small and these resources have been di-verted elsewhere to counter the grow-ing threats around the world. It is irre-sponsible to ignore the transnational criminal threats in our own backyard. We need a strategy to interdict drug shipments and cut them off before they reach our shores, so I have submitted several amendments that would help focus our resources to interdict these shipments and to help stem the grow-ing tide of illicit drugs entering the U.S. market. One amendment would simply re-quire the Defense Department, when it allocates funding to the States for the National Guard Counterdrug Program, to prioritize drug interdiction. More ef-fectively using the National Guard’s military capabilities to help interdict drug flows would provide a needed boost to law enforcement and counter-narcotics efforts, especially on our southern border. Too often, law en-forcement agencies have been left with scant resources to handle this growing problem, so this amendment would allow the National Guard to play a big-ger role in drug interdiction. Another amendment I have sub-mitted would require the President to create a plan—a strategy, really—to in-crease interdiction of illegal drugs that enter across the southwest border. It would require the interdiction goal of 90 percent of those drugs, which would be a great leap forward from the cur-rent levels. Last year, General Kelly, then the commander of Southern Command, es-timated that only 15 to 20 percent of drugs bound for the United States were interdicted, just 15 percent to 20 per-cent. General Kelly said that, due to a lack of resources in the Southern Com-mand, basically many times they were relegated to being observers as illegal drugs would transit across their area of operation. Given our shortfall here, it is pretty amazing that a comprehensive plan across all relevant agencies doesn’t al-ready exist. It is shocking really. This amendment would make sure that one is created to boost the amount of drugs that we successfully interdict. It would also require the President to submit this plan to Congress so we can have a conversation between the executive branch and the legislative branch and so the American people could review it, could hold us accountable, and to make sure we are making progress on this front. Finally, I have submitted an amend-ment to strengthen the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Program. This would help Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials use task force funding to implement a multi-disciplinary heroin response strategy. This has been tested in several high-in-tensity drug trafficking areas with great success. This amendment would help implement this strategy nation-wide, giving law enforcement addi-tional tools to combat the growing threat of heroin from both the supply and demand side. Mr. President, I am glad we are mak-ing some progress on this legislation. I am optimistic that we will be able to complete it this week in a bipartisan fashion, which is the only way you get these done around here. We desperately need to target the opioid epidemic hap-pening across the Nation, and we also need to cut off as much of the supply of the cheap heroin as we can. When peo-ple can’t get access to prescription drugs, too often they turn to cheap her-oin, and that is why the supply issue is so important. But we need both pieces in order to make real progress and re-store our communities currently plagued by addiction and drug abuse. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from New Hampshire. Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Comprehensive Ad-diction and Recovery Act. This is a bill that we have been working on for 2 years—Senator P
ORTMAN , Senator W
HITEHOUSE , and Senator K LOBUCHAR . I thank them for their partnership and leadership on this bill. This is some-thing the four of us got together on be-cause we saw in our own States the public health epidemic that was hap-pening with our constituents: individ-uals struggling with addiction, people who were addicted to prescription drugs and overusing and misusing pre-scription drugs, and then with the price of heroin on our streets so low that people are turning to heroin and also a combination of heroin and a deadly drug called fentanyl. I thank Senators P
ORTMAN , W HITE-
HOUSE , and K LOBUCHAR for the work we have been doing together over the last several years on this bill to see this bill come to this Senate floor. This is a very important piece of legislation and will help us address the public health epidemic facing my home State of New Hampshire and this country. This is something I have come to the floor about on several occasions before. Traveling around my State, I can’t tell you the number of stories I have heard from people in New Hampshire about what we are facing and the num-ber of lives that are lost, the number of lives that are devastated by heroin and fentanyl and misuse of prescription drugs. This is a life-or-death issue in my State. The number of drug overdose deaths has been staggering. Before I came to the Senate, I served as attor-ney general of our State, and so I

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1111 March 1, 2016 
worked with law enforcement on these issues, whether it was methamphet-amine, cocaine, or other illegal drugs, but I have never seen anything like this. As of last week, the chief medical examiner’s office had recorded that there were 420 drug deaths in 2015, and that was a dramatic increase in New Hampshire from the year before. The year before, we had about 320 drug deaths. So this is more than one person dying a day in my State. Many more than die in traffic accidents are dying from drug overdoses, and it is a com-bination, again, the driver of this—her-oin and Fentanyl. Fentanyl is 40 to 50 percent times more powerful than her-oin, and when the drug dealers mix it up with the heroin, it is a killer. As Eric Spofford told me—he is an in-credible guy who is in recovery and has opened treatment facilities in our State. He got it right when he said fentanyl is a serial killer because that is what it is. In the month of February alone, there were 14 suspected opioid overdose deaths just in the city of Manchester— 14 in just one city in my State. That is a record high in Manchester, NH. These are not just numbers that we are talk-ing about. Behind every statistic is a life, a life that is taken from us far too soon and has been tragically lost—a mother, a daughter, a son, a brother, a neighbor, a friend, a coworker. This hits all of us, and these are people who are being lost from this horrible epi-demic. Behind the statistics and behind the headlines we see every day in the news, there are family members, friends, and communities that have been deeply im-pacted by this public health crisis, such as the mother from Greenville, NH, who wrote to me. She spends her days actually doing incredibly impor-tant work, helping people who are struggling with addiction. She helps them, and yet she has been coming home to see her own son struggling with heroin. She told me, ‘‘As I tried to comfort those who have been affected by this tragedy, I think that my son will be next.’’ In Laconia, a man helps those strug-gling to get treatment, but he feels helpless when they are faced with a 5- month waiting period for a rehabilita-tion facility. He wrote, ‘‘In 5 months, these individuals may be dead.’’ A parent from Salem, NH, contacted me and told me her son is struggling with heroin addiction, and she needs help finding a treatment program for him since she could not afford to pay for treatment herself. Parents don’t know where to go. I have met many parents who want to get help for their kids, and they are having a hard time finding a place and knowing where to go. Another mother of three children had to revive her son from an overdose before the para-medics could arrive. The Griffin family from Newton, whom I have gotten to know well, lost their beautiful 20-year-old daughter Courtney to an overdose. Now, Courtney’s father Doug and Courtney’s mother Pam have made it their mis-sion to bring awareness to this issue and to make sure that others don’t suf-fer from the same tragedy they have suffered in the lost life of a beautiful young woman named Courtney, who had so much of life before her and so much potential. Doug and Pam and so many other dedicated people in New Hampshire are working tirelessly to turn the tide against this epidemic. Over the past 2 years, I made it a pri-ority to travel the State and hear from our public safety community, treat-ment providers, addiction experts, fam-ilies, and individuals in recovery about finding effective strategies to address this problem. On ride-alongs with the police and fire, I have been to overdoses. I have seen them bring peo-ple back to life, administering Narcan only to say that they face this every single day. If we don’t focus on preven-tion and we don’t focus on treatment, and the important work that our first responders are doing, then we are not going to get at this problem and make sure people who are struggling get out of this cycle of addiction. Treatment facilities in New Hamp-shire are certainly working tirelessly, and individuals are stepping up to ex-pand our capacity in New Hampshire to support individuals who need help, and they need more support. I want to take a moment to recognize some of their hard work. Among so many others, I am grateful that there are so many working hard together in New Hamp-shire: Hope for New Hampshire Recov-ery, Families in Transition Willows Program, the Farnum Center, Westbridge Community Services in Manchester, GateHouse Sober Commu-nity in Nashua, Hope on Haven Hill, Bonfire Recovery Services in Dover, The Granite House in Derry, and the New Freedom Academy in Canterbury. I have met many incredible people who are dedicating their lives to this. I have had the opportunity to visit these facilities and hear directly from the dedicated professionals who work there. They do critically important work. You have average people coming together, whether to organize a 5K race or to gain resources and support for people who are on the frontlines. This is what those who are on the frontlines are saying: Tackling this epidemic and reversing the tide of addiction will take a comprehensive, thoughtful ap-proach, and include strategies for treatment, prevention, education, sup-port for individuals in recovery, and interdiction. That is why we have to pass CARA. CARA is important because it em-bodies the comprehensive approach that so many in my State have told me they need. Here is what it looks like. It gives more support to first responders and law enforcement, expanding the availability of lifesaving drugs like Narcan, which our first responders are using every day. And because CARA will help make this happen, it has been endorsed by the National Fraternal Order of Police, National District At-torneys Association, and National As-sociation of Attorneys General, includ-ing New Hampshire’s own attorney general, Joe Foster. It strengthens prescription drug monitoring programs to help prevent ‘‘doctor shopping.’’ This is something I have been advocating for since I was attorney general of our State so that our public health officials can have the tools—because we know from SAMHSA research that four out of five people started by misusing or overusing pre-scription drugs and transferred to her-oin. So this is critical. It increases access to treatment, in-cluding evidence-based medication as-sisted treatment, which can help peo-ple have more access. We need to turn the tide. Over 130 stakeholder groups have gotten behind this legislation, groups that are on the frontline of this issue. Just to name some of them, it has been endorsed by the National Council for Behavioral Health, Amer-ican Psychological Association, Amer-ican Society of Addiction Medicine, Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, Harm Reduction Coalition, Faces and Voices of Recovery, Mental Health America, Young People in Re-covery, National Association of State Alcohol and Substance Abuse Direc-tors, among many others. I thank these groups for their feedback. It would support additional resources to identify and treat incarcerated indi-viduals suffering from substance abuse disorders and expand prevention. It is so important we address prevention. It would establish a campaign to bring greater awareness to the associa-tion between the overuse and misuse of prescription drugs and what happens as people misuse prescription drugs and then go to heroin and deadly drugs like fentanyl. This bill has overwhelming bipar-tisan support. It has 42 bipartisan co- sponsors. I see my colleague from New Hamp-shire on the floor. I want to thank her for her sponsorship of this legislation. This crisis does not discriminate. It doesn’t care. Heroin, fentanyl—the dev-astating impact of this drug does not care whether you’re a Republican, a Democrat, an Independent, whatever your background. This is something that affects all of us. A high school student from Man-chester who wrote to me, sharing how concerned he is about the negative im-pact this epidemic is having on his city. When he walks home from school, he sometimes sees discarded needles on the sidewalk, and tragically he lost his best friend to a fentanyl overdose. Abi, who lives in the Seacoast Re-gion, struggled with an opioid use dis-order through her pregnancy until she was finally able to receive help and treatment and enter recovery. I met Abi, and I am so inspired by her be-cause she shows us we can make a dif-ference and we can turn this around.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES1112 March 1, 2016 
A woman in Londonderry, who spoke to me at a community forum, was ter-rified her brother would suffer a reoc-currence as soon as he was released from prison because he wasn’t getting treatment. She was worried about his path to a successful life because he was still suffering from a substance abuse disorder. Then there is Angela from Nashua, who has turned her story into a ral-lying cry for others. Angela lost her mother to a heroin overdose 17 years ago and has adopted the children of several of her aunts and cousins who have lost their battles with addiction. After all of this, Angela’s son and his girlfriend have become addicted to opioids and his girlfriend overdosed in Angela’s home. Her son is still battling with heroin addiction. There are so many groups that are working to support these individuals and we need to give them our support. They cannot and should not have to do this alone. I see my colleague, Senator S
HAHEEN  from New Hampshire on the floor. I really appreciate her leadership on this issue. I am a cosponsor of Senator S
HA-
HEEN ’s standalone legislation which would provide emergency appropria-tions in order to combat the heroin and prescription opioid crisis facing our State. In fact, she and I have both writ-ten to Health and Human Services and asked them to designate this as a pub-lic health emergency. We have seen the impact on our State and we have seen the lives that are being lost and im-pacted by this. So I am going to be co-sponsoring Senator S
HAHEEN ’s amend-ment to CARA and supporting it on the floor. I very much support her getting a vote on this amendment, and I hope that happens. In addition, I appreciate that the President has put in additional re-sources in his budget to address this issue. This is an issue that we all have to work together on. At the end of the year, there was also important funding that was passed that CARA would provide a very im-portant framework for. Last year dur-ing the appropriations process, Con-gress worked to increase by 284 percent funding for programs at CDC and SAMHSA related to combating opioid abuse. While this is a positive step for-ward, these dollars actually haven’t been distributed yet. It is important we pass CARA to make sure that as we go forward with the dollars that have al-ready been appropriated and as we go forward in the appropriations process this year, that we have the framework to properly redirect this funding for prevention, treatment, and first re-sponders, to make sure we have the feedback of 130 stakeholder groups and law enforcement throughout the coun-try and to ensure that these dollars are appropriately spent to address the epi-demic we are facing. I have been honored to work over the last several years, again, with Senators P
ORTMAN , WHITEHOUSE , and K LOBUCHAR  in introducing this bill. In fact, I also thank the head of drug policy in the administration, Director Botticelli. He summed it up well when we asked him what he thought about CARA. He said in a hearing before the Judiciary Com-mittee in January: There is clear evidence that a comprehen-sive response looking at multidimensional aspects of this that are embedded in the CARA Act are tremendously important. We know we need to do more, and I think that all of those components put forward in this bill are critically important to making head-way in terms of this epidemic. 
The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act would be a significant step forward in a Federal response to this public health epidemic that is fac-ing New Hampshire and so many other States in the country. I urge my col-leagues to support this critical legisla-tion, to listen to the people of New Hampshire and to the people of this country who are asking us to act. This is what they are saying in New Hampshire. In Center Barnstead: ‘‘Please pass legislation to save my son’s life.’’ In Manchester: ‘‘I wake up every morning with a fear that I will find my son dead. I am crying out for help.’’ In Spofford: ‘‘I want my voice to be heard so that no one else falls through the cracks.’’ In Londonderry: ‘‘Addiction can hap-pen to anyone.’’ In Tilton: ‘‘We need action, and we need it right now.’’ We have an opportunity on this floor right now, in this debate, with very thoughtful legislation, very bipartisan legislation—the Comprehensive Addic-tion and Recovery Act—to take action now. We owe it to all those who have lost their lives, their families who have been impacted, and those who are struggling with addiction. We owe it to the first responders in our community and to the people who are working hard to turn this around in New Hampshire and across this country. To all, I thank them for the incredible work they are doing. We need to pass this legislation. I urge my colleagues to join me in sup-porting passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. This bill will make a difference, and I believe it will help save lives in New Hampshire and across the country. There is no doubt that passing this bill will make a difference. We will all need to continue to do more. We will all need to continue to fight for more and more support through the appro-priations process and any way we can. I intend to keep up this fight because I know lives are on the line. I know this issue is impacting my State. I know that as I talk to the mothers, the daughters, the fathers, the sons, the friends who are telling me the stories of the people they have lost, that we can turn this around. It is so important that we pass this legislation. Again, I wish to thank my colleague from the State of New Hampshire for her work on this. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from New Hampshire. Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 30 minutes, and I wonder if the Chair will advise me when I have about 3 minutes remaining. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Chair will so notify the Senator. Mrs. SHAHEEN. I thank the Pre-siding Officer. I am pleased to join my colleague from New Hampshire on the floor and the others who have spoken this morn-ing so eloquently about the heroin and opioid epidemic that is ravaging fami-lies and communities in every one of our States. As Senator A
YOTTE said so well, we have seen in New Hampshire that we are at ground zero for this epidemic. In terms of the percentage of people af-fected in New Hampshire, we are losing a higher percentage than almost every State in the Nation. This is an issue we need to work together to address. I think we have to respond much more robustly than we have done at the Fed-eral level because this epidemic is be-coming a pandemic. It is affecting young and old, urban and rural, rich and poor, Whites and minorities. As others have said, the Senate is now considering the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act or CARA. I want to congratulate the sponsors of the legislation because this is a good bipartisan bill. It is important as we look at what we need to do to address the epidemic we face. In addition to the authorizations and the good work that is in the CARA leg-islation, we also need to provide the re-sources that law enforcement and health professionals who are on the frontlines of dealing with this crisis are going to need. Despite heroic ef-forts, law enforcement and treatment professionals are increasingly over-whelmed by the sheer scope and scale of the opioid and heroin crisis. Every-where I go in New Hampshire, the lack of resources is abundantly clear. Our communities need additional funding— and they need it urgently. So this is why I have submitted an amendment cosponsored by the author of CARA, Senator W
HITEHOUSE , and I am pleased my colleague from New Hampshire has also joined in cospon-soring this amendment. This amend-ment would provide $600 million in emergency funding for critical pro-grams that we know will help address this crisis. I am on the floor to urge the major-ity leader and the leadership of the Senate to allow a vote on this legisla-tion because this is a nationwide emer-gency of the first order, and it is time for us in Congress to treat it like a na-tionwide emergency. In 2014, more than 47,000 Americans died from lethal drug overdoses—more fatalities than from car accidents. Each day 120 Americans die of drug

overdoses—2 deaths every hour. In our State of New Hampshire, where we have 1.3 million people, we are losing more than a person a day to drug over-dose deaths. Here we have a map of America that shows the increases in deaths from drug overdoses. We can see in 2003 the majority of the map is lighter colored, so it means it doesn’t have the same number of deaths. In 2008 we can see this dark red color which shows the deaths from drug overdoses increasing. Here, in 2014, we see the impact of those 47,000 people lost. The State of the Presiding Officer, like in New Hampshire, is at ground zero in the State of Arizona. In West Virginia, in Tennessee, and in Ken-tucky, they are seeing the same dra-matic increase in the number of deaths from drug overdoses. This chart rep-resents overdose deaths per 100,000 peo-ple. Again, it demonstrates how truly national in scope the crisis has become. No State is immune from the scourge. Across the country, our communities are asking why this is happening. They are asking why so many of our family members and neighbors are overdosing on these drugs. Sadly, as we have heard from people who have spoken on the floor, one of the primary reasons is be-cause so many people are becoming ad-dicted to prescription opioid drugs, bet-ter known as painkillers. In 2012, 259 million prescriptions were written for these drugs—almost 1 for every Amer-ican. That is more than enough to give every American adult their own bottle of pills. During a 3-month stretch in 2015 in New Hampshire, 13 million doses of schedule II painkillers were dis-pensed at New Hampshire pharmacies in just one 3-month period—13 million pills in 3 months for a State with a population of 1.3 million, and nearly 80 percent of these prescriptions were for heavy painkillers like oxycodone, mor-phine, and fentanyl. If we look, we can see how this graph dramatically tracks the increase in drug prescribing and the number of deaths that resulted. The number of drug overdose deaths has risen as opioid prescriptions have increased. This orange line is the number of deaths. The green line is the number of prescriptions that are being written. We are missing the data for the year 2012, but there is no doubt that those deaths track the number of prescrip-tions for painkillers that are being written. The National Institutes of Health have found that people who are ad-dicted to opioid painkillers are 40 times more likely to be addicted to heroin. So when someone gets addicted to pain pills and can no longer get pre-scriptions, they turn to drugs like her-oin and fentanyl. What I heard from law enforcement in New Hampshire and from the med-ical community is that people turn to heroin because it is cheaper and easier to get than prescription drugs after they become addicted. Of course, we have seen that drug traffickers are tak-ing advantage. They are flooding our streets with these drugs. In many of our communities, that bag of heroin is cheaper than a six-pack of beer. Of course the end result is a staggering in-crease in overdose deaths, which we can see on this chart. Again, in 2014, nearly 21,000 people died from opioid abuse. There were more than 10,000 deaths from heroin. That is a 222-percent increase from 2009 levels. So we can see that these are opioid deaths, these are deaths from cocaine, and these are deaths from heroin. We can see the red line and the green line have gone up dramatically. A professor at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, Brendan Saloner, de-scribes opioid addiction as ‘‘a chronic relapsing illness, just like diabetes.’’ We know treatment is the only effec-tive answer. Again, what I have heard from law enforcement in New Hamp-shire is that they know they can’t put drug users in jail. That is not the an-swer to deal with this challenge. We need to put the bad guys in jail, but we need to provide treatment to the peo-ple who need it because that is the only effective answer. Unfortunately, it is a tragic reality that nationwide nearly 9 out of 10 people with substance use dis-orders don’t receive treatment. They are being turned away and denied treatment due to a chronic lack of re-sources. My colleague from New Hampshire spoke very eloquently about some of the people she heard from. We have heard from people in the same way in New Hampshire. Of the 1.3 million peo-ple in our State, it is estimated that 100,000 people—almost 10 percent—are currently seeking treatment for sub-stance use disorders. We are able to offer services to only a small fraction of that total. Over the last decade the number of people admitted to State treatment programs increased 90 percent for her-oin use and 500 percent—500 percent— for prescription drug use, with the largest increases occurring in the past several years. As we can see from this chart, lack of treatment is a national problem: the darker the green, the more people in that State who are not receiving treat-ment for addiction. Sadly, New Hamp-shire is a very dark green, as is Ari-zona, the Presiding Officer’s State. You can see this dark green line coming down the east coast and going up the west coast. In 2014, in Kentucky, 82,000 people needed addiction treatment but failed to get it—in Tennessee, 116,000 people; in Arizona, 157,000; in Nevada, 55,000; in North Carolina, 200,000 people. These are all people who needed treatment who didn’t get it. When people don’t get treatment, they are overdosing in overwhelming numbers. Sadly, this map of the United States shows where the overdose death rates are the highest. Where the darkest col-ors are shown the death rates are greater than 19 per 100,000 of popu-lation. We can see many of the same States, such as New Hampshire, that have the most difficulty in people find-ing treatment. Those are the States where we are finding the highest death rates. In 2014 in Kentucky, 1,100 people died from a drug overdose; in Ten-nessee, 1,200 people; in Arizona, 1,200 overdose deaths; in Nevada, 500; and in North Carolina, 1,300. In recent days I have had a chance to visit three treatment centers in my home State, Headrest in Lebanon, Se-renity Place in Manchester, and Sea-coast Youth Services in Seabrook. These treatment centers are staffed by skilled, dedicated professionals. They are saving lives every day, but they tell me that for every life they save, many more are being lost for lack of treatment capacity, lack of facilities, and lack of funding. I had a chance on some of those visits to meet with some of the people in re-covery. I can remember one young man up in Lebanon at Headrest who had been in and out of prison because of crimes committed when he was using. He said to me that it costs thousands of dollars to keep someone in prison. The figure he used was $35,000. He said: Don’t you all know that it is cheaper to give somebody treatment? It is abso-lutely more cost effective for us to pro-vide treatment for people who are in recovery, people who need help. I heard from a young woman in Man-chester who said that she had been ar-rested for drug use. She said: I am not a criminal. My problem is I need treat-ment to deal with these drugs. Another young woman who was in her early twenties who had been in and out of the Manchester jail—the Valley Street jail—said: You know, they don’t provide treatment in the Valley Street jail. I learned when I got picked up that I don’t tell them that I have a drug problem or that I have mental health issues because if I do, they put me in the bubble where I get observed 24 hours a day, regardless of what I am doing. What I need is treatment. I don’t need to be in the bubble. Well, that is why this supplemental amendment would increase resources for treatment and recovery—because the answer is treatment. Our amend-ment includes $300 million for the Sub-stance Abuse Prevention and Treat-ment Block Grant Program. This pro-gram is the premier Federal initiative to boost State and local resources for prevention, treatment, and recovery support. In 21 States this block grant program represents at least 75 percent of the State agency’s substance abuse prevention budget. In some States, sadly, it is the only funding for sub-stance abuse prevention. If we are going to get a handle on this problem, we are going to have to provide some additional resources for the treatment that these programs need. This funding will result in an immediate increase in the number of addicted individuals who

will receive lifesaving treatment. It will also save taxpayer dollars in the future, just as I heard from that young man at Headrest, who said it is cheaper to provide treatment than to build prisons. He is absolutely right. The National Institute on Drug Abuse estimates that for every dollar spent on substance use disorder treat-ment programs there is a $4 to $7 re-duction in the cost of drug-related crime. An outpatient treatment pro-gram can result in savings that exceed costs by a factor of 12 to 1. I live in Stratford County in New Hampshire. It has used the modest funding from this block grant program, the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant Program, to accomplish important things, includ-ing expanding the peer-based addiction recovery efforts and working at schools to engage at-risk students in the mid-dle school years. If we can prevent ad-diction, that is obviously the best thing we can do. Unfortunately, many prevention and treatment efforts in Stratford County remain chronically underfunded. I re-cently learned about one local woman, a mother and waitress, who overdosed in front of her 2-year-old child. Fortu-nately, she received inpatient treat-ment, and now she is doing well. Others have not been so lucky. Like cities and counties all across America, Stratford has a months-long waiting list for those needing treatment. When people with substance use disorders are turned away, they remain on the streets—des-perate, often committing crimes to support their addiction, always at con-stant risk of a lethal overdose. Vice News in New Hampshire re-cently profiled the opioid epidemic. The reporter interviewed one desperate user who said this: 
I tried to get help and stop, but at the treatment center they said I would have to wait 3 months. I had to go to the hospital and tell them I was going to kill myself just to get admitted. 
That should not happen in America. Another critical tool in the effort to stem the tide of this crisis is prescrip-tion drug monitoring programs. These State-run programs collect, monitor, and analyze electronically transmitted prescribing and dispensing data sub-mitted by pharmacies and dispensing practitioners. We know that moni-toring works. We have the data to show that it works, but only half of the 50 States are receiving Federal support. The emergency supplemental amend-ment would include $50 million for the CDC to expand and bolster State drug monitoring programs. Our amendment also allocates $10 million to improve access in high-risk communities to medication-assisted treatment services for heroin and prescription opioids be-cause numerous studies have shown the effectiveness in including medication in the treatment of some individuals with substance use disorders. Medica-tions like methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone have been shown to re-duce opioid use. Our supplemental spending amend-ment would also speed emergency re-sources to law enforcement agencies. This Senator has heard from police in New Hampshire. They can’t solve this problem by putting people in jail. They can help to solve it by putting traf-fickers in jail and by breaking up those networks that are supplying drugs. In recent years, the opioid epidemic has spread to small towns and rural areas in every part of the country. If we went back to that first map of the United States, we could see just how much the spread has been to rural parts of this country. Heroin traf-fickers in New York expressly target New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine— all States with a large rural popu-lation. We don’t have any real urban areas in our States, but we can see the spread of those drugs in northern New England. This amendment will provide $230 million in emergency funding for Ed-ward Byrne Memorial Justice Assist-ance Grants, and $10 million for COPS Anti-Heroin Task Force Grants. The Byrne JAG Grant Program is the Na-tion’s cornerstone crimefighting pro-gram. It has proved its effectiveness in each of our States, which is why it en-joys such strong bipartisan support. But the program has suffered cuts. In New Hampshire, we received $1.7 mil-lion in Byrne funding in 2007. Last year we received less than $1 million—al-most a 50-percent reduction. I had the chance to travel with Sen-ator HOEVEN down to our southern bor-der of Texas last spring because we both are on the Appropriations Sub-committee on Homeland Security. We talked with some of our Customs and Border Patrol employees who were down on the border in Laredo and were interdicting drugs down on our south-ern border. One of the things they talked about is that drugs are coming across our southern border and they are going up the Interstate Highway System. They are going up Interstate 95 to northern New Hampshire. They are going up Interstate 35 through the middle of the country. We have to pro-vide law enforcement with the funds they need to interdict those traf-fickers. We need an infusion of new funding to mobilize so that the pro-grams are more aggressive for stopping opioid traffickers and dealers. Our amendment requires that Byrne JAG funds be used directly to combat the opioid crisis for this emergency funding. That will allow for programs that emphasize treatment over incar-ceration, such as drug courts. In New Hampshire we have seen what a difference it can make to have well- resourced, ambitious law enforcement initiatives. From May to December of last year, the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Task Force, or the HIDTA Task Force, based in Bedford, NH, carried out Operation Trident. They draw on Federal, State, and local law enforcement resources in New Hampshire and Massachusetts. It makes sense because the more we co-operate, the more we can respond. Operation Trident resulted in 240 ar-rests. They took down four major her-oin fentanyl trafficking organizations. They dismantled three processing mills, and they seized more than $1.2 million in assets. What we have to do is continue to recreate these successes all across the country by moving aggres-sively to take down the gangs and other trafficking organizations that are feeding the opioid epidemic. To do that we have to provide the resources. This emergency funding amendment doesn’t create any new programs. In-stead, we fund proven and effective ini-tiatives like Byrne JAG and the sub-stance abuse preventive and treatment block grants. These initiatives have earned bipartisan support because Sen-ators have seen the good work it has done in each of our States. By allo-cating these emergency resources to these proven programs, this amend-ment will provide law enforcement and treatment professionals with the re-sources they need to go on the offen-sive to mobilize a real war on opioid trafficking and addiction. Perhaps most importantly, our emer-gency supplemental funding amend-ment funds the programs that are in-cluded in the CARA bill. I want to thank Senator WHITEHOUSE and other drafters of CARA, who have made im-portant statutory steps and pro-grammatic changes to improve pro-grams that help treat addiction. But CARA, as important as it is, is an authorization bill that doesn’t pro-vide any funding. If we support making the changes in the law that are in-cluded in the CARA bill, then we should also support the funding needed to make these programs work. This chart shows a quote from the National Governors Association. Re-cently, they came together and they endorsed emergency appropriations to address this crisis. They wrote: 
Governors applaud the introduction of leg-islation that would provide emergency as-sistance to states working on the front lines of the opioid crisis. . . . [I]nvestment is need-ed to help states mount an effective response to opioid addiction, from increasing preven-tion and education regarding the dangers of illicit drugs to strengthening state prescrip-tion drug monitoring programs, expanding access to addiction treatment and enhancing support for law enforcement.

This bill will help our State and local law enforcement officers by giving them the nec-essary funding and tools to battle their com-munities’ heroin and opioid problems. This funding will be used for expenses relating to drug treatment and enforcement programs, law enforcement programing, and drug ad-diction prevention and education programs. Something needs to be done and Congress is correct to provide law enforcement with the resources we need to combat this epidemic. On behalf of more than 330,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police, I thank you for your continued leadership and support of law enforcement. I look forward to working with you and your staff to get this bill through Congress to put an end to the heroin and opioid epidemic. If I can be of any addi-tional assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me or my Executive Director Jim Pasco at my Washington office. Sincerely, C

NATIONAL GOVERNOR ’S ASSOCIATION  
STATEMENT  Provide emergency supplemental funding to help states and communities turn the tide on the opioid epidemic. Governors applaud the introduction of legislation that would provide emergency assistance to states working on the front lines of the opioid cri-sis. Congress has provided billions in emer-gency aid to address natural disasters, secu-rity threats and other crises, including more than $5 billion last year to combat Ebola at home and abroad. A similar investment is needed to help states mount an effective re-sponse to opioid addiction, from increasing prevention and education regarding the dan-gers of illicit drugs to strengthening state prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs), expanding access to addiction treatment and enhancing support for law en-forcement. Mrs. SHAHEEN. The question is, Why do we need emergency funding? Some of my colleagues have argued that additional funds are not needed because there was enough money for the opioid crisis in last year’s omnibus. Yes, it is true there is additional fund-ing for these programs in the omnibus. I sit on the Appropriations Committee; I was one of many on that committee who worked very hard to fight for those dollars. But with spending caps in place, these increases are modest at best. The majority of my supplemental amendment appropriates resources to two programs: the substance abuse pre-vention and treatment block grant and the Byrne JAG Program. These pro-grams have been critically underfunded in recent years. For example, the sub-stance abuse prevention and treatment block grant received a small increase in the omnibus. That was good, but the reality is that over the last 10 years, funding for this program has not kept up with health care inflation. So we have a 26-percent decrease in the real value of funding despite the small in-crease we got in the appropriations process. In order to restore the block grant to its purchasing power from 10 years ago—10 years ago, before we had the explosion of the opioid and heroin crisis—just to get back to that level, Congress would need to allocate an ad-ditional $483 million for fiscal year 2017. My amendment provides $300 mil-lion for this program. It is a downpay-ment—only a downpayment—on where we need to be. The Byrne JAG Program has been flat-funded for the last 3 years. Fifteen years ago—again, before the explosion of the heroin and opioid cri-sis—Congress provided more than $1 billion in support to State and local law enforcement through Byrne JAG and block grant funding. By 2015 that number had been reduced to $376 mil-lion. Right now, despite the explosion in this heroin and opioid crisis, we are providing only about one-third of the support we provided 15 years ago. The reality is that criminal justice and prevention and treatment have been chronically underfunded and, as a result, deaths have continued to rise. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator has consumed 27 minutes. Mrs. SHAHEEN. Thank you, Mr. President. I should be finished shortly. We have talked to the Department of Justice and to Health and Human Serv-ices, and they are ready to get this funding out the door immediately be-cause there is no time to wait. Law en-forcement and health care providers on the frontlines need this money, and they need this money now. In the past, Congress has risen to the challenge of epidemics. In 2009, Con-gress appropriated nearly $2 billion in emergency funding to fight swine flu, which claimed the lives of about 12,000 Americans. That emergency appropria-tions bill passed the Senate 86 to 3. Mr. President, 51 Senators who voted for that bill are still serving in this Cham-ber, including 23 Republican Senators and every Member of the Republican leadership. Last year, Congress ap-proved $5.4 billion in funding to combat the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, an outbreak that killed only one Amer-ican. Surely we can come together now, this year, in this session, to fight a raging epidemic here at home. We cannot avert our eyes from 47,000 Americans who are being killed by le-thal overdoses each year. We cannot accept that 9 out of 10 Americans with substance abuse disorders go without treatment. We cannot avoid the fact that law enforcement officers in com-munities across this country are over-whelmed by aggressive drug traffickers and a rising tide of opioid-related crimes. CARA will help fight the heroin and opioid epidemic in the longer term, but I urge my colleagues to also support this emergency supplemental funding amendment because it will provide ur-gent emergency funding to ramp up this fight in the months immediately ahead. This is a nationwide crisis, and it is time we mobilize a nationwide re-sponse that is equal to the challenge. I urge my colleagues, I urge the ma-jority leader to allow a vote on my amendment and to pass this out so we can give our local communities and States the resources they need. I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate re-cess as under the previous order.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES1116 March 1, 2016 
that across the Nation there has been a dramatic increase in the incidence of opioid addiction, which is now at the point of being a full-blown crisis. In my home State of North Carolina, we have seen this devastation first-hand, with 1,358 overdose deaths in 2014 alone fueled by the combination of abuse of opioid-based prescription pain-killers and heroin. To put that figure into context, that is more than the number of North Carolinians who lost their lives in automobile accidents in 2014. For far too long the conventional thinking was that drug addiction de-served the stigma it receives: a choice made by criminals who were intent on destroying the lives of themselves and others. It was a dark and painful em-barrassment for their families. It is long overdue for us to come to grips with reality because we know the truth: Drug addiction doesn’t discrimi-nate based on one’s gender, race, or so-cioeconomic status. Successful CEOs of major companies have succumbed to addiction. Straight-A students and val-edictorians with once bright futures ahead of them have succumbed to ad-diction. PTA moms and dads, who were pillars of their communities, have suc-cumbed to addiction. We know it be-cause we have seen it in our inner cit-ies, our suburbs, and our tight-knit rural areas. Two weeks ago I picked up my home-town newspaper, the Charlotte Ob-server. On the front page was a report that highlighted the rising prescription overdose epidemic. It started off with a terrifying story of a North Carolina mother that encapsulates the kind of crisis we are dealing with. The story began: 
The Charlotte woman didn’t know her daughter was a drug addict until she heard a thud upstairs. Her daughter, a bright Myers Park High graduate, had returned from college for the weekend with a sack of dirty laundry. Her mother was folding clothes in the den when she heard the fall of her daughter’s uncon-scious body. She sprinted upstairs. ‘‘She’s unconscious on the floor, blue, not breathing. No heart-beat,’’ said the mother. 
That is what the mother saw on the floor of her daughter’s bedroom. Fortu-nately, in this case, the young woman survived the painkiller overdose. With the support of a loving family, she has an opportunity to get her life back on track and seize the chance to reach her full potential. But let’s not kid our-selves. This near tragedy could have happened anywhere in America, and any parent could have experienced it. It is important to reflect on how it got to this point, though. In 2012 the CDC completed a report that said that in North Carolina, there were 97 pain-killer prescriptions written per 100 peo-ple. So what does that mean? It doesn’t mean 97 percent of the people in North Carolina are getting painkillers; it means there is a group of people who are getting dozens and dozens, some-times hundreds of prescriptions for opioids. In part, this is a result of a greater awareness of the importance of pain management. And many people do need pain medication, but the wider availability of these life-improving and lifesaving surgeries and treatments has actually contributed to the epidemic. The medical community rightly rec-ognized that managing patient pain was the compassionate thing to do and started holding providers accountable for doing so. However, the risk of the wider availability of these powerful medicines must be urgently and rigor-ously addressed. That is because for Americans from all walks of life, the nightmare of addiction begins with something as unassuming as a routine prescription for a painkiller such as OxyContin or Percocet. Due to the highly addictive nature of these drugs, a patient’s body can become dependent and they experience debilitating with-drawal. Once the prescription runs out, the physical addiction unfortunately influences people to make really bad decisions that can be life-changing— seeking more pills on the black market when their doctor says ‘‘no more’’ or turning to cheaper or even more deadly opioid drugs, such as heroin. Opioid addiction is a slippery slope, and it is a deadly slope. The CDC has concluded that people are 40 times more likely to be addicted to heroin if they are addicted to prescription pain-killers. Our country desperately needs co-ordination from Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials to de-velop comprehensive strategies to com-bat heroin trafficking and to prevent prescription drug diversion. Federal dollars and resources come with so much redtape and so many mandates that State and local experts cannot use funding for different initiatives, and that is what the CARA bill seeks to ad-dress. For example, there simply are not enough treatment slots for moth-ers with children, and there isn’t enough assistance provided to phar-macists and doctors to teach them how to best manage their prescriptions and help the people with the highest risk of addiction. It has been heartening to see Mem-bers of Congress set aside their par-tisan differences in order to take im-mediate action to address the current shortcomings. I am proud to be a co-sponsor of the Comprehensive Addic-tion and Recovery Act, which is the bi-partisan legislation that brings to-gether the experiences and rec-ommendations of drug addiction ex-perts, law enforcement, health care providers, first responders, and the pa-tient community most affected by the opioid epidemic. The legislation expands abuse pre-vention and education initiatives. It provides grants to substance abuse agencies, local governments, and non-profit organizations in North Carolina and the rest of the Nation that are being hit hardest by the heroin and painkiller epidemic. Local first responders will receive help through expanded availability of naloxone, a powerful antidote that is used to prevent overdose deaths. It has had amazing impacts on saving the lives of people, such as the young lady I talked about earlier. The legislation also addresses the strain the addiction crisis places on our criminal justice system by pro-viding more resources to identify and treat incarcerated Americans, helping put them on the path to recovery, which in turn could lower the Nation’s recidivism and crime rates. We can never forget that the solution to so many of America’s problems can be found in our local communities—our schools, our churches, townhalls, and VFW halls. The Federal Government can help support these efforts through smart, commonsense approaches, such as the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA. However, we must be honest in recognizing that suc-cess will be neither quick nor easy. We are confronted with the reality that addiction is a vicious and devastating cycle of abuse and despair, with con-sequences that can result in the de-struction of loving families and the end to once-promising lives. It affects us all, Mr. President. The fight against addiction is one we must wage to-gether, and we cannot afford to lose. Mr. President, I want to thank the Presiding Officer personally for his leadership on this issue. I look forward to seeing the CARA bill come to the Senate and then on to the President’s desk. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from South Dakota. Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I also want to take a few moments today to discuss the devastation drugs are bringing to too many families and com-munities across our Nation and also to congratulate the Presiding Officer for his great work on this issue. The bill before us today is a collaborative effort of his and Senators AYOTTE , TOOMEY , and others who have worked very hard to address what has become an epi-demic across our country. It is particu-larly hitting States hard, it is hitting communities hard and families hard, and it needs to be dealt with. The de-structive effects of illegal drug use have been well documented, and any-thing we say about the problem is like-ly to have been said many times before, but it is still worth saying because we cannot afford to forget what is at stake in this effort. In my home State of South Dakota, methamphetamine use has hit our In-dian reservations very hard over the past few years. Numerous individuals have become trapped in a cycle of meth abuse, their plans and dreams for their futures erased as their world shrinks to nothing more than their next dose. Of course, drug abuse doesn’t just affect the individual using drugs; it ripples out into families and communities. Since meth abuse spiked on our res-ervations, there has been a significant

increase in the number of babies born addicted to meth, and that is about as heartbreaking as it gets, Mr. Presi-dent—a newborn baby screaming in agony as her body suffers withdrawal. The meth epidemic on our reserva-tions has also caused a significant in-crease in the number of meth-related crimes, including sexual assaults, do-mestic violence, child neglect, car acci-dents, and gang violence. The meth epidemic has worsened the housing shortage facing South Dakota tribes because meth has contaminated a number of homes across our reserva-tions. Cleaning up a house that has tested positive for meth costs thou-sands of dollars. Several South Dakota tribes have seen so much devastation from meth abuse that they have declared a State of public emergency to gain access to additional government resources to fight the problem. Today we are considering legislation to address another drug epidemic that has caused similar devastation—the abuse of prescription painkillers and heroin. Since 1999, drug overdose deaths from prescription opioids, such as oxycodone and hydrocodone, have quadrupled. Forty-four Americans die every single day after overdosing on prescription opioid painkillers, and the numbers on heroin abuse are similarly disturbing. Heroin abuse in the United States nearly doubled between 2002 and 2013, while overdose deaths related to heroin nearly quadrupled. Between 2013 and 2014 alone, heroin use in the United States increased nearly 35 percent. Be-hind those numbers are thousands of broken families, suffering children, and devastated communities. Any response to a problem as deep and complex as drug abuse has to ap-proach the problem from a number of different angles. It has to address edu-cation and prevention. It has to target the drug supply by going after those who trade in and produce drugs. And it has to ensure that individuals trying to escape the cycle of addiction have ac-cess to the resources they need to over-come their dependence. The bill before the Senate today, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, targets all these priorities. A substantial part of the bill is focused on funding pro-grams that provide treatment and sup-port for individuals trying to escape painkiller or heroin dependence. The bill also provides grants for education and prevention and for local commu-nities’ anti-drug efforts. An important section of the bill fo-cuses on developing best practices for prescribing pain medication. Right now, prescription painkillers are heav-ily prescribed in the United States. In fact, the United States consumes more opioids than any other country in the world. Our country accounts for almost 100 percent of hydrocodone used glob-ally and 81 percent of oxycodone use. In 2012 doctors prescribed enough pre-scription opioids to give every adult in the United States a month’s supply. Let me repeat that. In 2012 doctors pre-scribed enough prescription opioids to give every adult in the United States a month’s supply. It goes without saying that prescrip-tion painkillers can be a key part of medical treatment, but it is essential that we make sure these potentially addictive drugs are being carefully pre-scribed and that they are only being prescribed when they are really needed. Reviewing and updating prescribing practices will help us prevent attempts to use these drugs inappropriately. One of the most important parts of preventing drug abuse is going after the people who prey upon the vulnera-bilities of their fellow man by engaging in the drug trade. One significant rea-son for the recent spike in heroin abuse is the sharp increase in supply of af-fordable heroin here in the United States over the past several years. This increase has been driven by a major surge in heroin production in Mexico. Between 2013 and 2014 heroin produc-tion in Mexico increased a staggering 62 percent—62 percent, in 1 year. A large part of that production increase has ended up here in the United States. Any successful strategy to combat the heroin epidemic in the United States has to include efforts to check the flow of heroin coming across our borders. The Comprehensive Addiction and Re-covery Act addresses this priority by authorizing grants to State law en-forcement agencies to investigate the illegal trafficking and distribution of heroin and prescription painkillers, and Republicans will continue to look for ways to support Federal, State, and local law enforcement as they seek to stem the flow of drugs into our commu-nities. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act is an important bill. It is supported by Senators of both parties and by a number of law enforcement and drug treatment associations. It takes the kind of comprehensive ap-proach we need to address the abuse of heroin and prescription painkillers, but our efforts are not limited to this bill. Last year we passed the Protecting Our Infants Act to help prevent and treat prescription painkiller abuse in pregnant women and provide care for newborns who suffer as a result of their mothers’ abuse of opioids. We also in-creased funding for efforts to combat painkiller abuse and provided grants to States to help them prevent and treat drug abuse. As chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, I worked with my colleagues last year to provide new resources to the Coast Guard, the lead-ing Federal agency for combating the drug trade on the high seas. The Sen-ate Finance Committee recently held a hearing on the Stopping Medication Abuse and Protecting Seniors Act, which establishes a Medicare Program to prevent painkiller abuse. Too many lives across our country have been wrecked by drug abuse, too many children have lost a mother or a father to addiction, and too many com-munities are bleeding from the vio-lence and brokenness that accompany the drug epidemic in this country. Republicans remain committed to doing everything we can to support those fighting drug abuse, whether they serve in law enforcement agen-cies, emergency rooms or classrooms. We are committed to reaching a day when fewer lives are destroyed by the scourge of drugs. The legislation before us today— which Senators P
ORTMAN , A YOTTE , T
OOMEY , and others have been involved with—is an important step forward in helping to address something that has become a crisis in this country and which is impacting, in a harmful and negative way, way too many families and way too many individuals and ru-ining the hopes and aspirations of too many young people and children across the country. Let’s pass this legislation, let’s get the House to pass a similar piece of leg-islation, and let’s get something on the President’s desk that can be signed into law that will bring the relief that is needed. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, no one appears to be seeking the floor right now, so I will take the oppor-tunity to speak about our CARA legis-lation. Since the Senator from Ohio, who has been my partner in this, is now presiding, this is an opportune time to give some remarks. I think like many States, just from the remarks we heard on the floor al-ready, it is not unusual to have a ter-rible toll at home from opioid abuse and from overdoses. In 2014, 239 Rhode Islanders lost their lives to overdoses. That is more than were killed in auto-mobile accidents, more than were killed in homicides, more than were killed by suicide. Indeed, that is more than all of those categories—auto-mobile accidents, homicides, and sui-cides—combined. In one small community, Burrillville, RI, the beginning of last year was marked by six opioid overdose deaths. Burrillville is a very small town in northern Rhode Island. There are prob-ably 5,000 people who live there. In one quarter, the opening quarter of last year, to lose six people, to have six po-lice calls to the scene, to have six wakes, six funerals in a community that small—that is sadly emblematic of what is going on all around the country. Rhode Island is not alone. The addic-tion overdoses are claiming lives, cre-ating tragedy, and destroying families

across the United States. Our emer-gency rooms in America treat almost 7,000 people every single day for the misuse or abuse of drugs. There are 7,000 people who come through the ER doors needing treatment, which, by the way, runs up costs to our health care system. More than 120 people die every day as a result of an overdose. The lat-est year for which we have figures is the year that Senator T
HUNE just men-tioned, 2014—47,000 dead in 1 year. If you leave this building and walk down to the Mall, you will find the Vietnam war memorial. The Vietnam war memorial has about 58,000 names on it. From the entire Vietnam con-flict, there are 58,000 names on the Vietnam war memorial. From 1 year of opioid overdose, there are 47,000 deaths. I am afraid it probably went up in 2015. We don’t have the figures in yet. Behind this tragedy of death and sor-row lies a terrible failing, which is that, according to the most recent esti-mates, nearly 9 out of 10 people who need drug treatment don’t get it. They just don’t get it. When you think of that death toll, you think of the cost and you think of the sorrow. The idea that we are still letting 9 out of 10 peo-ple who need treatment not even get it, not have access to it, is a terrible fail-ing. The economic cost of all of this is something we always think about here in Congress. Whether it is from health care costs or criminal justice-related costs or loss of productivity at work, that has been estimated at as much as $70 billion per year. One thing we have seen is that the ongoing substance abuse epidemic does not discriminate by race, by ethnicity, by gender, or by age. Overdose rates are up in both men and women, in non- Hispanic Whites and Blacks, and in adults of almost all ages. The dynamic nature of this epidemic demands that we respond in a comprehensive way—a way that brings together the public health, the public safety, the behav-ioral health care, the addiction recov-ery, and other communities. It was out of this recognition, this realization that this pandemic, as some have aptly called it, requires an all- hands-on-deck approach that the Com-prehensive Addiction and Recovery Act was born. Starting in the spring of 2014, Senator P
ORTMAN of Ohio, Senator K
LOBUCHAR of Minnesota, Senator A
YOTTE of New Hampshire, and I hosted a series of bipartisan, bicameral congressional forums addressing var-ious aspects of addiction—from the role of addiction in our criminal justice system, to the special challenges faced by women, by veterans, by young ad-dicts, and the collateral consequences that we impose on people when they are in recovery. We hosted five forums, as the Presiding Officer will well re-call, that brought together experts from these various fields to come here from all around the country. This was a national pilgrimage to Washington to highlight best practices and to share success stories from their States. I have more remarks that I will be pleased to make as the day goes on, but I am here managing the floor, and so I will yield the floor to my colleague and fill in again when there is a gap in the proceedings. I yield the floor, and I will pursue this later. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Montana. GUANTANAMO DETAINEES  
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, yester-day I joined Senators G
ARDNER and M
ORAN on a factfinding mission to Guantanamo Bay. Guantanamo Bay was a humble reminder of the services our military provides overseas to get these terrorists off the battlefield and ensure they don’t end up in Americans’ backyards. President Obama has signed multiple pieces of legislation into law that ex-plicitly prohibit the transfer of enemy combatants from Guantanamo Bay to our shores. Most recently, the 2016 Na-tional Defense Authorization Act signed by the President specifically prohibited funds to be utilized to trans-fer detainees from Guantanamo Bay to the United States. Among those being held are detainees such as Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, who is the principal architect of the September 11, 2001, attacks in New York City, according to the ‘‘9/11 Com-mission Report.’’ Khalid Shaikh Mo-hammed is just part of the 9/11 five who are currently detained in Guantanamo Bay who allegedly masterminded and facilitated the 9/11 terror attacks on our country. In fact, other prisoners in-clude Osama Bin Laden’s bodyguard, who fought U.S. forces in Afghanistan. We need to do the right thing for our country and keep them locked up in Guantanamo and not help President Obama fulfill a campaign promise and bring these terrorists to our commu-nities. I am exceedingly proud of our men and our women serving at Guantanamo Bay. They are impressive, they are pro-fessional, and I am honored to rep-resent their interests in the U.S. Sen-ate. I will continue working tirelessly to prohibit the transfer of these detain-ees to America. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Rhode Island. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I will continue my remarks. We were discussing the forums that the Presiding Officer, Senator A
YOTTE , Senator K
LOBUCHAR , and I organized. Out of that developed a national work-ing group of stakeholders from the pub-lic health community, from behavioral health folks, prevention, treatment, re-covery, and law enforcement. The fo-rums informed us and the working groups supported us as we worked to draft legislation that would promote effective, evidence-based policies and increase collaboration among what are too often siloed areas of activity and expertise. The bill we developed would do a great number of things. They fall into four major categories: First, it would expand prevention and educational efforts—particularly aimed at teens, parents, and other caretakers, and elderly folks, aging populations— to prevent the abuse of opioids and her-oin and to promote treatment and re-covery. Second, it would expand the avail-ability of naloxone to law enforcement agencies and other first responders to help in the reversal of overdoses and save lives. Third, it would expand the resources to identify and treat incarcerated indi-viduals suffering from addiction dis-orders promptly by collaborating with criminal justice stakeholders and by providing evidence-based treatment. Fourth, it would strengthen prescrip-tion drug monitoring programs to help States monitor and track the diversion of prescribed drugs out of the proper and legitimate market and to help at- risk individuals get access to the serv-ices they need. It does a number of other things, but I will not summarize them all now. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act recognizes what we have learned from science and from experi-ence, and it promotes those practices that we know work best to confront the multiple facets of this new epi-demic. It sends the message that we in Congress understand that addiction is a disease, a public health crisis that re-quires more than the enactment of stiffer criminal penalties. We tried that road. We know it was not a suc-cess. The bill we worked on and prepared has been endorsed by over 130 commu-nity and national organizations on the frontlines of this epidemic, including the National Council on Behavioral Health, Community Anti-Drug Coali-tions of America, the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation, the National District Attorneys Association, the National Association of Attorneys General, major county sheriffs, the American Correctional Association, and many others. Here in the Senate, at the last count, we had 38 cosponsors and myself. I am sure that number is climbing. As committed as I am to the prin-ciples in this legislation and to the need to encourage and support these policies, I recognize that this bill alone is not enough. Without adequate re-sources to fund the programs in the Comprehensive Addiction and Recov-ery Act, CARA, they will remain out of reach to too many of the individuals, communities, and first responders who most need them. Without adequate re-sources for prevention, treatment, and recovery, we will continue to spend bil-lions of dollars elsewhere in economic and societal costs that would be avoid-able if we got this right. Without ade-quate resources, too many people who desperately want to turn their lives around will be told to wait another day. Anybody who knows about addic-tion recovery knows what the con-sequences can be of being told to wait another day.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1119 March 1, 2016 
Senator S HAHEEN of New Hampshire has proposed an amendment which pro-vides emergency appropriations to ad-dress this crisis. I am a cosponsor of that amendment because I agree with her that the opioid epidemic is an emergency, a public health emergency, and should be treated as one. Building on the strong commitment Congress made to funding addiction and recov-ery programs in the fiscal year 2016 omnibus, Senator S
HAHEEN ’s bill would appropriate an additional $600 million to the Department of Justice, to SAMHSA, and the CDC, much of it going to programs authorized in CARA, the Comprehensive Reduction Recov-ery Act, or complementary to CARA’s goals. This would not be the first time the Congress has authorized emergency spending in response to a public health emergency. When the swine flu epi-demic hit, and I believe took 11,000 lives, Congress appropriated $2 billion on an emergency basis with broad sup-port on both sides of the aisle. Here, in the latest year for which we have the data, the body count is 47,000 deaths. We lost 11,000 lives to swine flu and 47,000 lives in 1 year to the opioid epi-demic. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me and Senator S
HA-
HEEN and vote, not only to support the Comprehensive Addiction and Recov-ery Act but to also provide added re-sources to make those principles a re-ality in the lives of the people who are counting on us to come to their aid. Addiction is a tough illness and recov-ery from it is a hard but noble path. Men and women who walk that path deserve our support, encouragement, and admiration. I thank my fellow sponsors, Senator P
ORTMAN , Senator K LOBUCHAR , and Senator A
YOTTE , for their partnership over the past 2 years as we prepared this legislation. I thank Chairman G
RASSLEY and my ranking member Senator L
EAHY for their commitment to tackling this epidemic and for bring-ing this bill out of the Judiciary Com-mittee without opposition and now to the floor where we hope we can bring it across the finish line. Let me say that I anticipate we are going to have a disagreement about the funding of this bill. I will fight as hard as I can to make sure this bill is ade-quately funded, but I do not intend, nor do I know anyone who intends, to block the passage of CARA or to inter-fere with it going into law over the question of funding. People will have to check in with their own consciences, check in with the desires of the addiction and recov-ery communities in their home States, and check in with their constituents as to the right way to vote on giving this adequate funding. Finally, let me close by thanking the advocates, providers, police officers, rescue personnel, and of course the families who support and help the peo-ple in recovery through the tough nights and days. They do the hard work of saving lives every single day, and we would do well to honor them by passing this bill and seeing to it that it has adequate funding support. I yield the floor to the Senator from Virginia. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. FLAKE ). The Senator from Virginia. Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have an inquiry. I believe there will be a se-ries of speakers coming to the floor to address the issue of digital security. I don’t know if my colleague, the Sen-ator from Ohio, has a long statement. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Ohio. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask if my colleague would defer to me for just 2 minutes so I may address the CARA bill that Senator W
HITEHOUSE  has been talking about, and then I will yield to the Senator from Virginia. First, I wish to thank Senator W
HITE-
HOUSE for his partnership. As he said, we have been working on this issue for the last few years to ensure that we have a comprehensive approach to this horrible issue of drug addiction and specifically the increasing threat of ad-diction to prescription drugs and her-oin which we see in all of our commu-nities. It is the No. 1 cause of death in my home State of Ohio, and we have been told it is the No. 1 cause of acci-dental death in the country. It is far worse than that. It is tearing apart families and communities, and we need to address it. I will say two things. One, this is not just a bill about principles, this is a bill about policy, and Senator W
HITE-
HOUSE and I are supporting new policies to approach this issue more effectively, as to prevention and education, as to treatment and recovery, as to dealing with the unfortunate situation of too many overdoses of naloxone, as to training, as to getting prescription drug monitoring programs in place, as to helping these addicted babies and mothers who are pregnant and have an addiction. There are very specific pol-icy changes here that direct the in-crease in appropriations which is pro-vided for in the current fiscal year, for the next 7, 8 months. That funding will be there for this legislation. If we were to pass this bill tomorrow and get it enacted into law, that fund-ing would be there not just in principle but in specific ways to spend that money more effectively. I wanted to make that point clear. Second, I do support additional re-sources, as does Senator W
HITEHOUSE . I believe this is such a crisis that it re-quires resources over and above what we even provided in CARA. We have to get CARA done, and I agree with Sen-ator W
HITEHOUSE on that. This is pri-ority No. 1 not just for us but for the 130 groups around the country that are the experts in prevention, education, treatment, and recovery. They have come together and given us their best counsel; that is, that this legislation will actually help to begin to reverse this terrible trend of addiction. I am hopeful we can have a full de-bate on this legislation. I understand Senator SHAHEEN is going to offer an amendment. I have seen the revised version of her amendment, and I be-lieve I will be able to support her amendment. I have just started to look it over, but I like it because it does provide additional funding. The fund-ing is in addition to the funding we know will already be in there for CARA. It would be emergency funding. It is not usual for me to support fund-ing that is not paid for through other offsets, but I believe we are in such a crisis in this country, including my State, that I will be able to support that. However, as Senator W
HITEHOUSE  said, we have to pass the underlying bill. I appreciate my colleague’s com-mitment on that, and I appreciate the commitment of so many other great groups around the country that have supported us and said: Let’s not get off track here. Let’s get this legislation passed. We have companion legislation in the House. It is bipartisan and identical to the legislation Senator W
HITEHOUSE  and I introduced. We worked together with the House on this legislation. This is bipartisan. They have over 88 co-sponsors, Republicans and Democrats. We have very good signals from the White House that shows they are inter-ested in working with us. Therefore, this can actually get done. It is not just about funding for this year. Obviously, this would be a change in the way we spend money. It is an au-thorization to change it next year and the year after that and the year after that. In my experience that is what needs to be done. I was the author of the Drug-Free Communities Act in the House for al-most the past two decades. There has now been $1.3 billion under the auspices of the Drug-Free Communities Act that directs and targets that funding to what we know is effective prevention. Our legislation takes that to the next step with regard to heroin and pre-scription drugs and will help those communities that are particularly im-pacted. I thank my colleague from Rhode Is-land. I also thank my colleague from Virginia for his indulgence. I am sorry to interrupt his colloquy with our col-leagues. I yield my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Virginia. Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first of all, I thank both of my colleagues for their very important work on the issue before the Senate today. I, like them, have a State where both opioid and heroin abuse is taking too many lives and destroying too many families. I look forward to successfully moving forward on this legislation. 
DIGITAL SECURITY

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES1120 March 1, 2016 
House Homeland Security Committee, Texas Republican M
ICHAEL MCCAUL, to set up a Commission of experts to study digital security and issues around encryption. These issues have been somewhat in the news, and we have seen court cases in both Cali-fornia and New York. I say to my colleagues that this is one component the Commission is try-ing to address. We are at the beginning of a debate that is even broader than the current cases being litigated in California and New York, which will encompass the whole world with digital security. If you think the issues we face now are challenging, as our coun-try and the world move more toward the Internet, such as having your re-frigerator respond to your voice, this issue around digital security is only going to grow. I have a background with the tech-nology community and Chairman M
CCAULhas a background with the law enforcement community. Unfortu-nately, over the last few months, we have seen folks from the tech commu-nity, the law enforcement community, and the privacy community talk past each other too often. We have seen this issue addressed without a common set of facts. We have now seen situations arise that have basically pitted law en-forcement against technology. We think the approach we are taking—bi-partisan legislation that was intro-duced on Monday—is the appropriate way to go. I am joined by my partner in the Senate, Senator G
ARDNER . We have Senator C
OLLINS , Senator B ENNET , and my good friend Senator K
ING. Mr. President, regardless of where people fall in this debate, digital secu-rity tools are terribly important. Encryption is essential to protecting our personal information, our financial information, our intellectual capital, and our national security, and this is one issue in which the heads of law en-forcement and the heads of the intel-ligence community as recently as 2 weeks ago—Senator K
INGand Senator C
OLLINS , who are on the Intelligence Committee—have said that encryption is here to stay and is extraordinarily important. We have seen challenges around this technological innovation come very quickly. Think about this: Nearly 2,000 new applications are submitted to the App Store every day. That is how quickly this world is changing. The majority of these new applications that are added to that App Store are actu-ally produced overseas. Two-thirds of these new apps use some level of encryption. I follow this from a policy standpoint but also my personal background in the telecommunication industry for over 20 years. I can say that the net-works we deal with today in terms of the Internet, the cloud, are infinitely more complicated than the distributed top-down network that existed in the 1990s when the Congress most recently addressed some of these issues. The Internet today is no longer top down. The fundamental architecture of the Internet is decentralized and resilient. We have seen on countless occasions in the past that telecom traffic shifts quickly from one area to another, and attempts by any government to chan-nel that traffic in a certain way in fact often results in shifts that make it harder for government, law enforce-ment, and intelligence to stay abreast of the activity. Obviously, Mr. President, many of these issues have been public since Ed-ward Snowden’s disclosure 3 years ago. I think that disclosure did great harm to our country. We have seen more re-cently, in the press, this debate crys-tallize after terrorist events and court activities in both California and New York. What we are doing—these Members in the Senate and Members in the House—in a bipartisan way is saying: Let’s sit down together and work through a common set of facts, a com-mon collaborative approach, so that before more time elapses and positions harden any further, we bring some-thing together now to sort through these complicated issues. We all need to be working, as I said before, from the same set of facts. We need a framework for collaborative conversation. Too often I have heard from law enforcement and tech in re-cent months that we need to get into a room and try to sort these things through. Unfortunately, a static, American-only solution won’t get us solving the problem. I believe it will simply drive the bad guys, the crimi-nals and terrorists—at least the smart ones, anyway—off of American tech-nology, away from American plat-forms, and move more and more crimi-nals and terrorists to foreign-based hardware and software and at the end of the day actually make the safety and security of the United States far more out of reach. I know at the outset some of my col-leagues here questioned whether a commission is the right way, done too often. Congress has used commissions in the past to punt the solution. The model we have taken, working with great assistance from Senator C
OLLINS , is the 9/11 Commission. In the event of a national tragedy, a congressionally mandated Commission came together on a series of policy rec-ommendations, the overwhelming ma-jority of which were implemented by the Congress. That is why the 16-mem-ber Commission, modelled after the 9/11 Commission, has been endorsed by a wide range of stakeholders, from the tech sector, to respected academic and legal experts and distinguished na-tional security figures. As a matter of fact—and this doesn’t happen that often—our Commission proposal has even been endorsed by the editorial boards of both the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post. These validators agree with us: A bipartisan, bicameral Digital Security Commis-sion is a productive path forward. All these issues are not easy. What is great about America is that we are a country of innovators and of problem- solvers. I know that if we stop talking past each other and put the right peo-ple in a room, we can find the right so-lutions that protect us all, and then Congress can act. Mr. President, I know we are going to hear from a number of my colleagues. I would like to now yield the floor to my friend and colleague on this issue, the Senator from Colorado, Mr. GARDNER . The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Colorado. Mr. GARDNER. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleague from Virginia for his work on this and his history in the telecom business and his under-standing of the complicated issues set before us. There are no simple answers. There is no black-and-white way to proceed here. There is no yes or no that we can reach because of the com-plicated set of factors before us when it comes to balancing our security needs and balancing our privacy needs at the same time. In fact, I am reminded of when I was in the State legislature and legislation we worked on several years ago. We were trying to figure out what to do when it came to criminal acts over the Internet. At the time this bill passed, most people were using BlackBerrys. I don’t know if the iPhone had been in-vented yet. They described in the stat-ute that the legislature was working on—it was dealing with the issue of Internet luring of a child, and when they wrote the language, they used technical language. And when pre-sented with a case under the statute trying to charge somebody with Inter-net luring of a child, a judge actually said: Well, since the defendant, the per-petrator, was using a BlackBerry—we don’t define the BlackBerry as a com-puter; therefore, this offense of Inter-net luring of a child won’t apply in this particular case. That was because at the time, the legislature tried to de-scribe in very definite terms a black- and-white answer to technology that had evolved or that everybody thought would be understood that this is a com-puter or this is the Internet. A judge said: No, that is not the case. So we had to address that issue in later years to try to overcome and understand the technology in ways that allow tech-nology to evolve, that allow new tech-nologies to emerge, but also make sure we are passing laws to provide protec-tion to victims of crimes—in this case, an innocent child. So when we are dealing with this issue of privacy and security and encryption, Congress ought to be the first body to admit there is no single person in here who can say: I have every answer. I have every solution. Choose me. Choose my bill. This is the way forward. I applaud my colleague, Senator W
ARNER from Virginia, for the work he

is doing, along with Senator C OLLINS , myself, and Chairman M
CCAUL in the House of Representatives, to try to find that solution to a very nuanced issue. This challenge with encryption that we face today is significant. Encryption, as we know, is a tech-nology designed to prevent unauthor-ized access to data and information. It is a code or series of codes put in place to put a lock on valuable things and trivial things alike, as the case may be when it comes to encryption. No mat-ter how you describe what it is or what it is protecting, there is no doubt that it has been an enabler of global com-merce in an increasingly inter-connected age. It is that blanket that keeps our credit card numbers safe and our bank account numbers safe. It is the underpinning of financial success for businesses such as eBay, Amazon, iTunes, and more. But it can also be used, as we have seen, perhaps to cover bad actors, to cover their actions, cre-ating a safe harbor sometimes for peo-ple who don’t deserve to have a safe harbor. It can be an impenetrable cage around crimes, a powerful tool that is used to thwart law enforcement and lawful investigations, a blockade that is too difficult to penetrate for law en-forcement. So this bill that you have put for-ward, this Digital Commission that will be comprised of experts around the country on issues of privacy, on secu-rity, on encryption, to try to find the right balance between what is it that we need in this country to protect our national security, to find bad actors who are trying to hide bad things with innocent technologies—this is to craft policies in an open manner that we can then turn to and look at to make sure we are protecting privacy, protecting encryption, that we are not offshoring the problem, allowing others to hide by technology made offshore, but that we have a solution here in Congress that takes into account evolving encryption techniques and technologies, respect-ing people’s privacy rights as well. While there is a darker side to some users of innovations we have un-leashed, we have great benefits from the innovations we have created that have enhanced our way of life and our quality of life. So to Senator W
ARNER , my col-leagues in the Senate, and the Chair, I would congratulate the Senator on his good work and the work so many of us have done to try to find this balance of security, privacy, and to make sure we are giving no quarter to people who wish to do this Nation harm. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Virginia. Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, he stat-ed that correctly. This is not an either/ or circumstance. We have to protect Americans’ privacy. We have to make sure we protect Americans’ lives and liberty from criminals and terrorists. We also need to ensure that we con-tinue to promote American innovation. And I believe there is a way through this, and I appreciate his good work as we move forward on this important piece of legislation. Let me ask someone who has seen this process work before, a longtime member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Homeland Security Committee who helped shape this legis-lation, my friend and colleague from Maine. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. Presi-dent. Mr. President, I rise today as a co-sponsor of the Digital Security Com-mission Act, a bill that will establish a national bipartisan commission to ex-amine digital security and privacy and the ‘‘going dark’’ problem that poses a real challenge for those responsible for our national security and for pro-tecting the American public. Let me commend the primary author of this bill, the Senator from Virginia, Mr. WARNER , for his expertise in put-ting together not only a well-balanced commission but also a broad array of cosponsors in support of this important legislation. Senior administration officials—the FBI Director first among them—have been vocal in articulating the problem of terrorists and criminals going dark, with the result that our intelligence agencies and our law enforcement are going blind. Director Comey has testi-fied repeatedly to the fact that there are terrorists who are using encrypted communications to plot attacks against our people, and we know that international criminal cartels are doing so as well. There are many competing and dif-ficult concerns that need to be worked out as we address this complex issue. Under our bill, a national and diverse commission will perform its review and then make recommendations that will protect the privacy rights of law-abid-ing individuals in an era in which ter-rorists and criminals increasingly use encrypted devices. The Digital Secu-rity Commission will have the oppor-tunity to make a valuable contribution to this debate, and that is the oppor-tunity our legislation creates. The laws of the United States, unfor-tunately, have not kept pace with tech-nology, which has obviously rapidly evolved during the past three decades. As a result, the issues of going dark and preserving personal privacy are ones that we simply must grapple with today and for the future. To resolve what often are competing concerns will undoubtedly require a new law. Let me be clear that I personally don’t believe that the absence of a new law in any way exempts a company or an individual from complying with a court order issued by a Federal judge. In the San Bernardino terrorism case, Apple has been ordered by a Federal judge to provide technical assistance to help the FBI access data on a cell phone that was used by one of the ter-rorists involved in killing 14 people and injuring 22 others. Here is an important fact that has been overlooked in many of the reports on this crime. Given that this phone was owned by the county, which has given its permission for the data to be retrieved—and I bet that is a critical point here—and that the court order is narrowly tailored, I believe Apple should reconsider its position as it re-lates to this particular case. In the long run, however, it is clear that we need a new law and a dialogue among the administration, Congress, Federal and State law enforcement, and the tech community in order to deal with this issue. It is appalling to me that there have been no legislative proposals submitted by the White House or any other Fed-eral agency to guide us on this issue. At a time when the administration has been notably absent in the offering of a legislative proposal to address these important and complex issues, the practical solutions that I believe would come from the Digital Security Com-mission would be most welcome by the Congress and would help us and guide us as we draft a new law. To be sure, these are difficult issues to resolve. And I believe that if you surveyed the cosponsors of this bill, you would find all sorts of different views on the cases that are before us. Indeed, the courts have reached dif-ferent opinions. While I do not expect that the Commissioners will see eye to eye on every recommendation, we can have confidence that the final report will reflect the consensus judgment of a supermajority of the Commissioners who are selected in equal numbers by Republicans and Democrats. The final report must be supported by at least three-quarters of the Commission to ensure that no recommendation rep-resents the view of just a few stake-holders. When we had the 9/11 Commis-sion’s recommendations, one reason they were so powerful in enabling us to revamp the intelligence community was their unanimity. Again, let me thank Senator W
ARNER  for his leadership. I look forward to working with him and with my other colleagues, including the Senator from Maine, A
NGUS KING, to make sure that we get this issue right for the chal-lenges we face now and in the decades to come. Thank you, Mr. President. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Virginia. Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank Senator C
OLLINS from Maine for her comments today and for her good work on the Intelligence Committee and for her good work on the Homeland Secu-rity Committee and the fact that she has thought through these issues in a different framework—when our coun-try was attacked—after 9/11. I would simply add that if some in Congress or elsewhere had come through with this kind of collaboration a few years back, we might not now be having two cases—one in New York and one in California—where, at least it appears

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES1122 March 1, 2016 
at first blush, the courts are coming at it from very different directions. Let me reemphasize that in America the only solution here could simply drive criminals and terrorists to for-eign-based technology, hardware, and software. In many ways, to get this right, if we are going to prevent a bal-kanization of the Internet, which is not in America’s interests and not in most countries’ interests, we need to at least think through this from an inter-national perspective. Let us hear now from a former Gov-ernor, like myself, and a great member of the Intelligence Committee. I thank him for joining in this effort. As Sen-ator C
OLLINS said, we have a broad breadth of ideological viewpoints from these eight bipartisan original sponsors here in the Senate, and I think more will be joining us. I would simply add that on a day where a lot of the Nation’s focus is on Super Tuesday and on some of the ac-tivities that are taking place in the Presidential debates, it is great to see such responsible Members from both parties step forward in a bipartisan way to address a very serious issue, both today and in the future, for our country. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Maine. Mr. KING. Mr. President, when I first entered this body in the winter of 2013, I was appointed to the Intelligence Committee. Every Tuesday and Thurs-day, we would meet for several hours talking about very difficult, very com-plex, and sometimes very scary issues. After sitting through those meetings for several months, it suddenly came to me what our mission in that com-mittee is. It really comes down to bal-ancing two provisions of the Constitu-tion. The Preamble to the Constitu-tion, which establishes the basic premise for why we have a government and why the Constitution was estab-lished, uses two important phrases in conjunction with each other. The first is ‘‘to ensure domestic Tranquility’’ and the second is ‘‘to provide for the common defence.’’ There are other ele-ments listed, but that is part of the es-sence of any government: to ensure do-mestic tranquility and provide for the common defense; in other words, to keep us safe. That is what government is all about. But on the other hand, the Bill of Rights, and particularly the Fourth Amendment, makes it clear that there are limitations on government’s power in whatever area. The Fourth Amend-ment says that ‘‘the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects shall not be vio-lated’’ and also: no unreasonable searches and seizures. Those two provi-sions are intentional, and they have been since the founding of the Repub-lic. The role of the Intelligence Com-mittee and this body, it seems to me, is to constantly recalibrate the balance between those two provisions based upon the threats our country faces and the developments of technology. That is really what this discussion is about. It has been brought into sharp focus in the last two weeks by the case involv-ing Apple and San Bernardino, as well as other cases around the country. The Apple case points out the com-plexity and the difficulty of these issues. It is not simple. It is easy to say it was a terrorist’s phone; open it up and get the information. But then we learn that, No. 1, Apple is not being asked to simply throw a switch or plug in a wire. It is being asked to write new software that would compromise its own software protections built into its iPhones all over the world. So it is being asked to create something, not simply open the doors. No. 2, although there has been some discussion about it as ‘‘just this phone,’’ it is not just this phone. Apple is being asked to create a new piece of software that com-promises its operating system in such a way that the phone can be hacked. Once that piece of software is created, there is no telling where it will go. It is referred to in the tech literature as the ‘‘golden key’’ or the ‘‘God key.’’ Sure, Apple could keep it, but it might—who knows, a disgruntled em-ployee could let it out. Apple itself could be hacked. It could fall into the hands of our intelligence community. It could then be made public. Once it is out there, we can’t undo it. What I mean by raising these issues is not that I know what the answers are, but that it is very complicated. And what if Apple creates the key for the San Bernardino phone but it ends up in the hands of China or Russia or Iran or a criminal enterprise, then we have compromised the security of mil-lions of our citizens, and perhaps of our country itself. The real point here is this is an issue of immense significance and public pol-icy importance that should not be de-cided by a single court in California or Iowa or New Jersey or anywhere else based upon a 220-year-old law. This is an issue of policy that should be de-cided here. Indeed, in the district court opinion that was written yesterday in New York, that was released yester-day—I stayed up late last night reading it—the heart of that opinion was: This is a job for Congress. This is a policy question. The judge said the people who wrote the All Writs Act in 1789, the Judiciary Act of 1789, many of them were the same people who wrote the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. He said he could not believe they meant to import to the judiciary the power to make this kind of policy. That was the fundamental promise of the opinion. I commend that opinion to my colleagues. I have been reading ju-dicial opinions for about 50 years. It is one of the best I have ever read in terms of the research and the footnoting. It is a very, very strong ar-gument, and it makes the case I think very straightforwardly that this deci-sion should not stay in the hands of the court. The real issue here is who shall decide this complex and portentous issue. Now, generally, I don’t like commis-sion bills. Typically, they are often the politicians’ way of putting the problem off to someone else in the future and we will deal with it later and we will appoint a blue-ribbon commission. But I have seen them work. The Senator from Maine mentioned the September 11 Commission that I think did excel-lent work and provided the basis for a great deal of good policy. In Maine we had a commission years ago on work-ers’ comp, which was a very difficult issue in our State, but the commission helped us to get a political solution that ultimately helped to solve that problem. I have seen commissions work, and I think this is exactly the right answer in this particular situa-tion, because the issue is so com-plicated and because it involves tech-nology, it involves law, it involves the First Amendment, the Fourth Amend-ment, the Fifth Amendment, and it in-volves national security. These are im-portant considerations, and we have to understand the ramifications of these issues before taking action. Now, we may want to and need to ad-dress the specific issues raised in the current Apple case on an interim basis. We may decide not to do that, but that is an option whereby we don’t nec-essarily have to wait until the commis-sion acts because the commission is talking about larger issues. Yes, it is talking about the encryption issue, or would talk about the encryption issue, but it is also dealing with broader issues of digital security. So we may want to make an interim decision while we wait for the work of the com-mission. I think the important point is that the question before the Senate is, Where should this decision be made? I would join my colleague from Maine by saying that this problem—this so- called going dark—the encryption problem and its constraints upon law enforcement are not new this week. We have been hearing about it in the Intel-ligence Committee and in the Armed Services Committee and generally in the press for 1 year or 2 years, and I be-lieve the law enforcement community or the administration should have come forward with a legislative pro-posal for us to act upon. Of course, I am not absolving myself. We could have brought forth our own proposal. But it was their continuing to raise this issue, and I think it was incum-bent upon them to say: Here is how I think it should be solved. Now, I know if Mr. Comey were here he would say: Well, we hoped we wouldn’t have to bother you about this because we were trying to work this out with the technology companies. I understand that. But I wish, frankly, that we had put forth this bill 1 year ago or 2 years ago, and then we would be in the position of answering this question today instead of starting

down the path of handing this question to a commission that we hope will pro-vide some answers and guidance to us that will help us to make policy. I am delighted to be a cosponsor of this bill. I commend the Senator from Virginia for spearheading this effort. I think it is one that deserves quick at-tention here, and it is something that we can move so we can get to work on trying to understand all the ramifica-tions of this decision. We don’t want to compromise national security, but we also don’t want to compromise per-sonal security. And we don’t want to create something that could redound against national security if it fell into the hands of some of our adversaries. So I am delighted to be able to help with this effort. I look forward to working with the sponsor and the other cosponsors. Hopefully, this is some-thing we can move on with alacrity so that we can bring this issue back to this Congress sooner rather than later. We will never answer the questions fi-nally because by the time we get some answers, there will be new develop-ments in technology and new ques-tions. But we at least need to bring this debate into the 21st century and try to find a solution that will make sense, both in terms of national secu-rity and personal security for the citi-zens of this country. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Virginia as well. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from California. 
FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY  
Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this is a great country. Regardless of what some people say, this is a great country, and the reason it is great is that people work. They get up and they produce for this country. They give their talents. They get paid. They help their fami-lies. Their kids get educated. We have that ethic of doing our job. That is why it is so shocking to me that the Republicans who are in charge of this Senate refuse to do their job. They said that no matter who the President nominates, they are not even going to hold a hearing on that person. They say they want a Presidential election. Well, they had two, and their guys lost. I know it is not a happy ex-perience. Believe me, I have lived through it. I have served with Repub-lican Presidents and Democratic Presi-dents. But the world doesn’t stop be-cause you are not happy with who is President. The Constitution tells us what we have to do. Here is what arti-cle II, section 2, clause 2 says. And I know everyone here swears to uphold this Constitution. I would argue that when my Republican friends state that they are not going to do their job, they are not going to hold even a hearing on whomever the President nominates for the Supreme Court, which is now short one member, they are defying the Con-stitution. Maybe they will be sued by someone—an aggrieved party. The peo-ple of this country are aggrieved by this attitude. Let’s read article II, section 2, clause 2, for anyone who cares about the Con-stitution, and everybody says they do. It says the President ‘‘shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Con-sent of the Senate, shall appoint Am-bassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, [and] Judges of the supreme Court.’’ It doesn’t say the President does it alone; it doesn’t say the Senate does it alone; it says they do it together. That is article II, section 2, clause 2. This Senator advises her colleagues to read it, and if you don’t follow it, you are not doing your job. We want them to do their job. Now, who else says that it is impor-tant? I will tell you—some very incred-ibly respected people. This quote is from Ronald Reagan, one of the heroes of the Republican Party. I served when he was President, and he said: ‘‘Every day that passes with a Supreme Court below full strength impairs the people’s business in that crucially important body.’’ That is Ronald Reagan. Let’s look at Sandra Day O’Connor, the first woman appointed to the Su-preme Court, a Republican who is very beloved. What a wonderful woman. She made history because Ronald Reagan appointed her and we confirmed her. She said, ‘‘I think we need somebody there’’—meaning in the Court—‘‘to do the job now, and let’s get on with it.’’ This is Sandra Day O’Connor. So, my Republican friends, you have two extraordinary Republicans whom you love telling you to do your job. It doesn’t say in article II, section 2, clause 2: But you don’t have to do your job if you don’t like the President. It doesn’t say that. It just lays it out pretty straightforwardly. This is arti-cle II, section 2, clause 2. It doesn’t say: Don’t do this if you don’t like the President. It doesn’t say: Don’t do this in an election year. As a matter of fact, we voted in an election year. Anthony Kennedy was nominated by Ronald Reagan with a Democratic Congress. And we voted in an election year. Do you think we wouldn’t have been happier to wait and see if we were able to get that Presi-dency back as Democrats? No, we did what Ronald Reagan asked us to do. We acted responsibly, and we found An-thony Kennedy to be very qualified. He sits on the Court to this day, having been voted on in an election year. It has happened 14 times in our his-tory. The only time we had a problem was back in the Civil War, when our country was obviously under tremen-dous stress. Today, we are one Nation under God, and we should pull together on this. There are some other things I wanted to read to you. This is what Michael Gerhardt, professor of law at the Uni-versity of North Carolina, said about the Republican plan not to move on this vacancy: Refusing to hold a hearing on a Supreme Court nomination or refusing to take any ac-tion on a nomination before it has been made is simply unprecedented in our history. The refusal is not grounded in the Constitution. It is a willful abdication of authority. The Constitution does not seek to have effect at certain times of the year or the session. 
One never knows when something horrible is going to happen. When this happened to Justice Scalia, this was a shock to his family, to the country. Regardless of whether you agreed with him or not, it was a shock. Nothing in the Constitution says if you are shocked about something that happens, you don’t have to work with the Presi-dent. It doesn’t say that. Don’t make it up, especially because this is the party that keeps saying they want a strict construction of it. If you want to con-strue the Constitution in a strict way, you need to act. There is Jamal Greene, professor of law at Columbia. He says: ‘‘The Senate has a constitutional duty to give due consideration to anyone nominated by the President to fill a Supreme Court vacancy.’’ He goes on: ‘‘In the modern history of the Nation, there is no precedent for the Senate deliberately refusing to vote on a nominee to a vacant Supreme Court seat, whether during an election year or at any other time.’’ We have our differences here; we real-ly do. People say: Senator, is that why you are not running again, because it is so hard to do things? No. I love it here. This is just my time to move on and do other things and have somebody else come in. I love it here. I love my colleagues. I have friends on both sides of the aisle and I get things done and so do they. You would think that we would agree on the meaning of the Con-stitution—it is simple—and that we wouldn’t be arguing about it. I am a little stunned at this failure to step up and do their job. I will tell you this. If you are an average Amer-ican and you have a job and you call your boss and say: ‘‘Hi, Boss. It is Mon-day morning, and I just don’t feel like coming to work.’’ ″Are you sick?’’ ″No.’’ ″Do you have a problem with your family?’’ ″No.’’ ″Well, what should we do?’’ ″Well, I am not in the mood. I want to wait.’’ You would be fired. You would be fired. I am going to be here for the remain-der of this year. I want to do my job. I want to do my due diligence. I want to have a chance to work with my col-leagues on both sides of the aisle here on this issue. Today at the White House, Senator M
CCONNELL and Senator G RASSLEY re-portedly told President Obama that they don’t want to do their job. They don’t want to do it. They don’t care who he sends up. It is unreal. It is un-believable. They want an election. We had an election. President Obama didn’t get elected for 3 years; he got

elected for 4 years. The next President, whatever party, is going to be there for 4 years until the next election. This person has to do their job for 4 years, and we have to do our job. They don’t want to hold a vote, they don’t want to hold a hearing, and many of them say they will not even meet with the nomi-nee. It is our job to be involved in this election. This election of the next Jus-tice is such an important job. The Su-preme Court has a job to do. This in-credible attitude by my Republican colleagues means that the Supreme Court cannot really function the way it is meant to function. It is going to be divided 4 to 4. That is unfair to the peo-ple of this country. Whatever side they are on, this decision needs to be made. As Ronald Reagan said: ‘‘Every day that passes with the Supreme Court below full strength impairs the people’s business in that crucially important body.’’ Here is one of the heroes of the Re-publicans saying that every day that passes with the Supreme Court below full strength, the people’s business is, in fact, impaired. Here is what that states. This isn’t an argument that is happening in a vacuum in some fancy boardroom of some law firm, conservative or liberal. It is a serious argument that impacts the people. Every year the Court con-siders cases with profound con-sequences for our constituents. Again, it doesn’t matter what your position is. We need a fully functioning Court. I want to give an example, and I see my friend from the State of Wash-ington. The Supreme Court is going to hear oral arguments in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, the most impor-tant women’s health case in a genera-tion. The case is about the unprece-dented attacks we are seeing on wom-en’s health in Texas—which is what this case is about—but also across the Nation. This case is about extreme politicians and extreme groups trying to overturn 43 years of settled law. The settled law is very simple. Women have a right to have reproduc-tive health care. It is as simple as that. When a series of clinics throughout the State are shut down and women have to travel hours and hours and hours and maybe even days to get health care, they effectively don’t have it. That is what has been happening in Texas. That is why this case is so im-portant. There is a Texas law, HB2, that was designed to close health clin-ics that provide a full range of repro-ductive health care services, including annual exams, pap smears, STD tests, birth control, and, yes, safe and legal abortions—the full panoply of services for a woman. This law in Texas singles out women’s health providers with bur-densome requirements that have al-ready forced more than half of the clin-ics in Texas to close. I don’t know who gets happy about that, but I don’t get happy about that, and nobody who cares about a woman should get happy about that. It is a total outrage. Women are taking mat-ters into their own hands because they have no access to doctors. The goal of this law—and it is working—is to shut down these clinics and deny to women these rights that they have earned. It would reduce the number of providers in practice from 40 to 10. If you are just unfortunate enough to live in an area where your clinic is shut down, Lord knows what you do. You may be a sin-gle mother, you may be part of a cou-ple where you both work, you may have children, and you may not be able to take days to find health care. The law is forcing women to travel for hours and some even to other States. Women who live in remote or rural areas may have to stay overnight or for multiple days to avoid making more than one trip. Think about the cost to families who may not be able to do it, who are just getting by. Many women simply can’t afford to take off work, drive for hundreds of miles, or get on a plane every time they need health care. They want to do their jobs. They want to be responsible. They step up to the plate every single day, but we can’t do it here because politics is playing a part. People have decided they didn’t like the fact that Barack Obama got elected twice. Well, too bad—he did, and it is your job to act. I am sorry you don’t like the Presi-dent. Maybe you don’t like the fact that he got us out of the worst reces-sion since the Great Depression. Maybe you don’t like the fact that he cut the deficit by two-thirds. Maybe you don’t like the fact that he got us out of two wars. That is your choice, fine, but he has a right to nominate, and we have a responsibility to meet that nominee and to vote up or down on him or her. These cases that are pending before the Court—and I am just highlighting this one, and I know Senator M
URRAY  will go into depth on it—these cases are critical. We need the full bench. I don’t care how you feel about the issue. Maybe you support closing down clin-ics and going from 40 to 10, letting women suffer, taking matters into their own hands. If that is your posi-tion, I am sorry, it is not fair, but you have a right to your position—but the Court has a right to be at full strength. I close with just a quote from a woman who has been hurt already by this Texas law which is going to be heard tomorrow in the Court. Marni. Marni had to fly from Austin, TX, to Seattle when her appointment was cancelled the night before it was scheduled because the clinic was forced to immediately discontinue providing these services after the Texas law took effect. Marni said her first reaction was ‘‘to feel like my rights were being taken away from me, to feel very dis-appointed that elected officials had the ability to make decisions about my and my fiance’s life.’’ That is Marni. The stakes could not be higher. This is just one of the cases. Finally, the highest Court in our land should be fully functioning. The American people deserve nothing less. I am going to put up the Sandra Day O’Connor quote for the last time in this talk. She is a Republican woman, first woman to serve, and appointed by Ronald Reagan. She is looking at this Court. She knows what it is like to serve on the Court. She knows how hard the issues are. She understands how important it is. She is more im-portant to this debate than anyone in the Senate, including yours truly. She knows. She didn’t say: Wait until the next election to see if my party wins, no. She didn’t say that. She said: ‘‘I think we need somebody there now to do the job, and let’s get on with it.’’ I thank the Senator from Washington for her leadership on this issue. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Washington. WHOLE WOMAN ’S HEALTH V . HELLERSTEDT  
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, thank you to the Senator from California for her long advocacy on behalf of women across this country to be able to access the health care they choose. Tomorrow the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the case of Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt. At its core, this is a case about wheth-er extreme rightwing politicians will be allowed to block women from exer-cising their constitutionally protected health care rights, rights that have been affirmed by the Supreme Court for more than four decades. For women across the country, for our daughters, and for our grand-daughters, there is truly a lot at stake. I have been so inspired to see women of all ages from across the country stand-ing up now to share their stories and to make sure the Supreme Court knows why politicians should not be able to make women’s health care decisions. In fact, 113 lawyers submitted an amicus brief to the Supreme Court ex-plaining the difference that constitu-tionally protected reproductive rights have made in their own lives. The sto-ries they tell are incredibly powerful. One partner at a major law firm wrote that after three miscarriages, ‘‘my hus-band and I were delighted when I again became pregnant in December 1999 and safely made it past the ‘danger zone’ of the first trimester, passing an amnio with flying colors. [But] five weeks later, when I was heading into the sixth month of my pregnancy, I re-turned to the doctor for a routine ultrasound and the doctor immediately detected a problem.’’ Her baby had a rare heart defect, so severe that he was already in conges-tive heart failure and would be born only to suffer if he survived at all. After talking with her doctors and her husband, they made the decision to terminate her pregnancy. She wrote: 
As a woman, a mother and a lawyer, I know I did the right thing. I have shared my story with my children, and hope that should my daughter ever find herself in a position similar to mine, she will enjoy the same rights that were available to me.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1125 March 1, 2016 
It should go without saying, but poli-ticians have absolutely no place in such a deeply personal, extraordinarily difficult decision. Unfortunately, the Texas clinic shutdown law being chal-lenged in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt—a law that has been driven by extreme rightwing politicians who want to undermine women’s access to health care—would mean the exact op-posite. This law and laws like the one that was allowed to stand in Louisiana just last week places burdens that health experts, such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gyne-cologists, say are medically unneces-sary on clinics in order to shut them down and make it harder for women to exercise their constitutionally pro-tected reproductive rights. If the Supreme Court fails to block this law, three-quarters of the clinics that provide abortion services, as well as other health care in Texas, would be forced to close, leaving 5.4 million women in Texas with just 10 clinics statewide. Hundreds of thousands of Texas women would have to drive 300 miles round trip just to get care they need. If that is not an undue burden, I don’t know what is. A ruling upholding the Texas shutdown law wouldn’t just impact women in Texas, it would make it easier nationwide for politicians to interfere with women’s health care and block them from exercising their con-stitutional right. That would be the wrong direction for women. It would be the wrong direction for families and for our country as a whole. That is why tomorrow women and men from all over the country will be outside the Supreme Court standing up for women’s health, rights, and oppor-tunity. I will be very proud to be right there with them because we are going to be sending a very clear message. A right means nothing without the abil-ity to exercise that right. I hope the Justices listen, realizing how much this ruling means to wom-en’s lives. Ultimately, I hope they will rule in favor of ensuring women’s health and rights continue to progress, rather than going backward. I know our country will be stronger for it. Mr. President, I express my apprecia-tion to Senator W
HITEHOUSE and all of our colleagues who have worked very hard to bring this bill before us on the floor, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. It lays out key steps toward addressing the crisis of pre-scription drug abuse and heroin addic-tion, which is ruining and costing lives nationwide, including in my home State of Washington. I hear about this epidemic from Washington State families and commu-nities far too often. Parents ask me what we are doing in Congress to help families like theirs who are trying des-perately to help their children who are struggling to escape addiction. I am told about mothers and fathers who de-veloped opioid addictions after being prescribed pain medication, with dev-astating consequences for their fami-lies. When I go to speak with local sheriffs and police chiefs, they say they are most often the ones responding to these crises and that our country needs to do better than allowing those strug-gling with addiction to cycle in and out of the criminal justice system. They tell me that heroin use is only becom-ing more widespread in our commu-nities, especially amongst our young people. Penny LeGate is a former news an-chor from Seattle and she knows this all too well. Her daughter, Marah Wil-liams, had a happy childhood, ballet lessons, softball, a close-knit family, but in middle school, as she began to struggle with ADHD, depression, and anxiety, she also started experimenting with drinking and drugs. For years her parents tried everything they could do. As Penny will tell you, Marah did too. She fought hard to break her addiction and to keep her life moving forward, but tragically, when Marah began using OxyContin and then heroin, the grip of addiction was just too much. Marah died of a heroin overdose in the basement of her family home when she was just 19 years old. This is a parent’s worst nightmare. It is happening to parents across my State, across the country, and it has to stop. I am pleased there is bipartisan mo-mentum toward giving our commu-nities the tools and resources they need to tackle this disease. The Com-prehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, CARA, includes efforts to strengthening education, prevention, and treatment efforts around prescrip-tion drug abuse and heroin use. It will cut down on inappropriate use of pain medication that gets so many people addicted to opioids in the first place and would make it easier for people to safely dispose of pain medication so it doesn’t get in the wrong hands. This legislation will also help police depart-ments get access to naloxone, a drug that counteracts the effect of an over-dose, which is something police chiefs I have spoken to make clear they need— and more. The bill we are debating right now would be a good step in the right direc-tion, but it can be even better. As many of my Democratic colleagues have made clear, a problem as serious and urgent as this epidemic deserves a serious, urgent response. So we should enact the policies in this bill and at the same time we should also make sure families and communities will see addi-tional tools and resources as quickly as possible. That is why I strongly sup-port the emergency investments pro-posed by the senior Senators from New Hampshire, West Virginia, the junior Senator from Massachusetts, and oth-ers. Their proposal will actually help our States and local governments, as well as families who are on the frontlines of this battle, by providing the resources to prevent opioid abuse and expand access to the treatment that so many families are seeking. I am hopeful Republicans will work with us to move this alongside this im-portant bill so families don’t have to wait for Federal resources that this crisis desperately needs. As I have laid out, the legislation we are debating today would go a long way toward tackling the epidemic of pre-scription drug abuse and heroin addic-tion, especially if it includes an emer-gency funding that can offer relief and support quickly, but given the strong belief on both sides of the aisle that far too many people are falling through the cracks in our mental health and substance abuse systems, I believe we can and should do more to build on this CARA legislation in the coming months. We should pass this bill, but then I hope all of our colleagues will not just get up and walk away. We should build on this rare moment of bipartisan agreement, stay at the table, and keep working beyond this bill to strengthen mental health care and substance abuse treatment in our country. So even while we are debating this very first step, I wish to lay out just a few of the goals that should guide us as we look past this, goals I believe that can be met if we work together and take this crisis seriously. First, mental health is every bit as important as physical health, and we should make sure we work together to make sure they are both treated equal-ly in our health care system; secondly, we should do more to break down the barriers that make it difficult to ad-dress patients’ mental and physical health care needs at the same time; third, at a time when half of all U.S. counties lack access to a social worker, a psychologist or a psychiatrist, we need to strengthen our mental health care workforce so patients and families can get care when and where they need it, whether that is at a hospital or in their own community; fourth, we need to recognize that mental health care is important at every stage of life and en-sure our system can address every pa-tient’s needs, whether that patient is a child or an adult; and, finally, continue taking steps to address the opioid abuse epidemic, I believe we can do more to expand access to medication- assisted treatment and offer our States more resources to respond to crisis sit-uations, including by strengthening prescription drug monitoring pro-grams. My colleagues on the Judiciary Com-mittee have worked very hard to im-prove prevention and treatment of opioid addiction, especially among in-dividuals who pass through the crimi-nal justice system. I believe we need to ensure these tools and resources are available to all Americans struggling with addiction and ensure that our health care system is equipped to ad-dress addiction as a disease. I have been proud to work with the junior Senator from Connecticut and other members of the HELP Com-mittee on both sides of the aisle, led by

Chairman A LEXANDER , the senior Sen-ator from Tennessee, on a path toward meeting those goals. I am very hopeful we will be able to reach agreement on some additional steps that would make a difference for the many families and communities who are struggling to support loved ones in need. Mr. President, it goes without saying that in this divided government we don’t agree on much, but there is some important bipartisan agreement on the need to close the gaps in our mental health care system and tackle the cri-sis of opioid addiction. So I hope we can pass the legislation we are debat-ing today, along with improvements that ensure it helps patients and fami-lies as quickly as possible, but we shouldn’t stop there. We should seize this opportunity, work together, and continue making progress for the fami-lies and communities we serve. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Minnesota. Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak in favor of the Comprehensive Addiction and Re-covery Act. Senator W
HITEHOUSE and I have been working on this together for years, along with Senator P
ORTMAN  and Senator A
YOTTE , so this bill has been bipartisan from the beginning. I thank my colleagues, and I also thank Senator G
RASSLEY and Senator L EAHY  for their leadership in bringing this to the floor and all members of our com-mittee, including the Presiding Officer, who have contributed to this bill. Our Nation is facing a serious prob-lem with drug addiction, and I am glad to join my colleagues today to talk about how we can tackle this problem and work toward a solution by passing this bipartisan bill. Just last week I was out in Montevideo, MN, and we gathered together some people from the town. It is a town of a couple thou-sand people. Our goal was to just talk about this problem. I was shocked that early in the morning on a Saturday we had 50 people there. We had every doc-tor in the town there, to my knowl-edge. We had the sheriff there, the po-lice chief there. At one point a regular citizen who was there, who had suffered from some diseases and had been in the hospital, actually emptied out her purse and tons of medications and opioids came rolling out onto the table that she hadn’t used. It was an image I will not forget and an image I bring to the Sen-ate floor to remind us there are too many of these drugs out in our commu-nities. I heard stories of young children who had dealers—people who were trying to get the opioids—actually saying to them: Hey, I will give you a beer if you will go to your parents’ medical cabi-nets and look for these drugs, and they would write them down for them. The kids would then go, get the drugs, and bring them back. There was a story of one doctor who was treating someone, thought he was pretty normal. He had back pain, and the doctor had given him some pain-killers for years. Then, all of a sudden, one day the Secret Service shows up because this man had actually made a threat on the life of the President. He had an entire nightlife that was dif-ferent than his day life, and it was completely dictated by the fact he was addicted to prescription drugs. Four out of five heroin users get their start these days from prescrip-tion drugs. I don’t think anyone would have ever imagined that. When I was growing up, when we saw heroin ad-dicts on the corner or when I was a prosecutor for years, we never had those kinds of statistics. People got hooked on heroin because they got hooked on heroin. They started with heroin and they, sadly, would end with heroin. In this case, we have 80 percent of people becoming addicted because they have a surgery because they have back pain. They then get too much of the drug or no one figures out that get-ting hooked on the drug is worse than the pain they had in the first place, and they get hooked on the drug. We also have stories of overdoses of people who are not even taking the drugs for periods of time. So we have a crisis in this country, and when I met with those people in Montevideo, it hit home to me that it can happen at any time. We didn’t pick this town because they were having a big crisis or be-cause they had a number of deaths. We just happened to be in that area of the State and decided we wanted to focus on the issue. Before I was elected to the Senate, I spent 8 years serving as chief pros-ecutor in Hennepin County, which in-cludes Minneapolis. Drug cases made up about one-third of our caseload, which meant we handled everything from trafficking and selling to produc-tion and manufacturing. From this po-sition, I had an opportunity to see firsthand the devastating impact of drug addiction. Mr. President, I see my colleague from Indiana has arrived. I am man-aging the bill for this hour, and if he wants to speak, I can go back and fin-ish my remarks later. I will just finish up while he is getting back to his desk. I was talking about my time as coun-ty attorney. Many of those people who were affected by addiction that we saw were hooked on opioids, including both heroin and we saw the start of this pre-scription painkiller epidemic. We would be sadly mistaken if we think drug abuse only happens in our cities or the metropolitan areas of our States. As I saw this weekend—when I met with some of our people—Beltrami County, MN, received three emergency calls for heroin overdoses in 1 day. One of those individuals passed away. So this is happening every day. Mr. President, I am going to turn it over now to Senator C
OATS of Indiana. I see he is here to support this bipar-tisan bill, but I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Indiana. Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from Minnesota. I am here to talk about opioid abuse as well, although I am trying to combine two speeches. Since we are now talking about the opioids abuse and drug addic-tion, I am more than happy to listen to the Senator from Minnesota finish her speech. I thank her for the time, but I want to make sure I am not also un-duly holding my colleague back as I flip through my weekly ‘‘Waste of the Week’’ because I can delay that, if nec-essary. Mr. President, I am joining my col-leagues here. I believe all of us are deeply concerned about the drug addic-tion epidemic that is sweeping through our Nation. It is an epidemic for people of all ages, but it is most tragically an epidemic for our young people who feel a sense of immortality when they are young and often fall prey to the ‘‘just try it, it is harmless, don’t worry about the addiction.’’ Obviously, that is not the case. We are talking about highly addictive drugs and heroin that is com-ing into our country, and we are talk-ing about serious consequences of this. In our States, as in every other State, it is a major crisis, and we are trying to do everything we can to ad-dress that. In one county alone, we have had an unprecedented rural HIV outbreak as a result of the sharing of needles to inject opioids. These needles that are providing the kind of drug ad-diction we read about every day. It is clear the legislation before us is a comprehensive approach, and that is needed. As I have said, I think we have to have an all-hands-on-deck effort here, whether it is prevention, whether it is law enforcement to keep the drugs from coming in or whether it is treat-ment. It is all three, and it requires not only those three components but com-munities and community organiza-tions, whether Federal, State, local, or volunteer organizations, such as the various charities that are operating and their volunteers who are stepping up. All of us need to get involved in all aspects of dealing with this. I am pleased to cosponsor the bill Senators PORTMAN and W HITEHOUSE  have worked on, CARA, which has been talked about on the Senate floor. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bipar-tisan legislation. The legislation in-cludes a provision Senator B
LUMENTHAL and I, on a bipartisan basis, have offered, which authorizes individuals who are authorized by the State to write prescriptions for con-trolled substances, such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners, to access State prescription drug moni-toring programs—so-called PDMPs—to reduce drug abuse. I will not go into the details of that program, but it has been very successful in terms of pro-viding the transparency and the infor-mation necessary so we can control prescriptions and the output of drugs

that are perhaps prescribed for legiti-mate purposes but are used for illegit-imate reasons. For all of that, I look forward to our being able to work through this legisla-tion and to successfully pass this legis-lation and move it on through the Con-gress and to the President. 
WASTEFUL SPENDING  
Mr. President, if I could also, ask for the indulgence of my colleague from Minnesota, to talk briefly about my waste of the week. I think this is the 35th or 36th week. I have almost lost track of the number of weeks I have been down here. Every week the Senate has been in session I have been down, with maybe one or two exceptions, talking about the waste of the week. Waste of the weeks are simply issues documented, through a nonpartisan process, of waste, fraud, and abuse that occur through the irresponsible spend-ing and oversight of our bureaucracies here in Washington. Today I am high-lighting two policies that have oc-curred within the State Department and the Federal Aviation Administra-tion. Frankly, I could be talking about every agency in the Federal Govern-ment that has fallen prey to a lack of oversight. We have come to the point where we have identified over these ‘‘Waste of the Week’’ speeches well over $150 billion of documented waste, fraud, and abuse. These are issues that have been raised through inspections and analysis by the Government Accountability Of-fice by the inspectors general of var-ious agencies whose job it is to delve in and find out how the taxpayer money is being spent—is it being spent for the legitimate purpose of providing the service that is needed or is there a problem either in mismanagement or through waste or are criminals and others taking advantage of the pro-gram? I have now documented, as I said, 35 of those cases totaling well over $150 billion. Today we want to look at two agen-cies as examples of this. I can go through every agency, but we will take two today. One is the State Depart-ment. Let me note it is estimated that changing the policies here could save the taxpayers an estimated $295.6 mil-lion. That is not small change. Just ad-dressing these two agencies $295-plus million it will save. Let me go into a little bit of detail. State Department employees located overseas—those serving in embassies or consulates—have access to what is called a purchase card. The concept is OK. The idea is that rather than go through all the paperwork and proc-essing and sending back to the United States, employees can say: Look, we need some office supplies. We didn’t order enough initially. We need to pick up 100 Scotch tape containers or pens or who knows what. A purchase card is given to those employees who are re-sponsible for providing those supplies to make what is called simple trans-actions. To prevent the wasteful use or fraud-ulent use of these purchase cards, Fed-eral law and State Department guide-lines require all transactions meet cer-tain eligibility criteria and be contin-ually monitored. We know from experi-ence that mistakes are made. We know from experience that fraud is com-mitted. One of those key eligibility cri-teria is that all of the purchase re-ceipts have to be retained for a min-imum of 3 years. That is so inspectors general can go back and look at what the purchase is, look at the receipt, make sure everything is up to speed and done within the law. However, a recent report by the State Department inspector general has revealed that overseas employees have been told they do not have to send any purchase documentation to their supervisors in Washington for further review. All they need to do is keep the receipts of the purchases for a 3-year period of time so that if those assess-ments are evaluated, when someone comes back and says ‘‘We heard there is a problem here,’’ they will have the receipts to verify whether the pur-chases were legitimate or not. That is the ‘‘trust but verify’’ that I think is important for dealing with these kind of situations. When the State Department inspec-tor general tried to access the docu-mentation for purchase card trans-actions as required by the law and by State Department regulation, he found that many of the overseas offices didn’t keep their transaction records. As an example, in fiscal year 2014, the inspec-tor general found that more than half of overseas offices either didn’t per-form reviews of purchase card trans-actions as they are required to do or didn’t even respond to the inspector general’s request to produce the docu-mentation. The report determined that during 2013 and 2014, there were $53.6 million in unaccounted purchases. That is unacceptable. If you take a job, you are told: Here is your card. If you need to buy some-thing locally and don’t want to go through all the rigmarole of pur-chasing and sending documentation overseas and so forth, you can use this purchase card. But you have to keep the documents if you do this because you are going to be reviewed. Someone is going to come over here and say: Prove it. Yet the State Department has basi-cally said: Don’t worry about it. You don’t have to keep those—probably thinking that they will never come over and follow up on this. So that $53.6 million in unaccounted-for purchases at this rate, over a 10-year period of time, amounts to about $263 million in unknown and unverified purchases just within the State Department’s over-seas offices. Who knows what is going on here? Secondly, I want to talk about the Federal Aviation Administration be-cause they have a similar situation that was inspected by their inspector general. He found that many employees do not comply with the guidelines, and the employees are not consistently held responsible for safeguarding their assigned equipment and supplies, such as digital cameras, laptops, and any other number items. As a result, the Federal Aviation Administration IG, the Inspector General, found that there are nearly 15,000 pieces of equipment and material that employees may not be able to locate. The combined value of that missing property is over $32.5 million. To make matters worse, the IG re-port states that the FAA division that essentially lost $32.5 million worth of equipment doesn’t even have the au-thority to hold employees accountable. Not a bad job, right? It is as if they are saying don’t worry: If you mess up, if you do something illegal, fraudulent, or you are just sloppy you’re not re-sponsible, if you don’t know where the equipment is, if you don’t keep track of it, you will not have to be accountable for that lost equipment. No American business could function this way and stay solvent. But walk back an employee there and say: ‘‘What happened to the new laptop that we gave you 6 months ago?’’ They would say: ‘‘I don’t know. I don’t know where it is. I need another one.’’ ‘‘That’s fine. Don’t worry. This hap-pens all the time. We will give you a new one.’’ On and on it goes. That division of the FAA essentially has lost $32.5 mil-lion worth of equipment, and, again, it doesn’t even hold its employees ac-countable. We have racked up nearly $19 trillion of debt in this country. No one can ex-plain how large an amount of money that is. What we do know is that we are continuing to plunge into debt, and we are going to keep doing that. One of the ways we can be more accountable here is what I have just described. I know my time is running out. With that, I am going to add this week to our accumulating waste $295.6 million for these unknown, unverified pur-chases, bringing our total now to $157.5 billion. It is time to put a stop to this. It is time to enforce these rules and regulations. It is time to be sensitive to the fact that we are wasting hard- earned taxpayers’ dollars. With that, keeping on schedule, I thank my colleague from Minnesota for the time which she has yielded, and I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. A

ORTMAN , and the Presiding Officer for their leadership. We have worked to-gether on a bipartisanship basis on this bill from the beginning. Our Nation, as we know, is facing a serious problem with drug addiction, and I am glad to join my colleagues to talk about how we can handle this problem and how we can do something about it. Earlier in my speech today I referred to a group that I met with in Monte-video, MN, with only a few days’ no-tice. All the doctors in the town showed up. The sheriff, the police chief, and regular constituents poured a bunch of medications on the table to show how much we are seeing in terms of overprescription and how this can so easily get in the wrong hands or turn people into addicts. I came to this issue first as a pros-ecutor. I spent 8 years serving as the chief prosecutor in Hennepin County, which includes Minneapolis. Drug cases made up about one-third of our case-load, which meant we handled every-thing from trafficking and selling to production and manufacturing. From this position, I had an opportunity to see firsthand the devastating impacts of drug addiction. Many of those af-fected were hooked on opiates, includ-ing both heroin and prescription pain medication. But even when I left that office in 1998, I didn’t see anything near what we are seeing today. We were starting to see the beginnings of the addiction on prescription drugs, but nothing like we are seeing today. In fact, four out of five heroin users are getting their start by misusing pre-scription drugs. We would be sadly mistaken if we thought this was only an urban prob-lem. We know it is a huge problem in our rural areas. In Beltrami County, MN, just this past weekend there were three emergency calls for overdoses. One of those people passed away. That is a rural county in our State on one weekend. Many of those who have been affected by this epidemic are young people. Over just 6 months in 2013, three people died of opiate overdoses and another three were hospitalized for overdosing on heroin in one 7,000-person town in Minnesota. These statistics and stories are troubling, and they show why we must focus on both treatment and pre-vention. Minnesota is home to Hazelden Betty Ford Addiction Treatment Center. We are proud of the work and the leader-ship our State shows when it comes to treatment—one of the reasons I got in-volved in this issue. Hazelden Betty Ford has had impressive success with its comprehensive opiate response pro-gram. Their program offers the best of both worlds: lifesaving medicine to help treat the medical causes of addic-tion, as well as counseling to help peo-ple get on the right path. However, too many people have been unable to get the treatment they need. Almost 10 percent of Americans are es-timated to need treatment for issues related to drug and alcohol, but only about 1 percent receives treatment at a specialty facility. That is why my col-leagues and I have come together to in-troduce this bill. Our bill covers strategies for preven-tion, evidence-based programs such as strengthening prescription drug moni-toring programs—something I worked on with the Presiding Officer. These types of programs help States track data on controlled substances like opioids so that when they are dis-pensed, they can be a strong, effective tool in making sure that they are used for the right reasons. This last week I was near the South Dakota border. There were doctors who knew patients were also going into South Dakota to get prescriptions. It was very difficult for them to trace what was going on—which pharmacy they would go to in rural areas. They could drive an hour and go to a dif-ferent pharmacy, drive another hour and go to a different pharmacy—maybe see a different doctor in South Dakota and maybe check into an emergency room somewhere else. That is going on today in our country. Another important provision in our bill will help make drugs less acces-sible by providing consumers with safe and responsible ways to dispose of un-used prescription drugs. According to the DEA, more than 2,700 tons of ex-pired, unwanted prescription medica-tions have been collected through these programs since the drug take-back law that we passed in 2010 was put into place. That is a bill I worked on with Senator C
ORNYN , who is also on the Ju-diciary Committee with me. It is called the Secure and Responsible Drug Dis-posal Act. It took a long time for the DEA to get their act together to get the rules up. The rules came up, and guess what. Literally, a few months later, Walgreens has now said they will offer kiosks and places for people to re-turn drugs on a nationwide basis. Right now, we have law enforcement doing it. Minnesota is at the front of the curve. We have some of our libraries taking these drugs into secure facilities. But the best would be that the places where people got the drugs would also be tak-ing back the drugs. So we are glad that bill has finally helped in that way. We believe this bill before us today will help even more. We also have in this bill increasing the availability of naloxone, which is used to save lives in emergency overdose situations and a number of things that are going to be helpful going forward. This bill is a framework, but it is an important step forward that the Federal Government is finally saying to the Congress and the Senate that we need to take steps here. Our bill has the support of a broad range of stakeholders, including the National District Attorneys Associa-tion, the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors, Faces and Voices of Recovery, and the Major County Sheriffs’ Association. Finally, we must also recognize that combating this kind of drug abuse will require a serious investment of re-sources. It is for that reason that I have cosponsored Senator SHAHEEN ’s amendment to appropriate emergency funding to address the heroin and opioid drug abuse epidemic. I am hope-ful that the Senate will come together to curb the problem of prescription drug abuse and save lives across our Nation. I am hopeful we will pass the amendment as well as our bill. I think there will be a number of other good amendments that are considered, in-cluding medical education and other things that need to be done here. I see this bill as the beginning and not an end. I think more work is going to have to be done with funding. I think more work is going to have to be done with the prescription drug moni-toring. We have a start here. But when people and addicts are crossing State lines, when we have a very difficult sit-uation with trying to regulate where the drugs are and how many are going out—I figure that if a Target in my State can find a pair of shoes in Hawaii with a SKU number, we should be able to figure out if people are getting too many prescription drugs. We should be able to educate our doctors so they are not giving them out in quantities that are too big. These are some of the things I am going to continue working on. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY  
Mr. HATCH. Madam President, each of us has taken an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. President George Washington called the Constitution the guide that he would never abandon. The Constitu-tion declares itself to be the supreme law of the land, and more than 90 per-cent of Americans say it is very impor-tant to them. Unfortunately, basic knowledge about the Constitution is dangerously inadequate. I say this is dangerous because, as James Madison put it, only a well-instructed people can be permanently a free people. The current debate over when to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by Justice Antonin Scalia’s death only magnifies my concern. Ignorance of not only how the Constitution applies to this question but even what the Con-stitution says apparently extends far and wide. Here is the text of the Constitution regarding the appointment of judges

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1129 March 1, 2016 
and other public officials: The Presi-dent ‘‘shall have Power . . . [to] nomi-nate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law.’’ I could hardly read that on the chart from this side here. I should have done it by memory. The President ‘‘shall have Power . . . [to] nominate, and by and with the Ad-vice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law.’’ This is what the Constitution actu-ally says, right here for everyone to read. The Constitution gives power to nominate to the President and gives the power of advice and consent to the Senate. It says nothing about how the President and the Senate should exer-cise their separate powers. In fact, the judicial confirmation process has been conducted in different ways, at dif-ferent times, and under different cir-cumstances. Our job is to determine how, under current circumstances, best to exercise our power of advice and consent. Sev-eral factors convince me that the best way to do so is to defer the confirma-tion process for filling this vacancy until the next President takes office. First, this is only the third Supreme Court vacancy in nearly a century to occur after the American people had al-ready started voting for the next Presi-dent. In the previous two instances, 1956 and 1968, the Senate did not con-firm a nominee until the year after the Presidential election. Second, the only time the Senate has ever confirmed a nominee to fill a Su-preme Court vacancy created after Presidential election voting had begun was 1916. That vacancy arose only be-cause Justice Charles Evans Hughes re-signed to run against President Wood-row Wilson, a completely different sit-uation than we have before us today. Third, the judicial confirmation process has become increasingly com-bative, especially for the Supreme Court. Attempting to conduct this process in the middle of an already di-visive Presidential election campaign would be especially difficult. Fourth, President Obama’s judicial appointees and Justice Scalia represent two radically different kinds of judge. This offers the American people a unique opportunity to express, through the election, their view of the direction the judiciary should take by electing the President who will make judicial appointments in the next 4 years. In June 1992, then-Judiciary Com-mittee Chairman J
OSEPH BIDEN, a friend of mine, made the very rec-ommendation that we are following today based on some of the very same factors that I just mentioned. In par-ticular, he noted that the appointment process would take place in divided Government during a Presidential elec-tion process that was already under way. He could have been describing 2016 instead of 1992. The Constitution does not mandate a particular process to address this Su-preme Court vacancy. We have to look all the way back to the 19th century to find a year in which the Senate con-firmed a Supreme Court nominee of the other party in a Presidential election year. That, of course, was long before the courts became as powerful and the confirmation process as confrontational as they are today. Democrats can read the Constitution and understand the historical and po-litical facts as well as anyone else. Why then are they making such bizarre claims? Last week, for example, the minority whip said that the Constitution re-quires ‘‘a fair hearing and a timely vote.’’ He claimed that this conclusion comes from the plain text of the Con-stitution. Well, I have the plain text up here, and it clearly says nothing what-soever about hearings or votes. As I said, the Constitution gives the power to nominate to the President and the power of advise and consent to the Sen-ate and leaves to each the judgment about how to exercise their respective powers. Last week the Senator from Cali-fornia, Mrs. BOXER , said that deferring the confirmation process would be an abomination. She said that the Con-stitution’s standard for the Senate’s advice and consent role does not change with the party of the President making nominations. Yet she voted 25 times to filibuster Republican judicial nominees, including to the Supreme Court. She voted not simply to defer the confirmation process, as we are doing today, but to prevent a confirma-tion vote from ever taking place. If the confirmation process should not change with the President’s party, then she should have no problem with the decision we have made since it is less drastic than the blockade she pro-moted just a few years ago. Also last week, an email solicitation signed by one of my Democratic col-leagues asking for petition signatures claimed that the Senate has a ‘‘funda-mental duty to confirm nominees to the Supreme Court.’’ I would like to think this is simply an egregious typo-graphical error because it goes beyond even the false claim that the Constitu-tion requires hearings and a vote. If the Senate has no choice but to con-firm a President’s nominees, what is the point of giving the Senate a role in the process at all? I will say it again in the hope of clearing up what should not have been confused in the first place: The Con-stitution gives to the President the power to nominate and to the Senate the power of advice and consent. These are separate and independent powers, and the Constitution does not mandate any particular way for the President and the Senate to fulfill their respon-sibilities. Because this fact is evident on the face of the Constitution, I cannot un-derstand my colleagues who say that the President has a 4-year term. That observation has nothing at all to do with anything before the Senate. The Senate is not doing a single thing and cannot do a single thing to interfere with the President’s power to nomi-nate. He can exercise that power in any way he chooses, including sending nominees to the Senate up to his very last day in office. He can do that. No-body that I know of disputes that. My dispute would be as to whether it is wise to do it right up to the very last day in office, but nobody really dis-putes that he can exercise that power in any way he chooses, including send-ing nominees to the Senate up to his very last day in office. What the Presi-dent cannot do is dictate to the Senate how we exercise our separate power of advice and consent regarding those nominees. Liberal allies of Senate Democrats are similarly confused. I received a let-ter signed by liberal groups, for exam-ple, claiming that the Constitution re-quires ‘‘timely hearings and votes.’’ It almost sounds like Democratic Sen-ators and leftwing groups are sharing talking points—almost. Let’s look once more at the language of article II. I will refer to the chart. Tell me, where is the language about hearings and votes? I understand that Senate Democrats and their leftist al-lies want a timely hearing and con-firmation vote this year to replace Jus-tice Scalia, but wanting a particular confirmation process and saying the Constitution requires that process are two very different things. Some of the groups signing that let-ter—in particular, I noticed the Lead-ership Conference, the Alliance for Jus-tice, and People for the American Way—actively urged Senators to fili-buster the Supreme Court nomination of Samuel Alito. In 2006 they opposed the very confirmation vote that today, just 10 years later, they say the Con-stitution requires. Democrats and their liberal allies must be reading the same made-up, shape-shifting Constitution that their favorite activist judges use because the real Constitution says no such thing. Democrats’ arguments contradict not only the plain words of the Constitu-tion but also their own words and ac-tions in considering nominees of a Re-publican President. As to hearings, then-Chairman P
AT L
EAHY denied a hearing to nearly 60 ju-dicial nominees in less than 4 years while George W. Bush was President. As to confirmation votes, the minor-ity leader said in May 2005 that claim-ing the Constitution requires a con-firmation vote would be, in his words, rewriting the Constitution and rein-venting reality. That was by the cur-rent minority leader. Here is what he said then:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES1130 March 1, 2016 
The duties of the United States Senate are set forth in the Constitution of the United States. Nowhere in that document does it say that the Senate has a duty to give Presi-dential nominees a vote. It says that ap-pointments shall be made with the advice and consent of the Senate. That’s very dif-ferent than saying that every nominee re-ceives a vote. 
That was the minority leader, who was then the majority leader. Well, think about that. 
The duties of the United States Senate are set forth in the Constitution of the United States. Nowhere in that document does it say that the Senate has a duty to give Presi-dential nominees a vote. It says that ap-pointments shall be made with the advice and consent of the Senate. That’s very dif-ferent than saying that every nominee re-ceives a vote. 
I mentioned one Democratic Senator who voted 25 times to prevent con-firmation votes on judicial nominees, as did the minority leader, minority whip, Senator L
EAHY , and Senator S
CHUMER as well. In fact, Vice Presi-dent B
IDEN himself, when he served in this body, voted 29 times to filibuster Republican judicial nominees. While President Obama today says that the Constitution requires us to vote on a Supreme Court nominee, as a Senator, he, too, voted to prevent any confirma-tion vote for Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito. In other words, these Senate Democrats voted over and over to deny the very confirmation vote that today they say the Constitution itself requires. They cannot have it both ways. Do we have multiple Con-stitutions, one to use for a President of your own party and another for the President of another party? Democrats today have no credibility whatsoever to dictate how the confirmation proc-ess should work for filling this Su-preme Court vacancy. The Constitution leaves to the Presi-dent how to exercise his power to nominate and to the Senate how to ex-ercise its power of advice and consent. Recent claims to the contrary are in-consistent with the plain text of the Constitution and with past words and actions of the very Senators and grass-roots activists making those claims today. The question is when, not whether, to fill the vacancy left by the untimely death of Justice Scalia. The best an-swer is to defer the confirmation proc-ess until after the next President takes office. Far from ignoring or shirking our responsibility, that conclusion tackles our responsibility head-on for the good of the judiciary, the Senate, and the country. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

HONORING DEPUTY DEREK GEER  
Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to honor the life and work of Mesa County Sheriff’s Deputy Derek Geer. On Monday, February 8, Deputy Geer was dispatched to a call about an armed individual in a local neighbor-hood. As members of our law enforce-ment do every day, Deputy Geer, with courage and care, responded to that call and through the senseless act of another, this son, husband, father, and friend, lost his life. Deputy Geer served with the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office for nearly 15 years. As a veteran of the Navy, his service to others began long before his role as a law enforcement officer. Serv-ice and duty to his country and his community exemplified Deputy Geer’s selfless concern for others. As a member of the Sheriff’s Depart-ment, Deputy Geer served as a victim’s advocate, providing support to those enduring some of life’s worst difficul-ties. In every role he held, he always found ways to give even more. This loss has been felt deeply across Colorado’s Western Slope, the commu-nities of the Western Slope, and our State, as we remember a man who ex-emplified the best of the western spir-it—courage and selfless leadership. The Grand Junction community has come together to support the Geer fam-ily and our men and women who nobly protect us each and every day. Mem-bers of law enforcement from around the State and around our Nation came to honor the life of Deputy Geer, filling the streets to pay their last respects. Integrity, service, and community, the values of the Mesa County Sheriff’s Department—values carried out since the inception of the organization in 1883—were embodied in the work of Deputy Geer. The thin blue line represents the men and women in law enforcement pro-tecting the public from those who seek to harm and cause destruction. Our of-ficers do not waiver at the dangerous calls and unknown situations. They face them in this line of duty, and they do so out of a love and loyalty for their neighbors and community. I am grateful for the work of those at St. Mary’s Medical Center who cared for Deputy Geer, as his last act was perhaps the most selfless of all—to give his organs to others in need. As Mesa County deputies shrouded their badges, we too shared in mourn-ing the loss of Deputy Geer, and we will continue to honor his life and leg-acy. My deepest sympathies and prayers go to Derek Geer’s family, his two chil-dren and his wife Kate. Madam President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Florida. Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I, too, would like to extend my condo-lences to the family in Colorado and to the Senators from Colorado for their loss. RETURN FROM SPACE OF COMMANDER SCOTT  
KELLY  
Madam President, I wish to call to the attention of the Senate that to-night, around midnight, we are expect-ing the return from space of Com-mander Scott Kelly, who has been in space for almost a year. He has been on the International Space Station for 340 days. It is an experiment regarding not only all of the things he has done in doing experiments—all kinds of phys-ical things—but we are specifically doing a test to compare the effects of zero gravity on the human body for an extended period of time and, of all things, comparing him to his twin brother, an astronaut commander who was in command of the next-to-the-last space shuttle mission in 2011. In that case, it was Commander, now Navy, Retired, Captain Mark Kelly. So we will have an identical twin so NASA can then see the effects of the physical, emotional, and psychological effects, because as we prepare to go all the way to Mars in the decade of the 2030s, there is going to be a lot we are going to have to learn in long-duration space flight, and long duration in zero grav-ity is going to be one of the things we have to be able to adapt to. This Senator was only in space for 6 days. The human body readapts when you get back to Earth fairly quickly. For the long duration, and in this case a year, there is going to be a signifi-cant readaptation, as we have seen by some of our Americans who have been up for months and months but nobody as long as a year. In the old Soviet program, they put up cosmonauts for a year, and there are changes that occur, but in those in-tervening years we have become so much more aggressive in how we keep in a physical exercise activity on board the space station, which is what it would be on a Mars mission as well, trying to replicate through stress ma-chines the fact that we don’t have gravity, but replicating that, and try-ing to keep up the bone density and the muscle tone. We have to work at it, and the astronauts on board the space station do that. Scott Kelly has been up there for a year, and we will compare that with his identical twin brother Mark Kelly, who has flown several times in the space shuttle. I will report to the Senate tomorrow, since he is supposed to return in early morning to Kazakhstan. That is some-where just before midnight here on eastern time, and I wanted to alert the Senate to this because we are right on the cusp of doing a whole number of things as we prepare to go to Mars. This is certainly one of the significant events, and we will see how Scott Kelly is doing. In the meantime, we say Godspeed on his fiery reentry into the Earth’s at-mosphere. Our hopes and our prayers go with him as he and his crewmates return. I will be able to report to the Senate tomorrow. Madam President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. G ARDNER ). The Senator from Rhode Is-land.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1131 March 1, 2016 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here to deliver my climate re-marks, but I wish to thank the Senator from Florida for his description of what is happening up in space and what our fellow Americans have achieved. One of the unforgettable moments of my time in the Senate has been to hear Senator N
ELSON ’s description of the events that led up to his space flight, the experience of his space flight, and, frankly, the spiritual nature of the events and the effects on his life. It has been impressive, and I am honored to serve with Senator N
ELSON . 
CLIMATE CHANGE  
Mr. President, as the Presiding Offi-cer knows, this is my 129th ‘‘Time to Wake Up’’ speech to my colleagues about the serious threat of carbon pol-lution and our responsibility as Sen-ators to heed that threat and to take steps to soften the blow of climate change. With each passing week, the evidence of climate change continues to mount and public understanding of the stakes of the climate crisis con-tinues to grow. Worldwide, 2015 was the hottest year since we began keeping records back in 1880, according to both NOAA and NASA. The last 5 years have been the warmest 5-year period on record since the World Meteorological Association. We know the amount of carbon in the Earth’s atmosphere has risen to its highest level in at least 800,000 years— probably several millions of years but at least 800,000 years. Global sea levels are rising along our shores at their fastest rate in nearly 3,000 years. The current rate of change in ocean acidity is already faster than at any time in the past 50 million years. Our oceans are acidifying more rapidly than they have at any time in 50 million years. We measure that from the geologic record. The American people get it. They un-derstand that climate change is real. More than three out of every four Americans believe that climate change is occurring and that doing nothing to reduce future warming will cause a very or somewhat serious problem for the United States—three out of four. Even the majority of Republicans now acknowledge global warming, with 59 percent saying the climate is changing. When asked, do you think that the world’s climate is undergoing a change that is causing more extreme weather patterns and the rise of sea levels, 70 percent said yes. The American people have an ex-traordinarily diverse and qualified array of expertise supporting those convictions: virtually every major sci-entific society and agency, our Amer-ican military and national security and intelligence officials, leading American companies, doctors, and faith leaders. So the truth is winning out, right? The polluters’ campaign of deception and misinformation has been thwarted, right? Well, wrong. They are still at it. A network of fossil fuel-backed front organizations with innocent sounding names still propagates counterfeit science in an attempt to cast doubt on the actual American scientific con-sensus. This network of polluter-paid deceit and denial has been well docu-mented by Dr. Robert Brulle at Drexel University, Dr. Justin Farrell at Yale University, Dr. Riley Dunlap at Okla-homa State University, and others. Dr. Brulle’s follow-the-money analysis, for instance, diagrams the complex flow of cash to these front groups—a flow that the polluters persistently try to ob-scure. Dr. Farrell’s quantitative anal-ysis of words written by climate denial organizations revealed a complex cli-mate denial apparatus that is ‘‘overtly producing and promoting skepticism and doubt about scientific consensus on climate change.’’ ‘‘Doubt is their product’’ is the famous phrase. Dr. Constantine Boussalis at Trinity College and Dr. Travis Coan at the Uni-versity of Exeter released a new study in December examining more than 16,000 documents from 19 conservative think tanks over the period 1998 to 2013 and found ‘‘little support for the claim that the era of science denial is over— instead, discussion of climate science has generally increased over the sam-ple period.’’ Their study demonstrates that in spite of the broken global heat records over the last decade, rising sea levels, and accelerated melting of polar ice sheets, these conservative think tanks have, in recent years, actually in-creased their polluter-paid attacks on science. The study explains these think tanks ‘‘provide a multitude of services to the cause of climate change skepticism.’’ These include: offering material sup-port and lending credibility to contrarian scientists sponsoring pseu-doscientific climate change con-ferences, directly communicating contrarian viewpoints to politicians— which is how we get infected here—and disseminating skeptic viewpoints out through the media. It follows a playbook of fraudulent deception that we have seen before from industrial powers fighting to ob-scure the harms their products cause, tobacco being a fine example. In 2002, the conservative strategist Frank Luntz summed up the scheme in a memo to the Republican Party, since leaked, titled ‘‘Straight Talk.’’ Here is what Mr. Luntz said: 
Should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled, their views about global warming will change accord-ingly. Therefore, you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a pri-mary issue in the debate . . . The scientific debate is closing [against us]— 
He said back in 2002— 
but not yet closed. There is still a window of opportunity to challenge the science. 
This is the climate science version of the infamous 1969 tobacco industry memo that declared that ‘‘Doubt is our product.’’ In her recent book ‘‘Dark Money,’’ Jane Mayer describes in-depth the means by which fossil fuel interests put their wealth to use exerting out-sized influence on our American polit-ical process. First, she describes, they invest in intellectuals who come up with ideas friendly to the industry. Then they invest in think tanks to transform these ideas into ‘‘market-able policies’’—stuff they think they can sell. As one environmental lawyer explains, ‘‘You take corporate money and give it to a neutral-sounding think tank’’ which ‘‘hires people with pedi-grees and academic degrees who put out credible-seeming studies. But they all coincide perfectly with the eco-nomic interests of their funders.’’ Ms. Mayor describes this as the ‘‘think tank as disguised political weapon.’’ Not surprisingly, think tanks in the climate denial scheme tend to be fund-ed by fossil fuel interests like ExxonMobil and the Koch brothers or their fronts. The Kochs and their ilk use dark money channels to funnel money through a labyrinth of non-profit groups that make the full extent of their meddling difficult, if not im-possible, to fully determine. The Boussalis and Coan study identifies the Heartland Institute as a particularly important cog in the polluter-funded climate denial apparatus. According to their study: Heartland’s shift towards science-related themes . . . dovetails with Luntz’s famous ‘‘Straight Talk’’ memo. It is therefore not a surprise that for a decade it has organized the annual International Conference on Cli-mate Change (also known as Denial-a- Palooza), which serves as a forum for climate science deniers, or that it [Heartland] made headlines in 2012 after launching a controver-sial ad campaign which equated climate sci-entists with Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber. 
Climate scientists, such as the ones who work at NASA and NOAA, are being equated with Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber—very responsible behavior by Heartland, but Heartland gets big bucks from the fossil fuel industry and its front groups for this service. Unfortunately, that is not all. Behind this well-paid conspiracy to fool the American public, which is failing, is a related political effort, which is not. The polluters are losing with the American public, but they still control Congress. Huge sums of dark money are spent on politics, particularly right here in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. As NYU law professor Burt Neuborne has written, ‘‘rivers of money flowing from secret sources have turned our elections into silent auctions.’’ How huge are these rivers of money? Each election sets new records. In the 2012 Presidential cycle, the nonpartisan Center for Responsible Politics re-ported that dark money groups spent over $300 million, with over 80 percent of it coming from Republican-leaning outfits. The torrent of dark money flooded the 2014 midterm elections, making them the most expensive midterm elec-tions in American history.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES1132 March 1, 2016 
that election came from groups not re-quired to disclose their donors—dark money. That doesn’t even count spend-ing on so-called issue ads, which is also not reported. In this 2016 election cycle, dark money spending has broken new records again. These dark money groups, according to the Center for Re-sponsive Politics, ‘‘are more integrated into campaigns than we’ve seen in the past.’’ The Koch brothers’ political net-work alone has vowed to spend $750 million this election cycle. They are through $400 million already and climb-ing. And the $750 million they have vowed to spend is more than the Bush and Kerry campaigns combined spent in 2004. In our political debate, dark money dollars drown out the voices of average citizens with what has been aptly called ‘‘a tsunami of slime.’’ All that money is not spent for nothing. As one secret corporate donor exulted, ‘‘We can fly under the radar screen. . . . There are no limits, no restrictions, and no disclosure.’’ The result stinks, and it is polluting our public discourse. The sad part is that it is working. Not one Republican Senator will stand up and address climate change in a meaningful way. I have a bill modeled on what conservative economists and the out-of-office Republican officials who are willing to address climate change all recommend as their solu-tion. I did it their way—not a single co-sponsor. In the Presidential primary, it is even worse. One leading candidate has actually declared that ‘‘the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. man-ufacturing noncompetitive.’’ Tell that to NOAA, NASA, the U.S. Navy, and every single American National Lab-oratory. It is a preposterous statement offered by a person who presents him-self as qualified to be President of the United States. Another candidate—this one, I am sad to say, a Senate colleague—simply shrugs and says, ‘‘Climate is always changing.’’ No, not like this. And if you don’t believe me, ask NOAA, NASA, the U.S. Navy, and every single American National Laboratory. Yet another candidate who is also a Senator dismissed the solid American scientific consensus on climate change as ‘‘partisan dogma and ideology.’’ Tell that to the scientists at NOAA, NASA, the Navy, and every single one of our National Laboratories, that what they are doing is not legitimate science, but it is partisan dogma and ideology. Again, that is a preposterous remark, but they have to say those things be-cause the big fossil fuel money is so powerful in that primary race that they don’t dare cross them. The powerful fossil fuel interests have created a beautiful situation. They no longer care which candidate wins the primary because they have schooled them all to climate denial. That is the achievement of dark money, and it is an achievement that is disgracing our democracy and will darken our reputation for decades. Its effect is that we do nothing—exactly what the big polluters want, exactly what the big polluters paid for. It is just sickening what these secretive special interests and their dirty dark money are doing to our American de-mocracy. It is time to wake up, Mr. President. I thank you. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
WHOLE WOMAN ’S HEALTH V . HELLERSTEDT  
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, tomor-row the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the case Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt. The central issue of this case is an attack by the State of Texas on women’s health and the clin-ics that provide abortion services. I wish to begin by stating clearly that in our country women have a con-stitutionally protected right to make their own choices about their bodies. That is the law of the land, as guaran-teed to women in Oregon and nation-wide by the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade. The 2013 Texas law at the heart of this case, HB2, is a thinly veiled at-tempt to block women’s choice by set-ting unjustifiable and burdensome re-quirements on the doctors and clinics that offer abortion care. Despite what HB2 supporters say, it doesn’t have anything to do with protecting wom-en’s health. And the reality is, com-plications from abortion procedures are exceedingly rare. In fact, the num-bers show that abortion care is far safer than colonoscopies. Yet Texas law doesn’t go out of its way to impose comparable requirements on facilities providing colonoscopies. HB2 unfairly targets women’s health clinics. To make this point directly, I wish to briefly quote from an amicus brief filed by the trusted experts on these matters at the American Medical Association and the American Congress of Obstetri-cians and Gynecologists, among others. Their briefs said that the requirements imposed by the State of Texas ‘‘are contrary to accepted medical practice and are not based on scientific evi-dence.’’ The brief continued: ‘‘They fail to enhance the quality or safety of abortion-related medical care and, in fact, impede women’s access to such care by imposing unjustified and medi-cally unnecessary burdens on abortion providers.’’ HB2 tells clinics, ‘‘comply with these new requirements, or close.’’ So in the months since the law passed, the num-ber of clinics that provides such serv-ices has, in fact, plummeted across the State. According to reports, if HB2 is upheld, the total will drop by more than three-quarters. Texas, obviously, is a big State, and under HB2 many women are going to have to travel for hours on end to exercise a right guar-anteed to them by the U.S. Constitu-tion. The fact is, a lot of working women don’t have the luxury of taking a day off or cannot afford a long and expensive trip to a faraway clinic. In effect, women are going to be denied care. You are going to hear people on both sides of the aisle say again and again how vital it is that Americans have ac-cess to medical treatment and advice from doctors they know and trust. But HB2 flatly denies many women that protection. I personally find it very troubling that HB2 has become a blueprint for similar restrictive laws around the Na-tion, bills that masquerade as women’s health safety measures. For example, the State of Louisiana now has a near-ly identical law on its books. In January, 162 of my congressional colleagues and I wrote the following in an amicus brief filed with the Supreme Court: ‘‘A woman’s right to decide whether to carry a pregnancy to term or to seek critical medical services, in-cluding abortion, should be insulated from the shifting political rhetoric and interest groups whose sole purpose is to erode the right to choose to bring a pregnancy to term afforded to women under Roe.’’ So here is my bottom line: A limit on the exercise of a woman’s right is a limit on the right itself. It is wrong and it is un-American to restrict a per-son’s right because it conflicts with your own views. Texas HB2 should be struck down. The rights guaranteed to women following Roe v. Wade ought to be protected, just as all the others that are guaranteed by the Constitution. My hope is that this ongoing crusade against women’s health care, which I have spoken about repeatedly on the floor of this Senate, ought to end here, and it ought to end now. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

INTERNATIONAL ELECTION OB-SERVATION MISSION, 2016—TAI-WAN Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on January 16, 2016, the people of Taiwan went to the polls and elected Dr. Tsai Ing-wen as the next President of Tai-wan, with 56.2 percent of the vote. The 2016 Presidential election marked the sixth direct election of the President and Vice President of Taiwan, and the first time a woman has been elected as head of Taiwan’s Government. Dr. Tsai’s party, the Democratic Progres-sive Party, also won 68 seats of the 113- member Legislative Yuan for an out-right majority in that body. I con-gratulate Dr. Tsai and her party for their victories and new responsibilities. This election represents a significant change in Taiwan’s political landscape, with important implications for the U.S.-Taiwan relationship. I urge the administration to express its clear sup-port for Taiwan and its vibrant democ-racy. As part of the 2016 Taiwan Presi-dential and legislative elections, an international election observation mis-sion made up of 18 observers from 10 countries visited Taiwan at the invita-tion of the Taiwan Nation Alliance and the International Committee for a Democratic Taiwan. After the elec-tions, the mission submitted its final report on the elections, concluding that they were free and fair. I ask unanimous consent that the summary of that report be printed in the R
ECORD . There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows: 
OBSERVATIONS BY THE INTERNATIONAL  E
LECTION OBSERVATION MISSION , 2016 
1. INTRODUCTION  From January 12–17, 2016, a group of eight-een observers from 10 countries (see the at-tached list of members) visited Taiwan at the invitation of the Taiwan Nation Alliance (TNA) and the International Committee for a Democratic Taiwan (ICDT). They formed an International Election Observation Mission (IEOM) to observe the election campaign for the January 16th 2016 Presidential and Legis-lative elections in Taiwan. At the completion of their mission on the day after the elections, the members of the IEOM expressed appreciation to the orga-nizers of the visit, and encouraged them to continue in their efforts to strengthen Tai-wan’s democracy, so that it can be shared with other countries in the region and around the world. In addition, as the IEOM conducted their mission, it greatly appre-ciated the willingness of candidates, party representatives, and government representa-tives to meet with them. During the IEOM, the group visited loca-tions in Taipei, Kaohsiung, and Taichung, meeting with various representatives of the two main political parties: Democratic Pro-gressive Party (DPP) and Chinese Nation-alist Party (KMT), as well as of two smaller parties—the People’s First Party (PFP) and New Power Party (NPP). They also observed political rallies, street campaigns, and ac-tivities at several polling stations and the Central Election Commission counting cen-ter on Election Day. 2. THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE IEOM WERE AS  
FOLLOWS : It congratulated the people of Taiwan and its newly-elected president Dr. Tsai Ing-wen on the achievement of this major milestone in Taiwan’s history, the consolidation of many decades of hard work and dedication by the Taiwanese people. And it stated that: a. The vibrancy of the sixth direct presi-dential election further confirms that Tai-wan has left its authoritarian past behind it, and has grown into a fully democratic soci-ety featuring the institutionalization of fun-damental freedoms, comprehensive electoral procedures, and sound democratic practices. b. In our view, these elections were free and fair, though there were media reports of irregularities such as vote buying in loca-tions such as Hsinchu, Chiayi and Taitung. However, these have not affected the overall outcome of the elections. c. After such elections it is key that all sides of the political spectrum in the country respect the democratic choice of the people, and work together to make Taiwan a better place for all. d. It is also essential that other nations re-spect the results of the elections as the free choice of the people of Taiwan, and work with the newly-elected leadership to estab-lish a sustainable, long-term peace and sta-bility in the region. e. The impending third transfer of execu-tive power, as well as the first parliamentary majority for the opposition, are opportuni-ties for further deepening and consolidation of Taiwan’s democracy.

NATIONAL EYE DONOR MONTH Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, today I wish to honor March 2016 as National Eye Donor Month, an event first cele-brated by President Reagan in 1983 and one I am proud to commemorate now. For over 50 years, corneal trans-plants have restored the vision of those with corneal diseases. Today these pro-cedures are overwhelmingly safe and successful and help reduce the impact of eye disorders on our economy. As a result of higher medical expenses and reduced workforce productivity, eye disorders are the fifth costliest disease type in the United States. In total, over 70,000 people receive corneal transplants each year. The largest eye bank in the United States, Eversight, operates two locations in Il-linois. These institutions, one in Chi-cago and one in Bloomington, facili-tated over 3,000 transplants in 2015 and provided nearly 1,500 corneas for re-search and training purposes. Thanks to the 2,700 eye donors in Illinois in 2014 and the thousands of other donors across the country each year, sci-entists are closer to finding treatments and cures for corneal blindness and many patients no longer suffer from impairment or loss of vision. On this special occasion, I commend the Eye Bank Association of America and the eye banks across this country for their great work, encourage my col-leagues to promote eye donation, and urge all Americans to register to be-come eye donors. f

ANTWELL and Senator M AZIE HIRONO  to introduce legislation to approve the 2010 Agreement between the Govern-ments of the United States and the Re-public of Palau following the Compact of Free Association Section 432 Review. Palau’s history with the United States dates back to the Battle of Peleliu, fought between United States and Japanese forces for over two months with the highest casualty rate of any battle in the Pacific Theater. Following World War II, Palau became a district of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands under the auspices of the United Nations, but administered by the United States. Palau was the last district of the Trust Territory to choose its political future, when in 1994, it became a self-governing, sov-ereign state and entered into a fifty- year Compact of Free Association with the United States similar to that of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. Under the Compact, the United States, through the Department of the

Interior, provides economic and finan-cial assistance, defends Palau’s terri-torial integrity, and allows Palauan citizens the opportunity to enter the United States as non-immigrants. In return, the United States receives ex-clusive and unlimited access to Palau’s land and waterways for strategic pur-poses. U.S. assistance is intended to help Palau develop its infrastructure and economy so that it has a sustain-able government and economy capable of functioning without the United States’ support. Section 432 of the Compact provides that after the fif-teenth, thirtieth, and fortieth anniver-saries of the Compact, the United States and Palau shall formally review the terms of the Compact and shall consider the overall nature and devel-opment of their relationship, including Palau’s operating requirements and its progress in meeting development objec-tives. The United States can count on Palau to vote with us on a broad range of issues, including some that are con-troversial and where we need reliable allies. On a number of important reso-lutions that have come before the United Nations’ General Assembly, Palau stood by us and provided critical votes. For example, in 2014, Palau voted with the United States on 97 per-cent of votes before the U.N. General Assembly, and Palau voted with the U.S. 90 percent of the time in impor-tant votes. From 2011–2013, Palau voted with the United States 100 percent of the time in important votes. Palau has been a steadfast ally of the United States in international forums and we should be mindful of and grateful for their support. It is also important to recognize that Palau has consistently demonstrated a commitment to the U.S.–Palau part-nership under the Compact. Palauan nationals serve in U.S. coalition mis-sions, participate in U.S.-led combat operations, and have given their lives for the safety of our nation. Approxi-mately 500 Palauan men and women serve as volunteers in our military today, out of a population of about 21,000. Palau is indeed a strong partner who punches well above its weight. We are grateful for their sacrifices and dedication to promoting peace and fighting terrorism. After reviewing the progress achieved by Palau in the first 15 years of the Compact, and with the 13th anniversary coming upon us, the administration is recommending con-tinued assistance, but at lower levels. This agreement, reached in 2010, has been before Congress in prior years and the Senate Energy and Natural Re-sources Committee has held hearings on the matter. To the best of my knowledge, there is no objection within Congress on the policy of continuing to provide financial assistance to Palau under the Compact of Free Association. The hang-up has been finding a viable offset to pay for that assistance. I would note that since 2010 Congress has provided just over $13 million in annual discretionary funding to the Govern-ment of Palau in lieu of the Agree-ment’s enactment—a total of over $90 million in that timeframe. At the same time, the administration has failed to identify an acceptable offset for a cost that is now just under $150 million over 10 years. For such a steadfast ally, partner, and friend, whose citizens serve in our Armed Forces for the protection of our nation, and whose government sup-ports the United States’ position on critical issues in international forums, we should be able to come up with a viable funding solution. I call upon the administration to work with Congress on this matter, find an offset, and enact the 2010 Agreement between the United States and Palau. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent that a letter of support be printed in the R
ECORD . There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows: 
FEBRUARY 22, 2016. Hon. J
OSEPH R. B IDEN, Jr., President of the Senate, Washington, DC. D
EARMR. PRESIDENT : Enclosed is draft leg-islation to amend Title I of Public Law 99– 658 (100 Stat 3672), regarding the Compact of Free Association between the Government of the United States of America and the Gov-ernment of Palau (Compact). This legislation would approve and implement the results of the mandated 15-year review of the Compact, as well as the Agreement Between the Gov-ernment of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Palau (Compact Review Agreement), signed on Sep-tember 3, 2010. We strongly urge this draft bill be introduced, referred appropriately, and passed in Congress at the earliest oppor-tunity. The relationship between the United States and Palau, as embodied in the Com-pact, is grounded in shared history, friend-ship, and a strong partnership in national se-curity, especially with respect to the Asia- Pacific region. In the Battle of Peleliu, in Palau, more than 1,500 American servicemen lost their lives, and more than 8,000 were wounded, resulting in one of the costliest battles in the Pacific in World War II. After the war, the United States assumed adminis-trative authority over Palau as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands and in 1994 Palau became a sovereign nation in free association with the United States under the Compact of Free Association. The Compact provides U.S. military forces full authority and responsibility for security and defense matters in or relating to Palau. Conversely, the United States has the extraordinary ad-vantage of being able to deny other nations’ military forces access to Palau, an impor-tant element of our Pacific strategy for de-fense of the U.S. homeland. In addition to the important historical and security relationship, Palau has consistently demonstrated a commitment to the U.S.- Palau partnership under the Compact. Palauan nationals have served in U.S. coali-tion missions and participated in U.S. led combat operations. Palauan citizens volun-teer in large numbers in the U.S. military. Since September 11, 2001, seven Palauans have lost their lives in combat. At the United Nations, Palau has voted with the United States more than 95 percent of the time, including on key foreign policy issues. The Compact has seen the goal of self-gov-ernance and democracy in Palau realized. However, to bolster this progress and main-tain stability in the region, we must now help to ensure Palau’s financial independ-ence. By approving the Compact Review Agreement, the pending legislation would extend U.S. assistance through 2024, helping to meet and achieve this critical goal. Under the agreement, Palau has committed to un-dertake economic, legislative, financial, and management reforms. Additionally, this agreement assures the United States can withhold economic assistance in the absence of significant further progress in imple-menting meaningful reforms. The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 requires that the cumulative effects of rev-enue and direct spending legislation in a con-gressional session meet a pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) requirement. In total, such legisla-tion should not increase the on-budget def-icit; if it does, it would produce a sequestra-tion if it is not fully offset by the end of the congressional session. This draft bill would increase mandatory outlays and the on-budg-et deficit as shown below: 
FISCAL YEARS 
[Dollars in millions] 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Total 
Deficit Impact ................................................................................................................. .............................. 46 26 20 17 15 14 6 5 149 
This proposal would increase direct spend-ing, and it is therefore subject to the Statu-tory PAYGO Act and should be considered in conjunction with all other proposals that are subject to the Act. Approving the results of the Agreement is important to the national security of the United States, stability in the Western Pacific region, our bilateral re-lationship with Palau, and to the United States’ broader strategic interests in the Asia-Pacific region. We stand ready, as al-ways, to provide you with any information and assistance necessary to help secure the passage of this legislation. Sincerely, S

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES1138 March 1, 2016 
in Canada in furtherance of border se-curity initiatives; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last year, I hailed the signing of a new agreement between the United States and Canada designed to improve cross-border trav-el, commerce and security between our two countries. Secretary Johnson of the Department of Homeland Security was joined in Washington by Canada’s Minister of Public Safety, Steven Blaney, for the signing of that new preclearance agreement, which was ne-gotiated under the Beyond the Border Action Plan. Preclearance facilities allow trav-elers to pass through U.S. Customs and Border Protection, CBP, inspections in Canada, prior to traveling to the United States. Preclearance operations relieve congestion at U.S. destination airports, facilitate commerce, save money, and strengthen national secu-rity. The United States currently sta-tions CBP officers in select locations in Canada to inspect passengers and cargo bound for the United States before de-parting Canada. The new agreement signed in March 2015 will lead to ex-panded U.S. preclearance facilities in Canada in the marine, land, air and rail sectors. However, the Department of Home-land Security requires specific, nar-rowly tailored legislation to fully im-plement the new agreement. CBP Offi-cers assigned to preclearance locations operate with law enforcement authori-ties and immunities as agreed upon by the United States and the host coun-try’s government. Under the new preclearance agreement with Canada, the United States secured the right to prosecute U.S. officials if they commit crimes on the job while stationed in Canada—and thereby preclude a pros-ecution by Canadian prosecutors. But in some cases, the United States may lack the legal authority to prosecute U.S. officials because many federal crimes do not have extraterritorial reach. The Promoting Travel, Com-merce and National Security Act of 2016, which I am proud to introduce today with Senator M
URKOWSKI , would ensure that the United States has the legal authority to hold our own offi-cials accountable if they engage in wrongdoing abroad in Canada. This leg-islation will allow for full implementa-tion of the expanded Canada preclearance agreement. Enacting this legislation will pro-mote two key national goals: enhanc-ing our national security, and creating a more efficient flow of travelers and goods. By placing CBP personnel at the point of departure, screening occurs be-fore a person boards a flight, increasing our ability to prevent those who should not be flying to the United States from doing so. In 2014, preclearance stopped more than 10,000 inadmissible travelers worldwide before they left foreign soil. As Secretary Johnson has said, ‘‘We have to push our homeland security out beyond our borders so that we are not defending the homeland from the one-yard line.’’ At the same time, preclearance facilitates travel and trade. I am pleased that a bipartisan coali-tion in the House of Representatives, led by Representatives ELISE STEFANIK  and A
NNKUSTER , will also introduce companion legislation today as well. And I am grateful for the support of Senators S
CHUMER , J OHNSON , H
EITKAMP , SHAHEEN , CANTWELL , M UR-
RAYand G ILLIBRAND for this important legislation. I hope with this bipartisan, bicameral support, this simple, straightforward enabling legislation will be enacted this year. In Vermont, we look to our Canadian neighbors as partners in trade and commerce, and as joint stewards of our shared communities. While both na-tions strive to ensure that the border is secure, the ties between Canada and Vermont run deep. We rely on each other for trade, commerce, and tour-ism. And many Vermont families have members on both sides of the border. This agreement has long been a dream for Vermonters who have fond memo-ries of taking the train north to Mon-treal to enjoy all that this vibrant cul-tural hub offers. It is also a win for visitors from Canada’s largest cities who love to come to Vermont to ski, shop and dine. I commend Secretary Johnson for his commitment to forging this agreement that will greatly ben-efit Vermont and the United States. I look forward to enacting this legisla-tion into law so that these projects can move forward. 
By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. S
CHUMER , Mr. H ATCH , and Mrs. F
EINSTEIN ): S. 2613. A bill to reauthorize certain programs established by the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006; to the Committee on the Judi-ciary. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have all heard accounts of innocent children being victimized and abused by predators. Today I will introduce legislation to extend two of the key programs that Congress established under the Adam Walsh Child Protec-tion and Safety Act of 2006. With to-day’s legislation, I hope to send a strong message to all Americans about Congress’ continued commitment to keeping our Nation’s children safe. Many of us here in the Senate worked very hard on the original version of the Adam Walsh Act, which is named for a six year-old who was tragically murdered in 1981. President George W. Bush signed that legislation on the 25th anniversary of Adam Walsh’s abduction from a Florida shop-ping mall. I am pleased that Senators H
ATCH , SCHUMER , and F EINSTEIN —who cosponsored the Senate version of that legislation when it was first introduced in the 109th Congress—have joined me as original cosponsors of today’s legis-lation. John Walsh, the father of Adam Walsh, worked closely with us on the development of the 2006 Adam Walsh Act, and we worked with him on the development of today’s legislation as well. Reauthorization of the Adam Walsh Act is a priority for him and has the support of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The Adam Walsh Act was enacted in response to multiple, notorious cases involving children who had been tar-geted by adult criminals, many of them repeat sex offenders. Its passage be-came a national priority after Congress discovered that criminals were taking advantage of gaps and loopholes in some States’ laws to circumvent sex of-fender registration requirements—with tragic results for some of the nation’s children. Who can forget Jetseta Gage—a beau-tiful 10-year-old girl from Cedar Rap-ids, Iowa who was sexually assaulted and murdered by a registered sex of-fender in 2005? As a cosponsor of the Senate version of the Adam Walsh Act, I championed the inclusion in the 2006 law of language imposing mandatory minimum penalties for those who mur-der, kidnap, or inflict serious bodily harm to children like Jetseta. Of course, the centerpiece of the Adam Walsh Act is the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, or SORNA. SORNA divides sex offenders into three categories, or tiers, depend-ing on the seriousness of their crimes. It encourages States to set minimum criteria for the registration of sex of-fenders in each tier, with the aim of discouraging ‘‘forum shopping’’ by of-fenders who prey on children. The Adam Walsh Act also established several programs that are key to its successful implementation. One such program, known as SOMA, or the Sex Offender Management Assistance Pro-gram, makes federal grant resources available to states to offset the costs of Walsh Act implementation. Today’s legislation would extend the authoriza-tion for that program, which expired 8 years ago. The federal government, through the U.S. Marshals Service, also supports States and localities in tracking down sex offenders who fail to register or re- register. Those fugitive apprehension activities were authorized under the 2006 Adam Walsh Act, and today’s leg-islation would extend the authoriza-tion for those U.S. Marshals Service activities at $60 million annually for each of the next 2 years. Nothing can bring back Adam Walsh, Jetseta Gage, Dru Sjodin, Megan Kanka, or the other innocents for whom the Adam Walsh Act was passed. But it is important that we continue to not only honor their memories but also protect America’s future children from harm by extending the key programs that were authorized under the original Adam Walsh Act. The authorization for these programs expired at least 7 years ago. According to the Justice Depart-ment’s Bureau of Justice Statistics, there are about a hundred thousand

people convicted of sexual violence of-fenses in state prisons, and hundreds of thousands more who currently reside in neighborhoods across the United States. As a father of five and the grandfather of 9, I believe we should continue to make sex offender registra-tion and notification a priority. Mr. President, July 27 of this year will mark the 35th anniversary of Adam Walsh’s abduction. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the passage of this important legislation before that date elapses. 
By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mr. G
RASSLEY , and Mr. T ILLIS ): S. 2614. A bill to amend the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, to reauthorize the Missing Alzheimer’s Disease Patient Alert Pro-gram, and to promote initiatives that will reduce the risk of injury and death relating to the wandering characteris-tics of some children with autism; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today Senators S
CHUMER , TILLIS and I will introduce legislation to help America’s families locate missing loved ones who have Alzheimer’s dis-ease, autism or related conditions that may cause them to wander. Our bill would extend existing programs de-signed to assist in locating Alzheimer’s disease and dementia patients. It also adds new support for people with au-tism. We have named the legislation in honor of two boys with autism who per-ished because their condition caused them to wander. One of these children, nine-year-old Kevin Curtis Wills, slipped into Iowa’s Raccoon River near a park and tragically drowned in 2008. The other, 14-year-old Avonte Oquendo, wandered away from his school and drowned in New York City’s East River several years ago. Theirs are not isolated cases. We have all read or heard the heart-breaking stories of families frantically trying to locate a missing loved one whose condition caused him or her to wander off. We have also seen benefits of notifi-cation systems to locate missing chil-dren and bring relief to families through community assistance. Our bill will use similar concepts and other technology to help locate people with Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia as well as children with au-tism spectrum disorders who may be prone to wander away from their fami-lies or caregivers. My home State of Iowa has the fifth highest Alzheimer’s death rate in America, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. As further noted by the Alzheimer’s Association, which we con-sulted on this bill’s development, as many as one in three seniors will die with a form of dementia. About 63,000 Iowans are living with Alzheimer’s dis-ease. In 2014, the Centers for Disease Con-trol and Prevention released informa-tion on the incidence of autism in this country. The CDC identified 1 in 68 children as having autism spectrum disorders. Experts tell us that, in Iowa alone, about 8,000 individuals have been diagnosed with autism spectrum dis-orders, and we worked closely with the Autism Society of Iowa on the develop-ment of this bill. Because police often are the first people to respond when a child goes missing, the bill also will make re-sources available to equip first re-sponders and other community offi-cials with the training necessary to better prevent and respond to these cases. With better information sharing, communities can play a central role in reuniting these children with their families. Finally, the bill will ensure that grants from the U.S. Department of Justice also can be used by state and local law enforcement agencies and nonprofits for education and training programs to proactively prevent and locate missing individuals with these conditions. The grants will facilitate the development of training and emer-gency protocols for school personnel, supply first responders with additional information and resources, and make local tracking technology programs available for individuals who may wan-der from safety because of their condi-tion. Grant funding may also be used to establish or enhance notification and communications systems for the recovery of missing children with au-tism. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

SEC. ll1. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Democracy Restoration Act of 2016’’. 
SEC. ll2. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: (1) The right to vote is the most basic con-stitutive act of citizenship. Regaining the right to vote reintegrates individuals with criminal convictions into free society, help-ing to enhance public safety. (2) Article I, section 4, of the Constitution grants Congress ultimate supervisory power over Federal elections, an authority which has repeatedly been upheld by the United States Supreme Court. (3) Basic constitutional principles of fair-ness and equal protection require an equal opportunity for citizens of the United States to vote in Federal elections. The right to vote may not be abridged or denied by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, gender, or previous condition of servitude. The 13th, 14th, 15th, 19th, 24th, and 26th Amendments to the Constitution em-power Congress to enact measures to protect the right to vote in Federal elections. The 8th Amendment to the Constitution provides for no excessive bail to be required, nor ex-cessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted. (4) There are 3 areas where discrepancies in State laws regarding criminal convictions lead to unfairness in Federal elections— (A) the lack of a uniform standard for vot-ing in Federal elections leads to an unfair disparity and unequal participation in Fed-eral elections based solely on where a person lives; (B) laws governing the restoration of vot-ing rights after a criminal conviction vary throughout the country and persons in some States can easily regain their voting rights while in other States persons effectively lose their right to vote permanently; and (C) State disenfranchisement laws dis-proportionately impact racial and ethnic mi-norities. (5) Two States do not disenfranchise indi-viduals with criminal convictions at all (Maine and Vermont), but 48 States and the District of Columbia have laws that deny convicted individuals the right to vote while they are in prison. (6) In some States disenfranchisement re-sults from varying State laws that restrict voting while individuals are under the super-vision of the criminal justice system or after they have completed a criminal sentence. In 35 States, convicted individuals may not vote while they are on parole and 31 of those States disenfranchise individuals on felony probation as well. In 11 States, a conviction can result in lifetime disenfranchisement. (7) Several States deny the right to vote to individuals convicted of certain mis-demeanors. (8) An estimated 5,850,000 citizens of the United States, or about 1 in 40 adults in the United States, currently cannot vote as a re-sult of a felony conviction. Of the 5,850,000 citizens barred from voting, only 25 percent are in prison. By contrast, 75 percent of the disenfranchised reside in their communities while on probation or parole or after having completed their sentences. Approximately 2,600,000 citizens who have completed their sentences remain disenfranchised due to re-strictive State laws. In 6 States—Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia—more than 7 percent of the total population is disenfranchised. (9) In those States that disenfranchise indi-viduals post-sentence, the right to vote can be regained in theory, but in practice this possibility is often granted in a non-uniform and potentially discriminatory manner. Disenfranchised individuals must either ob-tain a pardon or an order from the Governor or an action by the parole or pardon board, depending on the offense and State. Individ-uals convicted of a Federal offense often have additional barriers to regaining voting rights. (10) State disenfranchisement laws dis-proportionately impact racial and ethnic mi-norities. Eight percent of the African-Amer-ican population, or 2,000,000 African-Ameri-cans, are disenfranchised. Given current rates of incarceration, approximately 1 in 3 of the next generation of African-American men will be disenfranchised at some point

during their lifetime. Currently, 1 of every 13 African-Americans are rendered unable to vote because of felony disenfranchisement, which is a rate 4 times greater than non Af-rican-Americans. 7.7 percent of African- Americans are disenfranchised whereas only 1.8 percent of non African-Americans are. In 3 States—Florida (23 percent), Kentucky (22 percent), and Virginia (20 percent)—more than 1 in 5 African-Americans are unable to vote because of prior convictions. (11) Latino citizens are disproportionately disenfranchised based upon their dispropor-tionate representation in the criminal jus-tice system. If current incarceration trends hold, 17 percent of Latino men will be incar-cerated during their lifetimes, in contrast to less than 6 percent of non-Latino White men. When analyzing the data across 10 States, Latinos generally have disproportionately higher rates of disenfranchisement compared to their presence in the voting age popu-lation. In 6 out of 10 States studied in 2003, Latinos constitute more than 10 percent of the total number of persons disenfranchised by State felony laws. In 4 States (California, 37 percent; New York, 34 percent; Texas, 30 percent; and Arizona, 27 percent), Latinos were disenfranchised by a rate of more than 25 percent. (12) Disenfranchising citizens who have been convicted of a criminal offense and who are living and working in the community serves no compelling State interest and hinders their rehabilitation and reintegra-tion into society. (13) State disenfranchisement laws can suppress electoral participation among eligi-ble voters by discouraging voting among family and community members of disenfranchised persons. Future electoral participation by the children of disenfranchised parents may be impacted as well. (14) The United States is the only Western democracy that permits the permanent de-nial of voting rights for individuals with fel-ony convictions.

Congress finds the following: (1) The abuse of heroin and prescription opioid painkillers is having a devastating ef-fect on public health and safety in commu-nities across the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-tion, drug overdose deaths now surpass traf-fic accidents in the number of deaths caused by injury in the United States. In 2014, an av-erage of more than 120 people in the United States died from drug overdoses every day. (2) According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (commonly known as ‘‘NIDA’’), the number of prescriptions for opioids in-creased from approximately 76,000,000 in 1991 to nearly 207,000,000 in 2013, and the United States is the biggest consumer of opioids globally, accounting for almost 100 percent of the world total for hydrocodone and 81 percent for oxycodone. (3) Opioid pain relievers are the most wide-ly misused or abused controlled prescription drugs (commonly referred to as ‘‘CPDs’’) and are involved in most CPD-related overdose incidents. According to the Drug Abuse Warning Network (commonly known as ‘‘DAWN’’), the estimated number of emer-gency department visits involving nonmed-ical use of prescription opiates or opioids in-creased by 112 percent between 2006 and 2010, from 84,671 to 179,787. (4) The use of heroin in the United States has also spiked sharply in recent years. Ac-cording to the most recent National Survey on Drug Use and Health, more than 900,000 people in the United States reported using heroin in 2014, nearly a 35 percent increase from the previous year. Heroin overdose deaths more than tripled from 2010 to 2014. (5) The supply of cheap heroin available in the United States has increased dramatically as well, largely due to the activity of Mexi-can drug trafficking organizations. The Drug Enforcement Administration (commonly known as the ‘‘DEA’’) estimates that heroin seizures at the Mexican border have more than doubled since 2010, and heroin produc-tion in Mexico increased 62 percent from 2013 to 2014. While only 8 percent of State and local law enforcement officials across the United States identified heroin as the great-est drug threat in their area in 2008, that number rose to 38 percent in 2015. (6) Law enforcement officials and treat-ment experts throughout the country report that many people who have misused pre-scription opioids have turned to heroin as a cheaper or more easily obtained alternative to prescription opioids. (7) According to a report by the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors (commonly referred to as ‘‘NASADAD’’), 37 States reported an increase in admissions to treatment for heroin use during the past 2 years, while admissions to treatment for prescription opiates increased 500 percent from 2000 to 2012. (8) Research indicates that combating the opioid crisis, including abuse of prescription painkillers and, increasingly, heroin, re-quires a multipronged approach that in-volves prevention, education, monitoring, law enforcement initiatives, reducing drug diversion and the supply of illicit drugs, ex-panding delivery of existing treatments (in-cluding medication assisted treatments), ex-panding access to overdose medications and interventions, and the development of new medications for pain that can augment the existing treatment arsenal. (9) Substance use disorders are a treatable disease. Discoveries in the science of addic-tion have led to advances in the treatment of substance use disorders that help people stop abusing drugs and prescription medications and resume their productive lives. (10) According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, approximately 22,700,000 people in the United States needed substance use disorder treatment in 2013, but only 2,500,000 people received it. Further-more, current treatment services are not adequate to meet demand. According to a re-port commissioned by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (commonly known as ‘‘SAMHSA’’), there are approximately 32 providers for every 1,000 in-dividuals needing substance use disorder treatment. In some States, the ratio is much lower. (11) The overall cost of drug abuse, from health care- and criminal justice-related costs to lost productivity, is steep, totaling more than $700,000,000,000 a year, according to NIDA. Effective substance abuse preven-tion can yield major economic dividends. (12) According to NIDA, when schools and communities properly implement science- validated substance abuse prevention pro-grams, abuse of alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs is reduced. Such programs help teach-ers, parents, and healthcare professionals shape the perceptions of youths about the risks of drug abuse.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1155 March 1, 2016 
(13) Diverting certain individuals with sub-stance use disorders from criminal justice systems into community-based treatment can save billions of dollars and prevent size-able numbers of crimes, arrests, and re-in-carcerations over the course of those individ-uals’ lives. (14) According to the DEA, more than 2,700 tons of expired, unwanted prescription medi-cations have been collected since the enact-ment of the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 (Public Law 111–273; 124 Stat. 2858). (15) Faith-based, holistic, or drug-free mod-els can provide a critical path to successful recovery for a number of people in the United States. The 2015 membership survey conducted by Alcoholics Anonymous (com-monly known as ‘‘AA’’) found that 73 percent of AA members were sober longer than 1 year and attended 2.5 meetings per week. (16) Research shows that combining treat-ment medications with behavioral therapy is an effective way to facilitate success for some patients. Treatment approaches must be tailored to address the drug abuse pat-terns and drug-related medical, psychiatric, and social problems of each individual. Dif-ferent types of medications may be useful at different stages of treatment or recovery to help a patient stop using drugs, stay in treatment, and avoid relapse. Patients have a range of options regarding their path to re-covery and many have also successfully ad-dressed drug abuse through the use of faith- based, holistic, or drug-free models. (17) Individuals with mental illness, espe-cially severe mental illness, are at consider-ably higher risk for substance abuse than the general population, and the presence of a mental illness complicates recovery from substance abuse. (18) Rural communities are especially sus-ceptible to heroin and opioid abuse. Individ-uals in rural counties have higher rates of drug poisoning deaths, including deaths from opioids. According to the American Journal of Public Health, ‘‘[O]pioid poisonings in nonmetropolitan counties have increased at a rate greater than threefold the increase in metropolitan counties.’’ According to a Feb-ruary 19, 2016, report from the Maine Rural Health Research Center, ‘‘[M]ultiple studies document a higher prevalence [of abuse] among specific vulnerable rural populations, particularly among youth, women who are pregnant or experiencing partner violence, and persons with co-occurring disorders.’’

SEC. 801. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Recovery Enhancement for Addiction Treatment Act’’ or the ‘‘TREAT Act’’. 
SEC. 802. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: (1) Overdoses from opioids have increased dramatically in the United States. (2) Deaths from drug overdose, largely from prescription pain relievers, have tripled among men and increased five-fold among women over the past decade. (3) Nationwide, drug overdoses now claim more lives than car accidents. (4) Opioid addiction is a chronic disease that, untreated, places a large burden on the healthcare system. Roughly 475,000 emer-gency room visits each year are attributable to the misuse and abuse of opioid pain medi-cation. (5) Effective medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction, in combination with counseling and behavioral therapies, can de-crease overdose deaths, be cost-effective, re-duce transmissions of HIV and viral hepa-titis, and reduce other social harms such as criminal activity. (6) Effective medication-assisted treatment programs for opioid addiction should include multiple components, including medications, cognitive and behavioral supports and inter-ventions, and drug testing. (7) Effective medication-assisted treatment programs for opioid addiction may use a team of staff members, in addition to a pre-scribing provider, to deliver comprehensive care. (8) Access to medication-assisted treat-ments, including office-based buprenorphine opioid treatment, remains limited in part due to current practice regulations and an insufficient number of providers. (9) More than 10 years of experience in the United States with office-based buprenorphine opioid treatment has in-formed best practices for delivering success-ful, high quality care.

HAPPY ANNIVERSARY AND CON-GRATULATIONS TO THE GOV-ERNMENT PUBLISHING OFFICE 
HON. ROBERT A. BRADY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 1, 2016 Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, March 4, 2016, marks the 155th anniversary of the Government Publishing Office (GPO), the legislative-branch agency that Congress depends upon every day to produce the docu-ments we need to discharge our constitutional responsibilities. Opening its doors for business as the Government Printing Office the same day that Abraham Lincoln was first inaugu-rated as President, the GPO since that time has worked around the clock in support of Congress, Federal agencies, and the right of the American people for access to information by and about our Government. Where once GPO produced this Govern-ment information solely through the printing process, in the past generation GPO has transformed itself into a digital publisher, re-ducing dramatically the cost of producing Gov-ernment information while exponentially ex-panding its reach to the public. More than 8,000 staff labored at GPO when it provided print only, while today there are about 1,700. Yet because of technology changes embraced by GPO the productivity of the 1,700 vastly exceeds their predecessors’. That productivity has yielded huge savings for the taxpayers and vastly modernized the way we work on behalf of the citizens we represent. The technological changes the GPO has un-dergone have not gone unnoticed. In 2014, legislation was introduced in the Senate to recognize that the GPO is, by virtue of its dig-ital progress, not just for printing anymore, and Congress and the President agreed that the time had come to change the GPO’s name. Today, the GPO is the Government Publishing Office, a lean, technologically proficient, and thoroughly modern agency under the leader-ship of Director Davita Vance-Cooks, a tal-ented manager who understands how to lead and sustain the benefits of change. For the third year in a row Director Vance- Cooks has sent Congress a flat budget re-quest. With her at the helm the GPO’s em-ployees have rated it one of the best places to work—a big change from how they felt ten years ago—and in their work they now turn out one success after another. Last year they installed high-efficiency equipment that has yielded a significant price reduction in the cost of producing our hearings. Last month, they unveiled a new, easy-to-use website that is drawing universal praise, including from you, Mr. Speaker. Moreover, together with the Library of Con-gress, GPO employees last week launched public access to bulk-data files of bill-status in-formation, a move that is further expanding openness and transparency to the legislative process. For the future they are poised to sup-port the State Department’s introduction of the next generation e-Passport and in 2017 they will move to a new composition system to speed and further reduce the cost of pro-ducing documents for Congress and Federal agencies. Mr. Speaker, in remarks five years ago ob-serving the GPO’s sesquicentennial, I noted that Benjamin Franklin—America’s patron saint of printing and Philadelphia’s greatest cit-izen—would be surprised and pleased by what the GPO is and does. I can confidently say that he would feel the same today. On behalf of all of us in this House, congratulations and best wishes to GPO Director Davita Vance- Cooks and the men and women of the Gov-ernment Publishing Office. Many thanks for all their good work.

SUPREME COURT VACANCY 
SPEECH OF  
HON. MARCIA L. FUDGE 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 29, 2016 Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, when taking of-fice, every Member of Congress swears to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. This includes Article II, Section 2, Clause 2, also known as the ‘‘Appointments Clause.’’ The Appointments Clause clearly states the President has the power to nominate Justices of the Supreme Court. Nowhere does this clause state the President abdicates this con-stitutional responsibility during a presidential election year. And, nowhere does it state the U.S. Senate can make threats against the President for exercising his constitutional au-thority. Our separate branches of government exist to provide checks and balances against tyranny, not to hijack Constitutional processes for political gain. Many Republicans have argued that Su-preme Court Justices are not typically ap-pointed during presidential election years, and especially during a president’s last term. To those claims I invoke Mahlon Pitney, Louis Brandeis, John H. Clarke, Benjamin Cardozo, Frank Murphy, and Anthony Kennedy—all ex-amples of Supreme Court Justices who were confirmed during a presidential election year. Supreme Court Justices Anthony Kennedy and Benjamin Cardozo in particular, were con-firmed during President Reagan and President Hoover’s last years, respectively. Justice Louis Brandeis was nominated and confirmed in 1916 to replace Justice Joseph Lamar, who died in early January of that same year. Not only has the Senate voted on and con-firmed Supreme Court nominees during presi-dential election years, the process has never taken more than 125 days. In fact, on aver-age, nominees have been confirmed, rejected, or withdrawn within 25 days. Ample time re-mains for President Obama to work with Con-gress to approve a nominee. However, Republican leadership has once again let politics get in the way of doing what the American people elected them to do. The Constitution is clear. Just as we honor our First Amendment right to freedom of reli-gion or our Second Amendment right to bear arms, so should we defend the constitu-tionality of the Supreme Court appointment process. We cannot pick and choose which sections we enforce. As Members of Congress, we made a prom-ise to our constituents that we would ‘‘faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which’’ we have been elected to. It is the Senate’s duty to consider a Supreme Court nominee. I implore my Republican colleagues: Put politics aside and do your job; do not block President Obama’s nominee. Rulings handed down by the Supreme Court directly affect our economy, security, and civil rights. This seat is too important to leave vacant. f 
SUPREME COURT VACANCY 
SPEECH OF  
HON. DONALD M. PAYNE, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 29, 2016 Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, barely an hour after Justice Scalia’s death was confirmed, Senate Majority Leader M
ITCH MCCONNELL  issued a statement rejecting any judge Presi-dent Obama chose to nominate to the Su-preme Court. At that point, the President hadn’t even an-nounced his intention to fill the vacancy on our highest court. It’s a sad state of affairs that the highest ranking Republican in the Senate would politi-cize the Court in such a grotesque way when many of us were still learning of Justice Scalia’s passing. But this is par for the course for the Repub-licans. On issue after issue, debate after de-bate, they continue to solidify their reputation as the party of ‘‘no,’’ to the detriment of this great nation. Senate Republicans continue to maintain that they will deny a confirmation hearing to any individual nominated by President Obama to serve on the Supreme Court. This is part of the Republican political agen-da to disrupt the work of government when it does not align with their far-right ideology. It is a thinly-veiled attempt to obstruct the nomination process in hopes of packing the Supreme Court with conservative justices who will roll back the progress our nation has made, from marriage equality to reproductive rights. We have already seen what is at stake here. In 2013, the Supreme Court struck down the heart of the Voting Rights Act—a major setback for civil rights and voting rights, and a major blow to fundamental democracy in this country. The president has a constitutional responsi-bility to nominate a successor to Justice Scalia.

The Senate also has a constitutional re-sponsibility—to give the nominee a fair hear-ing and a timely vote. This is about democracy and protecting the institution of the Supreme Court. What we are seeing from Republicans is a clear pattern of obstruction. They have shut down the government, threatened not to pay our debts, and halted the nomination process before it has even begun. This divisiveness is a detriment to our de-mocracy, an affront to justice, and an insult to the American people, who deserve to have their nation’s highest court working at full ca-pacity. Republicans have said that there is no precedent for confirming a Supreme Court nominee during an election year. That is bla-tantly wrong: six Justices have been confirmed in presidential election years, including three Republican appointees. Since the 1980s, Congress has almost never left any vacancy during a single Su-preme Court session. What is unprecedented in modern history is denying the President of the United States a hearing or vote on a nomination to the Su-preme Court. And yet that’s what the Republican plan is. It’s hard not to see this as an effort to delegitimize the nation’s first black president. Republicans have been trying to derail President Obama ever since he took office. And now, whoever ends up being nomi-nated for the Supreme Court, regardless of qualifications, will be rejected simply because he or she is an Obama nominee. The disdain Republicans have for Obama is so great that they are willing to trample on the U.S. Constitution to prevent him from appoint-ing a judge to the Supreme Court. The U.S. Constitution—the very document that Republicans like to accuse the President of ignoring—states that the president ‘‘shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges of the Supreme Court.’’ Not only does he have the right, he has a duty to appoint a judge to the Court. Now, President Obama made clear that he seeks judges ‘‘who approach decisions without any particular ideology or agenda, but rather a commitment to impartial justice, a respect for precedent, and a determination to faithfully apply the law to the facts at hand.’’ There is nothing radical about the Presi-dent’s position. His comments speak to his re-spect for the law and the seriousness he brings to the nomination process. Republicans must do their job as it relates to that process—earnestly debate and then vote on the person nominated by the Presi-dent. There are many hotly debated issues in our country—immigration, gun reform, health care, campaign finance; issues that necessitate the maximum strength of the Supreme Court. The American people deserve far better than attempts by Republican politicians in Washington to stack the Supreme Court with far-right judges who will forgo impartial justice to advance the conservative agenda. They expect their government to work for them, and Senate Republicans must meet that expectation by swiftly filling the vacancy on the Court. SUPREME COURT VACANCY 
SPEECH OF  
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 29, 2016 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, sixteen days ago, and just moments after learning the sad news that Antonin Scalia, the most senior Justice on the Supreme Court, had died in his sleep at the age of 79, the Republican Senate Majority Leader, announced emphatically that ‘‘this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new President.’’ Later that evening, the Senate Majority Leader’s position was echoed at a presidential primary debate in South Carolina by every Re-publican presidential candidate. Justice Scalia may have had many qualities but none endeared him more to his admirers on that debate stage and across the country than his professed devotion to the rule of law, his exaltation of the doctrine of ‘‘original in-tent,’’ and his insistence that the meaning of the Constitution is to be divined only from the strictest reading of the text. Given the praise heaped on Justice Scalia by Republican senators and presidential can-didates, it is passing strange indeed that they claim to be honoring his memory by taking a position that repudiates the very principles Justice Scalia devoted his life to advancing. Mr. Speaker, so-called ‘‘strict construc-tionists’’ claim that the Constitution is to be in-terpreted according to its literal text. Well, there is nothing clearer than the provi-sion in Article II, Section 2, which states that the President ‘‘with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the Su-preme Count[.]’’ To read the Constitution as containing a lim-itation restricting the President’s exercise of this power in the fourth year of his term of of-fice would be to treat the Constitution as a ‘‘living document’’ and to engage in the type of judicial activism that Justice Scalia opposed and fought during his 30 years on the Court. Indeed, just three years ago, at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Justice Scalia in discussing his judicial philosophy, ex-pressed his view of the Constitution: ‘‘It’s not a living document. It’s dead, dead, dead.’’ If it had been the original intention of the Framers to restrict the President from nomi-nating Supreme Court Justices to fill vacan-cies occurring in the fourth year of his or her term, they would have manifested that intent clearly, explicitly, and unmistakably, as they did in conditioning Supreme Court appoint-ments to the advice and consent of the Sen-ate and in prohibiting the President from exer-cising the Pardon Power in cases of impeach-ment. Mr. Speaker, disregarding the procedure ex-pressly set forth in the Constitution for filling vacancies on the Supreme Court because it may not result in the appointment of one’s preferred justice makes a mockery of the ‘‘rule of law,’’ adherence to which is claimed to be the most sacred principle of both judicial and political conservatives. The bottom line is this: for those who re-vered Justice Scalia, cherish his memory, and wish to do honor to the work of his life, the way forward is clear. And that is for Republican senators to gladly receive, when it is put forward, President Obama’s nominee to fill the vacancy left by the death of their hero and discharge their constitutional duty to advise and consent (or not consent) to the nomination as reflected by an up or down vote on the nominee. Republican senators protest there is an 80 year precedent against confirming a Supreme Court nominee during an election year, and besides, there is not sufficient time even if they wished to do so. This is a short horse soon curried. The most recent instance where there was a vacancy on the Supreme Court in an elec-tion year occurred not 80 but 28 years ago, in 1988, during the administration of President Reagan. That vacancy was filled on February 3, 1988 by the appointment of Justice Anthony Ken-nedy, who was confirmed 97–0 by a Demo-crat-controlled Senate. The Justice Kennedy nomination is the con-trolling precedent, as Justice Scalia would rec-ognize. The erudite Justice would say to anyone claiming otherwise, ‘‘Leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant,’’ which is Latin for the canon of judicial interpretation that ‘‘the last expression of the people prevails.’’ There are 326 days left in President Obama’s term, which is more than sufficient time for the President to nominate, and for the Senate to consider and vote to confirm or re-ject his nominee. Since 1900, there have been 60 Supreme Court vacancies. The average time taken to fill these 60 va-cancies is 73 days, which is less than 25% of the time remaining in the President’s term. The average time to fill each of the 13 va-cancies since 1975 is a mere 67 days. And of the current members of the Supreme Court, the average time is 74 days, the long-est being the 99 days taken to confirm the controversial nomination of Justice Clarence Thomas in October 1991. Mr. Speaker, as is often noted, elections have consequences; they also impose respon-sibilities and duties. And one of the most important duties im-posed by the Constitution on the President is to nominate persons to fill vacancies on the Supreme Court and for the Senate to consider those nominations with dispatch. The Supreme Court is the nation’s highest court and its essential and indispensable role in our constitutional system is to provide defin-itive interpretations of American law and the Constitution. Its decisions are the law of the land binding in every state and territory. The Supreme Court is the only judicial tri-bunal capable of providing the legal clarity and certainty required for the legal system to func-tion and give meaning to the rule of law. President Obama has announced that he in-tends to fulfill the responsibility devolved upon him by the Constitution and will submit to the Senate a nominee to fill the large shoes left by the late Justice Antonin Scalia. The Senate should fulfill its constitutional duty to advise and consent, or withhold its consent, by casting an up or down vote on that nomination. That is the way to pay fitting tribute to Jus-tice Scalia, to honor the Constitution, and to keep faith with the American people.

CELEBRATING THE INDIANA BOROUGH BICENTENNIAL 
HON. BILL SHUSTER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 1, 2016 Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Indiana Borough in Penn-sylvania’s 9th Congressional District for reach-ing a huge milestone: its Bicentennial. Officially incorporated on March 11, 1816, countless citizens of the Indiana Borough have contributed to and witnessed the impressive development of a uniquely welcoming and en-terprising community over the past 200 years. As a proud American city, Indiana can claim as one of its many notable contributions to our country to have had citizens participate in the Civil War, World Wars I and II, the Korean conflict, the Vietnam War, and our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. What’s more, the borough has helped develop citizens who have contrib-uted meaningfully to just about every aspect of our society, including: business, education, medicine, the arts, and politics. As many of my constituents know, Indiana Borough is also the hometown of famous Hollywood actor Jimmy Stewart. Additionally, it is home to the Indiana University of Pennsylvania, which at-tracts thousands of bright students to the area each year. As the product of a region that has experi-enced the benefits of a strong coal industry, I am also proud to highlight Indiana Borough’s contributions to the rich heritage associated with coal mining. There can be no doubt that over the past 200 years, the Indiana Borough has contributed an invaluable spirit as well as list of accomplishments and successful resi-dents to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and I am certainly proud to represent this bor-ough and its citizens. As such, it is with great pleasure that I con-gratulate the Indiana Borough and its remark-able citizens on this Bicentennial milestone, and wish them an even brighter future.

RECOGNITION OF GUY PRESTON RICHARDSON 
HON. BRETT GUTHRIE 
OF KENTUCKY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 1, 2016 Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and remember the life of Guy Preston Richardson Sr. of Danville, Kentucky, who passed away on Friday, December 11, 2015. Guy was a World War II veteran, serving in the U.S. Army from 1944–1946. He earned his paratrooper wings, and served in the 11th Air-borne that fought in the Battle of Mount Macolod and liberated the Philippines. Guy was awarded the Bronze Star and was part of the honor guard to witness the return of Gen-eral Douglas MacArthur. After serving with the occupation forces in Japan for a year, he returned to Danville, Ken-tucky, in 1946 to attend Centre College on the G.I. Bill. It was there that he met the love of his life, Sue Swan. Following graduation, Guy went into his family’s grocery business, which he successfully managed for more than 50 years. Mr. Richardson was an active member of the First Presbyterian Church of Danville for more than 60 years, serving as a Stephen Minister, Sunday school superintendent, dea-con, elder, and trustee. He was a former president of the Rotary Club of Danville when, as a survivor of polio, he led the effort to raise local money to eradicate polio. He was also a former president of the Boyle County Chamber of Commerce, and served on the boards of the Boyle County Library, Ephraim McDowell Hospital and Central Kentucky Federal Sav-ings Bank. A lifelong, passionate student of politics and policy, Guy was the model of an engaged cit-izen. He managed numerous campaigns for State Representative Joe Clarke over the course of 20 years. He was a leader in the local civil rights movement to integrate the Danville schools, and was part of Dr. Martin Luther King’s 1964 march in Frankfort, KY. He is survived by his wife of 66 years, Sue, their four children, and many grandchildren. True to his abiding faith, Guy Richardson sought justice and was dedicated to his com-munity in Boyle County and the Common-wealth of Kentucky. f 
HONORING MRS. LORI PAULSON OF LAS CRUCES, NEW MEXICO

OF NEW MEXICO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 1, 2016 Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor an outstanding citizen in the great State of New Mexico, Mrs. Lori Paulson. Lori, despite being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2013, has dedicated the last two years to the betterment of her com-munity, and beloved New Mexico State Uni-versity. She is undoubtedly an inspiration and role model to all she meets. In the last two years, Lori has become more than a friend or mentor to the NMSU football team, she has become family. During both the 2014 and 2015 football sea-son, Lori served as the Aggies’ honorary cap-tain—attending practices and events with the team, even participating in the opening coin tosses during every home game. Throughout her time with the team, Lori has helped players through injury and personal tragedy. Recently, Lori took another step to help the school and team she loves—she gift-ed $100,000 to the football program in the cre-ation of the Lori Paulson Football Excellence Fund. When asked about the donation, Lori simply stated—‘‘It’s just me confirming what I have always said, which is that I believe in them.’’ Lori is an exemplary Aggie. We can all learn from her selfless dedication and courage. As a fellow Aggie and New Mexican, it is an honor to rise and recognize Lori’s commitment to her community and alma mater.

HONORING THE WOMEN WHO SERVED DURING WORLD WAR II FOR THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMER-ICA 
HON. CANDICE S. MILLER 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 1, 2016 Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I along with Representative D
INGELL would like to recognize an incredible group of women today. On May 29, 1943, in the midst of war, a new image appeared on the cover of the Saturday Evening Post. Created by Norman Rockwell, it was an image of a woman who was strong and brave. The image acted as an introduction to heroes the American people had already come to know. These heroes, known as Rosie the Riveters, have been so-lidified in our national memory as champions. Initially, there was uncertainty as to whether or not women should be allowed to work in in-dustries and fill positions that were previously only occupied by men. However, as the war moved on, women began to fill positions in the workplace and keep American industry, and the war effort, afloat. Slogans such as ‘‘The More Women at Work the Sooner We Win’’ were sprawled across newspapers and maga-zines and appealed to women’s patriotism and willingness to serve. As a part of Women’s History Month, on March 22nd, we will welcome a group of ‘‘Original Rosies’’ to the United States Capitol to celebrate their tremendous contributions to our nation. To these women we say: through your serv-ice during the Second World War, you played an invaluable role in the war effort and victory as a part of the Greatest American Genera-tion. Your rigorous work and passionate love of our great country are arguably what sus-tained the American people, at home and abroad, during a volatile time of war and un-certainty. You made great personal sacrifices and served with such infectious zeal that you were able to reinvigorate the war effort and in-spire, encourage, and support your commu-nities. Since your time serving during the War, the number of working women in the United States has never fallen to pre-war levels; this is one of countless examples of your legacy. Your generation paved a path for the genera-tions of women to follow. We are grateful for the work you have done. We honor you and recognize your work as a symbol of American strength and ingenuity. Rosie’s story inspires us. You inspire us, and we will continue to tell your stories to our chil-dren and grandchildren to ensure the Amer-ican spirit, which you embody, never leaves our hearts. Your spirit is a reminder to the American people that we, too, can do some-thing more for our country.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a man commonly referred to as the ‘‘Mayor of Riverdale,’’ Mr. Irving Ladimer, a staple of the northwest Bronx community and a dear friend. Irving turned 100 years old on February 16, 2016, and I am so grateful to be able to help celebrate his reaching that re-markable milestone by honoring him in the hallowed halls of Congress. Irving has contributed a great deal to the Riverdale neighborhood, both professionally and through his work in various community groups. As an attorney specializing in health care issues, Irving’s compassion for his fellow man was always evident. Incredibly, Irving maintains his distinguished law career to this day, and still travels into his law firm’s office in Manhattan every week to work. Irving’s legal expertise has also been put to work as a law professor at institutions such as Yale, Columbia, and New York University, where he taught on a wide array of topics from patient safety, rights for the elderly, ethics, and nutri-tion. Irving has also dedicated a great deal of time to the community. As a trustee at his syn-agogue, he has volunteered to help the aging and still offers his legal expertise to those in need. Irving also generously gives his time to the Catholic Health Services Center and has teamed up with local officials to reach out to schools and community centers to offer civics lessons about the constitution and govern-ment. It has always been important to Irving for his fellow community members to be more civic-minded, and as a member of the Ben Franklin Reform Democratic Club he has made huge strides in advocating for that type of civic engagement. Without question, Irving has been an influ-ential member of the community. He is the most spry 100 year old I’ve ever met, and I wish him nothing but the best and thank him for all he’s done for the Bronx.

BORDALLO 
OF GUAM  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 1, 2016 Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, today I intro-duce a bill to provide relief for Mr. Myong Mok Bae and Mrs. Kei Za Ryu Bae. Mr. and Mrs. Bae are eighteen-year residents of Guam, who currently face removal by the Department of Homeland Security Immigration and Cus-toms Enforcement (ICE). The Baes came to the United States in June 1997 as immigrant entrepreneurs. Although unforeseen natural disasters and economic hardships hampered the success of their in-vestment, the Baes remained active members of the Guam community. They continue to serve as goodstanding members of the com-munity who have no criminal history and pose no risk to public safety or national security. Removal of the Baes would cause them to suffer extreme hardship. The Baes arrived in Guam from Korea, a country which they have now not seen in 15 years. They are an elderly couple with no family or community in Korea, and with no means of gainful employment at this stage in their lives. This bill would provide the Baes relief from this extreme hardship by establishing their eli-gibility, under the Immigration and Naturaliza-tion Act, for either an immigrant visa, or an ad-justment of status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or an ad-justment of status to that of a lawful perma-nent resident. The bill provides a timeline of two years to allow the Baes to file, and pay the applicable fees, for the appropriate status. Finally, the bill reduces by two, the total num-ber of immigrant visas that are made available to those whose country of origin is Korea. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to advance this leg-islation to relieve the Baes from the extreme hardship that would result from their removal, and to allow them to remain in the United States—the place they have lived for nearly two decades and the place they call their home.

Westchester Jewish community and plays a key role in fostering relationships with organi-zations, law enforcement, and community leaders, both inside the Jewish community and the community at large. Additionally, their work involves interfaith initiatives and events aimed at communicating and coordinating services and programs for the Jewish commu-nity. Furthermore, the Westchester Jewish Council provides meaningful opportunities to engage in volunteer work throughout the com-munity. The Westchester Jewish Council also spon-sors various educational roundtables which foster Israel advocacy and Jewish education, initiatives that are paramount to the organiza-tion’s mission. The Westchester Jewish Coun-cil works together with 150 other organizations to help facilitate Westchester Jewish traditions and culture by supporting and hosts various community-wide events aimed at celebrating Jewish history and heritage. The wide variety of services they offer are meaningful, indis-pensable, and cultivate the important traditions of the community. On February 6th, 2016 the Westchester Jewish Council will be celebrating their 40th Anniversary Gala. I want to congratulate the entire organization on the occasion, and thank them for the invaluable work they have done for the entire Westchester community.

HONORING THE 90TH BIRTHDAY OF MRS. ROSE BAENKE 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 1, 2016 Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, Mrs. Rose Baenke was born on February 24, 1926, in Chicago, Illinois. At an early age, she devel-oped a passion for politics. When she turned 18, she voted in her first election and has taken pride in the honor and privilege of voting ever since. In 1992, Mrs. Baenke and her husband moved to the community of Nesbit, Mis-sissippi. She became involved in the local po-litical scene and was a charter member of the Desoto County Republican Women, a group in which she remains an active member. At age 90, she participates in the club’s events and dedicates her time and effort to the group’s mission. Mrs. Baenke has been politically involved at the state level as well. She says that her crowning achievement was assisting Governor Phil Bryant’s successful campaign to be Mis-sissippi’s 64th Governor. She has served in leadership positions with the DeSoto County Republican Women, which has enabled her to become an effective voice in the Republican Party. As an active citizen, she also served two terms on the Mississippi River Commis-sion. Currently, Mrs. Baenke resides at Wesley Meadows Retirement Community in Hernando, Mississippi, where she works tirelessly to urge other residents to remain engaged and in-formed on political issues. Specifically, she asks other residents to exercise their right, which was earned at a very high price, to vote. I would like to wish Mrs. Baenke a Happy 90th Birthday and extend my deepest appre-ciation for her passion and dedication to her country and state. f

HON. PAUL COOK 
OF CALIFORNIA

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-ognize San Bernardino County Sheriff’s De-partment Captain Gregg Wielenga, who was recently promoted to the position of Captain for the Hesperia, California Sheriff’s station. Captain Wielenga is a twenty-five year veteran of law enforcement and has served with the department since 1990. Over the course of his distinguished career, Captain Wielenga has served the citizens of San Bernardino County in a variety of ways. His assignments have included Patrol Deputy in Needles, Detective in the Victor Valley, and Sergeant at the county’s jail facilities. Prior to Captain Wielenga’s recent promotion he served as the Lieutenant at the Hesperia sta-tion. I would like to congratulate Captain Wielenga on his new position. He exemplifies the professionalism of the men and women of the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Depart-ment. I am honored to have him serving the people of Hesperia and wish him the best of luck.

WOMEN IN CONSTRUCTION WEEK 
HON. LAMAR SMITH 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 1, 2016 Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, March 6th marks the beginning of Women in Con-struction Week. The National Association of Women in Construction (NAWIC) takes this week to highlight women in the construction industry. Chapter 11 of NAWIC is located in San Antonio, which I represent. This week al-lows thousands of NAWIC members across the country to raise awareness of the opportu-nities available to women in the construction industry and emphasize the growing role of women in the industry. In sincere appreciation, Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing this week as Women in Construction Week. HONORING DAVID FORD HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 1, 2016 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a good friend and trusted employee, David Ford, who today is being honored by the Black Dems of Westchester for 50 years of incredible service to the community. David has been a resident of Mt. Vernon for 53 years and an active member in the com-munity his entire adult life. He has pursued his two great passions—community service and politics—with great vigor and has accom-plished a great deal in both fields over a long and impressive career. First elected Chairman of the Mt. Vernon Democratic Party in 1969, David inherited a club in a rock bed of Republican politics. For the next 27 years he served as Chairman and oversaw a complete political switch in the area. When he left the position in 1996, every elected official in Mt. Vernon was a Democrat, whereas none were in 1969. David has also made his mark in the com-munity through engagement with various civic organizations and as Commissioner of the Mt. Vernon Water Department, a role he served in for 33 years until his retirement in 2009. He has been President of the Mt. Vernon Lions Club, the Mt. Vernon YMCA, and the Citizens Veterans Association. As Board Chairman of the Mt. Vernon Neighborhood Health Center for 30 years, David was instrumental in turning a small program with 19 employees into one of the largest Health Care Centers in the re-gion, employing over 400 people serving 40,000 patients annually. It is no wonder then why David has received countless honors in the community, including the Torch Liberty Award from the Anti-Defamation League and the ‘‘Citizen of the Year’’ Award from the YMCA. But for all of his accomplishments in the community, I will always value David’s incred-ible hard work as one of my most trusted and talented special assistants, a role he still serves in to this day. I congratulate David on this well-deserved and wonderful recognition from the Black Dems of Westchester, and thank him personally for all he has done to better the Mt. Vernon community. I am proud of David for all of his hard work, but I am even more proud to call him a friend.

HONORING STEVEN AND KATH-ERINE DIEBERT AS THEY CELE-BRATE 50 YEARS OF MARRIAGE 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, March 1, 2016 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Steven and Katherine Diebert on the celebration of their 50th wedding anniver-sary.

Hopalong Cassidy’s cowboy sidekicks at a Fresno department store called Coopers. Katherine’s mother brought her to meet Hopalong Cassidy on that day, and little did she know that the boy by Hoppy’s side would one day be her husband and that they would raise two beautiful daughters together. In December of 1965, Steven proposed to Katherine and they were joined in marriage on February 26, 1966 at the First Baptist Church in Fresno. Despite many opportunities to leave the Central Valley over the last 50 years, they chose to remain in Fresno and raised their family here. The highlight of their marriage have been their two daughters, Stephanie (along with her husband, Kenneth) and Me-lissa (along with her husband, Layne), who have blessed them with five grandchildren, Leo Stephen, Ari Benjamin, Kaitlin Jade, Ella Rose, and Harrison Steven. Steven Diebert was born on July 10, 1943 in Fresno, California to parents of Volga Ger-man descent, who were also born and raised in the San Joaquin Valley. Steven was a high-ly regarded football player at Roosevelt High School, where he proudly graduated from in 1961. Following high school, Steven attended Fresno State University where he graduated with a degree in Political Economy in 1966. Upon receiving his bachelor’s degree, Steven went on to work for the Xerox Corporation where he worked for two years. In 1968, he returned to Fresno State to continue his edu-cation and received a graduate degree to be-come a Certified Public Accountant. Following graduate school, he worked for the national accounting firm Touche Ross and in 1975, he was appointed by then California Controller, Ken Cory, to serve as a California Probate Referee. Steven is regarded as one of the fin-est probate referees in California and has carefully developed a reputation as a straight shooter and as a man of great integrity. Katherine Diebert was born on November 6, 1944 in Fresno, California. Her parents were of Armenian, English and Irish decent and lived the majority of their lives in Fresno. Kath-erine graduated from Roosevelt High School in 1962 and went on to attend Fresno City College. In 1964, she began working in the medical administration and billing department at Fresno Medical Group. Katherine continued to work at Fresno Medical Group until she and Steven were blessed with their first daughter, Stephanie in 1971. Upon the birth of their sec-ond daughter, Melissa in 1975, Katherine de-cided to take some time off of work to raise her children. In 1977 Katherine returned to work for Internal Medicine and Associates where she worked until her retirement in 2008. While, building a beautiful family and success-ful career, Katherine has maintained a beau-tiful home and has continued to keep a metic-ulous and stunning garden. Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratu-lating Steven and Katherine Diebert on their fifty years of marriage and may they be blessed with many more. They serve as a prime example to us all of what it means to be committed to strong family values. PERSONAL EXPLANATION
