PRAYER Reverend Gary Studniewski, St. Peter’s Catholic Church, Washington, D.C., offered the following prayer: Heavenly Father, we praise You, we thank You—You, who not only govern human affairs, but who extend infinite compassion to the human family. We remember the mercy You have often granted to the sons and daughters of the United States of America, and we acknowledge how dependent we are on that mercy. We ask for Your mercy once again as You look upon so many who suffer in our land, devastated by storms of life, some natural and others of human origin. Lord, may Your saving hand be ex-tended through people of goodwill across America, and may that goodwill begin here in the Chambers of this House, that our elected officials be filled with wisdom and compassion and work together to provide care and gov-ernance for all Your sons and daugh-ters. Bless all who work and assemble in this House, and bless this session with Your Spirit, that it may result in much good fruit and lasting peace. Amen.

HONORING FIRST SELECTMAN PATRICIA MECHARE 
HON. ELIZABETH H. ESTY 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 21, 2017 Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor First Selectman Patricia Mechare, a tireless public servant for the town of Falls Village, Connecticut. First Selectman Mechare is retiring after 12 years as First Se-lectman, but her service to the town will con-tinue, and her contributions to the community will be felt for years to come. Pat comes from a long line of public service Her father, Rolland, served on the Boards of Finance, Education, and Selectmen for the Town of Canaan. Pat followed his example and began her career in public service, joining Falls Village’s Planning and Zoning Commis-sion in 1977. As a public school teacher and a member of numerous town departments, in-cluding the Board of Education and the Day Care Building Committee, Pat quickly made her mark on the community. In 2005, Pat was elected First Selectman of Falls Village. Her commitment to the role led to substantial community development for one of Connecticut’s smallest towns. By working with all levels of government, Pat was a strong advocate for Falls Village, securing public grants to develop Main Street and kick start public works throughout the town. Even in her retirement, Pat plans to remain heavily in-volved in her community. Mr. Speaker, First Selectman Pat Mechare is an exemplary role model for our community and for public servants everywhere. Falls Vil-lage and the entire State of Connecticut are better places because of her efforts. There-fore, it is fitting and proper that we honor her here today.

Upon receiving his Black Belt, Master Thanh became a Judo instructor and continued his training to become a Master. During this time, he became the Finance Commissioner for the ‘‘Vietnam Judo Association’’ and joined the Republic of Vietnam Air Force. Master Thanh was invited to instruct Judo at various places including Ngo Quyen training center, Tinh Nghiem Temple, and Bien Hoa Orphanage. His great talents granted him the opportunity to become the committee member for Mekong Judo Competition—a competition which was organized in Saigon, Vietnam and had eleven countries worldwide participate. When Master Ha Huyen Thanh came to the United States, he became a journalist and worked for various broadcasting stations in Or-ange County, California. In 1993, Master Ha Huyen Thanh’s contin-uous passion for martial arts urged him to es-tablish the General Association for the Devel-opment of World Martial Arts. The association has been hosting the World Martial Arts fes-tival every two years to gather over 500 mar-tial arts Masters, instructors, and students to showcase various types of martial arts. The association has also made great efforts to help their members open more training cen-ters. Master Thanh is currently the General Secretary for the Association. On September 1, 2017, Master Thanh passed away, but his dedication to preserve and promote martial arts, and his impact on the Vietnamese martial arts community will re-main a legacy. f 
RECOGNIZING DR. ANTHONY LOCKHART, FLORIDA’S 2017 PRIN-CIPAL OF THE YEAR 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 21, 2017 Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Anthony Lockhart, Principal at Lake Shore Middle School and Florida’s 2017 Principal of the Year. Mr. Lockhart has shown outstanding merit and dedication to his profes-sion. He has been a source of inspiration and courage for hundreds of students for more than 20 years with the Palm Beach County School District. He has gained well-earned ac-colades for his ability to connect with his stu-dents and has gone above and beyond his call of duty to improve the performance of a struggling school. Dr. Lockhart was named the Legacy Magazine 2015 Top High School Edu-cators of the Year and was also named one of the top 50 most influential black profes-sionals. After graduating from Jackson State Univer-sity, Dr. Lockhart worked as a counselor to young people—it is this critically important work that would eventually lead him to be-come a school guidance counselor and work his way up to principal. Dr. Lockhart believes that education is the great equalizer—that no matter what socioeconomic or racial back-ground an individual comes from, they can ac-complish anything if they obtain an education. Lake Shore Middle School faced many chal-lenges when Dr. Lockhart became Principal. Not shy about rolling up his sleeves and get-ting to work, he started interviewing teachers and community members to ascertain what needed to be done to make the school as suc-cessful as he knew it could be. Dr. Lockhart, armed with this information, then worked with teachers and community members alike to change the school culture. This diligent work resulted in the school going from being graded at a F– to a C rated school and being recog-nized by Florida Governor Rick Scott for being in the top ten percent of middle schools in five categories. Dr. Lockhart has no doubt that this achievement could not have been possible without the efforts from a supportive commu-nity, a focused group of educators, and a dedicated administrative staff. Instead of see-ing students that embraced a failing attitude, he saw children that had not been given an opportunity to succeed; he saw teachers that needed encouragement, training and support; and a community that could be convinced that success was possible. Mr. Speaker, as we recognize and honor Dr. Anthony Lockhart today for his accomplish-ments and his dedication, may we also recog-nize the hope and light educators like Dr. Lockhart bring to the future of this country. f 
HONORING CHARLIE MAE DAVIS 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 21, 2017 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an extraordinary mother, grandmother, activist, and public servant, Charlie Mae Davis. With her passing on September 9, 2017 the East Bay lost a champion for justice, and many of us lost a life-long friend. Charlie Mae was a Texas transplant to Cali-fornia. She was born in Rockdale, and grad-uated from high school in Waco. In 1950, she moved to California where she met her future husband, Arthur Lee Davis. Charlie Mae and Arthur Lee were married in 1964, and raised a wonderful family together. During this period when she was raising her family, Charlie Mae was very active in her community, and eventually went to work at Brookfield Elementary, where she would later retire after working as an assistant to the prin-cipal. Charlie Mae gave selflessly of her time to help improve her community, and was pas-sionate about improving the lives of her neigh-bors in Oakland. In 1992, she, along with a core group of activists, worked to establish the Martin Luther King, Jr. March and Rally, which is the longest continuously held celebration in Oakland to honor the life and legacy of Dr. King. I was grateful to participate in this past year’s Oakland MLK Day rally, marking the event’s 25th anniversary. This wonderful event’s continuation for future generations is a great legacy for Charlie Mae.

Charlie Mae was also instrumental in the establishment of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Freedom Center in Oakland, an organization that I helped found and am particularly proud of. In the mid-1990’s, we had this idea to cre-ate a leadership academy for students, in-spired by the teachings of Dr. King. I was in the state legislature in California at the time, and I proposed a bill to establish a memorandum of understanding between the City of Oakland, the East Bay Park District and several other local agencies in order to provide the resources for the MLK Freedom Center to exist. Charlie Mae, who was one of the principal founders of the center, helped or-ganize busloads of my constituents from Oak-land up to Sacramento to testify on the impor-tance of the project, and why the bill was so important. That effort was essential to the passage of the bill and the formal creation of the center, which now has taught hundreds of young peo-ple from the East Bay about leadership, con-flict resolution, violence prevention and civic engagement and is really helping to create the next generation of social activist leaders. On a personal note, I was proud to call Charlie Mae my friend for decades, and am in-debted to her for her leadership in empow-ering Oakland residents to work together to create a better city and world for themselves, their neighbors, and future generations. It was such an honor this past May to present Char-lie Mae with the first Mildred Parish Massey Legacy Award, named after my late mother. It was a happy moment for Charlie Mae, and in-spiring for me to know that I had the chance to say thank you to her for her service, her friendship, her leadership and her love. Today, California’s 13th Congressional Dis-trict honors Charlie Mae Davis’ memory, and her lifetime of service working on behalf of so-cial justice and equality. I join her loved ones in celebrating her incredible life with a promise to honor her tremendous legacy.

HONORING STEVE M CKERNAN 
HON. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM 
OF NEW MEXICO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 21, 2017 Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great honor to recognize Steve McKernan, Chief Ex-ecutive Officer of University of New Mexico Hospitals, as he prepares for his retirement after 37 years of service to the people of Bernalillo County and the State of New Mex-ico. In 1980, Mr McKernan began his career at the University of New Mexico Hospital. Mr. McKernan began as a staff accountant and worked his way up through the organization, becoming CEO in 1996. During his 21 years as CEO, Mr. McKernan was an integral part of a team relentlessly focused on improving the care of the people of New Mexico. Thanks to Mr McKernan’s vision and leader-ship, UNM Hospitals provide the level and specialties of care that are only available in the largest teaching hospitals in the country. During Mr. McKernan’s tenure, the Barbara and Bill Richardson Pavilion opened in 2008 and a network of community-based clinics was established, providing healthcare throughout the City of Albuquerque. In addition to his achievements in growing the mission and reach of UNM Hospitals, Mr. McKernan has gained national prominence in the hospital community, serving on the Board of the America’s Essential Hospitals. He has also been involved in a variety of local com-munity and business groups, including the Ro-tary Club, the New Mexico Hospital Associa-tion and the Boy Scouts of America. It is with great honor and privilege that I take this moment to thank Steve for his serv-ice and commitment to our community, the lives of New Mexicans are forever changed because of his work. I wish him and his wife Becky an enjoyable and well-deserved retire-ment. f 
RECOGNIZING PETER HARVELL 
HON. KATHERINE M. CLARK 
OF MASSACHUSETTS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 21, 2017 Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, today, I recognize Peter Harvell, who will retire as Director of Veterans Benefits and Services of Framingham, Massachusetts on September 28, 2017. Peter’s lifetime of service shows us how one person’s undeterrable mission to help others can positively impact his broader com-munity. Peter has dedicated the past 13 years to helping veterans by connecting them with state and federal benefits, partnering with community organizations, and ensuring the stability and growth of their mental and finan-cial health. Peter has been one of our veterans’ strong-est advocates in the towns of Sudbury and Framingham. He partnered with local food banks, jail diversion task forces, and legal aid services to help veterans and service mem-bers who fell on hard times. He worked with the VFW, the American Legion, and local Na-tional Guard units to host welcome home ceremonies. He paid our veterans their due respect on national holidays. Above all, Peter maintains relationships and provides support to our Gold Star families. Prior to his service to the towns of Sudbury and Framingham, Peter spent 23 years in the U.S. Army serving in the U.S. Special Oper-ations Command. After preparing OPER-ATION EAGER ANVIL in DESERT STORM and coordinating NATO missions in Bosnia, he returned home to continue service as a con-gressional liaison at USSOCOM for two years. Peter’s dedication and leadership honor our Commonwealth and our country. We thank him for his years of service and wish him a happy and successful retirement.

CELEBRATING EL AVISO MAGAZINE’S 30TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 21, 2017 Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I rise to salute El Aviso Magazine, an award-winning Spanish-language weekly publication based in my 40th Congressional District, as it begins its 30th anniversary celebration. Since its establishment in 1988, El Aviso Magazine has focused its reporting on local areas with the highest populations of Latinos. The publication offers a unique blend of topics ranging from social and political, to health and welfare, to family, culture, and entertainment. At its inception, El Aviso Magazine shared an office with a travel agency in the City of Huntington Park, and only had two employees and five distributors. At that time, the maga-zine’s weekly circulation reached an audience of 70,000, and its method of distribution was door-to-door. Today, an average issue reaches an audience of more than 600,000, and it can be found at over 10,000 points of distribution in 136 cities and neighborhoods in the greater Los Angeles area, Orange County, the San Fernando Valley, and the Inland Em-pire. El Aviso Magazine has received countless awards from the National Association of His-panic Publications, and has also received na-tional recognition for its editorial content and covers. In 2004, it received an award for being the fastest-growing publication in the United States. At the 2014 National Association of Hispanic Publications Convention, El Aviso Magazine received the Gold Award for the Most Outstanding Newsprint Magazine. Over the past 30 years, Jessica Maes Zepeda and Jose Ramiro Zepeda, along with their family, have operated this family-owned magazine. Mr. Zepeda was born in Mexico, and immigrated to the United States in the mid-1980s in search of the American Dream. As he was searching for the right business, he witnessed the passage and implementation of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. Mr. Zepeda saw the need to inform the Spanish-speaking community in a language they could read and understand. This led him to produce a Spanish publication that would serve the Latino community across Southern California—El Aviso Magazine. Mr. Zepeda has worked diligently for the past three dec-ades and has made El Aviso Magazine a suc-cess story. Mrs. Zepeda, the magazine’s co-owner and its director of public relations and community affairs, was raised in Southeast Los Angeles, where she attended local parochial schools and decided to pursue a career in real estate. In the early 1980s, she joined the Downey Board of Realtors and served as vice presi-dent. She then became the president of the Women’s Council of Realtors, and the director of the California Association of Realtors. In 1994, Mrs. Zepeda became politically ac-tive and was elected to the Huntington Park City Council. Through her accomplishments, she became the first woman to hold the posi-tion of Mayor for the City of Huntington Park three years later. Mrs. Zepeda has received numerous acco-lades for her community service from elected officials in the State of California and Con-gress, and from non-profit organizations. The California Chamber of Commerce recently rec-ognized Mrs. Zepeda with the 2017 Pioneer Empresaria Award. Mr. and Mrs. Zepeda believe in assisting the less fortunate and those in need. Their dedica-tion to the community and their philanthropic activities are reflected through El Aviso Maga-zine’s involvement with various non-profits, in-cluding the YMCA, Salvation Army, Boys & Girls Club of America, Human Services Asso-ciation, Southeast Relay for Life, faith-based groups, and local schools.

For the past ten years, the magazine has published a special edition bilingual magazine dedicated to the fight against cancer, titled ‘‘El Aviso Relay for Life.’’ In addition, through hard work, perseverance, and dedication to the communities it serves, the magazine has raised more than $120,000 for the American Cancer Society’s Southeast Cities Relay for Life over the past ten years. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to please join me in sending best wishes and congratu-lations to Jose Zepeda, Jessica Maes Zepeda, and their El Aviso Magazine team on the cele-bration of their 30th anniversary. They have played a vital role in informing Latino commu-nities across Southern California over the past 30 years.

INTRODUCTION OF THE SUSTAIN-ABLE FARMLAND FOR THE FU-TURE ACT 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 21, 2017 Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, the Farm Bill is one of the most important bills that most Americans have never heard of. It impacts our economy, environment, and what we eat. It is important that Congress gets the upcoming re-authorization right. Today, I am introducing the Sustainable Farmland for the Future Act. This bill builds upon the progress we made in the 2014 Farm Bill to promote the long-term sustainability of farmland and better protect the environment. In 1985, Congress enacted conservation compliance in the Farm Bill, codifying the compact between taxpayers, farmers, and landowners to provide stability through sub-sidies in return for responsible stewardship of farmland and the surrounding environment. The 1985 Farm Bill simply required most farm subsidy recipients to implement basic con-servation practices on vulnerable farmland and wetlands. The 2014 Farm Bill improved this measure by expanding the conservation com-pact to recipients of crop insurance premium subsidies. While the USDA has found that the current conservation compact has successfully reduced runoff and soil erosion, Congress must do more. The Sustainable Farmland for the Future Act would strengthen the conservation com-pact by requiring farmers who receive tax-payer assistance to abide by basic, common- sense conservation standards on all of their land, not just ‘‘highly erodible land’’ and con-verted wetland. By complying with these ex-panded standards and acting as good stew-ards, farmers will be honoring the commitment made to the taxpayers who provide for their farm subsidies. I believe that the Sustainable Farmland for the Future Act is one of the 115th Congress’s most important pieces of environmental legis-lation and should be considered for inclusion in the 2018 Farm Bill. IN RECOGNITION OF BARBARA NIESS-MAY FOR 15 YEARS OF EXEMPLARY SERVICE AT SAFEHOUSE CENTER HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 21, 2017 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Barbara Niess-May for her 15 years of service at SafeHouse Center in Washtenaw County. As Executive Director of SafeHouse Center, Mrs. Niess-May’s leadership and ex-pertise have impacted countless lives and greatly enhanced the Center’s programming capabilities. SafeHouse Center first opened its doors in 1978 with the hope of providing leadership and support for survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence in Washtenaw County. The organization’s founding mission has en-dured throughout the years, and SafeHouse has been able to expand its services through popular public support and a 1992 millage that funded a new facility with increased boarding capacity. Today, due to the Center’s new loca-tion, over 5,500 women and children are served out of the shelter every year. Since joining SafeHouse as Executive Di-rector in 2002, Mrs. Niess-May has overseen the agency’s daily operations and is critical to the continued growth and success of the orga-nization. She has advocated for survivors and implemented programs to help both women and children get back on their feet by finding safe and affordable housing, employment, and childcare. Successful SafeHouse programs in-clude a children’s playroom, Teen Voice Peer Education at local schools, and four different onsite support groups. Additionally, Mrs. Niess-May works as an adjunct faculty mem-ber at Eastern Michigan University’s School of Social Work and Graduate School of Crimi-nology, bringing her real world experience to the classroom and educating the next genera-tion of social workers. She has saved many lives, been a shelter for those desperate for a hand, and is a leader in changing the dialogue on domestic abuse. It is my hope that Mrs. Niess-May continues to advocate on behalf of domestic violence survivors and build on her lifetime of distinguished work supporting women and children. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Barbara Niess-May for 15 years of outstanding service at SafeHouse Center. Her tenure at SafeHouse has greatly contributed to the organization’s ability to provide important services and support to women in need.

RECOGNIZING HAZEL THOMPSON 
HON. TOM REED 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 21, 2017 Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-ognize a constituent, Hazel Thompson, who is celebrating her 100th birthday this month. Ms. Thompson has spent her life serving our country and local community. Born and raised in Vermont, she has dedicated her life to helping and advocating for others. She started her career as a nurse and devoted thousands of hours volunteering with the Red Cross where she received several awards for her selfless service. In 1972, after our area was devastated by flooding from Hurricane Agnes, Ms. Thompson once again answered the call and devoted her time to helping her community and neighbors in Elmira, New York. Ms. Thompson has been a member of the Ladies Auxiliary at the American Legion Post 443 in Elmira, New York for seventy years. She is a true patriot and has volunteered at other veterans’ organizations. Ms. Thompson has been a member of the AARP for decades and has served as a Board Member for Chap-ter 246 and as editor for its Spotlight news-letter for years. She has also volunteered with the Girl Scouts, Food Bank and at West-minster Presbyterian Church of which she is a member. Ms. Thompson has been a recipient of sev-eral honors and awards in recognition of her generous spirit and endless dedication to help-ing others. As the team captain for the AARP’s annual Alzheimer’s Walk team, she was awarded the Grand Champion medal in honor of her fundraising. She was awarded the Chemung County Senior Citizen of the Year in 1988, and in 2010, Ms. Thompson was awarded the prestigious Jefferson Award in recognition for her lifelong commitment to community service. She is truly an inspiration to us all. I ask my colleagues to join me in cele-brating Hazel Thompson’s 100th birthday and recognizing her life-long commitment to serv-ice. f 
HONORING BETTY OLDS 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 21, 2017 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the remarkable life of Betty Olds. She passion-ately served on the Berkeley City Council for 16 years and advocated for the environment, women, and animal rights until her passing at the age of 96 on July 16, 2017. Ms. Olds was born Betty Marion Milne in St. Joseph, Missouri on October 19, 1920, and grew up in Holt County. She attended Iowa State University, where she graduated in 1942 with a degree in Home Economics and met her future husband, Walter Olds. Together they had three children. In 1950, Ms. Olds and her family moved to the Bay Area. While her husband was away in Okinawa for several years, Ms. Olds planted her roots in the city of Berkeley to raise her family, and became a substitute teacher at Garfield Middle School. She eventually be-came the Dean of Students at Willard Middle School, and was instrumental in evacuating the school and ensuring student safety when UC Berkeley protestors were tear-gassed in the Bloody Thursday riot of 1969. After committing her time to several city commissions, Ms. Olds was elected to the Berkeley City Council in 1992 where she made an immediate impact in the creation of a new fire station in the Berkeley Hills, fol-lowing the devastating Oakland Hills fire of 1991. Ms. Olds was also a founding member of Save the Bay, a group that fights to protect

and restore the environment of the San Fran-cisco Bay. In 2007, Ms. Olds made national news when she protested the destruction of a grove of oak trees to construct a sports training facil-ity next to UC Berkeley’s Memorial Stadium. Although she was 87 years old, Ms. Olds, along with former Mayor Shirley Dean and Save the Bay founder Sylvia McLaughlin, climbed into an 80-foot-high tree to prevent it from being cut down. Ms. Olds was known for her humor and live-ly spirit. She often made jokes to her col-leagues that they referred to as ‘‘Bettyisms.’’ She was an outspoken Council member, unafraid to take on opposing views, and was known for her pragmatic approach to local pol-icymaking. Ms. Olds was adored by many and was greeted by a cheering crowd when she walked into the Council Chambers on the day of her retirement in 2008. That same year, Ms. Olds was voted ‘‘Best Politician’’ by East Bay Express readers; and in 2014, a path in the Berkeley hills, con-necting Sterling Avenue and Whitaker Avenue was named in her honor. Today, on behalf of California’s 13th Con-gressional District, it is my honor to commend the life and achievements of Ms. Betty Olds. I offer my sincere gratitude to Ms. Olds for her activism and civic leadership, and for the pro-found legacy she has left in the East Bay community. I also offer my condolences to Ms. Olds’ family and friends as they cope with this immeasurable loss and join together to cele-brate Ms. Olds’ life.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 10TH AN-NUAL OUT OF THE DARKNESS COMMUNITY WALK 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 21, 2017 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, last week-end we recognized National Suicide Preven-tion Week in Northern Virginia. The American Foundation for Suicide Pre-vention National Capital Area chapter hosted their 10th annual signature fundraising event, Out of the Darkness on Saturday, September 16th in Fairfax County, Virginia. Over the past ten years, Out of the Darkness has been vital to the rehabilitation of the human spirit here in Northern Virginia, and has been an integral part of the changing attitude towards suicide prevention and mental health awareness, al-lowing individuals from all backgrounds and stages of grief to come together in support of each other. The success of this year’s walk, bringing together over 860 attendees and rais-ing over $90,000, attests to the meaningful im-pact of this chapter in support of Northern Vir-ginian neighbors and their families. We have lost 1,122 precious lives, perhaps more, due to suicide in the last 12 months in Virginia, including children and veterans. The National Capital Area chapter’s extensive work in providing community resources, including crisis numbers for the Veteran Combat Call Center, Veteran’s Crisis Line, Suicide Preven-tion Line, and a texting option, have im-mensely benefited those who are seeking im-mediate assistance and support. These serv-ices are crucial, and especially helpful to those who are fearful in seeking assistance, and I thank you for all your efforts in supporting these programs. Out of the Darkness was supported by a va-riety of partners in prevention from across Fairfax County that shared resources to peo-ple and their families in various stages of grief, including the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue, Fairfax County Police Department, Fairfax County Sheriff Stacey A. Kincaid and the De-partment, INOVA Fairfax Hospital, Inter-national Association of Fire Chiefs, Virginia Professional Firefighters & Paramedics—IAFF Local 2068, IAFF Financial Corporation, Fair-fax County Employee Advisory Council, Fair-fax County Live Well Program, Interstate Van Lines, Shirley Contracting, 29 Diner Res-taurants, JV’s Restaurant, Austin Grill, Everymind.org, Trevor Project, Divine Ele-ments Healing Home, Virginia Academy of Clinical Psychological Services, Abiding Hope Counseling Services, Yava Yoga, David J. Cobb Foundation, Youth for Tomorrow and many other local community businesses and elected officials. I thank them again for working to support the lives of Fairfax County families as well as those in the surrounding region. I am pleased to represent the National Capital Area chapter of the American Foundation for Suicide Pre-vention and its partners in the 10th District, and I wish them the best as they continue to bring awareness to suicide prevention and be-havioral health. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Virginia’s Tenth Congressional District, I ask that you join me in recognizing the positive impact of the Amer-ican Foundation for Suicide Prevention Na-tional Capital Area chapter Out of the Dark-ness Community Walk these past ten years. f 
HONORING MR. JOE PICARD 
HON. ELIZABETH H. ESTY 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 21, 2017 Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Joe Picard for his serv-ice in the 65th Infantry Regiment, the ‘‘Borinqueneers.’’ The 65th Infantry Regiment was the largest and longest-standing seg-regated Latino military unit in our country’s history, and the Borinqueneers service in the face of discrimination led Congress to award these veterans the well-deserved Congres-sional Gold Medal in 2014. The Borinqueneers trace their history to 1898, when Congress authorized the creation of a military unit in Puerto Rico. For more than a century, members of the 65th Infantry Regi-ment served honorably in our Armed Services, displaying valor and distinction in World War I, World War II, and the Korean War. In fact, the Borinqueneers are credited with firing the first American shots in the First World War after stopping a German supply ship from leaving San Juan Bay in 1915. Throughout both World Wars, the Borinqueneers defended the Panama Canal Zone, and some members of the regiment served in North Africa and Central Europe dur-ing World War II. The regiment became a key force during the Korean War after distin-guishing itself during the Operation PORTREX military exercise. Over 2,700 Borinqueneers earned Purple Hearts during the Korean War, and some Borinqueneers led the last regi-mental bayonet assault in U.S. military history. Despite their honorable service by thou-sands, the Borinqueneers faced segregation and regular discrimination in the Armed Forces. Our country owes these veterans our thanks, and we must remember the story of the Borinqueneers as role models for national service. Mr. Speaker, Joe Picard served our country in the 65th Infantry Regiment during the Ko-rean War despite the danger and discrimina-tion that the Borinqueneers faced. It is there-fore fitting and proper that we honor him here today. f 
RECOGNIZING KEMAL PASAMEH-METOGLU FOR HIS LEADERSHIP AT THE IDAHO NATIONAL LAB-ORATORY 
HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON 
OF IDAHO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 21, 2017 Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Kemal Pasamehmetoglu for his leadership at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL). For the past five and a half years, Dr. Pasamehmetoglu has served as the Associate Laboratory Director for Nuclear Science & Technology at INL. Dr. Pasamehmetoglu has been instrumental in supporting the Department of Energy’s Of-fice of Nuclear Energy in developing the road-map and setting national research and devel-opment priorities. His vision and passion for nuclear energy has been a huge asset to INL, the Office of Nuclear Energy, and the nation. During his tenure, Kemal traveled the globe serving in leadership positions in multi-national collaborative efforts. He enhanced INL’s rep-utation nationally and internationally as a groundbreaking laboratory for nuclear energy research and development. Most recently, Kemal led the national effort to develop the Gateway for Accelerated Inno-vation in Nuclear (GAIN) initiative and served as its first National Director. The GAIN initia-tive provides the nuclear community with ac-cess to the technical, regulatory, and financial support necessary to move innovative nuclear energy technologies toward commercialization while ensuring the continued safe, reliable, and economic operation of the existing nuclear fleet. Kemal has accepted a new position at INL as the Executive Director of the Versatile Fast Neutron Source Research and Development Initiative. A fast reactor would be groundbreaking in providing next generation nuclear fuel testing capabilities. Kemal holds a doctorate in mechanical engi-neering from the University of Central Florida and has more than 30 years of research engi-neering experience within the national labora-tory system.

16TH DISTRICT CONGRESSIONAL FIRE AND RESCUE AND EMS AWARDS 
HON. VERN BUCHANAN 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 21, 2017 Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize fire and rescue and EMS per-sonnel who have provided distinguished serv-ice to the people of Florida’s 16th Congres-sional District. As first responders, fire departments and emergency medical service teams are sum-moned on short notice to serve their respec-tive communities. Oftentimes, they arrive at scenes of great adversity and trauma, to which they reliably bring strength and composure. These brave men and women spend hundreds of hours in training so that they are prepared when they get ‘‘the call.’’ In 2012, I established the 16th District Con-gressional Fire and Rescue and EMS Awards to honor officers, departments, and units for outstanding achievement. On behalf of the people of Florida’s 16th District, it is my privilege to congratulate the following winners, who were selected this year by an independent committee comprised of a cross section of current and retired fire and rescue personnel living in the district. Manatee County Community Paramedicine Program was chosen to receive the Congres-sional Unit Citation Award. Training Officer Christopher Stark of the Hillsborough County Fire Rescue was chosen to receive the Congressional Dedication and Professionalism Award. Chief Dennis Jones of the Hillsborough County Fire Rescue was chosen to receive the Congressional Career Service Award. Division Chief-Fire Marshal Tammy Zurla was chosen to receive the Congressional Dedication and Professionalism Award.

CELEBRATING THE OPENING OF THE INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED MANUFACTURING AT CLINTON COMMUNITY COLLEGE 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 21, 2017 Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate the opening of the Insti-tute for Advanced Manufacturing at Clinton Community College. Clinton Community College serves as a member unit of the State University of New York system (SUNY), which allows students of diverse backgrounds across the state to ac-cess educational programs and services. Since its founding in 1966, Clinton Community College has promoted educational opportuni-ties that enrich minds, strengthen the econ-omy, and improve the quality of life in the North Country. Clinton Community College is approaching completion of a 30,000 square foot state-of- the-art facility for its technology programs, which was made possible by a $12.7 million award through the SUNY 2020 grant program. This new facility will feature flexible teaching and learning spaces, as well as a variety of courses in transportation and manufacturing. These fields play an important role in local economic development, and the addition of this facility will continue Clinton Community College’s legacy of bringing education and op-portunity to the North Country. On behalf of New York’s 21st District, I want to congratulate Clinton Community College on the opening of the Institute for Advanced Man-ufacturing. We are grateful for the College’s commitment to educating our community, and hope that this addition serves it well for many years to come. f 
RECOGNIZING THE USS THE SUL-LIVANS DD–537/DDG–68 ASSOCIA-TION’S 27TH REUNION 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 21, 2017 Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize and welcome the USS The Sullivans DD–537/DDG–68 Associa-tion to my hometown of Buffalo, New York on September 20th, 2017 as they celebrate their 27th reunion at the Buffalo and Erie County Naval and Military Park. On November 13, 1943, following the First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal during the Sec-ond World War, five brothers tragically lost their lives at sea when a Japanese torpedo struck and sunk the USS Juneau while sailing the Solomon Sea. Upon learning that George, Francis, Joseph, Madison, and Albert Sullivan had all perished, President Roosevelt honored their memory by renaming DD–537 in their namesake as USS The Sullivans. Since the Second World War, two ships, DD–537 and DDG–68 have proudly shared the name USS The Sullivans and the motto of ‘‘We Stick Together’’ in order to exemplify the courageous and enduring spirit of the Sullivan brothers. For over 70 years a USS The Sulli-vans has patrolled the world’s waterways, thus preserving the peace and promoting inter-national stability. In the years since it was decommissioned, DD–537 has called the Buffalo and Erie Coun-ty Naval and Military Park home. Located in Buffalo’s Canalside district, USS The Sullivans DD–537 has served as a floating monument to the Sullivan brothers’ enduring legacy as well as to the countless men and women who have served aboard a USS The Sullivans since 1943. Mr. Speaker, it is again with great pride that I welcome the 27th reunion of the USS The Sullivans DD–537/DDG–68 Association to Buf-falo, New York as they celebrate the storied legacy of their vessels in the company of fel-low veterans and current service members.

IN RECOGNITION OF DELAWARE COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE 
HON. PATRICK MEEHAN 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 21, 2017 Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Delaware County Community College on its 50th Anniversary. Since its establishment in 1967, Delaware County Community College has educated thousands of students from southeastern Pennsylvania, giving them the skills they need for good-paying middle-class jobs in the mod-ern economy. The college awards degrees in fields as diverse as accounting, carpentry, computer-aided drafting and nursing—and its distinguished faculty has always provided a first-class education to its students. Mr. Speaker, as Delaware County Commu-nity College celebrates the 50th anniversary of its founding, it’s also celebrating a transition: Dr. Jerry Parker will retire after 40 years of service to the college, including 14 as Presi-dent. He’ll be succeeded by Dr. L. Joy Gates Black, who will be the first woman and the first African-American to lead the college. I congratulate Dr. Gates Black on her ap-pointment, I thank Board Chairman Michael L. Ranck for his service to our community, I wish Dr. Parker the best in his retirement and I hope Delaware County Community College enjoys another prosperous 50 years of edu-cating hardworking Pennsylvanians. f 
RECOGNIZING PROFESSOR BETTY TSAI 
HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 21, 2017 Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize Betty Tsai, a retired Bucks Coun-ty Community College professor who started the Salute to Mothers Scholarship. The schol-arship allocates funds for women who are at-tending Bucks County Community College while raising at least one child. This year is the tenth anniversary of the creation of the Sa-lute to Mothers Scholarship, and it has raised over 120,000 dollars to date. This scholarship is vital to providing mothers with greater career opportunities, and encour-aging women to participate in our workforce. It is only available to mothers who possess a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or better, and are en-rolled in at least six credits for the upcoming semester. I appreciate the philanthropy that recognizes the struggles of balancing family and school, and thank Betty Tsai for her work to that end.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Booz Allen Hamilton Toast-masters Potomac Club, a ten year Arlington, Virginia communications and leadership club, achieving significant success in its club and membership.

speaking club, in which he mentored young members on how to shake hands, answer two to three minute table topics, improve nose to nose communication, practice skills of vocal variety, mitigate use of filler works, use their hands to maintain audience attention, and take constructive recommendations from peers. He also taught the young men how to ‘‘step away from the podium’’ and ‘‘dance your words’’. Today, the Crystal City chapter of the club is a healthy, vibrant community of communica-tors in Virginia’s 8th Congressional District. In a record 4 months, the club grew from near critical to President’s Distinguished, the Toastmasters International’s highest club rank-ing. I salute the Toastmasters Potomac Club for their dedication to living out the values of Toastmasters International’s founder Dr. Ralph Chester Smedley.

IN RECOGNITION OF JOHN C. COUGHLIN ON HIS RETIREMENT FROM A SUCCESSFUL CAREER IN PUBLIC SERVICE 
HON. JOHN K. DELANEY 
OF MARYLAND  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 21, 2017 Mr. DELANEY. Mr. Speaker, I wish to rec-ognize Mr. John C. Coughlin on his retirement after an accomplished career, having served as a federal employee for 28 years. Mr. Coughlin was born and raised in Be-thesda, Maryland. He received his Bachelor of Science Degree from the United States Naval Academy, was commissioned as an Ensign in the U.S. Navy, and served in the Navy’s Avia-tion and Intelligence Office Program as a Command Pilot and Program Manager. After serving his country, Mr. Coughlin joined the Department of Energy in 1989, where he began an impressive career working with the Department’s radiological emergency re-sponse assets. He served in various pres-tigious capacities, including the Director of the Office of Emergency Operations and Re-sponse, the Special Assistant to the Office of Self-Assessment and Emergency Manage-ment, the Director of the Threat Assessment Division for the Department’s Programmatic and Nuclear Threat Programs, the first Direc-tor of the Office of Emergency Planning Pre-paredness and Operations here, within the U.S. House of Representatives, and most re-cently, the Assistant Sergeant at Arms for the U.S. House of Representatives. His work over the past 28 years has greatly benefitted our nation’s security and preparedness in the event of an emergency, and we are grateful for all he’s done to ensure the safety and readiness of our country. Mr. Coughlin has had an outstanding career in public service, and I am pleased to recog-nize him both as an upstanding citizen and an exemplary resident of Maryland’s 6th District. I congratulate Mr. Coughlin on a successful and impactful career and wish him all the best during his well-deserved retirement. HONORING LANCE CORPORAL JEDH COLBY BARKER HON. JOSH GOTTHEIMER 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 21, 2017 Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a decorated veteran and a true American hero from New Jersey’s Fifth Dis-trict, Lance Corporal Jedh Colby Barker. Cor-poral Barker grew up in Bergen County in New Jersey, and graduated from Park Ridge High School. In 1967, Corporal Barker was as-signed to Fox Company in the Marine Corps, where he heroically defended his comrades in the line of fire during Operation Kingfisher. Corporal Barker’s actions on this day earned him the most prestigious military decoration, the Congressional Medal of Honor. I am including the Congressional Medal of Honor citation to highlight Corporal Barker’s actions: 
For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as a machine gun-ner with Company F. During a reconnais-sance operation L/Cpl. Barker’s squad was suddenly hit by enemy sniper fire. The squad immediately deployed to a combat formation and advanced to a strongly fortified enemy position, when it was again struck by small arms and automatic weapons fire, sustaining numerous casualties. Although wounded by the initial burst of fire, L/Cpl. Barker boldly remained in the open, delivering a dev-astating volume of accurate fire on the nu-merically superior force. The enemy was in-tent upon annihilating the small marine force and, realizing that L/Cpl. Barker was a threat to their position, directed the prepon-derance of their fire on his position. He was again wounded, this time in the right hand, which prevented him from operating his vi-tally needed machine gun. Suddenly and without warning, an enemy grenade landed in the midst of the few surviving marines. Unhesitatingly and with complete disregard for his personal safety, L/Cpl. Barker threw himself upon the deadly grenade, absorbing with his body the full and tremendous force of the explosion. In a final act of bravery, he crawled to the side of a wounded comrade and administered first aid before succumbing to his grievous wounds. His bold initiative, intrepid fighting spirit and unwavering devo-tion to duty in the face of almost certain death undoubtedly saved his comrades from further injury or possible death and reflected great credit upon himself, the Marine Corps, and the U.S. Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country. 
September 21, 2017 will mark the 50th anni-versary of Corporal Barker’s remarkable patri-otism and valor on the battlefield during the Vietnam War. The Marine Corps motto is, ‘‘Semper Fidelis’’, meaning, ‘‘always faithful’’. Corporal Barker lived and embodied that to the fullest. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Lance Corporal Jedh Colby Barker, a true American hero. His family, the Fifth Dis-trict, and all Americans should be proud of Lance Corporal Jedh Colby Barker. His mem-ory and heroism in the line of duty will never be forgotten.

RECOGNIZING B3CG INTER-CONNECT IN PLATTSBURGH, NEW YORK 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 21, 2017 Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate B3CG Interconnect on the open-ing of their new plant in Plattsburgh, New York. B3CG is a world leader in the manufacturing of cable, harnessing and electrical mechanical assembly. In 2009, the owners of B3CG de-cided to expand their business from its head-quarters in Saint-Eustache, Quebec, and open a second plant in Plattsburgh, New York. This move has allowed B3CG to expand their busi-ness within the United States, contributing greatly to the North Country economy in the process. With B3CG now moving into a new facility in Plattsburgh, we can reflect on all of the company’s important work in the transpor-tation, medical and industrial sectors, as well as their contributions to the upstate commu-nity. By employing state of the art manufac-turing technology and a dedicated local work-force, B3CG has built a strong relationship with the people of New York’s 21st District, one which we are excited to continue. On behalf of New York’s 21st District, I want to thank B3CG Interconnect for its contribu-tions to the North Country and wish it the best of luck in its new location.

RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVER-SARY OF THE SOUTH CENTRAL COMMUNITY ACTION PARTNER-SHIP 
HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON 
OF IDAHO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 21, 2017 Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate South Central Community Action Partnership for making extensive positive im-pacts on the lives of low-income families in South-Central Idaho and on the occasion of their organization’s 50th anniversary. South Central Community Action Partner-ship is a highly valued local, charitable, non- profit corporation in Idaho’s 2nd Congressional District. Although it began in the 1960s to oversee area Head Start programs, in fifty years it has changed thousands of lives. Since 1967, SCCAP has developed impor-tant Idaho programs such as the Family De-velopment and Families in Transition Program, the Valley House Coalition, a Low-Income En-ergy Assistance Program, the Supportive Services for Veteran Families, the Twin Falls- based Weatherization Program, and the Boy’s & Girl’s Club of Magic Valley. Of special note, the Partnership has led efforts to build seniors’ centers in the cites of Twin Falls, Buhl, Burley, Jerome, and Kimberly. In addition, many of SCCAP’s projects have been so successful that they have become independent organizations themselves or even parts of Idaho government programs. These include their Regional Housing Council (now the Region IV Housing Coalition), their Youth Challenge Project (which evolved into the Je-rome Youth Center), their Family Planning Project (which became part of the District Health Department), their summer Migrant Head Start Programs (now the Idaho Migrant Council), and their invaluable Guardian ad Litem Program (now the Fifth Judicial CASA Guardian ad Litem). As a small example of their impact, Mr. Speaker, over the past 5 years alone, SCCAP has assisted an average of more than 6,800 families and represented more than 20,000 in-dividuals, helping with weatherization, veteran services, food, transportation, affordable hous-ing, and many other valuable fields in our Idaho communities. The SCCAP’s hardworking administrators have consistently earned the trust of the peo-ple of Idaho, from Betty L. Wooten’s leader-ship of the organization in 1967, all the way to Ken J. Robinette’s and Joe Herring’s leader-ship today. Mr. Speaker, I sincerely thank South Central Community Action Partnership for their service and commitment to the residents of South- Central Idaho.

HONORING THE 40TH ANNIVER-SARY OF OAKLAND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 21, 2017 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Oakland Community Organizations (OCO) as it celebrates 40 years of organizing the people of Oakland into powerful leaders for social change. Founded on May 14, 1977, OCO has united people across diverse communities in order to create positive and permanent change in Oakland neighborhoods, schools, and throughout the city. After forty years of work, OCO continues to be at the forefront of coalition building and organizing to bring about systemic change and improve the quality of life for all families. Since its founding, OCO has consistently exhibited their steadfast support for under-served communities and tackled the obstacles that impede individuals from achieving a great-er living standard. During its first 10 years, OCO created Housing Rehab programs to renovate 400 once-vacant houses, developed over 100 affordable housing units for first time homeowners, helped establish the Port of Oakland’s minority hiring program, and aided in the implementation of Oakland’s ‘‘Hire Oak-land First Program,’’ which is still in existence today. In 1985, OCO transitioned from their tradi-tional neighborhood-organizing model to a congregation-based model of organizing, which brought together congregations of all re-ligious denominations. Under its new model, OCO launched a campaign to address Oak-land’s drug epidemic during the 1980s. Thanks to OCO, the City of Oakland, Alameda County, and the State of California adopted new enforcement, treatment, and prevention measures to address the drug epidemic. In addition, the White House formally recognized OCO for its anti-drug campaign. In the 1990s, OCO shifted their focus to the root causes of poverty. As a result, they brought a new grocery store to West Oakland, secured $6.6 million in new street lighting, im-plemented truancy reductions program, and formed Aviation High School, a pilot school-to- work transition program that prepared high school student for jobs in the transportation field. At the beginning of 2000, OCO researched and developed one of the only community- driven school reform efforts in the United States, which resulted in the creations of doz-ens of new schools. Since then, OCO has also been dedicated to defending the rights of immigrant community by organizing legal sup-port forums for thousands of immigrant fami-lies seeking citizenship, pushing for family-ori-ented immigration reform legislation, and con-necting at-risk immigrants with emergency de-portation defense services. On behalf of California’s 13th Congressional District, I want to extend my sincere congratu-lations on this important milestone. I thank Oakland Community Organizations for all that they do. I wish them continued success in training and organizing future generations of leaders to address the challenges facing the City of Oakland and its neighboring commu-nities. f 
RECOGNIZING MASTER SERGEANT SEAN SARGEANT 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 21, 2017 Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Master Sergeant Sean Sargeant on the occasion of his retirement from the Marine Corps after 30 years of dedicated service to our country. Master Sergeant Sargeant’s time with the United States Marine Corps first began in 1988. As a trained infantryman, security guard and civil affairs specialist, he served in Soma-lia, Iraq and Afghanistan, and was also part of the last crew to serve on the Battleship New Jersey from World War II. In 1996, Master Sergeant Sargeant transitioned from active duty to the Marine Corps Reserve, where he began his career as a probation officer with the county. Working with a wide range of clients and families, Mas-ter Sergeant Sargeant’s efforts with inter- agency coordination and focused mentoring has changed many lives by helping them re- integrate into the community. Alongside his work with at risk adults and youth, Master Sergeant Sargeant continued to remain heavily involved with organizations that served veterans. Serving as an Operations Chief for Wounded Warriors, Master Sergeant Sargeant coordinated care for injured Marines and Sailors at Camp Pendleton and managed transitions for veteran families. He also served as a Civil Affairs Operations Chief with the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, assisting with G9 operations. In his community, Master Sergeant Sargeant co-organized the very first Orange County Stand Down event, providing tem-porary relief to homeless veterans and offering medical and hygienic services. MSgt Sargeant’s sense of duty is truly com-mendable, and he is an example to us all of what it means to be a public servant. Mr. Speaker and Members, please join me in congratulating Master Sergeant Sargeant on his retirement, and honoring him for his many contributions to the Marine Corps and to our nation. As he embarks on this new chapter, I wish Master Sergeant Sargeant all the best and thank him for his patriotism. f 
HONORING MR. CELESTINO CORDOVA 
HON. ELIZABETH H. ESTY 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 21, 2017 Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Celestino Cordova for his service in the 65th Infantry Regiment, the ‘‘Borinqueneers.’’ The 65th Infantry Regiment was the largest and longest-standing seg-regated Latino military unit in our country’s history, and the Borinqueneers service in the face of discrimination led Congress to award these veterans the well-deserved Congres-sional Gold Medal in 2014. The Borinqueneers trace their history to 1898, when Congress authorized the creation of a military unit in Puerto Rico. For more than a century, members of the 65th Infantry Regi-ment served honorably in our Armed Forces, displaying valor and distinction in World War I, World War II, and the Korean war. In fact, the Borinqueneers are credited with firing the first American shots in the First World War after stopping a German supply ship from leaving San Juan Bay in 1915. Throughout both World Wars, the Borinqueneers defended the Panama Canal Zone, and some members of the regiment

served in North Africa and Central Europe dur-ing World War II. The regiment became a key force during the Korean war after distin-guishing itself during the Operation PORTREX military exercise. Over 2,700 Borinqueneers earned Purple Hearts during the Korean war, and some Borinqueneers led the last regi-mental bayonet assault in U.S. military history. Despite their honorable service by thou-sands, the Borinqueneers faced segregation and regular discrimination in the Armed Forces. Our country owes these veterans our thanks, and we must remember the story of the Borinqueneers as role models for national service. Mr. Speaker, Celestino Cordova served our country in the 65th Infantry Regiment during the Korean war despite the danger and dis-crimination that the Borinqueneers faced. It is therefore fitting and proper that we honor him here today.
