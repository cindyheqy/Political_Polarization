PRAYER Monsignor Stephen J. Rossetti, Catholic University of America, Wash-ington, D.C., offered the following prayer: Good and gracious God, Abraham Lincoln set aside the last Thursday of November as quote: ‘‘A day of thanks-giving and praise to our beneficent Fa-ther who dwells in the heavens.’’ We do indeed give You thanks not only on that day, our Thanksgiving Day, but on every day of our lives. President Lincoln said we are ‘‘prone to forget the source from which’’ our blessings come. So, Lord, we pause and recognize again that it is You who have blessed us. May we never be numbered among the ungrateful. But as our hearts are increasingly filled with gratitude and overflowing with love, we mirror Your generous and loving heart. All we can say, all we need to say, is a heartfelt and daily ‘‘thank you.’’ And to this, we each add our own consent and we say: Amen. 
f 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to section 2(a) of House Resolution 1142, the Journal of the last day’s pro-ceedings is approved. f

I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 23, 2018 Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Mr. Speaker, by no means do I condone the atrocities that con-tinue to be committed in Yemen. The United States Congress cannot stand by as famine and armed conflict claim the lives of millions. Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution assigns to Congress the sole authority over the offen-sive use of force, and now is the time not only to reassess our military’s involvement in Yemen, but in every other conflict zone. I voted YEA on Roll Call No. 418 because I be-lieve that Congress must take back the con-stitutional reins and thoroughly examine U.S. military participation across the globe for the good of our country, our servicemembers, and our allies.
