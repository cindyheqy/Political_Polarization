ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-
tain up to five requests for 1-minute speeches on each side of the aisle. THE REGULATORY INTEGRITY 
PROTECTION ACT OF 2015 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute and to re-vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1732, the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act of 2015, introduced by my friend and colleague, Chairman B
ILLSHUSTER . 
Enacted in 1972, the Clean Water Act 
established a Federal-State partner-ship to protect our Nation’s navigable waterways. The administration has maintained that the proposed Waters of the U.S. rule would have no impact on waters historically not under the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction and is needed simply to provide legal clarity. 
While I agree that the boundaries of 
the Clean Water Act need to be better defined in statute, this proposal pro-vides no such clarity or certainty, cre-ating far more problems than it can solve. Conversely, rather than clari-fying the law, the rule would actually create more confusion about where the law stops. 
Back in March, the House Agri-
culture Subcommittee on Conservation and Forestry, which I chair, held its second hearing to review the proposed rule and its impact on rural America. The various witnesses spoke loud and clear that the rule would have far- reaching and unprecedented impacts on permitting costs and regulatory uncer-tainty for land use activities, such as agriculture and forestry.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2776 May 1, 2015 
With the significant challenges al-
ready before farmers, ranchers, for-esters, and landowners, there is too much on the line to continue down the path of nonsensical overregulation. The Corps of Engineers and the EPA must withdraw this rule, and go back to the drawing board. 
f 
HOLD THE VOTE 
(Mr. HECK of Washington asked and 
was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Speak-
er, next week we will be out of session and back in our districts, and many of us will be visiting small businesses, ap-propriately because it is National Small Business Week. We should visit small businesses; we should, frankly, whenever we are home. 
Meanwhile, only 25 legislative days 
remain before a tool used and cherished by America’s small businesses dis-appears. Only 25 more legislative days before this business tool for small busi-nesses vanishes altogether. Only 25 more legislative days, and the Export- Import Bank will shut its doors to our Nation’s small businesses unless we hold the vote. 
Mr. Speaker, hold the vote. Hold the 
vote today. Hold the vote if you cham-pion America’s small businesses suc-ceeding in global competition. The votes are here. Mr. Speaker, hold the vote. 
f 
HELPING GRANITE STATE 
FISHERMEN 
(Mr. GUINTA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) 
Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today on behalf of New Hampshire’s most historically important enterprise: our fishing industry. For nearly 400 years, our fishermen have provided the Granite State with a steady source of jobs and revenue. Their passion and livelihood is woven into the fabric of New England’s rich heritage. 
Today our fishermen face a host of 
challenges, most of which are due to the heavy hand of government inter-vention and regulation. Our govern-ment must help—not hinder—our State’s fishermen. 
That is why this week I join my col-
league, Congressman B
ILL KEATING , 
from Cape Cod, to introduce H.R. 2106, a bipartisan bill to redirect more than $100 million in existing funds to pro-grams of crucial importance to our fisheries, our fishermen, and the region at large. 
Granite State fishermen deserve the 
resources and tools necessary to assist with their jobs, cope with government mandates, and increase their ability to put food on the table for millions of Americans around the United States. This bipartisan legislation represents one step we can take to ensure this in-dustry that is so important to the his-tory of our State and our region and 
our country can last for another 400 years.

RECOGNIZING 2015 AS THE YEAR 
OF THE MILITARY DIVER 
(Ms. GRAHAM asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. GRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to recognize 2015 as the Year of the Military Diver, to honor the hard work and sacrifice of divers from all of our Nation’s service branches. 
Within north Florida’s Second Con-
gressional District is Naval Support Activity Panama City, the home of military diving in the United States. Today, led by Commanding Officer Hung Cao, the Naval Diving and Sal-vage Training Center at NSA PC is training the world’s most advanced divers. I have seen firsthand how hard the men and women of our Armed Forces train at the diving center to keep our Nation safe, and today I would like to thank them for their service and officially recognize 2015 as the Year of the Military Diver.

ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOP-
MENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2016 
GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the fur-ther consideration of H.R. 2028. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
T
HOMPSON of Pennsylvania). Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Idaho? 
There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 223 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill, H.R. 2028. 
Will the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
P
OE) kindly take the chair. 
b0910 
IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE  
Accordingly, the House resolved 
itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the further consideration of the bill (H.R. 2028) making appropriations for energy and water development and related agencies for the fiscal year ending Sep-tember 30, 2016, and for other purposes, with Mr. P
OEof Texas (Acting Chair) in 
the chair. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. The Acting CHAIR. When the Com-
mittee of the Whole House rose earlier today, a request for a recorded vote on an amendment offered by the gen-tleman from California (Mr. L
AMALFA ) 
had been postponed, and the bill had been read through page 57, line 11. AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR . DUNCAN OF SOUTH  
CAROLINA  
Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. 
Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will re-
port the amendment. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
At the end of the bill (before the short 
title), insert the following: 
SEC. ll. For an additional amount for 
‘‘Corps of Engineers—Civil—Department of the Army—Investigations’’, there is hereby appropriated, and the amount otherwise pro-vided by this Act for ‘‘Department of En-ergy—Energy Programs—Departmental Ad-ministration’’ is hereby reduced by, $2,500,000. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 223, the gentleman from South Carolina and a Member op-posed each will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from South Carolina. 
Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. 
Chair, before I start, I just want to thank the gentleman from Idaho, the chairman of the Subcommittee on En-ergy and Water Development, and Re-lated Agencies appropriations for all his exemplary work on this and allow-ing the open process to actually work. I know that my colleagues that have offered amendments appreciate the time that they have been able to do that, and I want to thank him for that. 
Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer an 
amendment to the Energy and Water Appropriations bill. This amendment takes dollars out of the bureaucracy in Washington, D.C., and puts it to work for the American people, helping ports and harbors like the Charleston Port in my home State of South Carolina do the important work necessary to begin the deepening of those harbors. 
Last month, I had the pleasure of vis-
iting the Panama Canal when I led a House delegation to the Summit of the Americas. The lock and dam system in that canal is being upgraded, and it was very interesting to see the work that they are doing there. Once that work is complete, larger ships will be able to come through the canal and de-liver goods to and from Atlantic and Gulf ports along the eastern seaboard. This will be one of the key economic drivers in the 21st century. 
If America is going to compete on the 
global stage, we need to be ready for this transformation. My amendment seeks to speed that readiness, helping to transform critical ports like Charleston’s to the depth that will allow these bigger ships to navigate those harbors more often. 
This amendment is about this House 
setting our government’s spending pri-orities, just like every family does at home. We are rapidly approaching a $20 trillion debt, and we have a moral re-sponsibility to use every tax dollar wisely. 
I am grateful that my colleagues on 
the Committee on Appropriations were able to negotiate this amendment to

increase funding for vital infrastruc-
ture projects like the Port of Charles-ton and pay for it by forcing bureau-cratic agencies to operate more effi-ciently. I urge the passage of the amendment. 
I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-tleman from South Carolina (Mr. D
UN-
CAN). 
The amendment was agreed to.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE ACTING CHAIR  
The Acting CHAIR (during the vote). 
There is 1 minute remaining. 
b1018 
So the amendment was agreed to. 
The result of the vote was announced 
as above recorded. 
PERSONAL EXPLANATION  
Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Chair, I was unavoid-
ably detained this morning and unable to vote on rollcalls 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, and 213. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘aye’’ on rollcalls 208, 209, 211, 212, and 213. I would have voted ‘‘no’’ on rollcall 210. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
read. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Energy and 
Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016’’. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I move 
that the Committee do now rise and re-port the bill back to the House with sundry amendments, with the rec-ommendation that the amendments be agreed to and that the bill, as amend-ed, do pass. 
The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; 
and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. D
OLD) having assumed the chair, Mr. 
POEof Texas, Acting Chair of the Com-
mittee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Com-mittee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2028) making appropria-tions for energy and water develop-ment and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes, directed him to report the bill back to the House with sundry amendments adopted in the Committee of the Whole, with the recommendation that the amendments be agreed to and that the bill, as amended, do pass. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the rule, the previous question is or-dered. 
Is a separate vote demanded on any 
amendment reported from the Com-mittee of the Whole? If not, the Chair 
will put them en gros. 
The amendments were agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the third time. 
MOTION TO RECOMMIT  
Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I have a mo-
tion to recommit at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the 
gentleman opposed to the bill? 
Mr. BERA. I am opposed in its cur-
rent form. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion to recom-mit. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Bera moves to recommit the bill H.R. 
2028 to the Committee on Appropriations with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendment: 
(1) ‘‘W
ATER AND RELATED RESOURCES ’’.— 
Page 13, line 14, after the dollar amount, in-sert ‘‘(increased by $15,000,000)’’. 
(2) ‘‘P
OLICY AND ADMINISTRATION ’’.—Page 
15, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $30,000,000)’’. 
(3) ‘‘E
LECTRICITY DELIVERY AND ENERGY RE -
LIABILITY ’’.—Page 21, line 17, after the dollar 
amount, insert ‘‘(increased by $15,000,000)’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, this is the 
final amendment to the bill. It will not kill the bill or send it back to com-mittee. If adopted, the bill will imme-diately proceed to final passage as amended. 
Mr. Speaker, we are in the midst of 
the worst drought we have ever experi-enced in California, in my home State, and across the Western United States. This is the fourth year of unprece-dented drought conditions. Two-thirds of California is in extreme or excep-tional drought. Almost twice the area as this time last year is experiencing exceptional drought. This is critical. 
When I go back to my district and 
talk to farmers, small-business owners, individuals, they are worried; they are worried about what the summer is going to bring. We are about to enter the driest part of the year. 
I have got a picture here. This is the 
Sierra Nevadas, one of the most beau-tiful regions in our country. When my wife and I first moved to northern Cali-fornia, we would scrimp and save so we could go on vacation and go skiing up here—beautiful snow. In fact, the 1960 Winter Olympics were held up here. 
But it is not a recreational area. 
What the Sierra Nevadas mean to Cali-fornia, this is our biggest reservoir of water. The snow falls in the winter, and in the springtime you get this melt-off. It fills our reservoirs; it nour-ishes our farmers; it allows the fisher-men to go fish the salmon in the Sac-ramento River. This is what a normal snowfall would look like. 
But let’s fast-forward to where we 
are today. There is no snow. The snowpack just last month was 5 per-
cent of normal—the worst conditions that we have ever seen. 
This is dramatic. What that means is 
our reservoirs are going to be empty. That means the farmers in central California are going to struggle to feed their crops. California’s farms are the breadbasket not just of our Nation, but of the world; some of the most produc-tive farms, incredibly important to our economy. But the water is not there. 
Now, what we are asking for is not a 
lot. We face critical times here. These aren’t Republican or Democratic issues, because a farmer or consumer doesn’t look at drinking water or the water to nourish their crops as Demo-crats or Republicans. They are looking at their business, their livelihoods, their very existence. We are just ask-ing for a small amount of emergency drought relief. 
Now, in my own district, a large part 
of my population depends on drinking water from Folsom Lake. Do you want to see what Folsom Lake looked like 1 year ago? Dry. Dry to the bone. This should all be under water. We are not going to fill this reservoir because it depends on the snowmelt. 
Now, these families are going to 
struggle. We are doing what we can to save water. We are doing what we can as consumers to better conserve. I know the farmers are stepping up to do what they can. 
We are not asking for a lot, though, 
here. My colleagues will talk about in-creasing surge capacity. Great. Let’s do that. But that is not going to re-lieve the impact of this summer. It is going to be devastating. 
And it is not just my State. It is af-
fecting Nevada. It is affecting Oregon. It is affecting Washington State. The funding that we are asking for is not just for California. All 50 States could ask for emergency drought relief to help families, to help businesses. 
We have got to address this. The cli-
mate is changing. We have noticed now for 4 years we haven’t had that snow. More of it is coming down as rain, so we have got to capture that rain. We certainly have to store it, and we have got to move that water to where we grow our foods. 
But for this summer, in these emer-
gency conditions, our families need re-lief. I am not asking for us to change the bill. I am asking for a bit of relief for families that are struggling. In fact, this will help them. It will help them get through it. It will help any of the 50 States plan for emergency condi-tions like this. 
In addition, we are asking for a brief 
bit of funding to help us beef up our cy-bersecurity for our electrical grid. We are vulnerable here. Can you imagine what would happen if those that want to harm us attacked our electrical grid? 
We are not asking for a lot. We are 
not asking for anything that is unrea-sonable here. We are Americans. Let’s help each other. Let’s do what is right.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2782 May 1, 2015 
Let’s amend the bill. Let’s pass it, and 
let’s provide relief for these families. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate the remarks that the gentleman just made. It would have been helpful, if he was so concerned about the drought—which I am sure you are. I don’t mean to imply that you are not. But it would have been helpful if you would have actually voted for some of the amendments that might have ad-dressed the problem, like the McClin-tock amendment that just passed that said you can’t take water and buy it and flush fish down the river when peo-ple need it. 
The reality is this motion to recom-
mit will not help with the drought con-
ditions in California at all. There are only two things that will help relieve the drought. One of them we have no control over. It comes from a higher power. It is called rain and snow. We can’t legislate that. 
b1030 
The second thing is that maybe we 
could start listening to some of the people who have been advocating to ad-dress this problem for several years— Congressman N
UNES , Congressman 
CALVERT , Congressman V ALADAO , Con-
gressman M CCARTHY , Congressman 
MCCLINTOCK , Congressman L AMALFA . 
They have made real proposals that would require the operation of the complex California water system so that it considered the lives and jobs and families of people before it did fish. 
Mr. Speaker, this amendment doesn’t 
do anything. It won’t help the drought conditions in California. We have al-ready put money into the grid issue to try to make sure that we secure the grid so that it is not subject to at-tacks. 
The other thing I would say is that 
this has been a balanced bill. We have got over 60 amendments we have con-sidered from Members on both sides of the aisle. We have adopted many of them, and some of them have been re-jected. It has been an open process. It has been the way Speaker B
OEHNER has 
wanted the appropriations process to work so that all Members could work their will on their appropriations bills. 
I don’t need to go through the bill. 
What I would tell you is to reject this MTR and to support the underlying bill. Be happy, smile, and enjoy next week. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the previous question is or-dered on the motion to recommit. 
There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion to recommit. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. RECORDED VOTE  
Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I demand a 
recorded vote. 
A recorded vote was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule XX, this 5-minute vote on the motion to re-commit will be followed by 5-minute votes on passage of the bill and agree-ing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal, if ordered. 
This is a 5-minute vote. The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—ayes 180, noes 235, not voting 16, as follows:

HONORING SHIRLEY VERDE AS 
VILLAGE OF PINECREST POLICE DEPARTMENT’S OFFICER OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015 
(Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was 
given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) 
Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, 
today I rise to recognize police officer Shirley Verde on being named the Vil-lage of Pinecrest Police Department’s Officer of the First Quarter of 2015. 
Officer Verde has consistently shown 
her commitment to her community and her fellow officers through her pro-fessionalism and dedicated service. She also has proven herself as an invaluable member of the Pinecrest police DUI en-forcement program. 
A perfect example: in the early morn-
ing hours of March 1 of this year, Offi-cer Verde successfully and safely re-solved a situation where an impaired driver was traveling in the wrong di-rection on heavily trafficked U.S. 1. There is no doubt that her quick and decisive actions saved many lives. 
Officer Verde is incredibly worthy of 
this honor, and I thank her for her dedication and service to the people of my hometown, the Village of Pinecrest.

STEM TO STEAM RESOLUTION 
(Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, earlier 
today, I introduced the STEM to STEAM Resolution. We all know how important science, technology, engi-neering, and mathematics is to our sys-tem of education, but it is also impor-tant that we recognize that art and de-sign are critical and complementary to

the traditional STEM fields. This is 
what my resolution accomplishes. 
Art and design are key parts of the 
innovative process, and I urge all of my colleagues to keep this in mind as we consider education legislation. In classrooms and laboratories across the country, the innovative nature of art and design play an essential role in im-proving STEM education and advanc-ing STEM research. In my home State, the Rhode Island School of Design con-tinues to be a leader in this field, and I commend their efforts to unlock our full creative potential. 
STEAM is a strategy for investing in 
job creation and ensuring that we have the best educated and creative college graduates on the planet. It is wonderful to see a growing interest in STEAM, and I hope we can turn this energy into policy changes this Congress.

HONORING THE HARD-WORKING 
MEN AND WOMEN OF THE OIL FIELDS OF WEST TEXAS 
(Mr. CONAWAY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) 
Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the hard-working men and women of the oil patches of west Texas. I have lived most of my life around those oil fields. I grew up in Odessa, Texas, where my dad was a roughneck. I have seen up close the hard work these good men and women do and the risks they face every day. 
These individuals, from wildcatters 
to roustabouts and roughnecks and company men and women, have led the charge in the American energy revolu-tion. Each has played an integral part in rewriting America’s energy story and changing our Nation’s course to-ward energy independence. 
We have witnessed the impact of 
their strong entrepreneurial spirit and innovative technological advances that have grown our economy, created jobs, and bolstered our national security. We depend on their exhaustive and dan-gerous work to power our homes, pave our roads, fuel our cars, farm our lands, and everything in between that keeps this Nation running. 
It is imperative that Congress sup-
port energy policies that are as adapt-ive and innovative as these hard-work-ing men and women. Our policies must cut through bureaucratic red tape to encourage exploration here at home, reduce job-killing regulations, and re-peal the antiquated crude oil export ban of a bygone era. 
To that end, I am introducing H. Res. 
243 that will pledge the House’s support to these criteria. I hope my colleagues will join me in this show of support for a hard-working industry.

HONORING JANE PHIPPS FOR 30 
YEARS OF SERVICE TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
(Mr. VEASEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, in April 
1985, Jane Phipps began her first job as a receptionist for the office of John Murtha at the age of 19. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
Jane Phipps for her 30 years of service to the United States House of Rep-resentatives. Jane Phipps has seen many historical and great Members move through the House of Congress here and has done a great job serving many Members honorably, but most of the time was spent working for Mr. Murtha for 25 years until he passed. After that, Jane continued her service with Congressman Mark Critz, and then she joined my office in 2013, which was my freshman year. 
Jane is known in the office and 
around the House as someone who is very caring, very committed and pas-sionate about her work, and she loves Maryland and knows so much about the history of the hometown where she is from. She has a great sense of humor and love of her family, including her father, who served honorably in World War II in the Marines. 
I would like to take this moment to 
thank Jane Phipps for 30 years of serv-ice to the House and to personally thank her for all of her hard work for so many Members, including myself. 
Our office has benefited greatly from 
her presence.

TOMORROW’S SOUTH DADE 
(Mr. CURBELO of Florida asked and 
was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in strong support of the work being done to rejuvenate the South Dade neighborhoods in Florida’s 26th Congressional District. Prepared by more than 300 residents and busi-nesses, the plan entitled ‘‘Tomorrow’s South Dade’’ is a community-driven ef-fort to provide a vision for the future of the region over the next several dec-ades. 
South Dade has a rich history based 
in agriculture and military and is home to one of our country’s great nat-ural treasures, Everglades National Park. The leaders of Tomorrow’s South Dade program have established nine committees to focus on different areas in which to strengthen the economy, including infrastructure, agriculture, and education. 
I commend the bold leadership of 
Homestead Mayor Jeff Porter and Flor-ida City Mayor Otis Wallace, and with the help of Bill Durquette of Home-stead Hospital and Bob Epling of Com-munity Bank of Florida, I am confident local government and businesses can work in unison for the betterment of our community. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues in Congress to promote To-morrow’s South Dade and ensure fu-ture generations have a community they are proud to call home. REMEMBERING ROCHELLE TATRAI 
RAY 
(Mr. JOLLY asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) 
Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to extend my deepest condolences and those of Florida’s 13th Congressional District to the family and friends of Rochelle Tatrai Ray. No words can truly convey the loss that has been felt since Rochelle’s most tragic passing. 
Rochelle was the president and CEO 
of Gulf Coast Jewish Family & Commu-nity Services and had been with the agency for 12 years. She was respon-sible for managing the organization’s 600 employees, working with 60 dif-ferent programs, covering 32 counties of the State of Florida. 
She worked tirelessly to help those 
with serious physical disabilities and impacted many families around the country as an advocate for children’s mental health policies. She frequently spoke around the country to share her passion for the welfare of children. 
Rochelle’s life was tragically cut 
short in an abhorrent case of domestic violence last December. Rochelle was just 46 years old. I wish to honor the life of Rochelle, who is survived by her two daughters, Marisa and Selena; her parents, Louis and Gai Linn Tatrai; and her sisters, Dana and Gai Linn. Ro-chelle will be greatly missed, but her memory will live on through those she has touched and influenced throughout her life. 
May God bless Rochelle Tatrai Ray; 
may God bless her family, and may God bless the family of Gulf Coast Jew-ish Family & Community Services.

CELEBRATING THE CENTENNIAL 
OF WILLCOX, ARIZONA 
(Ms. M CSALLY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. M
CSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the people of Willcox, Ari-zona, in my district, on their city’s up-coming 100 years of incorporation on May 3. 
Willcox is rich in history of the 
Southwest. Incorporated in 1915, the city was founded over 30 years earlier as a construction camp of the Southern Pacific Railroad. The railroad contrib-uted greatly to Willcox’s development as one of America’s busiest ranching towns. In 1936, Willcox shipped more cattle directly from the range than any other shipping point in the U.S., and ranching is still an important part of that community today. 
The city is the birthplace of Rex 
Allen, known as the Arizona Cowboy, and is home to the Headquarters Sa-loon, where the youngest of the fabled Earp brothers, Warren, was killed. 
Today, the city lies at the heart of 
the region’s blossoming wine industry, where three-quarters of all wine grapes produced in Arizona are grown.

WE NEED TO DO MORE TO BUILD 
THE WATER SUPPLY FOR THE WEST 
(Mr. L
AMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) 
Mr. L
AMALFA. Mr. Speaker, this 
week, we made some important strides on water in the West, especially in the time of drought we have in California. 
We need to do much more to build 
the kind of supply that is necessary to get out of the drought. Unfortunately, the bureaucracy doesn’t reward that with slow permit process or even some of the things we had to battle this week, such as deferring more water for fish that isn’t even in records of deci-sion or been feasibly shown to be sci-entifically sound. 
At the same time we have to curb the 
bureaucracy, we have to be positive moving forward with new storage projects, such as Sites Reservoir, such as other obstacles we have in the State of California and throughout the West to address this drought, not just take it to the ‘‘church of climate change’’ and think that is the whole problem. 
We are going to have to be proactive, 
as we have been in previous genera-tions.

FOSTER CARE MONTH 
(Ms. BASS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to join President Obama in recognizing May as National Foster Care Month. 
The goal of this special month is to 
raise awareness about the experiences of more than 400,000 youth in the foster care system and to recognize the essen-tial work that foster parents, social workers, and advocates have in the lives of children in foster care through-out the United States. 
Foster care was created as a tem-
porary placement for children who have been abused or neglected. The act of removing a child, even from an abu-sive home, is traumatic; yet, even in the face of these challenges, the resil-iency of foster youth remains strong. 
For example, Maurissa, a young 
woman who spent most of her high school years in a residential facility in Los Angeles, was able to graduate high school with honors and go on to Oxnard College. It took Maurissa almost 10 years to complete community college. She explains: ‘‘I was living on my own and working a minimum of 40 hours per week, and I had to take algebra nine times to pass.’’ 
Maurissa struggled to get past her 
experiences but was able to find some-one who believed in her. Dr. Adam 
Grudberg, a faculty member at the res-idential facility, encouraged her to reach her dreams. 
When Dr. Grudberg died at the young 
age of 30, Maurissa knew she couldn’t let him down. She went on to graduate from California State University with her undergraduate degree in psy-chology and then on to Harvard Grad-uate School of Education to receive her master’s degree in human development and psychology. 
In honor of Maurissa’s courage and 
Dr. Grudberg’s inspiration, I invite my colleagues to join the Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth and cosponsor the bipartisan resolution in recogni-tion of National Foster Care Month.

HONORING THE LIFE OF 
GUILLERMO OCHOA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
HARDY ). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. D
ENHAM ) is recognized for 60 minutes 
as the designee of the majority leader. 
Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to acknowledge and honor the life of a beloved leader in the Ceres community, former Ceres City Councilmember Guillermo Ochoa. The beloved father, son, son-in-law, broth-er, and uncle died at the age of 54 on Monday, March 2. 
Guillermo was born on August 29, 
1960. He immigrated to Ceres, Cali-fornia, from Mexico when he was 9 and became an American citizen. He at-tended school in Ceres at Caswell Ele-mentary School, Mae Hensley Junior High School, and Ceres High School. 
After graduating from Ceres High in 
1979, Guillermo attended Modesto Jun-ior College and transferred to St. Mary’s College of California. He earned a BS in business administration and ec-onomics from St. Mary’s in 1984. 
Over the course of 17 years, Guil-
lermo was employed in an administra-tive capacity for several employers, in-cluding Campbell’s Soup, Diamond of California, Yellow Roadway, and ConAgra Foods. 
Guillermo became a dedicated public 
servant in 2005, when he was appointed to the Ceres City Council. He ran for a seat on the city council 2 years later and won, making him the first Latino immigrant to become an elected city councilmember in Ceres. 
‘‘Working and succeeding together’’ 
was a slogan Guillermo lived by. He demonstrated his dedication to com-munity service through the many com-mittees, boards, and organizations he was a member of. 
The list includes the Ceres Chamber 
of Commerce, the Society for Human Resources Management, the StanCOG Policy Board, the Tuolumne River Re-gional Park committee, the Mello-Roos joint powers authority board, the City- School Committees, the Ceres Partner-ship for Healthy Children Committee, the Howard Stevenson Memorial Com-mittee, the Daniel Whitmore House 
Preservation Committee, and the Latino Community Roundtable. He also served as president and vice presi-dent of the Hispanic Leadership Coun-cil during various periods of his life. 
He was a true servant to the public 
and a strong community leader. He mo-tivated Ceres students to actively learn, working diligently with a Mo-desto group of students in an HLC or-ganization called Hispanic Youth Lead-ership Council. The council has had a lasting impact on the educational suc-cess of students in both communities. 
Although he was not reelected again 
in 2011, a few years later, he achieved his true dream of opening his own busi-ness, Garcia’s Market, a new grocery store in Empire, California. To this day, Garcia’s Market remains a vibrant testament to the economic vitality of the American free enterprise system. 
One has to admire men like Guil-
lermo Ochoa, who display consistent dedication to public service. He re-mained active in the community even after he was unseated from the city council. 
Guillermo was once asked what sets 
him apart. His response was: ‘‘My busi-ness and professional experience, as well as being a product of two diverse cultures, which helps me understand the issues that face our community as a whole.’’ 
Guillermo has set a loving standard 
of humanity for us all to remember him by. Guillermo leaves behind his wife, Martha Ochoa; a daughter, Kim-berly Ochoa; and a son, Christian Ochoa—each of them from Ceres, Cali-fornia. 
Also from Ceres, he leaves behind his 
father, Guillermo Ochoa, Sr.; mother, 
Maria Ochoa; sister, Luz Ochoa; neph-ew, Alexis Ochoa; sister, Irma Ochoa; brother-in-law, Rosendo Ruiz; nieces, Kassandra Ruiz and Clarissa Ruiz; and nephew, Angel Ruiz. 
Mr. Speaker, please join me in hon-
oring and recognizing my very, very good friend for his unwavering leader-ship and many accomplishments and contributions to our community. 
He had a genuine love for the people 
and community he worked so hard to help. We will have a long memory of him. 
I now yield to the gentleman from 
West Virginia (Mr. M
OONEY ). 
SYRIAN ATROCITIES  
Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to lend a voice to the people of Syria, many of whom have been silenced by a cruel and op-pressive dictator. 
This very moment, 5,500 miles from 
this Chamber, in the country of Syria, innocent people are suffering under a regime bent on crushing freedom. 
I met recently with a group of Syrian 
Americans in Charleston, West Vir-ginia, my congressional district. Many of them have family members and loved ones in Syria. The stories I heard are alarming.

waging an all-out war against his own

people, with one goal in mind, to muz-
zle any voice that speaks out in opposi-tion to his regime. 
People are suffering. Four out of five 
Syrians live in poverty. More than 200,000 people have been killed; 1 mil-lion have been wounded, and more than 3 million Syrians have fled the coun-try. 
Assad has shown that he will use any 
means necessary to maintain his dicta-torship. He has rained down chemical weapons from the sky onto neighbor-hoods. He has dropped cluster bombs and barrel bombs into residential buildings occupied by women and chil-dren. 
He has placed entire communities 
under siege, starving peaceful residents into submission. He has even bombed hospitals full of people recovering from his attacks. 
I would now like to share a few sto-
ries that I have heard from my con-stituents, with whom I met just this previous Monday. 
First, Dana Ashbani has family that 
lives in Syria. Several of her cousins were brutally killed by the Assad re-gime. 
One summer night, in 2013, gunfire 
rang out in the streets of the neighbor-hood in which Dana’s cousin lived. Fearing for her life, she grabbed her husband and her three young children and rushed toward a nearby basement for safety; but they were met by Assad’s thugs and mercilessly gunned down, their bodies mutilated beyond recognition. 
Dr. Rhagda Sahloul is an 
endocrinologist in Charleston. Her sis-
ter Dalia lives in Syria with her hus-band and their two children, Shahed and Omar, aged 7 and 11. Their town fell under siege by the Assad military in 2013. 
The residents are running low on 
food and are surviving on a diet of dry noodles and, if they are lucky, vegeta-bles that they grow on their rooftops and balconies. Without electricity, they have stripped their streets bare of trees to keep themselves warm on cold nights. No one even wants to think about next winter. 
Recently, a foreign humanitarian or-
ganization dropped relief materials for the town, and Dalia’s husband set up a marketplace in his home to facilitate the bartering of goods, but it didn’t last long. The Assad regime bombed their home, destroying their little mar-ket and killing three people. 
Dr. Khaled was an orthopedic sur-
geon in Aleppo before the conflict in Syria began, but he was forced to flee to Idlib, as he was targeted by the gov-ernment. In Idlib, he worked in several field hospitals and witnessed numerous aerial attacks. 
One of these attacks occurred on a 
new orthopedic center on the day of its opening in March 2013. The missile struck the hospital, killing one pa-tient, injuring several people, and forc-ing the facility to shut down. 
In June 2012, government forces en-
tered Douma, a suburb of Damascus, and ordered everyone out of their 
apartments. Citizens were lined up and told to face the wall. 
Mattessem, an 11-month-old baby at 
the time, was held by his mother, with his father and 10-year-old sister Fatima by her side. Fatima asked the soldiers to spare the life of her baby brother, of-fering $2, all the money she had in her pocket. The soldiers shot anyway. 
As Fatima’s father was shot, he fell 
onto Fatima, protecting her from the bullets. One bullet went through Mattessem and killed their mother. In a family of 25, only four survived. 
These are just a few of the stories 
that I have heard, but they should be a call to action. 
The Commander in Chief of our pow-
erful military, President Obama, ap-propriately recognized the severity of the situation in Syria, drawing a red line at chemical weapons; but Assad has crossed that red line repeatedly, with impunity, and the President has failed to rise to the challenge. Accord-ing to press reports, Assad’s regime launched another chemical weapon on the Syrian people just this past week. 
We need leadership from the Presi-
dent in the face of grave human rights violations in Syria, not faux red lines and empty threats. President Obama is not providing that leadership, and peo-ple in Syria are suffering because of it.

SUPREME COURT NEWS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-uary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. G
OHMERT ) 
for 30 minutes. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, this 
has been an interesting week, with all the activity here on the Hill. The Prime Minister of Japan came and spoke. He did a very admirable job. There has been a lot of activity across the street at the Supreme Court. It was rather interesting. 
If you look at the history of the Su-
preme Court, until 1810 or thereabouts, the Supreme Court did not have a courtroom here in the Capital—or any-where, really—and they often had to borrow a room from the House and Senate in order to have oral argu-ments. 
They were thrilled on the Supreme 
Court in 1810 when the Senate Chamber on the second floor was open, what is now referred to as the Old Senate Chamber. The Senate moved up to that Chamber just straight down the hall out here, and the Old Senate Chamber downstairs was converted into a Su-preme Court courtroom. 
The Justices were thrilled. They were 
thrilled that they finally had their own nice courtroom. Now, it is not much more than a museum room. People can tour that room. There were some im-portant decisions that were considered down there, some very poor decisions that were made in that room and some very good decisions that were made in 
that room. 
One of them involved the Spanish 
ship the Amistad . It was a great movie. 
A guy who grew up in Longview, Texas, in my district, Matthew McConaughey, played the trial lawyer in the case. 
b1115 
Anthony Hopkins did a great job 
playing John Quincy Adams, and I commend that movie to anyone that cares to see it. I don’t think as many people saw it as have seen McConaughey’s other movies. He didn’t take off his shirt in this one. 
The basic story can be found in the 
likes of history books,—unfortunately, not many that you can find in any school in America these days. But it was a very important case in estab-lishing propriety in America. 
There was a group of Africans who 
were captured by other Africans, taken to the coast of Africa, sold into slav-ery, put in chains, sailed across the sea to the Atlantic, to the Caribbean. There, this particular group of Africans was put on a Spanish ship called the Amistad. 
After they sailed, the Africans were 
able to get free, take over control of the ship. They didn’t know anything about sailing a ship like that and ended up landing in the United States, on the United States coast. 
Immediately, the Spaniards began 
proclaiming that the Africans were their property. They were slaves. They were their property, as was the ship, and they wanted to take their ship. What they said were slaves, or were ac-tually Africans, should have been free, but they wanted to go and leave with them. So there was a lawsuit. 
It took a while to find someone who 
could speak the Africans’ native tongue. Their version was a little dif-ferent. They were minding their own business. They were free Africans, and that is what they wanted to be. They are not anybody’s property. But fellow Africans had sold them into slavery, and they just wanted to be free like they started. 
So the lawsuit went on. There were a 
couple of trials, some apparent impro-prieties in the process, but it made its way to the Supreme Court in the 1830s. 
By that time, John Quincy Adams 
had become the first son of a former President to be elected President. Someone told me it has happened since then, but he was the first son of a former President to be elected Presi-dent. He had argued cases before the Supreme Court before, including just 2 or 3 years before he got elected Presi-dent. In 1828, he was defeated, so he never got a second term. 
Two years after that, he did, for a 
President, what was fairly unthink-able. He ran for the House of Rep-resentatives. No President has ever run for Congress before or since John Quin-cy Adams. But he had an abiding sense that he had a calling, like William Wil-berforce in England, with whom he had

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2787 May 1, 2015 
corresponded, that like Wilberforce 
was doing in England, trying to fight to bring an end to slavery there and all the injustice that came with it, he had a calling to do that in America. 
So he ran for the House of Represent-
atives. He was elected nine times, be-ginning in 1830. So the little plaque where his desk was, just down the hall in the old House Chamber, says, 1831– 1848. He had a massive stroke in 1848. But, over the course of his time in the House, he repeatedly filed bills to end slavery in America, to free specific slaves, and, at times, he made the Rules Committee furious because of the number of bills he filed. 
When he was recognized, in essence, 
he would give a hellfire brimstone ser-mon about the evils of slavery and how could we expect God to bless America when we were treating brothers and sisters the way slaves were treated. 
Well, he never got a win on any of his 
votes to end slavery, but in the 1830s, after the Amistad case made its way to 
the Supreme Court, he was eventually convinced to take over the case, to argue it before the Supreme Court. He had originally been reluctant, but de-cided that was something he should do, and so he did. He argued the case. 
Back in those days, there was no 
limit on length of oral argument, and so he went on and on, not as long as the 3 days Daniel Webster took in one case, but over 1 day and another, and of course they broke for lunch and in the evenings. But before the oral argu-ments ended, one of the Justices died, so that kind of throws a kink in oral argument. 
But on the last day in his argument, 
after having argued the law, tried to argue precedents, tried to argue the facts, he apparently didn’t feel good about the Supreme Court’s position. He didn’t feel like they were with him. 
Mr. Speaker, if you can put yourself 
in the place of John Quincy Adams, knowing how wrong slavery was and how we could never reach our potential as a nation if we continued the course of slavery, and yet knowing if you are not up to the job in this case, arguing before these Justices, nine and then eight, and you don’t do a good enough job, then the Africans will remain in chains, and most likely their children, grandchildren will wear chains because you didn’t do a good enough job as the attorney, so the pressure was immense. 
You can find his oral argument on-
line. We don’t have days for that to all be recited. But you can find, toward the end of the oral argument—and I don’t have it here before me. I don’t have it verbatim. But the process he used toward the end might be offensive to some judges now. If somebody had done it before me, as a judge, it might have been offensive to me. 
But he was desperate to convince the 
Justices to think carefully about what they were about to decide: whether free Africans, Africans that started as free Africans, should remain free Africans or whether they should be considered no more than property to the people 
that bought them from the Africans that sold them. 
So his argument turned, right at the 
end, to a recitation of Justices who had been on the Court and who were no longer alive, saying, in essence, you know: Where is Chief Justice John Marshall? Where is this Justice, that Justice? He called them by name. He knew them. Through his father, through himself, personally, he knew the Justices, all those that had passed away. Then he called every one of their names. 
He said: The solicitor general that 
last argued a case against me before this Court—this was back in the early twenties—where is he? He had passed away. 
And he went on naming the names of 
Justices who had been on the Supreme Court and died, and then came around and he said: Even the Justice that started this case, where is he? He is not with us. They have all gone to meet their Maker, their Judge. 
Then he said: The biggest thing 
about—the biggest question about their lives is, when they met their Maker, their Judge, did they hear the words, ‘‘Well done, good and faithful servant?’’ 
That was an argument before the Su-
preme Court. Like I said, that is not verbatim, but the question that he said was so critical about their lives was verbatim because he knew that came from Scripture that he believed with his heart, like the Apostle Paul is say-ing that he hoped that he would hear that, ‘‘Well done, good and faithful servant.’’ 
Now, he didn’t go the extra step and 
insult the Justices by saying: Are you going to hear it if you die tonight? But the implication was very clear. And fortunately, not just for the Africans, but for people of conscience back in that day, the Supreme Court made a good decision, unlike what they did in the Dred Scott case, making an abys-mal decision. But that was also heard and decided while the Supreme Court met in that same room that tourists— it is not as easy to go on the tour as it used to be throughout the Capitol, but you can see that courtroom where that occurred. 
The Supreme Court did the right 
thing. They decided the free Africans should be free Africans—a good deci-sion—that they were not anyone’s property, that they did not have to leave in shackles. They are free Afri-cans. They were free people. This actu-ally goes right back to the Declaration of Independence, and the Founders be-lieved that we were endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights and that we were created equal. 
One of the great questions about 
those days was how even Thomas Jef-ferson, who had put in the Declaration of Independence, one of the longest grievances was actually King George having allowed slavery to exist in America, he, himself, had slaves. But you get the gist. They under-
stood it really was not a good thing. It didn’t end up in the final draft of the Declaration of Independence, but it held our country back, because any country that treats people like that is going to never reach their potential as a country. 
It is interesting, though, in our his-
tory, that if you go there in what’s called Statuary Hall because all these statues have been placed in there now, but it was the House Chamber until the late 1850s, the place where they had church for the majority of the 1800s. Thomas Jefferson went to church in there most Sundays. 
The guy that coined the phrase in a 
letter to the Danbury Baptist, separa-tion of church and state, there should be a wall of separation, he saw it as a one-way wall, that the government should not interfere with religion and religious beliefs, but he thought it would be perfectly fine for religion to participate in government, and had no problem. He even brought the Marine Band just down the hall to play hymns on many occasions on Sundays. For many years, it was the largest Chris-tian church in Washington, D.C. Right down the hall, in the U.S. Capitol, in the House of Representatives, is where they met. 
James Madison, who gets so much 
credit in accumulating the provisions of the Constitution, he should know what the Constitution meant in the First Amendment that was to come. He saw no problem with coming to church in the U.S. Capitol each Sunday while he was President. 
Congressional Research Service, 
when I inquired, they indicated that usually when Jefferson came to church here in the Capitol each Sunday, he would normally ride his horse. Madi-son, when he came to church each Sun-day here in the Capitol, he would nor-mally come up here in a horse-drawn carriage. 
But that is part of our history. There 
was no way that any of those Founders were ever going to try to interfere with the religious beliefs of, especially, Christians in America. That would have been unfathomable to them. 
b1130 
Yet that is the very thing that was 
being argued right across the street this week, that the government should be able to compel people with very strong religious beliefs, compel them to violate their most strongly held reli-gious beliefs, and compel them basi-cally to become slaves to the govern-ment and the nonbelief, the amoral be-liefs of people who may be on the Su-preme Court. 
Now, I bring this up because, as you 
look at the history of the Supreme Court, you find that when the Senate moved at the beginning of their term in the year 1860, as they started that Senate year, they started it down the hall in the current Chamber where they are.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2788 May 1, 2015 
So in 1860, the Supreme Court moved 
up from the floor below to the beau-tiful old Senate Chamber, as it is called now, but it was actually the Su-preme Court chamber from 1860 to 1935. 
I think it was in 1931 the current Su-
preme Court building was built because before that, the Supreme Court got hand-me-downs for most everything. And, of course, after a decision like Dred Scott, they probably deserved nothing but hand-me-downs. 
But nonetheless, our only President 
to have been President and also be on the Supreme Court, William Howard Taft, because of his political ties, he was in a position to seek and get fund-ing for a new building. He didn’t get to be Chief Justice in the new building. 
But in a documentary that was done 
not too long ago—I was not aware—it pointed out that when the Justices of the Supreme Court were taken through this new Supreme Court building in 1935, showing them their new cham-bers, the new Court, many of them were appalled. They were shocked be-cause it appeared to them to be a pal-ace. They didn’t even have a room for a while. Then they got the hand-me- down from the old, old Senate cham-ber. Then they got the old Senate. And now they are looking at a palace that they, as Justices, weren’t supposed to have. 
The documentary pointed out that 
there were some Justices who didn’t move into offices for a long time be-cause they just felt it was inappro-priate for Justices in the United States of America to be in a palace. 
Mr. Speaker, some may not be aware, 
but they are comfortable with the pal-ace now, of course. But it was inter-esting that for a while, some of them felt that it looked too much like a pal-ace, and it sent the wrong message. 
When I was a judge, when I was a 
chief justice, we had many programs on ethics to teach, you know, what the general feeling on ethics was, what the rules are. And generally, if there was a case in which it appeared a justice had already made a decision in advance, that was a judge or a justice who should, in order to remain ethical, recuse themselves or recuse him or her-self. 
Well, we have two Justices, I read, 
that had performed marriage cere-monies for couples that were the same sex. There could be no more clearer evidence that a Justice had decided whether or not same-sex marriage was appropriate when such Justice was per-forming that. 
But one of the flaws in our Supreme 
Court justice system that only exists for the Supreme Court of the United States—no other court in the land has this problem—they have no one to whom anybody in America using the court system can appeal on ethical issues. Congress can impeach after the fact, if something is done inappropri-ately. But, for example, if someone made a motion to recuse me as a judge, then I could hear it. But then that could be appealed to another judge, and 
there were methods of appeal. 
But if you believe that a judge, or a 
Justice, in the Supreme Court’s case, making their views very clear that they have very strong feelings for same-sex marriage and that they be-lieve it is perfectly appropriate before the case comes before them, and yet they decide, I am not doing anything unethical, should stay on the Court— because they have come so far from those days when they didn’t even have a courtroom for about 21 years to where they now have a lovely palace— there is no one else that they allow an appeal to. They could set up a panel to make decisions about ethical issues. 
But when you, as a Court, began re-
placing God with your own decisions, when you began to replace the laws of human nature with what you think the laws should be, then naturally, you are not going to set up a panel that second- guesses your decision on ethics because you are the be-all and end-all for such decisions. 
So it grieves me very much for our 
Court system to have Justices who have made their positions very clear, sit on a case as if they hadn’t, decide a case as if they are fair and unbiased, and then say, this is justice in Amer-ica. 
We have badly regressed. The days of 
humility for some Justices are gone. There was a time when Justices had such a sense of humility that they thought this was a palace they should not be in. Those days are gone. There was a time when Justices could be em-barrassed about such a horrendous de-cision, like Dred Scott. I fear those days are gone as well. 
But they will make a decision, and 
they will decide either—I hope they de-cide that this is a decision for each State, that since the Constitution does not speak to the issue of marriage and the 10th Amendment makes very clear any power not specifically enumerated is reserved to the States and the peo-ple, that they will ensure that they are not the arbiters of morality in America any longer, at least not on this issue; that they will decide that they are not going to go so far as to condemn people who believe firmly in the teachings of the Bible, Old Testament and New Tes-tament, people who believe in the Com-mandments, that the man depicted as the only full face in this whole gallery above these doors, the man who was considered the greatest lawgiver of all time when this was decorated in this way, Moses—that is the same Moses that, if you go into the Supreme Court and you are looking at the Supreme Court, and you are seeing them strug-gling to become God in their decisions about religion, if you look up at the marble wall above you, to the right, you will see Moses depicted, holding the Ten Commandments and looking down. 
They will decide whether they are 
going to inject themselves and tell peo-ple what the Pilgrims heard in Europe, what Christians heard around the 
world who came to America so they would not be persecuted as Christians. They will tell America very clearly: We don’t care what your religious views are. This Supreme Court is going to de-cide that we are going to prohibit the free exercise of religion because we are more important, and our views are more important than the clear lan-guage of the First Amendment when it says that the government will not pro-hibit the free exercise of religion. 
Well, we will find out. I hope and 
pray that the Supreme Court has a time of humility, their hearts are touched to the point that they will not decide that the Pope is an idiot, that they, as the popes of America, know what is best for the people, more than any religious leader in the country, that they will substitute their judg-ment for those of the Bible. 
It is kind of hard to get around Ro-
mans I, if you really believe the New Testament. 
Nonetheless, that decision is coming. 
Mr. Speaker, I am truly hopeful that Americans will realize the seriousness of this decision and the ultimate breakdown that it will be. And I hope we don’t degenerate in this country into more violence. 
But we see what happens around this 
country when we get God—we don’t even want God mentioned anywhere, even though, for this country’s history, the Bible has been the most quoted book right here in this Chamber, the Chamber down the hall, the most quoted book ever in our government’s history. 
So when I am talking like this on the 
floor, we usually get calls from people that are going berserk, how dare him mention God. 
Just in the last week or two, I have 
quoted from Abraham Lincoln, who wrote an official United States Govern-ment proclamation, begging, imploring the people to have a time of prayer, hu-mility, and fasting. And in the procla-mation, he makes clear that the prob-lem at that point, as slavery was a huge problem, the Civil War was ongo-ing at the time of this proclamation. But he knew those were symptoms of what happens when you turn from the religious morality of the Bible. And he said, We have forgotten God. 
I hope the Supreme Court will not, 
once again, inject themselves as gods but that they will observe the true meaning of the First Amendment. 
With that, I yield back the balance of 
my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H2789 May 1, 2015 
Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, within the 
last hour or so, there was a decision by the Baltimore City State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby in the investigation of the death of Freddie Gray, a Black man who died under questionable cir-cumstances; circumstances that kind of made us all wonder where the truth lies; circumstances that cause young people and others to take to the streets across this Nation; circumstances that brought into a sharp, bright light the question of justice in America, the question of police misconduct in Amer-ica, the question of mayhem in Amer-ica, the question of poverty in Amer-ica, and the question of bias in Amer-ica. 
Freddie Gray’s murder, Freddie 
Gray’s death, and the questionable cir-cumstances around his death brought into sharp relief all of these issues of race and living in an urban center— brought into sharp relief, Mr. Speaker, 50 years or more of abject, determined, and callous disinvestment in our urban areas, 50 years or more of joblessness, bad schools, bad housing, bad health care, and 50 years of hopelessness. 
In the last few minutes, Mr. Speaker, 
this brilliant, young, African American woman, Baltimore City State’s Attor-ney Marilyn Mosby, made a decision; and she decided that, yes, notwith-standing all the differences of opinion, the changed stories, the moving target, notwithstanding all of these things that happened, she decided that Freddie Gray was murdered—Freddie Gray was murdered—and that she would indict the police officers who were responsible. 
By indicting the Baltimore City po-
lice officers who were responsible for Mr. Gray’s murder, she made a giant, enormous step for justice for young people, young African American men and women, young people who live in our urban areas. 
By her decision today, just a few mo-
ments ago, she has done this Nation an invaluable service, especially for young people, especially for the African American and other minority youth. These young people have, for decades now, sought and yearned for justice as it relates to police misconduct, police brutality, and, yes, police murder. 
This new standard for justice is a 
standard that now transcends Balti-more and transcends even the entire State of Maryland. It transcends and it reaches to other points all across this Nation—Ferguson, New York City, Chi-cago, Cleveland, and other places all throughout this country. 
Mr. Speaker, as an African American 
male who represents the South Side of the city of Chicago, I know firsthand about police misconduct, police may-hem, and police murder. 
I must say, Mr. Speaker, that, in my 
68 years living mostly in the city of Chicago, I have never seen the wheels of justice move so profoundly, so point-edly, and so purposefully as I have wit-nessed with Baltimore City State’s At-torney Marilyn Mosby’s actions. She has raised all kinds of standards. 
She has captured the imagination of all of us who fight for justice, who want to see justice delivered in the true Amer-ican way, and who want to see an end to all the machinations, excuses, turn-ing away, and closing our eyes to po-lice misconduct in our urban areas. 
This wonderful, courageous, young 
city State’s attorney has raised the standard for prosecutors all across our great Nation. She has raised the stand-ards for mayors, chiefs of police, and other law enforcement officials. She has raised the standard for even those who are in this body. Open your minds, open your eyes, and see the truth. 
Let me just say right now, Mr. 
Speaker, that the police officers of this Nation, the overwhelming majority of them, are good, hard-working defenders of the community. They are not lawbreakers. They are there to serve and protect. 
We honor them, and we lift them up; 
but there are a few who think that they can get away with all kinds of il-legal actions just because they can get away with it because the system has a tendency and a habit of rising to pro-tect even those who violate not only the laws of the Nation, but the spirit of the laws of this Nation, these laws that keep this Nation together, these laws that make us have an identity as one nation under God, indivisible, with lib-erty and justice for all. 
These police officers, this minority of 
those on the urban police forces across this Nation, these are the ones that ab-rogate the Constitution, short-circuit our Constitution, short-circuit our quest for justice, our appeal for justice, our right for justice, and short-circuit those just for their thrill of the mo-ment. 
Can you imagine, Mr. Speaker, being 
handcuffed and leg-cuffed, laying down facedown in the back of a paddy wagon driven not accidentally recklessly, de-termined by those police officers who were driving, who had him in custody, to maim, harm, and brutalize him, dif-ferent speeds driven by the driver of that van, tossed about because of sud-den stops? 
You are in the back of a paddy 
wagon, handcuffed and leg-cuffed, and these police officers are getting a thrill out of tossing you around in a steel-en-cased paddy wagon, not caring about the broken parts of your body that might occur, not caring about whether you really live or die, not even caring about their oath that they were sworn to when they were hired and when they took that oath to serve and protect. 
All those things became secondary to 
their thrill of seeing how much havoc and harm they could cause to this Black man in Baltimore. Yeah, they thought they would get away with it, that no one would even think to ques-tion their decisions, their thrill-seek-ing, their conduct. 
Thank God there is a woman in Bal-
timore who said to them, to all the po-lice officers who are like minded such as them, said to this Nation: No more. 
No more, not this time. You are going to be indicted, and you are going to be charged, and that is the way it is. 
Grieving mothers, Mr. Gray’s moth-
er, his father, his relatives, his loved ones, his friends, and his neighbors can all now say that there will be justice for Freddie Gray. I said, in Chicago, there will be justice for Freddie Gray. From this Nation’s borders, young peo-ple are rejoicing now. The day is soon to be justice for Freddie Gray. 
Mr. Speaker, Ms. Mosby’s actions, 
her courage, her dedication, her com-mitment, and her decisiveness have spoken to the idea that is creating this movement for justice all across this Nation. 
b1200 
She has very clearly and profoundly 
and without hesitation spoken to all of us, to this Nation. Her actions have shouted out that Black lives do matter, that Black lives do matter, that all lives in America matter, and that Black lives matter also. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

HONORING THE CAREER OF JAN 
ALDERTON 
HON. JOHN K. DELANEY 
OF MARYLAND  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 1, 2015 
Mr. DELANEY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
recognize and honor Mr. Jan Alderton, Man-aging Editor at the Cumberland Times-News, for his incredible career and his retirement after nearly 48 years of journalism. 
Jan started at the Cumberland News in 
1967 as a proofreader. Eventually, he worked his way through almost every newsroom posi-tion. From his coverage of the Maryland Gen-eral Assembly in the 1970’s, to his work as a sports reporter, Jan showed true commitment to his craft, and worked hard to publish the best stories each day. 
In 1987, Jan was named Managing Editor of 
the Times-News for the first time. There, Jan strived to make sure readers of the Times- News had access to breaking stories and the best reporting. His service to the people of Al-legany County will be dearly missed. 
Local journalism, like that at the Cum-
berland Times-News, provides a critical serv-ice for communities nationwide, highlighting events that aren’t covered elsewhere. When it comes to reading hometown news, there’s only one place to find it, and that’s your home-town paper. 
I ask that you and my other distinguished 
colleagues help me in honoring Mr. Jan Alderton, for his dedication to honest reporting and his commitment to the people of Cum-berland. Let’s wish Jan a happy and healthy retirement.

RECOGNIZING HOWEY-IN-THE- 
HILLS, FLORIDA 
HON. DANIEL WEBSTER 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 1, 2015 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it is 
my privilege to recognize Howey-in-the-Hills, Florida as the town celebrates its 90th anni-versary. Howey-in-the-Hills is a small town with deep roots in the Florida citrus industry. 
Howey-in-the-Hills’ rich history began in 
1916 with the purchase of 60,000 acres of land in Lake County by William John Howey. With a vision to build a citrus empire, Mr. Howey planted citrus on the majority of his land, and in 1921 he built Florida’s first citrus plant. To serve as the commercial hub for the citrus industry, Mr. Howey founded Howey in 1925. A landscape with rolling hills and beau-tiful lakes, Mr. Howey nicknamed the area ‘the Florida Alps’ and in 1927 he officially changed the name to Howey-in-the-Hills to better char-acterize the natural beauty of the community. 
Today, Howey-in-the Hills remains a beau-
tiful, scenic small town. Situated on the pictur-esque shores of Little Lake Harris and dotted 
with many smaller bodies of water, the town has developed itself into a resort town with the acclaimed Mission Inn Resort and Club. Howey-in-the-Hills is truly a gem worth discov-ering in Central Florida. 
I congratulate Mayor Chris Sears, Mayor 
Pro-Tem John Ernest, Councilors Joseph Mabry, Ed Conroy, and David Nebel, and most of all, the people that live and work in Howey-in-the-Hills. It is truly an honor to serve the residents of Howey-in-the-Hills, and I thank them for their tremendous contributions to the Central Florida community.

IN RECOGNITION OF GOLIAD, 
TEXAS AND CINCO DE MAYO 
HON. FILEMON VELA 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 1, 2015 
Mr. VELA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to com-
memorate the upcoming 153rd anniversary of Cinco de Mayo. In May I will join my constitu-ents in Goliad, Texas, to celebrate Cinco de Mayo. The holiday has come to represent a day of celebration of Mexican culture around the world. 
Goliad, Texas is the birthplace of the young 
Mexican general, and the hero of Cinco de Mayo—Ignacio Seguin Zaragoza. He initially studied for priesthood, yet took up arms in de-fense of his country when Mexico slid into the War of the Reform. As the conflict came to a close in the late 1850s, General Zaragoza joined federalist troops with the legendary Be-nito Juarez and fought in numerous battles, in-cluding the Battle of Calpulalpan, which ended the War of the Reform. His strategic acumen in those four years led to his rapid promotion to general. 
After the war, Mexico’s European debt suf-
focated the economy, forcing then Mexican President Benito Juarez to declare a morato-rium on debt payments. In retaliation, Spain, England, and France sent their fleets and forced the surrender of Veracruz, Mexico. President Juarez sent one of his generals to Veracruz in response. When that general ob-served the forces of the great European pow-ers displayed in front of Veracruz, he re-signed. President Juarez turned to General Zaragoza to lead the fight. 
The Spanish and English withdrew their 
forces after negotiations with President Juarez, but the French army, arguably the best during that time, marched on to Mexico City. The intent was to conquer Mexico, join forces with the Confederate Army, and attack the Union. However, General Zaragoza stopped this invasion, in Puebla, Mexico. 
The Battle of Puebla lasted most of May 5, 
1862. Despite a severe imbalance in forces, the Mexican army held. General Zaragoza was lauded on his return. Later, while visiting his own sick troops, he contracted typhoid fever and died on September 8, 1862, at the young age of 33. He was honored with a state 
funeral, and three days later, President Benito Juarez declared May 5, or Cinco de Mayo, a national holiday. 
Citizens of Goliad maintain a rich cultural 
heritage, and are fiercely proud of their legacy. Today, festivities center around Zaragoza Plaza, which is located adjacent to the birth-place of Ignacio Seguin Zaragoza. The Texas Legislature has designated this beautiful plaza as the official celebration site for Cinco de Mayo so that future generations may under-stand its historical significance.

IN HONOR OF WARREN WEINSTEIN 
HON. SAM FARR 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 1, 2015 
Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
mourn the tragic death of Warren Weinstein, a U.S. development worker who was held cap-tive by Al Qaeda from 2011 until 2015. 
Last week, we learned that Mr. Weinstein 
was an accidental victim of a U.S. drone strike that took place in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region in January of this year. This tragedy has deprived a family of their loving husband, father, and grandfather, and it has deprived our country of a tireless champion of human rights and economic development among some of the world’s poorest popu-lations. 
Warren Weinstein dedicated over 40 years 
of his life to international development work. Throughout his career, he worked with vulner-able populations throughout Africa and South Asia. He served as Peace Corps country di-rector in Togo and the Ivory Coast. Most re-cently, he spent 10 years working on eco-nomic development projects as an adviser to J.E. Austin Associates, a U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) contractor, in Pakistan. 
Mr. Weinstein’s life and approach to devel-
opment work showcased the ideals of the in-stitutions that he served: USAID, the Peace Corps, and others. He left the comforts of home and dedicated his career to improving the lives of others in countries that were not his own. He spoke seven languages and im-mersed himself in the local culture of the countries in which he worked. By all accounts, he had a warm, outgoing personality and a deep commitment to solving some of the world’s most difficult problems. 
Mr. Speaker, I know I speak for the whole 
House in offering our deepest condolences to Mr. Weinstein’s family and friends, especially his wife Elaine, their daughters Alisa and Jen-nifer, and their families. His legacy will live on in Pakistan, Togo, the Ivory Coast, and the entire range of countries in which he worked, and his service to our country and the world will never be forgotten.

TRIBUTE TO MATTHEW CHOW, 
MINKU LEE, AND HELEN WU MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL YOUTH ORCHESTRA OF THE UNITED STATES 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 1, 2015 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate Matthew Chow, Minku Lee and Helen Wu on being selected to represent the United States in New York City and seven cit-ies in China this summer as part of the Na-tional Youth Orchestra of the United States of America. 
Each year, Carnegie Hall selects the most 
talented young musicians from across our country to assemble an orchestra which shares music with the world. In 2015, the Na-tional Youth Orchestra will consist of 114 members and three of them are from the 18th Congressional District of California which I’m privileged to represent. 
Matthew Chow, a violist from Los Altos, 
Minku Lee, a cellist from Palo Alto, and Helen Wu, a violist from Saratoga, are three of the nation’s finest young musicians selected to play for the National Youth Orchestra. That each of them were selected is a testament to their superb skills. That a Congressional Dis-trict would produce more than one orchestra member is extraordinary. After training and performing in New York City, Matthew, Minku and Helen will represent the United States this summer, performing in seven cities in China. Each musician is a source of great pride to their families, their schools, their teachers, our entire community and their Congresswoman. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask the entire House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in congratulating Mat-thew Chow, Minku Lee and Helen Wu on their extraordinary accomplishments. I congratulate and wish each of them every success as they perform with the National Youth Orchestra in New York City and China, proudly rep-resenting the best of the United States of America.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 40TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF THE LORTON COMMUNITY ACTION CENTER AND IN HONOR OF FOUNDER’S AWARD RECIPIENT MOLLY LYNCH 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 1, 2015 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize the 40th Anniversary of the Lorton Community Action Center and join the Center in honoring this year’s Founder’s Award recipi-ent, Molly Lynch. 
Since 1975, Lorton Community Action Cen-
ter (LCAC) has served the residents of Fort Belvoir, Lorton, Newington, and other portions of southeast Fairfax County by providing ac-cess to basic needs and the opportunity to empower themselves through self-sufficiency programs. 
LCAC began as an all-volunteer organiza-
tion, working out of a local school and a church basement. The organization was 
founded in response to the needs of low-in-come families in southeast Fairfax, which was an under-served area. For LCAC’s first 15 years, the agency served as a resource for in-formation and collected and distributed food for individuals and families. Today, LCAC has a professional staff of five full-time and five part-time employees, who serve a diverse population of ages and ethnic backgrounds. 
LCAC aims to break the cycle of poverty 
and prevent homelessness through a variety of services and programs. LCAC’s food pro-gram distributes between eight and ten tons of food every month. Clients who need clothing can shop at Lorton’s Attic, LCAC’s thrift store. Small grants assist families with utilities, rent, mortgage, medical services, and other essen-tial needs. 
When LCAC cannot help directly, it works 
closely with other agencies and organizations in our area that may be able to provide assist-ance. Perhaps most important, LCAC helps people achieve self-sufficiency through case management, ESL classes, nutrition classes, pro bono legal services, and tutoring. All this would not have been possible without the dedication of time, talent, and resources by the thousands of community volunteers and supporters. 
Molly Lynch served on LCAC’s Board from 
1981–82 and again from 1991–2003. Mrs. Lynch was a part of the all-volunteer organiza-tion that operated out of a small building on Gunston Elementary School property in her early board service, providing a variety of much needed services to families in the Lorton community. When Molly rejoined the board in 1991 she helped LCAC pursue new funding opportunities through participation in the Com-bined Federal Campaign, United Way giving, and Fairfax County Community Funding Pool grants. In 2011, a generous gift from Molly and her husband, Bill, allowed LCAC to open a 2,000 square-foot pantry that doubled LCAC’s space and consolidated food oper-ations from five locations to one. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in commending the staff, volunteers, sup-porters, and partners of LCAC for 40 years of assistance to the Lorton community’s most vulnerable residents and in thanking Molly Lynch for her dedication to helping our neigh-bors in need.

MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND 
VETERANS AFFAIRS AND RE-LATED AGENCIES APPROPRIA-TIONS ACT, 2016 
SPEECH OF  
HON. FRANK A. LoBIONDO 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Wednesday, April 29, 2015 
The House in Committee of the Whole 
House on the state of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2029) making ap-propriations for military construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending Sep-tember 30, 2016, and for other purposes: 
Mr. L OBIONDO. Madam Chair, I rise today 
in support of the FY2016 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Bill. This legislation will go a long way to help facilities, such as the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Re-
gional Office where thousands of my constitu-ents have their cases managed, in improving their care and treatment of our nation’s Vet-erans. While this is another small step to ad-dress the larger problems within the Depart-ment of Veterans Affairs, this legislation con-tinues to show The House’s dedication to righting this ship. Some important provisions of this bill include: 
‘‘Strike force response teams’’ that would 
bring in experienced, high-performing man-agers to implement corrective actions at low- performing facilities and offices 
A fully funded request for digital scanning 
and centralized mail, which will improve speed and accuracy issues 
And, this fully funds the Veterans Benefits 
Administration (VBA) with a $163 million in-crease over FY15, which will allow for more staffing for processing of appeals of claims in Philadelphia and other regional offices 
I commend Chairman D
ENT and his sub-
committee for prioritizing care of our Veterans. While South Jersey still has many challenges to be overcome in access to timely care, I am proud to support this bill which continues to fix the system-wide problems within the VA.

RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING THE 
40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SOUTHEAST ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY 
HON. MICHAEL M. HONDA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 1, 2015 
Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to in-
troduce a resolution that recognizes and cele-brates the 40th Anniversary of the Southeast Asian American community in the U.S. 
Over the past 40 years, Southeast Asian 
Americans have become an integral part of the social and economic fabric of our country. 
They left war-torn nations, tyrannical re-
gimes, and even genocide, to make better lives for themselves and their children. 
Today, over 2.5 million Southeast Asian 
Americans trace their heritage to Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. 
In these four decades, they have contrib-
uted to our armed forces, arts, business, and politics. 
In fact, I have seen firsthand their enormous 
impact in my own district of Silicon Valley. 
This resolution honors their struggles in 
coming to America, and thanks them for all they’ve done—and continue to do—for our country.

clean energy economy. We should be able to 
do better than this. 
The Military Construction and Veterans Af-
fairs appropriations bill is usually something that we can all find common ground on—the importance of standing up for our nation’s vet-erans transcends partisan battles. This year, however, the bill Republican leadership put on the floor not only shortchanged our veterans and servicemen and women, but the modest increase in spending over last year’s bill will require cuts to critical public spending on edu-cation, health care, and infrastructure in later appropriations bills. Even veterans service or-ganizations like Veterans of Foreign Wars urged opposition. The bill also included a pol-icy rider preventing the transfer of detainees from the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, a prison whose very existence undermines America’s security and international standing. Further, part of the spending of this bill is through the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) fund, an unrelated war slush-fund that is exempt from all budget caps. 
During consideration of this bill, I offered an 
amendment that would have allowed VA doc-tors to recommend medical marijuana to their patients in the states where it was legal if they so choose. Our veterans should have the same medicines available to them as every-one else, and we should not prohibit VA doc-tors from consulting with their patients in ac-cordance with their medical training and state law. I am disappointed that my amendment very narrowly failed, but I remain encouraged that we continue to build momentum in this issue, and gained significantly more bipartisan support than last year. 
The Energy and Water appropriations bill, 
while it contains some infrastructure funds that are critical to ports, waterways and freight movement integral to Oregon’s economy, ulti-mately contained too many provisions bad for the environment for me to support. It prohibits the Army Corps of Engineers from finalizing and implementing rules to ensure clean water in streams and wetlands that provide drinking water for one in three Americans. It dramati-cally underfunds renewable energy support programs, while propping up fossil fuels and nuclear weapons spending, and delivers deep cuts to programs that assist low income fami-lies with energy bills. It also contains non-sense amendments, such as a measure to prevent the Department of Energy from imple-menting a law requiring incandescent light bulbs to be more energy efficient, even though American manufacturers have already adopted the new standard. 
In addition, both of these bills adhere to the 
Republican budget’s overall spending caps that account for sequestration. These caps re-flect the lowest discretionary spending we’ve seen in ten years, and we simply cannot con-tinue to cut government programs that are so critical to environmental protection, health, education, economic stability and defense.

RECOGNIZING THE 2014 RESTON 
ASSOCIATION SERVICE AWARDS 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 1, 2015 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the recipients of the 2014 Reston Association Service Awards. The Reston As-
sociation (RA) is the largest homeowners’ as-sociation in Virginia and one of the largest in the country with more than 21,000 homes under its jurisdiction. Among other roles, RA serves as the steward of Reston’s architec-tural aesthetics, recreational amenities, and environmental resources. 
RA relies on hundreds of volunteers and 
dedicated staff who serve on boards, commit-tees, and projects to carry out its mission to keep Reston a model community where all can ‘‘Live, Work, Play, and Get Involved.’’ I am pleased to submit the names of the out-standing 2014 honorees. 
2014 Reston Association Volunteer of the 
Year—Mark Elder 
Mark Elder has volunteered his time as a 
tennis instructor for the last two years. He fills the gaps and works interchangeably with RA staff instructors. Mark gives his time willingly, energetically and consistently to the youth ten-nis community to ensure programs like this and many others are successful. 
2014 Reston Association Volunteer Group 
of the Year—Senior Movie Day Volunteers (Laura & John Cole, Pat Coshland, Michelina Johnson, Kurt McJilton, Otto & Rosemarie Tubito) 
This dynamic group of volunteers is the 
backbone of Senior Movie Day in Reston Town Center, which benefits up to 400 seniors each month. The group has been volunteering since 2007 and contributes 150 hours annu-ally, thereby reducing staff time needed to put on this great community event for the seniors in our community. 
2014 Reston Association Community Part-
ner of the Year—Clarke 
For three consecutive years, Clarke has se-
lected Reston for the Annual Clarke Day of Caring. Clarke employees monitor for mos-quito larvae in Reston’s restored streams and help educate RA’s watershed staff on mos-quito collection and identification. More than a dozen Clarke employees spend a full day re-moving invasive plants and removing trash from streams and other natural areas. This commitment to Reston and corporate vol-unteerism makes Clarke a standout partner. 
2014 Employee of the Year—Rob Tucker For 15 years Reston community members 
have been fortunate to see the smiling face of Rob Tucker on RA tennis courts. His passion for tennis is equal to his commitment to the community and the RA staff. He provides top- notch customer service, personalized instruc-tion, and overall cheerleading for the RA ten-nis programs. RA and the entire community couldn’t find a better advocate for the tennis and recreation programs available to Reston members. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in congratulating the recipients of the 2014 Reston Association Service Awards and in thanking them for dedicating their time, en-ergy, and resources to the improvement of the quality of life and health of the Reston com-munity.

consideration the bill (H.R. 2028) making ap-
propriations for energy and water develop-ment and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other pur-poses: 
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chair, I rise to 
congratulate Chairman M IKE SIMPSON and 
Ranking Member M ARCY KAPTUR for their 
leadership in preparing the FY 2016 Energy and Water Appropriations bill. Both of you de-serve thanks for your hard work putting to-gether a bill that supports programs critical to our nation’s security, safety, and economic competitiveness. Your bill prioritizes invest-ments in our critical nuclear security enter-prise, and creates more opportunities to ad-vance American competitiveness, and as-sumes the key role of the Army Corps of Engi-neers in resolving so many issues important to every state and Congressional District in the nation: navigation and flooding emergencies. 
To my mind, the defense programs included 
in your bill are its single most critical responsi-bility. The bill funds Weapons Activities at the National Nuclear Security Administration to en-sure that the Secretary of Energy has the in-vestments he needs to certify to the President that our nuclear stockpile is reliable. It is es-sential that we provide the safety, security and reliability of the nation’s nuclear weapons stockpile. These weapons are a vital part of our national defense postures and they are essential to meeting our commitments to our allies, even if they are never used. They are a deterrent. 
The bill also funds Naval Reactors, which 
supports our U.S. Navy’s nuclear-powered Fleet including the Ohio class replacement submarine and our aircraft carriers and other submarines. 
The Appropriations committee has always 
provided vigorous support for these national defense priorities and I thank Chairman S
IMP-
SONfor his work in this area. 
Additionally, scientific research at the De-
partment of Energy strengthens American competitiveness and enables true break-throughs in the energy sector, and the bill pre-serves and protects it, especially in fusion en-ergy, nuclear and fossil energy, and areas that will bolster our nation’s electric grid. The bill also protects public safety and keeps America literally open for business by providing for the Army Corps of Engineers to meet the need for navigable rivers and open and accessible ports. 
Finally, a word about Yucca Mountain. Many 
Members of Congress have been advocates for Yucca Mountain as we consider it essential to our nation’s energy independence. Decades of analysis, millions of documents, and billions of taxpayer dollars have been put towards the scientific examination of Yucca Mountain as a safe and secure geologic repository for nu-clear waste. Your bill includes funding to keep the license processing for Yucca Mountain moving forward and it also prohibits the Ad-ministration from moving ahead with any other plan not authorized by Congress. This will en-sure that we keep Congress in the driver’s seat for nuclear waste policy. 
Mr. Chair, former chairman of this sub-
committee, I know the challenge that you and Ms. K
APTUR faced crafting this bill. I commend 
you on the fine bill that you put together. This is a fiscally conservative bill, which funds crit-ical national security, jobs, and infrastructure priorities. This bill deserves our support. RECOGNIZING THE 24TH ANNUAL 
BEST OF RESTON AWARDS FOR COMMUNITY SERVICE 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 1, 2015 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the recipients of the 24th Annual Best of Reston Awards for Community Serv-ice. These awards are the result of collabora-tion between Cornerstones (formerly Reston Interfaith) and the Greater Reston Chamber of Commerce and are presented to individuals, organizations, and businesses whose extraor-dinary efforts make our community a better place. I am pleased to submit the names of the following recipients of the 2015 Best of Reston Awards: 
Civic/Community Organization: His Hidden 
Treasures (Troy and Lois Hughes)—Working in partnership with organizations dedicated to ending homelessness, His Hidden Treasures transforms transitional rental housing into homes for families, personalized with lovingly restored furniture, donated store floor samples and new housewares. 
Small Business Leader: Maid Bright (Maria 
Fedick, Yusuf and Zeynep Mehmetoglu)— Maid Bright has made a difference by pro-viding free house cleaning services to women with cancer, catering dinners for the hypo-thermia shelter, performing cleaning for Cor-nerstones’ transitional housing units, offering discounts to seniors, veterans, firefighters, and teachers, and donating funds to help the homeless and Syrian refugees. 
Corporate Business Leader: Leidos (Mike 
Coogan, Director, Corporate Responsibility)— Since establishing its headquarters in Reston two years ago, Leidos—a worldwide leader in science and technology—immediately made broad and deep connections in the commu-nity. Leidos employees have provided more than 32,000 volunteer hours benefitting a wide range of organizations. The company also has contributed significant financial support to the community. Leidos has lent its support to meeting basic human needs, and supports training, education, and employment opportu-nities for returning veterans. 
Corporate Business Leader: MAXIMUS 
(Susan Boren, Mark Andrekovich, Tom Romeo)—MAXIMUS provides health and human service programs to a diverse array of communities. MAXIMUS and its employees have supported a wide range of organizations that work locally to strengthen the safety net for homeless and at-risk families, or those with special needs. 
Individual Community Leader: Francis C. 
Steinbauer—A true Reston Pioneer, Fran Steinbauer has been an integral part of the community’s history and success for five dec-ades. In 1964, Mr. Steinbauer became the De-sign Engineer responsible for the creation and government approval of plans for Reston’s buildings and infrastructure, and he remained professionally involved in the development of Reston until the 1980s. As a volunteer to this day, he has played a vital role in making sure Reston’s economy, community, and inclusive culture were as well developed as its physical environment. At Cornerstones, he is revered as the architect of its successful affordable housing program, and he continues to work for the ideal that anyone can live in our commu-
nity. 
Vade Bolton-Ann Rodriguez Legacy Award: 
Casey Veatch—A dedicated volunteer for many different organizations, Casey leads by example and inspires others to follow suit. He has generously supported and cultivated lead-ership through his work with Leadership Fair-fax, Reston Bible Church, Northern Virginia Family Service, the Greater Reston Chamber of Commerce, and numerous children’s sports teams. 
Individual Community Leader: Larry Butler— 
The Reston Association’s Senior Director of Parks, Recreation, and Community Re-sources, Larry’s lifelong passion for the out-doors and physically active lifestyle has in-spired his tireless volunteer work. In more than 30 years with Reston Association, Larry has been instrumental in the success of Reston’s many outdoors and athletics activi-ties. These events help create environmental awareness, build community spirit, promote healthy lifestyles, and raise funds for a wide variety of causes. 
2015 Robert E. Simon Community Service 
Award: Lynn Lillienthal—A Restonian for more than forty years, Ms. Lillienthal was named a Best of Reston recipient in 1998, and has cer-tainly not rested on that accolade. She has served on the board of directors of virtually every major nonprofit institution in Reston, in-cluding Reston Interfaith, the Embry Rucker Community Shelter Citizens Support Com-mittee, Greater Reston Arts Center, and the Reston Historic Trust, just to name a few. Her decades of service have touched thousands of lives in the community. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join 
me in congratulating the 2015 Best of Reston honorees for their tremendous contributions to our community. I express my sincere gratitude to these individuals, businesses, and organiza-tions for lending their time and energy to the betterment of our community.

HONORING THE CITY OF CAPE 
MAY AS A UNITED STATES COAST GUARD COMMUNITY 
HON. FRANK A. LoBIONDO 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 1, 2015 
Mr. L OBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I recognize 
the County of Cape May on its designation as a ‘‘Coast Guard Community’’ on October 1, 2014 by the United States Coast Guard and the United States Congress. 
In 1924, the Coast Guard established oper-
ations to support U.S. Customs efforts in Sewell’s Point. By 1948, the Training Center, which is the only recruit training facility in the country, became the entry-level training facility for all of the East Coast and eventually the en-tire country. Today, the base has more than 860 military and civilian personnel, and grad-uates an average of more than 2,300 recruits yearly. 
This new designation reflects the mutually 
beneficial relationship between the Coast Guard and Cape May County. Over the years, the recruits and military and civilian personnel have become part of our Cape May County family. And nothing says family more than Op-eration Fireside. Since the program’s inception

On May 8, the people of Cape May County 
and the United States Coast Guard will cele-brate this designation at the Training Center in Cape May. My thanks to all who helped make this designation a reality.

BUILDING SAFETY MONTH 
HON. PETER WELCH 
OF VERMONT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 1, 2015 
Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on 
the occasion of the start of Building Safety Month, to recognize the importance of building safety and to recognize the leadership of the International Code Council (ICC) that develops and publishes the model building safety and energy efficiency model codes used in my home state of Vermont, and each of the other 49 states. Increasingly, these codes, devel-oped in the United States, are being adopted in other nations where safety in construction is desired. 
Over the past few years, we have had sev-
eral sobering reminders about the importance of building codes. In other nations, much like the case in the U.S. before the codes were widely adopted, natural events and poor con-struction practices still cause catastrophic loss of life. Every year, deadly fires, tornados, windstorms, floods, earthquakes and other events remind us of the critical need for strong buildings. As Congress discusses the need for resilience and greater energy efficiency in our communities, Building Safety Month reminds us that key elements of resilience and energy efficiency are properly enforced building and energy codes. 
The theme of this year’s Building Safety 
Month is ‘‘Resilient Communities start with Building Codes.’’ I want to congratulate the leaders of the ICC, which has sponsored Building Safety Month in May every year for over 30 years. The leaders of ICC, including President Guy Tomberlin, Branch Chief Resi-dential/Light Commercial Inspections for Fair-fax County, Virginia; Vice-President Alex Olszowy III, Building Inspection Supervisor, Lexington/Fayette Urban County Government, Kentucky; Secretary/Treasurer M. Dwayne Garriss, State Fire Marshal, State of Georgia; Past President of the Board of Directors, Ste-phen Jones, Construction Official, Millburn Township/Short Hills, New Jersey will join ICC’s Chief Executive Officer Dominic Sims in Washington the week of May 25th to discuss the critical need to support the adoption and enforcement of current building codes, to make sure Americans are safe at home, at work, at school and at play. 
I also want to congratulate the leaders of 
the Building Safety Association of Vermont ICC, including President Glenn Moore and the other leaders of the Vermont ICC Chapter. 
I would also like to thank the thousands of 
men and women who work every day to make sure our buildings comply with building and fire codes. Their work, largely unseen and often unnoticed, is critical to keeping Ameri-cans safe. The model building codes, devel-oped by ICC members from all 50 states, allow every community to share the advantage 
of adopting building codes that are adaptable to local conditions, but at the same time incor-porate the very latest research, materials, and building practices. This is achieved in a pri-vate-public partnership, saving local jurisdic-tions from bearing the large expense of code revision, updating and coordination. These model codes are produced through the co-operation of thousands of local U.S. code offi-cials working with the building industry to produce codes that represent a consensus on what the minimum safety requirements are for various building types, all without a dime of Federal taxpayer money. 
Congratulations to the hard working mem-
bers and leadership of the International Code Council.

RECOGNIZING MR. WILLIAM C. 
PHELON FOR HIS SERVICE 
HON. LEE M. ZELDIN 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 1, 2015 
Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Corporal William C. Phelon, Jr. and his distinguished contributions to the United States Air Force. Mr. Phelon enlisted in the United States Air Force immediately after graduating from Mineola High School in June of 1943 and entered active service August 16, 1943, at the height of American involvement in World War Two. Mr. Phelon served valiantly until he left the service in March of 1946. Cor-poral Phelon flew as part of the illustrious 96th Bombardment Group, serving as a Radio Op-erator Mechanic and Waist Gunner in a B–17 Flying Fortress. He was responsible for all radio equipment aboard the B–17 while in flight. 
In his position as Airman, Corporal Phelon 
participated in Operation Chowhound, a hu-manitarian mission which delivered over 11,000 tons of food to Nazi-occupied Holland during the Dutch Famine. This mission was so appreciated by the Dutch people that com-memorative ceremonies have been held every five years in Holland to remember the men who helped feed their starving people. The Third Air Division of the 8th Air Force was re-sponsible for delivering 4,103 tons of food, of which the 96th Bombardment Group dropped 366 tons. For his efforts, Corporal Phelon was awarded the Conspicuous Service Cross by Governor Thomas Dewey on behalf of the people of New York. Sadly, Mr. Phelon passed away in Decem-
ber of 2014. I rise today in memory of a brave man who was an exemplary member of the Armed Forces and the community at large, and to posthumously thank him for his years of dedication and service. I hope we all re-member the courage and dedication shown by Mr. Phelon in everything he did.

HONORING THE COALITION FOR 
HEALTHY COMMUNITIES ON THEIR 20TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ROBERT J. DOLD 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 1, 2015 
Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the Coalition for Healthy Communities on their 20th Anniversary. The Cancer Treat-ment Centers of America at Midwestern Re-gional Medical Center assembled the Coalition of leaders in the Zion-Benton Township to ef-fectively address the need to improve the health and wellness of our community. 
The Coalition’s focus is to provide the com-
munity with education on ways to access pri-mary health care, sexual education, immuniza-tions for young children, parental education, and adolescent substance abuse. The leaders of the Coalition are working hard to provide healthcare that extends beyond the walls of hospitals. 
Mr. Speaker, the Coalition of Healthy Com-
munities is essential to ensuring that Zion, Beach Park and Winthrop Harbor’s residents receive the proper tools to lead a healthy, safe and fulfilling life. I offered my sincere thanks to the Coalition for their efforts over the last 20 years and wish them continued success in the future.

HONORING JOHN BROOKS SUPER-
MARKET AND NETTIE ALVA-RADO 
HON. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM 
OF NEW MEXICO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 1, 2015 
Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New 
Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor John Brooks Supermarket, and in particular, Nettie Alvarado for her exceptional customer service and dedicated commitment to our sen-ior citizen community. 
Since 1979, John Brooks Supermarket has 
prided itself as a locally owned and operated establishment. The John Brooks on Candeleria and 12th Street in Albuquerque, New Mexico, certainly takes on this persona; it’s a neighborhood corner spot that caters to each of its customers on an individual level and takes great lengths to serve our senior community. 
That’s how I first heard about Nettie Alva-
rado, a radiant, compassionate woman who has spent thirty years of dedicated service to John Brooks’ customers. Every Monday and Thursday, store owner John Brooks and Nettie 
trade off delivering groceries to the senior community living at The Good Samaritan Soci-ety: Manzano Del Sol Village on 5201 Roma Avenue NE. These are crucial services for many of the seniors there who are unable to drive or take transportation to the grocery store. 
Nettie takes this dedication one step further. 
Customers will inform her of a sick friend, dis-abled relative or struggling senior and it’s not long before numbers are exchanged, a gro-cery list is filed and Nettie is off making deliv-eries. Nettie has earned a reputation for her selfless actions and genuine, heartfelt appre-ciation for others. When asked, Nettie will tell you ‘‘I want them to be taken care of’’ and has no qualms about dipping into her free time to ensure her beloved Albuquerque residents re-ceive the services they need. 
Nettie’s sentiment towards others extends 
beyond age, gender, race, and socioeconomic status—it’s universal. I am inspired to see that we have individuals like Nettie in our commu-nity and stores like John Brooks that put peo-ple first and serve our ailing seniors. By val-uing our community and continuing these practices of goodwill and shared responsibility we will achieve a better tomorrow and build a stronger America.

IN HONOR OF THE 50TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF HEAD START 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 1, 2015 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it is 
my great honor and pleasure to extend my sincerest congratulations to the students, par-ents, staff, and supporters of the Head Start program as they celebrate 50 remarkable years of eliminating poverty through education, services, and partnerships. Enrichment Serv-ices Program, Inc. (ESP) will celebrate Head Start’s 50th anniversary on Thursday, May 7, 2015 at noon at the Columbus Convention and Trade Center in Columbus, Georgia. 
After President Lyndon B. Johnson declared 
the War on Poverty in his 1964 State of the Union speech, Sargent Shriver, a key social and political figure, took the lead in assem-bling a panel of experts to develop a com-prehensive child development program that would help communities meet the needs of disadvantaged preschool children. The brain-child of this panel was Head Start, a program designed to help break the cycle of poverty by providing preschool children of low-income families with the tools and resources to meet their emotional, social, nutritional, and psycho-logical needs. 
In 1965, the Office of Economic Opportunity 
launched an eight-week program called Project Head Start. Fifty years later, Head Start has served more than 30 million children, becoming an integral component of America’s education system. 
Enrichment Services Program, Inc. is a 
community action agency that provides essen-tial services to alleviate poverty levels, pro-mote family stability, and gradually build self- sufficiency. It was established in 1964 and op-erated as the Community Action Development Committee. The Agency was incorporated in 1965 as the ‘‘Lower Chattahoochee Commu-
nity Action Agency, Inc.’’ In 1974, when Presi-dent Gerald Ford signed the Head Start Eco-nomic Opportunity and Community Partnership Act, Head Start funding was allocated to local community action agencies such as ESP. 
Enrichment Services Program, Inc. admin-
isters the Early Head Start and Head Start programs within a nine-county area, including Chattahoochee, Clay, Harris, Muscogee, Quitman, Randolph, Stewart, and Talbot coun-ties, located in Georgia, and Russell County in Alabama. Each year, ESP serves approxi-mately 1,000 children ages 0–5 from low-in-come families. 
The Head Start program has been essential 
to the early childhood development and for-
ward progression of many children and their families. Head Start evaluates and works to improve six domains of early childhood devel-opment: social/emotional, physical, language, cognitive, literacy, and mathematics. Through Head Start, ESP addresses the basic needs of each child and prepares them for entry into kindergarten. ESP also encourages parent in-volvement by offering services such as family literacy functions and parental input into the curriculum. 
In the 2013–2014 program year, children in 
ESP’s Head Start program made remarkable accomplishments. In the Cognitive domain alone, an average of 96% of children exceed-ed growth range. There were 505 three- and four-year-olds who were ready to read by the end of the school year. 
Enrichment Services Program, Inc. has 
done an outstanding job of administering the Head Start program in the area that it serves. Because of the dedication and commitment of the teachers and the staff, thousands of chil-dren have gone on to achieve greater heights in primary, secondary, and higher education than they otherwise would have done. I firmly believe that Head Start’s outreach will con-tinue to help preschool children and their fami-lies overcome the cycle of poverty to lead suc-cessful and productive lives. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join 
me and the more than 730,000 residents of Georgia’s Second Congressional District in ex-pressing our profound gratitude to Enrichment Services Program, Inc. and to Head Start for working to improve educational outcomes for preschool children, which not only produces positive effects throughout their lives but also creates a ripple effect of improvement in the communities in which they live.

Friday, May 1, 2015 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize Herndon-Reston FISH, Inc. and the 2015 ‘‘Star Fish’’ Honorees. 
Since 1969, Herndon-Reston FISH, Inc. has 
provided Friendly, Instant, Sympathetic Help for neighbors in need in Reston and Herndon. FISH meets immediate critical needs for rental assistance, furniture, utilities, medical care, and other emergencies. FISH also manages a thrift shop, operates an information and refer-ral service, and offers financial workshops to

provide clients with the tools necessary to 
achieve and maintain self-sufficiency. 
During fiscal year 2014, FISH assisted a 
total of 2,337 families (5,665 people), gave emergency financial assistance to 1,328 fami-lies, and helped 180 families by providing them with used furniture and/or other house-hold necessities. FISH collected, assembled, and distributed Thanksgiving food baskets for 965 people and holiday food and gift baskets in December for 967 people. More than 800 volunteer hours were spent working at United Christian Parish on these two projects in co-ordination with other human service providers in Fairfax County. In addition, volunteer drivers provided 294 free rides for the elderly and other needy individuals to and from their med-ical appointments. 
At its annual gala, FISH recognizes individ-
uals and companies who have made extraor-dinary contributions over the past year. I am pleased to submit the names of the 2015 ‘‘Star Fish’’ honorees: 
Jocelyn Colao has been a volunteer pricer 
at FISH’s thrift shop, The Bargain Loft, for over 20 years. Jocelyn specializes in identi-fying, cleaning, pricing, and displaying donated linens. Her careful handling of vintage lace and fragile fabrics greatly increases their value. In addition to her work with donated lin-ens, Jocelyn’s lifetime of traveling makes her an indispensable part of the pricing team. The years she lived in Europe and Africa make her a great resource when identifying unusual and valuable donations. 
Jane and Mike Drewes were long-time Res-
ton residents who volunteered in the commu-nity in many capacities. In 2007 they moved to Shepherdstown, WV but continued to drive to Reston for volunteer activities. They started volunteering for FISH in 2006, the year of the first FISH Fling Gala and Fundraiser. Jane de-signed the decorations and they built the huge FISH sign that has been used behind the band at every Fling Gala. Mike created an auction check-out program that accelerates the check-out process and has been used at many charitable events. 
Diane Mandel manages the huge tasks of 
establishing and maintaining the schedule of Assistance Workers who handle the client re-quests for financial assistance from FISH. These volunteers make FISH’s ‘‘Instant’’ help a reality. Diane makes certain the volunteers are trained and ready to take calls and she serves as a phone volunteer herself. 
Chuck Veatch, owner of Charles A. Veatch 
& Associates, provided three storage units for FISH free of charge for many years and is well known throughout the community for his support of a wide variety of organizations and causes. 
CDW is a leading provider of integrated in-
formation technology solutions in the U.S. and Canada and has been a FISH Fling sponsor since 2008. CDW has provided many fabulous electronic products for our games and for both our silent and live auctions. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join 
me in commending Herndon-Reston FISH for 46 years of service. I also extend my personal congratulations to this year’s honorees and express my sincere appreciation to these indi-viduals for contributing their time and energy to helping the most vulnerable in our commu-nity. HONORING RICHARD ARROWOOD 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 1, 2015 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor Richard Arrowood for 50 years of exceptional winemaking, exclusively in Sonoma County. Mr. Arrowood has been, and continues to be, a tireless advocate and fierce supporter of grape growing and wine making in Sonoma County. We therefore rec-ognize and thank Mr. Arrowood today for his unwavering support and relentless efforts to preserve and promote the Sonoma County wine industry. 
Born and educated locally, Mr. Arrowood 
began his wine-making career in 1965. He got his start at Korbel Champagne Cellars and soon moved on to work with the legendary Rodney Strong. His education and experience helped his first vintage receive critical acclaim, and each subsequent vintage after that ce-mented his status as one of the most re-spected vintners in the area. 
A pioneer in the field of viticulture, Mr. 
Arrowood worked with a wide array of unique varietals, a concept that was ahead of its time. His efforts changed the perception of wine from Sonoma County, and the total number of vineyard acres in the county has increased fivefold over the time he has been in business. He was one of the first to emphasize vineyard designations on his wines, a trend that has since spread across the world. This success and influence on the industry led to an offer from Robert Mondavi to buy Arrowood Winery, which Mr. Arrowood accepted so he could re-turn to focusing on the art of fine winemaking. 
Amapola Creek Vineyards is his latest 
project, which is quite simply Richard’s quest to make his greatest wines ever, and is a per-fect example of the phrase ‘‘saving the best for last.’’ Its main focus is using the special fruit grown on Moon Mountain and its unique terrior. Devoting himself entirely to the new Sonoma vineyard, Richard bought the adja-cent land and built a home for his family. The vineyard uses exclusively organic methods to produce just 3,000 hand-crafted cases annu-ally in its state-of-the-art facilities. Here, he continues to showcase Sonoma County in the groundbreaking way he did many years ago when he started his journey. 
Mr. Speaker, it is appropriate at this time 
that we recognize Richard Arrowood for his role as an outspoken supporter of the produc-tion of high quality wines in Sonoma County. His impact on the growth of Sonoma wine cannot be overstated and for this it is only right that he be honored here today.

HONORING MANUEL PROL ON THE 
OCCASION OF HIS 100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. JOSEPH CROWLEY 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 1, 2015 
Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Manuel Prol, who will turn 100 on April 4, 2015. Manuel is a World War II veteran and cherished father of three, grandfather of three, and great-grandfather of five. Manuel was born on Easter Sunday in 
Samieira, a tiny village or ‘‘aldea’’ in the north-west corner of Spain in 1915. He was the youngest of four children and only son of Agripina Rodino and Antonio Prol. In 1932, he bade farewell to his mother for the last time and emigrated to the United States. Manuel would also not see his three sisters, Agripina, Peregrina, and Dolores, again until 1960. 
He was reunited with his father in New York 
City, where he settled in a Spanish-speaking neighborhood around 14th Street. Manuel em-braced his new home, learning English at Julia Richmond High School in Gramercy Park while working at the Roosevelt Hotel. 
In 1941, he married Vicenta Prol and soon 
after entered the U.S. Army Air Force at the outset of World War II. Manuel saw action on three continents over the course of the war, honorably serving his country in Europe, Afri-ca, and Asia. When he returned home, Manuel and Vicenta settled in the Bronx and had three daughters: Pilar, Victoria, and Consuelo. Over the years, their family has grown and spread out across the country. 
Pilar, their oldest daughter, was a nurse for 
over forty years. She married Charles Sergis in 1964 and had three children: Alicia, Laura, and Charles. They also have five grand-children: Catie, Noah, Matthew, Juliana, and Grace. Pilar and Charles live in Redondo Beach, California. 
Victoria lives in Bronxville, New York. She 
worked in Westchester County as a high school language teacher for over thirty years. 
Consuelo is married to Richard Liebowitz 
and lives in New York City and Montclair, New Jersey. She retired from the business world after thirty-eight years in sales. 
Manuel and Vicenta retired to Southern 
California in 1982, where they lived happily until Vicenta’s death in 1997. Manuel then moved to Montclair, New Jersey, where he currently lives with Consuelo and Richard. He spends winters in Redondo Beach, California with Pilar and Charles. 
Next month, Manuel will turn 100 years 
old—yet shows no signs of slowing down. He still writes letters and reads the newspaper every day. Manuel attributes his longevity to the Mediterranean diet, a glass of red wine every day, and yes, an occasional Rusty Nail, his favorite drink. 
I hope all my colleagues will join me in 
wishing Manuel Prol a happy 100th birthday, and continued health and happiness to him and to his family.

residents are foreign born and approximately 
40% are minorities. Half of our foreign-born population emigrated from Asia, and more than 80,000 of our neighbors speak an Asian language at home. 
Northern Virginia has a robust international 
business community and is home to the larg-est concentration of minority-owned tech-nology firms in the nation. The AACC and its members contribute greatly to our economic strength and stability; Asian-American busi-nesses generate more than 52% of total reve-nues generated by all minority owned busi-nesses in this region. 
In Fairfax County alone, more than 19,000 
businesses are Asian-owned. These busi-nesses generate approximately $5 billion in revenue and create more than 30,000 jobs. Each year, the AACC recognizes businesses and non-profits in the Asian-American commu-nity for their outstanding contributions to the Metropolitan Washington community and economy. I congratulate the following hon-orees: 
Small Business Award: The Tu’s Group Champions of Diversity: Morgan Stanley Asian Business Excellence Award: Zantech

HONORING SHANE FENLEY 
HON. LYNN A. WESTMORELAND 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 1, 2015 
Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, I 
come before you today to recognize an act of great kindness by one of my constituents, Shane Fenley. Shane lives in Griffin, Georgia and has been a UPS employee since 1999. It was at his job that Shane met Wayne Goree, they’ve been coworkers and friends ever since. The Goree family lives in Senoia and they have a 14 year old son, Justin. Justin has been sick off and on for some time, and was in need of a kidney transplant. When Shane heard that his friend’s child was in need, he volunteered his own kidney. 
Shane went through the process of getting 
tested to see if he was a match. The results showed that he was a 90% match and the doctors knew that wasn’t close enough. Next, Shane and Justin entered the Paired Donor Exchange program, where patients and do-nors are matched together. Because Shane wasn’t a match for Justin, he gave his kidney to another person, who in return gave their kidney to Justin. Shane gave his kidney to a complete stranger, so that Justin could receive the kidney he so desperately needed. To give a child the gift of life is one of the most admi-rable acts a man can do. 
My nephew Todd, has also worked at UPS 
with Shane for many years. When describing Shane, Todd explained that he has always been willing to give the shirt off his back to any one in need. Now he will be known as the man who will literally give you the kidney out 
of his back and ask for nothing in return. Shane said the reason behind his donation was that he had 41 years of good health under his belt, and Justin, at the age of 14, had not had any. The selflessness and kind-ness that Shane displayed is lacking in our world today and we could use more people like Shane Fenley. 
Shane and Justin—It is an honor to rep-
resent you. I wish you both a speedy recovery and that you both live a long and happy life.

TRIBUTE TO SCOTT A. BAILEY 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 1, 2015 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor and pay tribute to Scott A. Bailey, an in-dividual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Moreno Valley, California are exceptional. Moreno Valley has been for-
tunate to have dynamic and dedicated people who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a bet-ter place to live and work. Scott Bailey is one of these individuals. 
After graduating from Moreno Valley High 
School as an Eagle Scout, Scott married his wife Beverly and started working as an elec-trician in 1981. The couple had three children, bought a home in Moreno Valley, and had humble, yet unselfishly universal dreams about putting their children through college and saving enough to retire easily. Living in the economy of the early nineties, Scott and Beverly brainstormed about the best options to keep her from returning to her job in real es-tate and decided to start their own electrical contracting business out of their own home. 
The Baileys had a remarkable vision to cre-
ate a construction company based on an un-wavering commitment to quality and not only did they achieve this goal, but by doing so, ev-erything else seemed to fall into line. Strong-hold Engineering built a solid reputation as the go to contractor for civil, design/build, and high voltage electrical projects on both a national and international level. This allowed the com-pany to become ranked and win several awards. 
Scott is responsible for day-to-day oper-
ations as the Chief Operating Officer and sup-ports all Stronghold Engineering field per-sonnel, resources, and projects. Over the course of the company’s 23-year history, he has managed and directed over 450 projects, with the average project sizes ranging from $500,000 to well over $100,000,000. 
Scott has always been a hands-on manager 
making visits to each project site ensuring only the best quality and safety standards are met whether he’s making trips to Europe, South Africa, Russia, Canada, or Mexico, he remains humble and true to his roots by giving back to the world community as well as his own. Scott has chaired the ABC Craft Championships Committee, has helped in the rebuilding efforts in devastated New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, and in Mexico, helped to build an or-phanage for at risk children. Stronghold re-cently donated all labor in helping two local Riverside churches switch to solar energy. 
In light of all Scott Bailey has done for the 
community of Moreno Valley, it is clear that he deserves the Distinguished Citizen Award. 
Scott’s tireless passion for the community has contributed immensely to the betterment of Moreno Valley, California. He has been the heart and soul of many community projects, and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he receives this prestigious award.

RECOGNIZING VFW POST 7327 AND 
THE 2015 AWARD RECIPIENTS 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 1, 2015 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize the Springfield Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 7327 and the recipients of its 2015 Annual Awards. 
The Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) traces 
its beginnings to 1899 when veterans of the Spanish American War established local orga-nizations to bring awareness to their service and to advocate for veterans retirement bene-fits and improved medical care. Annually, the nearly 2 million members of the VFW and its Auxiliaries contribute more than 8.6 million hours of volunteerism in the community, in-cluding participation in Make A Difference Day and National Volunteer Week. 
With approximately 600 Comrades and 150 
Ladies Auxiliary members, the Springfield VFW Post 7327 stands out for the depth of its commitment to our community. Often called ‘‘The Friendliest VFW Post in Virginia,’’ Post 7327 has one of the most aggressive ADOPT–A–UNIT programs in the entire VFW organization to support our service members stationed overseas. VFW Post 7327 visits the VA hospital at least quarterly, bringing along goodie bags for our Wounded Warriors. Each Thanksgiving and Christmas, VFW Post 7327 adopts military families in need through the USO and provides them with meal baskets for each holiday, gifts for children, commissary cards for the parents, and a Christmas party where the children can meet Santa and re-ceive a gift-filled stocking. The Ladies Auxiliary members collect, sort, and distribute more than 2,000 pieces of clothing each month to various charitable organizations. VFW Post 7327 is a strong supporter of local youth orga-nizations including the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, and Little League Baseball that con-tribute greatly to the education and well-being of our children. 
Each year, VFW Post 7327 bestows awards 
to local students who have submitted out-standing essays on a theme and to local teachers and public safety officers in recogni-tion of their extraordinary actions and dedica-tion. I am honored to submit the names of the following 2015 honorees:

IN RECOGNITION OF LTC JOEL 
DAVIS, JR. 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 1, 2015 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a terrific educator, strong civic leader, and outstanding citizen, Lieutenant Colonel Joel Davis, Jr. (U.S. Army). LTC Davis will be retiring from his post as Pro-fessor of Military Science and Commander of the Senior ROTC Wildcat Battalion at the Fort Valley State University (FVSU). He will be honored by the administration, faculty, stu-dents, and supporters at FVSU’s 2015 Spring Commencement Ceremony on Saturday, May 2, 2015 in Fort Valley, Georgia. 
A native of Swainsboro, Georgia, LTC Joel 
Davis, Jr. graduated as a Distinguished Mili-tary Graduate and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Criminal Justice from Sa-vannah State College, now Savannah State University, in 1990. In 2004, he earned a Mas-ter’s degree in Military Operational Art and Science from Air University, Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama, and a Master of Science degree in Human Resource Man-agement from Troy University in Troy, Ala-bama. 
LTC Davis’ overseas tours of duty include 
the Republic of Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Panama, Marshall Islands, Guam, Kuwait, Baghdad, Iraq, and Haiti. His most recent as-signments include serving as Chief of Intel-ligence for the United Nations Humanitarian Assistance Mission in Haiti, where he served as the Senior Military Intelligence Advisor to the Force Commander, Contingent Com-manders, and staff in support of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. In 2007–2009, he served as the Chief of Intelligence/G2 for the 8th Theater Sustainment Command, the Brigade S3/Oper-ations Officer, 500th Military Intelligence Bri-gade and the Battalion Executive Officer, 205th Military Battalion in Fort Shafter, Hawaii. LTC Davis has held several other Command and key billets during his 30 years of military service, including his time as an Infantryman in the U.S. Marine Corps. 
The Second Congressional District of Geor-
gia gained a respected and compassionate leader when LTC Davis arrived in Fort Valley, Georgia in June 2011 to serve as Professor of Military Science and Commander of the Senior ROTC Wildcat Battalion at Fort Valley State University, with partnerships at Albany State University and Darton College in Albany, 
Georgia. In this capacity, LTC Davis provided command and control over recruiting, devel-oping, training, and retaining more than 155 Cadets, as well as the commissioning of 13 second lieutenants annually. He developed guidance and program objectives for 10 Cadre/Staff members to meet annual training and mission requirements. As the Department Head, LTC Davis managed an effective and efficient military science program that exceed-ed the high standards set by the U.S. Army and Fort Valley State University. 
During his time at FVSU, LTC Davis has 
fostered valuable relationships with the Univer-sity administration, faculty, community part-ners, and external centers of influence, as well as with Army recruiting organizations, the U.S. Army Reserve, and the Army National Guard. He supports numerous JROTC units and high schools throughout the state of Georgia and beyond to help motivate America’s youth to become better citizens. An excellent role model and mentor, LTC Davis is a loyal and 
altruistic leader who is committed to assisting young command members develop life skills and realize their full potential. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me, my wife Vivian, and the Fort Valley State University community in honoring Lieutenant Colonel Joel Davis, Jr. for his contributions to the Fort Valley State University and to our great nation.

HONORING RABBI LEONID FELD-
MAN OF TEMPLE BETH EL IN WEST PALM BEACH 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 1, 2015 
Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Leonid Feldman, who is the rabbi of Temple Beth El in West Palm Beach, Florida. Rabbi Feldman has led a remarkable life. Growing up in the Soviet Republic of Moldavia, where the open practice of Judaism was forbidden, he was unaware that he was Jewish. At age 21, he had learned enough to become a passionate Zionist and applied for a visa to emigrate. For this, he was imprisoned by Soviet authorities as a ‘‘refusenik.’’ 
Eventually, Rabbi Feldman was allowed to 
leave the Soviet Union and emigrated to Israel, where he became a citizen and served honorably in the Israeli army. Following his time in Israel, he became Director of Edu-cation for Soviet Emigres in Italy. Rabbi Feld-man eventually came to the United States, where he decided to attend the Jewish Theo-logical Seminary, becoming the first and still the only Soviet-born Conservative rabbi in America. 
Rabbi Feldman has testified in front of the 
U.S. Congress and the Commission on Secu-rity and Cooperation in Europe (the Helsinki Commission). A respected and much in de-mand lecturer, he has spoken to audiences in 37 states and 19 countries and authored fea-tured articles in national newspapers. Rabbi Feldman has been a visiting professor at the Jewish University of Moscow and the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, his alma mater. 
Since 2004, he has been the spiritual leader 
of Temple Beth El in West Palm Beach where, in 2013, he was bar mitzvahed at age 60. 
Rabbi Leonid Feldman is widely known and much loved by the members of his congrega-tion, his fellow clerics of all denominations and people throughout Palm Beach County. I am pleased to honor this remarkable man, who is truly deserving of being recognized in the an-nals of our nation.

RECOGNIZING DEAN KLEIN FOR 
RECEIPT OF LEADERSHIP FAIR-FAX’S KATHERINE K. HANLEY PUBLIC SERVICE AWARD FOR 2015 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 1, 2015 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize this year’s recipient of Leadership Fair-fax’s Katherine K. Hanley Public Service Award. This year’s award goes to Dean Klein, a 1997 graduate of Leadership Fairfax. 
Leadership Fairfax is a nonprofit corporation 
dedicated to finding, training, and growing leaders in Northern Virginia. Leadership Fair-fax seeks to build leaders who raise the tide not only in their organization or local commu-nity but also across the whole Northern Vir-ginia region. Graduates from its programs be-come part of and stay connected to a fast growing number of civic leaders. I’ve always said, ‘‘When you walk into a room, it’s easy to spot the Leadership Fairfax graduates—they just stand out!’’ 
Northern Virginia is blessed with many lead-
ers who have given their time and service to make a difference in our community. To rec-ognize these outstanding leaders among us, Leadership Fairfax instituted the Katherine K. Hanley Public Service Award. This annual award, now in its 12th year, honors an indi-vidual for his or her outstanding accomplish-ments in the areas of public service employ-
ment or service on a public board, authority, or commission and for lasting contributions to the quality of life in the community. 
Dean Klein has stood out in our community 
for many years. He currently serves as Direc-tor of the Office to Prevent and End Home-lessness in Fairfax County since being ap-pointed by the Board of Supervisors in March 2009. I was pleased to help establish that of-fice under the 10-year Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness, an initiative the County launched when I served as Chairman of the Board. Under Mr. Klein’s leadership, Fairfax has partnered with the neighboring City of Falls Church so that these jurisdictions can take a regional approach to the problem of homelessness. One of his many successes has been to increase the number of individ-uals moving out of emergency shelters to per-manent housing. He grew this number from 243 in 2010 to 926 individuals in 2014. As a result of that and other efforts, Fairfax has ac-tually reduced the number of people experi-encing homelessness by more than one-third, becoming a standout model for success for those communities still struggling to break the cycle of homelessness. For his accomplish-ments Mr. Klein was recognized in 2014 with Fairfax County’s highest employee honor, the A. Heath Onthank Award. 
Prior to working in his current position he 
served as the Senior Community Relations

Manager at the Freddie Mac Foundation, the 
metropolitan area’s largest corporate philan-thropic funder. He oversaw the Foundation’s support for housing programs throughout the United States and oversaw the Foundation’s investments in the Gulf Coast area after Hurri-cane Katrina. Mr. Klein came to the Founda-tion from Doorways for Women and Families in Arlington, where he was executive director and oversaw all operations for the organiza-tion including a Safehouse for Domestic Vio-lence, Emergency Shelter for homeless fami-lies, a Thrift Store, and transitional housing for families. Mr. Klein also served for six years as executive director of Shelter House, over-seeing this organization and serving homeless families in our community. He earned a Mas-ter of Social Work degree from Howard Uni-versity, and a Bachelor of Arts degree in Jour-nalism and Advertising from Ohio State Uni-versity. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in congratulating Dean Klein for receiving the Katherine K. Hanley Public Service Award and in thanking Leadership Fairfax for continuing to develop such talented and passionate lead-ers for Northern Virginia.

IN RECOGNITION OF THETA BOULE ´ 
OF SIGMA PI PHI FRATERNITY 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 1, 2015 
Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I proudly rise 
today to recognize a significant milestone in one of the pre-eminent organizations, not only in the Fifth Congressional District of Missouri, which I proudly represent, but throughout the region—Theta Boule ´of Sigma Pi Phi Frater-
nity. I am especially proud to be a member of Theta Boule ´. The milestone I mentioned is the 
celebration of its Centennial observance that will be held June 4–6, 2015 in Kansas City. 
Theta Boule ´was chartered on May 22, 
1915 with fourteen founding Archons who laid a strong foundation of fraternal fellowship in the Greater Kansas City Metropolitan Area. Dr. William J. Tompkins met Grand Sire Archon William C McCard while traveling in the eastern part of the country and was au-thorized by the Grand Sire Archon to plan the organization of a member Boule ´in Kansas 
City. With the cooperation of Archons from Beta Boule ´in Chicago and Eta Boule ´in St. 
Louis, Dr. Tompkins and his colleague, Dr. Lloyd E. Bailer organized Theta Boule ´. The 
charter Archons of Theta Boule ´were all out-
standing members of the Kansas City commu-nity and of their respective professions. Faced with cultural realities of the early Twentieth Century, these Archons found in each other a source of mutual support, enlightenment and a retreat of friendship and fraternity. Each sensed a significant void created by the perva-sive permanence of American institutional rac-ism and exclusionary practices predominant during that era. Throughout its history, the Archons of Theta Boule ´have upheld the high 
standards of Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity. 
Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity, also known as ‘‘The 
Boule ´’’, was founded in 1904 in Philadelphia.

TRIBUTE TO A. ALFRED TAUBMAN 
HON. SANDER M. LEVIN 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 1, 2015 
Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay 
tribute to A. Alfred Taubman, who made im-measurable contributions to my home state of Michigan and to our nation. Mr. Taubman passed away on April 17, 2015. 
Mr. Taubman, known to many of us as Al, 
loomed large in the business, cultural and reli-gious life of Southeast Michigan and far be-yond, but his beginnings were far more mod-est. The son of Jewish German immigrants, Mr. Taubman began working at the age of 9 after his father’s business went bankrupt dur-ing the Great Depression. After serving in the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II, Mr. Taubman attended the University of Michigan, where he studied architecture. 
The seeds of Al Taubman’s success were 
watered by these experiences—his father’s construction company, his studies in architec-ture, and the drive to work hard from a very young age. He also had a keen understanding of the needs and wants of people in America’s postwar economy, a period in which people 
migrated from cities to what would become thriving suburbs. Rather than building homes as his father did, Mr. Taubman focused on the shopping needs of suburban families, and helped to pioneer the growth of shopping malls. 
Over the years, Mr. Taubman’s company 
designed, built, and operated shopping malls throughout the country. These malls, and 
other investments, brought him significant wealth—wealth he decided to put to use not just in his business endeavors, but in a vast array of worthy causes. Dr. Mark Schlissel, President of the University of Michigan, quoted Mr. Taubman as having said that his father taught him that ‘‘If I make a donation, I have given once. If I then solicit monies, I gave twice. And if my contribution has inspired oth-ers to support a good cause, I will have given three times.’’ The University of Michigan and its missions were especially close to Al Taubman’s heart, as Dr. Schlissel and the en-tire U of M community would attest. While it is not possible to list each and every institution which benefited so greatly from Mr. Taubman’s philanthropy, some of those which did in addition to the University of Michigan are Lawrence Technological University (where he also studied), Wayne State University, the College for Creative Studies, Harvard Univer-sity’s John F. Kennedy School, Brown Univer-sity, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, the Jewish Federation, United Jewish Foundation of Metro Detroit and the Damon J. Keith Center for Civil Rights. 
Simply listing the institutions to which Al 
Taubman contributed so much does not pro-vide the full measure of the person he was. On his death I communicated these thoughts: ‘‘Al Taubman impacted the well-being of mil-lions who never met him because of his un-wavering support for the health and education needs of all Americans. He earned great wealth but never forgot his roots. He reached the top but maintained compassion for the un-derdog. He could be very blunt but even more sensitive about the feelings of the others. He was much beloved by all of us privileged to know him over many years.’’ 
His commitment and active participation in 
the issues he cared about was on full display in the successful effort in 2008 to amend Michigan’s Constitution to legalize expanded embryonic stem cell research in my state. Mr. Taubman was not only a vital financial contrib-utor to the campaign, but as the Detroit Free Press noted, ‘‘. . . he crusaded in ways that couldn’t be measured by dollar signs, arguably providing stem cell advocates with their loud-est voice during the 2008 campaign.’’ He or-ganized a fundraiser with former President Bill Clinton, hosted meetings where people could learn more about the science involved, and weighed in with the press and with elected of-ficials on the merits of embryonic stem cell re-search and the need for the constitutional amendment. The measure passed. There is no doubt that had Al Taubman not so fully in-vested his time, talents, and resources into the effort the present pioneering efforts now being undertaken at the University of Michigan would not be happening. 
Mr. Speaker, the research at the A. Alfred 
Taubman Medical Research Institute on stems cells and beyond is a legacy of Al Taubman’s and is likely to benefit untold numbers of peo-ple in our lives facing chronic disease who will

never have heard his name, but fame is not 
what he sought. His many endeavors have touched and will touch the lives of countless Americans. I encourage my colleagues to join in paying tribute to his many contributions to our country, and in offering condolences to his family, including his wife, Judith Taubman; his children William Taubman, Robert Taubman, and Gayle Taubman Kalisman; his step-children Tiffany Dubin and Christopher Rounick; and to his nine grandchildren and great-grandchild.

IN RECOGNITION OF DR. ISAAC J. 
CRUMBLY 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 1, 2015 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a terrific educator and out-standing citizen, Dr. Isaac ‘‘Ike’’ Crumbly, who will be celebrating 50 remarkable years of teaching at the Fort Valley State University (FVSU) in Fort Valley, Georgia. He will be honored by the administration, faculty, stu-dents, and supporters at FVSU’s 2015 Spring Commencement Ceremony on Saturday, May 2, 2015 in Fort Valley, Georgia. 
Before earning two degrees in horticulture 
and a Ph.D. in botany, Dr. Isaac J. Crumbly was picking cotton to help support his ten brothers and sisters. With an inherent knowl-edge of the art of cultivation and the science of plant life, Dr. Crumbly was destined to end up at Fort Valley State University, a state and land-grant university founded in 1895 that has made significant contributions to agriculture and related fields. 
Dr. Crumbly joined the faculty of Fort Valley 
State College, now Fort Valley State Univer-sity, in 1965 as a Professor in the Biology De-partment. In the 50 intervening years, his role at the University has grown to include Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences and Director of the Cooperative Developmental Energy Pro-gram. 
In 1983, Dr. Crumbly founded the one-of-a- 
kind Cooperative Developmental Energy Pro-gram (CDEP), a dual-degree STEM education program, in response to a call for proposals from the U.S. Department of Energy. The pro-gram’s primary objective is to increase the number of minorities and women pursuing ca-reers in the energy industry. With more than $4 million dollars to support their education, students in the program have logged over 250,000 hours of hands-on experience. CDEP has been recognized by the University System of Georgia, the Georgia House of Representa-tives, and two U.S. Presidents, Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama, for its success. 
Always striving to help his students achieve 
greater heights, Dr. Crumbly has given of his time and talents to mentor thousands of FVSU students in his STEM classes. Through CDEP, he is responsible for the education, employ-ment, and successful careers of over 126 CDEP graduates who are engineers, geoscientists, and health physicists. 
Dr. Crumbly’s impact has stretched far be-
yond his immediate students, however. A skilled grantsman, Dr. Crumbly has helped bring in over $30 million for the University and its students through funded grants, intern-ships, and scholarships. He also has helped 
established partnerships with over 70 cor-porate, private, and university entities. Dr. Crumbly has been recognized numerous times by various professional and scholarly organi-zations for his work in educating students in STEM. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me, my wife Vivian, and the Fort Valley State University community in honoring Dr. Isaac J. Crumbly for 50 outstanding years of contrib-uting to the education and success of students at the Fort Valley State University.

CONGRATULATING MARION 
STILLSON FOR RECOGNITION AS THE RESTON CITIZEN ASSOCIA-TION’S CITIZEN OF THE YEAR FOR 2014 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 1, 2015 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to com-
mend Marion Stillson of Reston on being rec-ognized as the 2014 Citizen of the Year by the Reston Citizens Association. 
The Reston Citizens Association was found-
ed in 1967 to promote and protect Reston’s founding principles by serving as a non-par-tisan forum for all residents and as an advo-cate for the community with County and State governments. 
The RCA Citizen of the Year Award dates 
back to 1976 and honors an individual whose actions are consistent with the goals of Reston and the RCA. Recipients are recognized for contributing to the quality of life in Reston and for providing assistance to our neighbors in need. Marion and her husband Dick arrived in the Reston area in 1973. Marion’s service to the community began in October 1980 when she was selected as one of the first members of the Reston Community Center’s Board of Governors and provided valuable input on ac-cessibility issues. Since then, she has been in-volved in a wide variety of issues important to Reston, the region, the Commonwealth of Vir-ginia and the nation. 
Marion was elected Vice-President of RCA 
in 2009 and President in 2010 and served our community in that role over two terms. During her tenure, RCA established the Reston Ac-cessibility Committee, which helps ensure that local businesses provide access to retail, of-fice and public amenity locations for those with mobility impairments, created the Reston 2020 Committee to analyze and advocate on land use issues, and implemented the Sustainable Reston Initiative to raise awareness of the need to address the effects on the Reston community of peak oil, global climate change and economic disruption. 
At the county level, Marion has been ap-
pointed to the Election Improvement Commis-sion, the Wiehle Avenue Steering Committee, the Hunter Mill District Budget Committee and has served as an elections officer. 
Marion’s passion for fairness and justice 
have been reflected in her distinguished pro-fessional career which has included serving as a lobbyist for the American Association of Uni-versity Women; Staff Attorney National Asso-ciation for the Repeal of Abortion Laws; Staff Attorney for the National Labor Relations Board; Director of the Criminal Justice Advo-
cacy Project for the DC Coalition Against Do-mestic Violence; Attorney/Counselor/Mediator for the Architect of the Capitol Fair Employ-ment Practices Office. In these roles, she di-rectly influenced and in some instances cre-ated national policy in numerous areas. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join 
me in congratulating Marion Stillson for this award and thanking her for her committed and selfless service to our community.

IN HONOR OF THE ROTARY CLUB 
OF THE WOODLANDS, TEXAS 
HON. KEVIN BRADY 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 1, 2015 
Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I stand 
today to honor the 40th anniversary of The Rotary Club of The Woodlands, Texas. Across our nation and world, service organizations make communities stronger through edu-cational, vocational and community health pro-grams. Since its formation, the leaders and members of this Rotary Club, of which I’m a proud member, has achieved all that—and more. 
As the Vietnam War was ending, 20 local 
business leaders stepped forward to find solu-tions and make a positive difference in a new master planned community known as The Woodlands, Texas. Within two months of their first meeting, Rotary International approved their charter on May 9, 1975. 
Over the last four decades, much has 
changed both within our Rotary and world, but the Rotary Club of the Woodlands continues to grow and serve. Today 174 business and community leaders keep the Club moving for-
ward by putting servant leadership first. The number of service projects and programs has increased, while educational scholarships for local students remain at the heart of it all. 
Before this new century the Club’s Scholar-
ship fund reached $250,000, necessitating the creation of a foundation. Over $1.3 million has been raised for deserving students—and many new community leaders credit their Rotary scholarships for making their education dreams a reality. 
Our Rotary Club sponsors five Interact clubs 
at local high schools where future Rotarians and community leaders connect with mentors, develop leadership skills and make connec-tions through service projects and club meet-ings. 
Our club works with Interfaith of the The 
Woodlands on a program called ‘‘Serving Our Seniors.’’ Twice annually, Rotarians, Interact students, Interfaith staff and volunteers come together to help seniors with a variety of home repair, improvement and landscaping chores. 
Our Club annually supports an international 
exchange student who attends high school in the community. This cultural and educational exchange benefits the hosted student, their home country and local students who get to know more about other cultures. 
The Club also provides layettes for the care 
of newborns in a South American medical clin-ic near the areas known for the Children of the Dump. This project ensures many lives begin in a sanitary environment and involves out local Interact Clubs who put together the lay-ettes from supplies purchased by the Club with matching funds from Rotary International.

Our club also holds mock interview sessions 
with local community college students. The ‘‘Show Me the Money’’ project pairs up Rotar-ians with students in a positive, affirming envi-ronment. Our sessions include making the right first impression and financial literacy. 
There are truly too many service projects 
this Club has completed over the past forty years to share them all, but a conservative es-timate is that Rotarians from The Woodlands Club have put in tens of thousands of service hours. 
So, to my fellow Rotarians I thank you for 
40 years of living the Rotary motto of ‘‘Service before Self’’ in thought, word, and most impor-tantly, in deeds. May your exemplary servant leadership continue to bless our community. 
I know my Rotarian pride shines through 
when I share what my home Rotary club does for our community. Today I want all of Amer-ica to join with us in celebrating 40 great years. I can’t wait to see what the future holds for The Rotary Club of The Woodlands.

ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOP-
MENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2016 
SPEECH OF  
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Wednesday, April 29, 2015 
The House in Committee of the Whole 
House on the state of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2028) making ap-propriations for energy and water develop-ment and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other pur-poses: 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chair, I thank my col-
league and friend, Mr. B EYER , for his leader-
ship on this issue. 
Our friends on the other side of the aisle are 
once again attempting to substitute Congress’ will outside its purview, this time by prohibiting the Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA from finalizing their Waters of the U.S. rule. 
This is nothing new. Earlier this year they tried to get into the 
local permitting process by forcing states to accept the Keystone XL pipeline. As a former local government official you can imagine how shocked I was at that effort. 
And let us not forget how often they seek to 
tell the District of Columbia, and its residents, how they should be governed. 
Now, my friends wish to halt federal rule-
making prescribed under the Clean Water Act, almost a decade in the making and after more than a million public comments and numerous public hearings and stakeholder meetings, just before a final rule is released. 
Remember, it was Congress and the Su-
preme Court who asked for clarification for what should be defined as ‘‘navigable waters.’’ 
Today, nearly 60 percent of our nation’s 
streams and millions of acres of wetlands cur-rently lack clear protection from pollution under the Clean Water Act. Current loopholes put at risk 2 million miles of our streams, threatening the drinking water of 117 million Americans, and jeopardizing 20 million acres of wetlands. 
The proposed rule would provide an esti-
mated $388 million to $514 million annually of benefits to the public, including reducing flood-
ing, filtering pollution, providing wildlife habitat, supporting hunting and fishing, and recharging groundwater. The public benefits significantly outweigh the costs for mitigating impacts to streams and wetlands, and taking steps to re-duce pollution to our waterways. 
Why don’t we let the rulemaking process fin-
ish and then we can see if it needs to be fixed. The Beyer-Connolly amendment will do that. But let’s not jump to judgement. 
Congress has a role to play. But it shouldn’t 
be as an intransigent obstacle.

HONORING GUILFORD NATIVE 
NICK FRADIANI, JR., AMERICAN IDOL SEASON XIV FINALIST 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 1, 2015 
Ms. D ELAURO. Mr. Speaker, it is with great 
pride that I rise today to join the community of Guilford, Connecticut, as well as the Fradiani family, friends, and fans of all ages in extend-ing my heartfelt congratulations to Connecti-cut’s own Nick Fradiani, Jr. who this week be-came a finalist on Season XIV of the reality television series American Idol. 
With his musician father, Nick Fradiani, Sr., 
bringing him to gigs as a child and blessed with a special talent all his own it is not hard to believe that Nick developed a passion for music. Though he has really only focused on music as a career over the last decade, it is that passion that makes Nick’s performances so special and why he has been able to build such a strong fan base in Connecticut. 
A performer, singer, and songwriter, he has 
taken American Idol Season XIV by storm and, in the process, has sparked a unique en-thusiasm across his home state of Con-necticut. Bringing his own style to fan favorites like Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers’ ‘‘Amer-ican Girl,’’ Billy Joel’s ‘‘Only the Good Die Young,’’ Maroon 5’s ‘‘Harder To Breathe,’’ Rod Stewart’s ‘‘Maggie May,’’ Matchbox Twenty’s ‘‘Bright Lights,’’ and Rascall Flatts ‘‘What Hurts the Most’’ he has impressed American Idol judges and, more importantly, won the hearts 
and minds of millions across the country who have voted to ensure his continued appear-ances. 
Nick has created quite the fervor in Con-
necticut—reflected in the thousands of fans across the state who crowd into viewing par-ties or watch from each week to see him per-form and vote for him to advance. I am hon-ored to have this opportunity to join his par-ents Nick and Liz, along with his sister, Kristen, his extended family, friends and the Guilford community in wishing Nick Fradiani, Jr. the best of luck in the last weeks of the American Idol competition. 
Nick—win or lose you have made us all 
proud and we are with you. HONORING ESCALADE SPORTS 
HON. LARRY BUCSHON 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 1, 2015 
Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Escalade Sports, a fantastic Hoosier business in my home district. 
Escalade Sports is being awarded the Presi-
dent’s ‘‘E’’ Award, the highest recognition a U.S. Company can receive for significantly contributing to the expansion of U.S. exports. 
This award was created in 1961 to provide 
recognition of the work that America’s export-ers undertake, and honors 45 companies every year for their contributions to the Amer-ican economy. 
Escalade Sports embodies the spirit of this 
award as it produces many high quality Amer-ican sporting and gaming products that range from basketball hoops, to table tennis equip-ment, to archery supplies. These products are then exported and sold to athletes and sports enthusiasts across the globe to enjoy and use. 
Escalade Sports is headquartered in Evans-
ville, where it provides quality jobs to Hoosiers here in Southwest Indiana and many more across the United States in its various produc-tion and distribution facilities. The company’s exports not only help show the world what amazing products are made here in America, but also keep Americans employed and help expand our economy. 
Mr. Speaker, we should all be grateful for 
the fine work of Escalade Sports, and the other ‘‘E’’ Award recipients across the United States for their contributions to the American economy.

Mary and Paul in Prague, and the Cathedral

He has also toured and con-ducted in Russia, Finland, and Estonia with members of the State Orchestra of St. Peters-burg and members of the Eastern Pennsyl-vania Choral Society.

Thomas and his choirs are also featured performers of the Na-tional Anthem for the Philadelphia sports com-
munity, including regular performances for the Phillies, Sixers, and Flyers. 
Dr. Thomas is deservedly listed in the 
Who’s Who in the World, Who’s Who in Amer-ica, Who’s Who in Education, and Who’s Who among American Teachers. He has received recognition from former President Bill Clinton on behalf of a music program he designed honoring World War II veterans. He has also received recognition from the U.S. House of Representatives, the Pennsylvania House and Senate, the Schuylkill County Board of Com-missioners, and the Austrian and German gov-ernments. Thomas was named by Philadel-phia Magazine as ‘‘Best Choral Director’’ in 
the Philadelphia region. He has also been rec-ognized by the St. David’s Society as a ‘‘Cit-izen of the Year,’’ was Pennsylvania finalist for ‘‘Teacher of the Year,’’ and was the first musi-cian inducted into the Upper Perkiomen Valley Academic Hall of Fame. It is an honor to recognize Dr. Mark Thomas 
for his work in the musical arts. His passion for music is evident his impressive body of work, which has touched countless individuals over the years. I applaud him for his service to the greater artistic good, and I wish him continued success in the future.
