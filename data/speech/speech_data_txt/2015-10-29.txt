Lord God, You know our needs. You 
have entrusted to us a great nation founded on life and liberty. We stand before You, ready to fulfill a mission that will give glory to Your name and ensure the dignity of all humanity. We plead for Your wisdom. 
Give us the courage to open our eyes 
to see. Give us the fortitude to endure when the demands of our office seem overwhelming. Bless us with prudence when all pathways seem troublesome. Help us to discern and seek the com-mon good when comfort and expedience tempt and beckon. 
Challenge our minds and steady our 
hand and remind us that all good things come from You. Transform our lives, and we will remember that life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is the greatest work we will perform on behalf of all people. 
Amen.

FAREWELL ADDRESS 
(Mr. BOEHNER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to inform you that I will resign as Speaker of the House effective upon the election of my successor. I will also resign as Representative from Ohio’s Eighth District at the end of this month. 
I leave with no regrets, no burdens. If 
anything, I leave the way I started— just a regular guy, humbled by the chance to do a big job. That is what I am most proud of. I am still just me, the same guy who came here 25 years ago as a small-business man and spent all these 25 years trying to just be me. 
Now, sometimes my staff thought I 
was too much like me, but it really is the thing I am most proud of. I am the same regular guy who came here to try to do a good job for my district and my country. 
Before I go, I want to express what an 
honor it has been to serve with all of you. The people’s House is, in my view, the great embodiment of the American Dream. Everybody here comes from somewhere, and everybody here is on some mission. 
I come from a part of the world 
where we are used to working. As far back as I can remember, I was working. My staff was asking me the other day: Well, you know, on November 1st, 
you’re not going to have a job. When was the last time you didn’t have a job? 
I thought about it and thought about 
it and thought about it. I thought, well, I had to be 8 or 9 years old be-cause I was throwing newspapers back then and working in my dad’s bar. As a matter of fact, I used to work from 5 a.m. on Saturday morning until 2 p.m. for $2. Not $2 an hour. $2. 
I never thought about growing up as 
the easy way or the hard way. It was just the Cincinnati way. Our city takes its name from the great Roman general Cincinnatus, a farmer who answered the call of his nation to lead and then surrendered his power to go back to his plow. 
For me, it wasn’t a farm. It was a 
small business. And it wasn’t so much a calling as it was a mission—a mission to strive for a smaller, less costly, and more accountable Federal Government here in Washington. 
How did we do? Here are some facts. 
For the first time in nearly 20 years, we have made some real entitlement reforms, saving trillions of dollars over the long term. 
We have protected 99 percent of the 
American people from an increase in their taxes. We are on track to save taxpayers $2.1 trillion over the next 10 years, the most significant spending re-ductions in modern times. We have banned earmarks altogether. Sorry. 
We have protected this institution. 
We have made it more open to the peo-ple. Every day in this capital city there are hundreds of kids from the toughest neighborhoods who are finally getting a chance at a decent education. 
I am proud of these things, but the 
mission is not complete. And the truth is it may never be. One thing I came to realize over the years that I have been here is that this battle over the size and scope and cost of our government in Washington has been going on for more than 200 years, and the forces of the status quo go to an awful lot of trouble to prevent change from hap-pening. 
Real change takes time. Yes, freedom 
makes all things possible, but patience is what makes all things real. So be-lieve in the long, slow struggle. Believe 
in this country’s ability to meet her challenges and to lead the world. And, remember, you can’t do a big job alone, especially this one. 
So I am grateful to my family, Deb 
and my two girls. My two girls were 3 and 1 when I first ran for office. Now they are a lot older. So they have been through a lot. You all know what your families go through. It is one thing for us to take the bricks and the boards and everything that gets thrown at us, but it is another thing for our families. Their skin isn’t as thick as ours. 
I am also grateful to all of my col-
leagues: my fellow leaders, Mr. M
CCAR-
THY and Mr. S CALISE , Ms. M CMORRIS  
RODGERS ; and many on my side of the 
aisle, our committee chairs, people I have worked with for a long time. But I am just as grateful to Ms. 
P
ELOSI , Mr. H OYER , Mr. C LYBURN , and 
Mr. B ECERRA and others for all of the 
work that we have done together. Over these last 5 years, we have done an awful lot of work together. There was probably more work done across the aisle over the last 5 years than in the 25 years that I have served in this in-stitution. 
Now, as much as I enjoy working 
with all of you, some of you still could learn to dress better. You know who you are. I saw one of the culprits, one of the usual suspects who shows up here once in a while without a tie. This morning he didn’t look dressed very well, but he did have a tie on. 
I am grateful to the people who work 
in this institution every day, whether it is the Reading Clerks or—you know, there are a lot of people, thousands of people, who allow us to do our jobs and to help make this institution what it is. Whether it is the people you see here today or the people in the CAO’s office or the Capitol Police or legisla-tive counsel, there really are thousands of people who really do allow us to do our job. 
I am grateful to my staff. Now, you 
all know I am a big believer in staff. None of us can be what we are without a good staff, and I certainly would never have gotten to this job without having built a great team. So I really am grateful to my staff. As they like to say to each other, once you are part of Boehnerland, you are always a part of Boehnerland, and that certainly goes for me as well. 
I am especially grateful to all my 
constituents and the volunteers over the years. That includes a student at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, in 1990, who was putting up campaign signs for me. His name was P
AULRYAN. 
I don’t think he could pronounce my name back in 1990 when he was putting up yard signs for me. 
But, as Cincinnatus understood, 
there is a difference between being asked to do something and being called to do something. P
AULis being called. 
I know he will serve with grace and with energy, and I want to wish him and his family all the best. 
b0945 
My colleagues, I have described my 
life as a chase for the American Dream. That chase began at the bottom of the hill, just off the main drag in Reading, Ohio, right outside of Cincinnati. At the top of the hill was a small house with a big family, a shining city in its own right. 
The hill had twists. The hill had 
turns, and even a few tears. Nothing wrong with that. But let me tell you, it was just perfect. 
Never forget, we are the luckiest peo-
ple on the Earth. In America, you can do anything that you are willing to work for, willing to work hard at, and anything can happen if you are willing to make the necessary sacrifices in life.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H7337 October 29, 2015 
If you falter—and you will—you can 
just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and go do it again, because hope always springs eternal. And if you just do the right things for the right reasons, good things will happen. 
And this, too, can really happen to 
you. 
God bless you, and God bless our 
great country. 
f 
ELECTION OF SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to the 
Speaker’s announcement of October 29, 2015, the Chair will receive nomina-tions for the Office of Speaker. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Washington (Mrs. M
CMOR-
RISRODGERS ). 
Mrs. M CMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. 
Speaker, today, in the people’s House, it gives me great honor to nominate the people’s Speaker. 
You don’t need to look any further 
than the architecture of Washington, D.C., to see what our Founders envi-sioned. It is not by mistake that the dome over the Congress is the very cen-ter of the Federal city. The White House and the Supreme Court are set about us, satellites to the supreme power of the people expressed in this legislative body. 
In the House, we are eager for a fresh 
start that will make us more effective to fulfill our obligation to reflect the will of the people and to reestablish the balance of power. 
There is no better person to lead us 
in that calling than the man I am about to nominate. He was first elected to the House at the ripe old age of 28, and he has served here now for almost 17 years. 
We all remember when he led the 
House Budget Committee: the vision-ary proposals, the lengthy debates. And who could forget those PowerPoints? 
He is now the chairman of the House 
Ways and Means Committee. But he is more than a chairman to us. He is more than a colleague. He is our friend. He is a leader. 
Through it all, he has never forgot-
ten his roots. He lives on the same block he grew up on in Janesville, Wis-consin. There is no place he would rather be than at home with his fam-ily. 
He will continue to put the people of 
this country first. And I can say, in all candor, he did not seek this office. The office sought him. 
As chair of the House Republican 
Conference, I am directed by the vote of that Conference to present for elec-tion to the Office of Speaker of the House of Representatives for the 114th Congress the Representative from the State of Wisconsin, the man from Janesville, the Honorable P
AUL D. 
RYAN. 
The SPEAKER. The Chair now recog-
nizes the gentleman from California (Mr. B
ECERRA ). 
Mr. BECERRA. Mr. Speaker, I offer 
my congratulations to my friend, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. R YAN), 
on his nomination by his colleagues. 
At this time, as chairman of the 
Democratic Caucus of this House, I wish to place in nomination the name of a proven leader for the Office of Speaker of the House of Representa-tives: 
A leader who has accomplished, in 
this Chamber and for this country, what few can match; 
A leader who, as Speaker of this 
House, secured passage of landmark economic recovery package legislation in 2009 which transformed a diving economy, losing 800,000 jobs each month, to one which has now created more than 13 million jobs over the last 67 consecutive months of job growth; 
A leader who, as Speaker, accom-
plished what 70 years of Congresses could not, enactment of our lifesaving health security law, which has put 18 million more Americans in control of their and their children’s health care; 
A leader who had the foresight, in 
2008, to fight for the biggest invest-ment in our troops since World War II, with the passage of the Post-9/11 GI Bill, and the largest investment in our veterans’ health care and benefits in the 77-year history of the VA; 
A leader who was not afraid to take 
on the challenge of fixing our broken immigration system and secured pas-sage of the DREAM Act in 2010. 
Mr. Speaker, leadership is about 
making the tough choices and getting things done. It means knowing how to build a majority, not just with the members of your own political party, but with the 435 elected Members of the House of Representatives so we can get things done. This leader understands that and knows how to get things done, even while serving in the minority in this House. 
That is why, less than 24 hours ago, 
this leader succeeded in breaking through the gridlock in this House and secured the votes needed to avert a senseless government shutdown and a perilous default on the payment of America’s bills. Thanks to this leader, 16.5 million seniors will not suffer a $55-per-month increase in their Medi-care premiums and Congress will not cut the Social Security benefits of 11 million disabled Americans by 20 per-cent. 
Mr. Speaker, that is leadership, and 
that is what Americans expect from those they elect. That is why it is my privilege, as chairman of the House Democratic Caucus and as directed by the colleagues of the Democratic Cau-cus, to nominate for election to the Of-fice of Speaker of the House of Rep-resentatives, from the 12th District of the great State of California, the Hon-orable N
ANCY PATRICIA D’ALESANDRO  
PELOSI . 
The SPEAKER. The names of the 
Honorable P AULD. R YAN, a Represent-
ative from the State of Wisconsin, and the Honorable N
ANCY PELOSI , a Rep-
resentative from the State of Cali-fornia, have been placed in nomination. Are there further nominations? 
There being no further nominations, 
the Chair appoints the following tell-ers: 
The gentlewoman from Michigan 
(Mrs. M
ILLER ); 
The gentleman from Pennsylvania 
(Mr. B RADY ); 
The gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. 
KAPTUR ); and 
The gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. 
ROS-LEHTINEN ). 
The tellers will come forward and 
take their seats at the desk in front of the Speaker’s rostrum. 
The roll will now be called, and those 
responding to their names will indicate by surname the nominee of their choos-ing. 
The Reading Clerk will now call the 
roll. 
The tellers having taken their places, 
the House proceeded to vote for the Speaker. 
The following is the result of the 
vote:

Ms. PELOSI. My dear colleagues of 
the 114th Congress of the United States, today, as every day, we come to this floor strengthened and inspired by the support of our colleagues, the trust of our constituents, and the love of our families. 
My special thanks to my husband, 
Paul; our five children; our nine grand-children; and the entire Pelosi and D’Alesandro families for their support. 
My deep gratitude to the people of 
San Francisco for the continued honor they give me to represent them here. 
My heartfelt thanks to my Demo-
cratic colleagues for extending me the honor of being nominated to be Speak-er of the House. Thank you, my col-leagues. 
Today, we bid farewell to a Speaker 
who has served his constituents and this Congress with honor for 25 years, Speaker J
OHNBOEHNER . 
In his story, we are reminded of the 
enduring, exceptional promise of Amer-ica—this hardworking son of an Ohio bartender and owner who grew up to be the Speaker of the House of Represent-atives. J
OHNBOEHNER talked about the 
American Dream. J OHN BOEHNER , you 
are the personification of the American Dream. 
As you all know, Speaker B
OEHNER  
was a formidable spokesman for the Republican agenda. My Republican col-leagues, I am sure you know—and I can attest—to the fact that he was always true and loyal to the members of his Conference in any negotiations we ever had. 
Although we had our differences and 
often, I always respected his dedication to this House and his commitment to his values. Thank you, J
OHN, for your 
leadership and courage as Speaker. 
Your graciousness as Speaker ex-
tended and was reflected in your staff under the leadership of Mike Sommers, whom we all respect. Thank you to J
OHNBOEHNER ’s staff. 
I know I speak for everyone here, 
Democrats and Republicans, when I thank you for making the visit of His Holiness Pope Francis such a beautiful and meaningful experience for all of us. 
Today, we extend our thanks and 
congratulations to Debbie; your daugh-ters, Lindsay and Tricia; and the entire Boehner family, now including grand-son, Allister. 
Let’s hear it for the family of J
OHN 
BOEHNER . 
On behalf of House Democrats and 
personally, I wish you and your family all of God’s blessings in the glorious years ahead. 
Last month, we witnessed something 
truly special when Pope Francis made history addressing a joint session of Congress. Standing right here, Pope Francis called on us to seek hope,

peace, and dialogue for all people and 
reminded us of our duty to find a way forward for everyone. ‘‘A good political leader,’’ His Holiness said, ‘‘is one who, with the interest of all in mind, seizes the moment in a spirit of openness and pragmatism.’’ 
Pope Francis echoed the principles of 
our Founders that placed at the heart of our democracy the saying, ‘‘E Pluribus Unum,’’ from many, one. The Founders could never have imagined how vast our country would become, how diverse and many we would be— ethnically, gender identities, beliefs, and priorities—but they knew we had to be one. 
Every day in this House and across 
the country we pledge allegiance to one nation under God, indivisible, with lib-erty and justice for all. 
This is the beauty of America, that 
for all of our honest differences, per-spectives, and priorities aired and ar-gued so passionately on this floor, we are committed to being one nation. De-spite our differences—in fact, respect-ing them—I look forward to a clear de-bate in this marketplace of ideas, the people’s House of Representatives. 
So, my fellow colleagues, we have a 
responsibility to act upon our shared faith in the greatness of our country. We have a responsibility to be worthy of the sacrifices of our troops, our vet-erans, and our military families. We have a responsibility to make real the promise of the American Dream for all. 
There is important work before the 
Congress. We must do more to promote 
growth, decrease the deficit, create good-paying jobs, and increase the pay-checks of America’s working families. 
Today, in this House, a page is 
turned. A new chapter has begun. Today, the gavel passes to a proud son of Wisconsin, the first Speaker from Wisconsin. 
P
AULRYAN has had the full breadth 
of experience on Capitol Hill, from a young staffer to a Tortilla Coast wait-er—shall I say that again?—Tortilla Coast waiter—to a Congressman, to being a sincere and proud advocate for his point of view as chairman of the Budget Committee, as a respected lead-er and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and in a minute, he will be the Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
Mr. Speaker, today, on behalf of 
House Democrats, I extend the hand of friendship to you. 
Congratulations to you, P
AUL, and to 
Janna; your children, Liza, Charlie, and Sam; your mother, who is here— how proud she must be—and the entire Ryan family, whom we all know mean so much to you. 
Mr. Speaker, God bless you and your 
family. And God bless the United States of America. 
This is the people’s House. This is the 
people’s gavel. In the people’s name, it is my privilege to hand this gavel to the Speaker-elect of the House, Con-gressman and Honorable P
AULD. R YAN. 
Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Thank you, 
Madam Leader. Before I begin, I would like to thank 
all of my family and friends who flew in from Wisconsin and from all over for being here today. 
In the gallery I have my mom, Betty; 
my sister, Janet; my brothers, Stan and Tobin; and more cousins than I can count on a few hands. 
Most importantly, I want to recog-
nize my wife, Janna; and our children: Liza, Charlie, and Sam. 
I also want to thank Speaker B
OEH-
NER. For almost 5 years, he led this 
House. For nearly 25 years, he served it. Not many people can match his ac-complishments, the offices he held, the laws he passed. 
But what really sets J
OHNapart is he 
is a man of character, a true class act. He is, without question, the gentleman from Ohio. So please join me in saying one last time, ‘‘Thank you, Speaker B
OEHNER .’’ 
Now I know how he felt. It is not 
until you hold this gavel, stand in this spot, look out and see all 435 Members of this House, as if all America is sit-ting right in front of you—it is not until then that you feel it, the weight of responsibility and the gravity of the moment. 
As I stand here, I can’t help but 
think of something Harry Truman once said. The day after Franklin Roosevelt died, Truman became President. He told a group of reporters, ‘‘If you ever pray, pray for me now.’’ 
When they told me yesterday what 
had happened, I felt like the Moon, the stars, and all the planets had fallen on me. We should all feel that way. A lot is on our shoulders. So if you ever pray, let’s pray for each other, Republicans for Democrats and Democrats for Re-publicans. 
b1115 
And I don’t mean pray for a conver-
sion, all right? Pray for a deeper under-standing. Because when you are up here, you see it so clearly. Wherever you come from, whatever you believe, we are all in the same boat. 
I never thought I would be Speaker, 
but early in my life, I wanted to serve this House. I thought this place was ex-hilarating because here you can make a difference. If you had a good idea, if you worked hard, you could make it happen. You could improve people’s lives. To me, the House of Representa-tives represents what is the best of America: the boundless opportunity to do good. 
But let’s be frank. The House is bro-
ken. We are not solving problems. We are adding to them. I am not interested in laying blame. We are not settling scores. We are wiping the slate clean. 
Neither the Members nor the people 
are satisfied with how things are going. We need to make some changes, start-ing with how the House does business. We need to let every Member con-tribute, not once they have earned their stripes, but now. 
I come at this job as a two-time com-
mittee chair. The committees should retake the lead in drafting all major 
legislation. If you know the issue, you should write the bill. 
Let’s open up the process. Let people 
participate, and they might change their mind. A neglected minority will gum up the works. A respected minor-ity will work in good faith. Instead of trying to stop the majority, they might try to become the majority. In other words, we need to return to reg-ular order. 
Now, I know this sounds like process. 
It is actually a matter of principle. We are the body closest to the people. Every 2 years, we face the voters and sometimes face the music. But we do not echo the people; we represent the people. We are supposed to study up and do the homework that they cannot do. So when we do not follow regular order, when we rush to pass bills that a lot of us don’t understand, we are not doing our job. Only a fully functioning House can truly represent the people; and if there were ever a time for us to step up, this would be that time. 
America does not feel strong any-
more because the working people of America do not feel strong anymore. I am talking about the people who mind the store and grow the food and walk the beat and pay the taxes and raise the family. They do not sit in this House. They do not have fancy titles, but they are the people who make this country work, and this House should work for them. 
Here is the problem. They are work-
ing hard. They are paying a lot. They are trying to do right by their families, and they are going nowhere fast. They never get a raise. They never get a break. The bills keep piling up and the taxes and the debt. They are working harder than ever before to get ahead, and yet they are falling further behind. They feel robbed. They feel cheated of their birthright. They are not asking for any favors. They just want a fair chance, and they are losing faith that they will ever get it. 
Then they look at Washington, and 
all they see is chaos. What a relief to them it would be if we finally got our acts together. What a weight off of their shoulders. How reassuring it would be if we actually fixed the Tax Code, put patients in charge of their health care, grew our economy, strengthened our military, lifted peo-ple out of poverty, and paid down our debt. At this point, nothing could be more inspiring than a job well done. Nothing could stir the heart more than real, concrete results. 
The cynics will scoff. They will say it 
is not possible. You better believe, we are going to try. We will not duck the tough issues; we will take them head- on. We are going to do all we can do so that working people get their strength back and people not working get their lives back. No more favors for the few. ‘‘Opportunity for all,’’ that is our motto. 
I often talk about a need for a vision. 
I am not sure I ever really said what I

meant. We solve problems here, yes. We 
create a lot of them, too. But at bot-tom, we vindicate a way of life. We show by our work that free people can govern themselves. They can solve their own problems. They can make their own decisions. They can delib-erate, collaborate, and get the job done. 
We show that self-government is not 
only more efficient and more effective, it is more fulfilling. In fact, we show it is that struggle, that hard work, that very achievement itself that makes us free. That is what we do here. 
We will not always agree, not all of 
us, not all of the time, but we should not hide our disagreements. We should embrace them. We have nothing to fear from honest differences honestly stat-ed. If you have ideas, let’s hear them. I believe that a greater clarity between us can lead to greater charity among us, and there is every reason to have hope. 
When the first Speaker took the 
gavel, he looked out at a room of 30 people, representing a nation of 3 mil-lion. Today, as I look out at each and every one of you, we represent a nation of 300 million. 
So when I hear people say that Amer-
ica doesn’t have it, we are done, we are spent, I don’t believe it. I believe with every fiber of my being that we can renew the American idea. Now our task is to make us all believe. 
My friends, you have done me a great 
honor. The people of this country, they have done all of us a great honor. Now let’s prove ourselves worthy of it. Let’s seize the moment. Let’s rise to the oc-casion. And when we are done, let us say that we left the people—all the people—more united, happy, and free. 
Thank you. I am now ready to take the oath of 
office. 
I ask the Dean of the House of Rep-
resentatives, the Honorable J
OHNCON-
YERS , Jr., of Michigan, to administer 
the oath of office. 
Mr. CONYERS then administered the 
oath of office to Mr. P AULD. R YANof

Do you solemnly swear or affirm that you

FY 2015 , 2016, AND THE 10 -YEAR PERIOD FY 2016

COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET ,

Hon. J OHNA. B OEHNER , 
Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
D
EAR MR. SPEAKER : To facilitate applica-
tion of sections 302 and 311 of the Congres-sional Budget Act, I am transmitting an up-dated status report on the current levels of on-budget spending and revenues for fiscal years 2015, 2016, and for the 10-year period of fiscal years 2016 through 2025. This status re-port is current through October 27, 2015. The term ‘‘current level’’ refers to the amounts of spending and revenues estimated for each fiscal year based on laws enacted or awaiting the President’s signature. 
Table 1 in the report compares the current 
levels of total budget authority, outlays, and revenues to the overall limits, as adjusted, 
that were filed in the Congressional Record on April 29, 2014 for fiscal year 2015, and to the limits contained in the conference report on S. Con. Res. 11, as agreed to on May 5, 2015, for fiscal year 2016, and for the 10-year period of fiscal years 2016 through 2025. This comparison is needed to implement section 311(a) of the Congressional Budget Act, which creates a point of order against meas-ures that would breach the budget resolu-tion’s aggregate levels. The table does not show budget authority and outlays for years after fiscal year 2016 because appropriations 
for those years have not yet been considered. 
Table 2 compares the current levels of 
budget authority and outlays for legislative action completed by each authorizing com-
mittee with the ‘‘section 302(a)’’ allocations filed on April 29, 2014 for fiscal year 2015, and to the limits contained in the conference re-port on S. Con. Res. 11, as agreed to on May 5, 2015, for fiscal year 2016 and for the 10-year period of fiscal years 2016 through 2025. For fiscal year 2015, ‘‘legislative action’’ refers to legislation enacted after the adoption of the levels set forth in the Congressional Record on April 29, 2014. For fiscal year 2016 and the 10-year period of fiscal years 2016 through 2025, ‘‘legislative action’’ refers to legisla-tion enacted after the adoption of the levels set forth in the conference agreement on S. Con. Res. 11. This comparison is needed to enforce section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act, which creates a point of order against measures that would breach the sec-tion 302(a) allocation of new budget author-ity for the committee that reported the measure. It is also needed to implement sec-tion 311(b), which exempts committees that comply with their allocations from the point of order under section 311(a). 
Tables 3 and 4 compare the current status 
of discretionary appropriations for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 with the ‘‘section 302(b)’’ suballocations of discretionary budget au-thority and outlays among Appropriations subcommittees. The comparison is needed to enforce section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act because the point of order under that section equally applies to measures that would breach the applicable section 302(b) suballocation. The tables also provide sup-plementary information on spending in ex-
cess of the base discretionary spending caps allowed under section 251(b) of the Budget Control Act. 
Table 5 compares the levels of changes to 
mandatory programs (CHIMPs) contained in appropriations acts with the permissible lim-its on CHIMPs as specified in sections 3103 and 3104 of S. Con. Res. 11. The comparison is needed to enforce a point of order established in S. Con. Res. 11 against fiscal year 2016 ap-propriations measures containing CHIMPs that would breach the permissible limits for fiscal year 2016. 
Tables 6 and 7 display the current level of 
advance appropriations for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, respectively, of accounts identified for advance appropriations under section 601 of H. Con. Res. 25 (113th Congress), in force and effect pursuant to H. Res. 5 (114th Con-gress), and under section 3304 of S. Con. Res 11. These tables are needed to enforce a point of order against appropriations bills con-taining advance appropriations that are: (i) not identified in the statement of managers or (ii) would cause the aggregate amount of such appropriations to exceed the level spec-ified in the budget resolution. 
In addition, letters from the Congressional 
Budget Office are attached that summarize and compare the budget impact of enacted legislation that occurred after adoption of the budget resolution against the budget res-olution aggregates in force. 
If you have any questions, please contact 
Jim Herz or Jim Bates at (202) 226–7270. 
Sincerely,

justed, and makes changes to those levels for enacted legislation.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. Gracious God, You are worthy of our 
praise. Let Your Name be honored on Earth as it is in Heaven. Fill our law-makers with a spirit of reverence for You and Your purposes. As they seek Your wisdom, direct their steps through the unfolding of Your Divine providence. May no weapon formed against them be able to prosper. Lord, continue to do great things for and through them, causing justice to roll down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream. Thank You that we can come to You in weakness and find strength. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest 
the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. 
ROUNDS ). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. FISCAL AGREEMENT 
Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
said that the Senate would take up the fiscal agreement after the House acted, and we are. This agreement isn’t per-fect. I share some concerns other col-leagues have raised. But here is the bottom line. This is a fully offset agreement that rejects tax hikes, se-cures long-term savings through enti-
tlement reforms, and provides in-creased support for our military. All this is at a time when we confront threats in multiple theaters. 
Each of these items was a Republican 
goal heading into the negotiation. Each of these items was achieved in the agreement before us. I am encour-aged that it would enact the most sig-nificant reform to Social Security since 1983, resulting in $168 billion in long-term savings. I am encouraged that it would repeal more of ObamaCare. I am encouraged that it would help provide resources our troops so desperately need in an era of diverse and very challenging global threats—when we see ISIL consoli-dating gains in Iraq and Syria; when we see the forces of Assad marching alongside Iranian soldiers and Hezbollah militias, supported by Rus-sian aircraft overhead. 
Colleagues know that I will respect 
whatever choice they ultimately make when this agreement comes up for a vote. There are valid differences of opinion, and that is OK. But I ask every colleague to also consider what this fully offset agreement would mean for the men and women who volun-tarily put themselves in harm’s way so that we may live free. 
Commanders tell us that additional 
resources are required—required to en-sure their safety and preparedness. This fully offset agreement would help provide them—along with enacting the most significant Social Security re-form in over three decades, along with repealing another piece of ObamaCare, and along with refusing to raise taxes by a penny. I hope Senators will join 
me in voting for it.

TRIBUTE TO JOHN BOEHNER 
Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, 
allow me to say a few words about the Speaker of the House. There is a lot you can say about J
OHN BOEHNER . He 
loves his breakfast every morning at Pete’s Diner. He is a fan of the tie dim-ple. He is one of the most genuine guys you will ever, ever meet. I know be-cause we have fought many battles to-gether in the trenches. He never breaks his word. He never buckles in a storm. 
What is amazing is how we have had 
such a frictionless relationship, espe-cially when you consider that old House saying: The other party—that is just the opposition. But the Senate— that is the enemy. 
That may have been true of past 
House and Senate leaders, but it wasn’t true for us. Though you might not ex-pect it, I am a little more Bourbon and J
OHNis a little more Merlot. I lecture 
on Henry Clay. John sings ‘‘Zip-a-Dee- Doo-Dah.’’ But I have always consid-ered J
OHNan ally. I have always con-
sidered J OHNa friend. It is hard not to 
like him, and it is hard not to admire what John has accomplished in his ca-reer. 
As a concerned Ohioan, he took on a 
scandal-plagued incumbent in a pri-mary and won. As a freshman Con-gressman, he took on money laun-dering schemes and banking scandals involving powerful Members and pre-vailed. As an engineer of the Contract with America, he took on Democrats’ decades-long power lock and tri-umphed. 
As an ex-member of leadership once 
considered politically dead, he knew he had more to offer and convinced his colleagues that he did. As the inheritor of a diminished and dispirited House minority, he dared to believe conserv-atives could rise again and help grow the largest Republican majority since

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7602 October 29, 2015 
bob-haired flappers were dancing the 
Charleston back in the 1920s. 
JOHNBOEHNER has wandered the val-
ley. J OHNBOEHNER has also been to the 
mountaintop. J OHN BOEHNER has slid 
right back into the valley, and then as-cended to great heights yet again. He does it all with hard work. He does it with an earnestness and an honesty I have always admired. 
When J
OHNtalks about struggling to 
make it, it is not some platitude. When J
OHNgets choked up about Americans 
reaching for their dreams, it is not some act. This is a guy who had to share a bathroom with 11 brothers and sisters. Imagine that. This is a guy whose parents slept on the pullout sofa. This is a guy who worked hard be-hind the bar and eventually found his way atop the rostrum. Maybe that is why he is so humble. Maybe that is why when he orders breakfast at Pete’s, they don’t call him Mr. Speak-er; they call him ‘‘John-John.’’ 
Here is what I know about Speaker 
J
OHN BOEHNER . He says the code he 
lives by is a simple one: Do the right thing for the right reasons, and the right things will happen. I have always found that to be true. I found it to be true in our battles fighting side by side for conservative reform, sometimes from a position deep in the minority. We had our share of Maalox moments. That is for sure. But he always strived to push forward. 
As I said about J
OHN BOEHNER the 
day he announced his retirement, grace under pressure, country and institution before self—these are the things that come to mind when I think of him. I wish Speaker B
OEHNER the very best in 
retirement. I thank him for always working hard to do the right thing—for his family, for his district, for his party, and for his country. Farewell, my friend. 
f 
PAUL RYAN 
Mr. M CCONNELL. Though we bid 
farewell to one Speaker today, we know we will soon be saying hello to a new one. The House will vote later this morning on the nomination of Con-gressman P
AULRYAN. I think it is ap-
propriate to wait for that vote to occur before making full comments. But I also think it goes without saying that P
AULRYANis one of the most respected 
guys around here. Everyone knows he is smart. Everyone knows he is serious. I look forward to working closely with him in pursuit of conservative solu-tions for our country.

MEASURE PLACED ON THE 
CALENDAR—H.R. 597 
Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
understand that there is a bill at the desk due a second reading. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will read the bill by title for the second time. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: A bill (H.R. 597) to reauthorize the Export- 
Import Bank of the United States, and for other purposes. 
Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, in 
order to place the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I ob-ject to further proceedings. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion having been heard, the bill will be placed on the calendar.

BUDGET AGREEMENT 
Mr. REID. Mr. President, last night 
the House of Representatives passed the bipartisan budget agreement that will keep our Government open, fund-ed, and free from default. Now, 100 per-cent of the Democrats in the House of Representatives voted for this, and 68 percent of Republicans voted against it. Let’s pause just a minute and under-stand what I said: 68 percent of the Re-publicans in the House of Representa-tives voted to default on the full faith and credit of our great country. So 68 percent of the Republicans voted to close our government. 
This legislation is now before the 
Senate. I urge all of my colleagues to support this responsible agreement. It is not perfect, as my friend the Repub-lican leader said. No legislation is. But this budget agreement accomplishes two major priorities the Democrats have long supported. It promotes eco-nomic growth by providing relief from sequestration’s damaging cuts for 2 years, and it ensures that we invest equally in the middle class and the Pentagon. The budget agreement is good for the middle class, good for the economy, and good for the country. 
I thank the people who worked so 
hard to make this agreement what it is today. The agreement was among President Obama, Speaker B
OEHNER , 
MITCH MCCONNELL , Leader P ELOSI , and 
I helped. I applaud and commend the President of the United States. He was firm, he was resolute, and he was—as usual—very smart. I appreciate the good work that he did to help us get to the point where we are now. 
To reach these negotiations, each of 
us had discussions with each other. We also know that a lot of the work was done by our staffs—our respective staffs. My chief of staff, Drew Wilson, represented the Senate Democrats in these negotiations. The Senate Demo-cratic caucus is aware of Drew’s exper-tise, hard work, fairness, and openness. Drew was ably assisted by Gary Myrick—indispensable Gary Myrick, who is the Democratic Secretary, as well as a number of people on my team of senior policy analysts who helped a great deal. Kate Leone—I don’t think there is anyone in the Senate who doesn’t know who Kate Leon is. She is the expert on health care. Bruce King, Ellen Doneski, Ayesha Khanna, Trey 
Reffett, Tyler Moran, George Holman, Gavin Parke, Alex McDonough, and utility man Bill Dauster all worked lit-erally night and day to get this to the point where we were able to be here on the floor today, seeking support for it. 
I am so grateful for the wonderful 
staff that I have, but there were others involved. Senator M
CCONNELL ’s nego-
tiator in this was Hazen Marshall. Hazen Marshall is a good person. He was resolute. He carried forward what the Republican leader wanted, but, like my staff, you never get exactly what you want. Everybody enjoyed working with him. 
Dave Stewart was Speaker B
OEHNER ’s 
negotiator on this. I care a great deal about Dave Stewart. David is a good man, and we all admire the work that he has done. I hope the new Speaker to be, P
AUL RYAN, will use his good of-
fices. He is very good. He is a talented man. 
Dick Meltzer was Leader P
ELOSI ’s 
able negotiator. I have to commend N
ANCY PELOSI . I so admire this good 
woman. She is a stalwart in the House of Representatives. She will go down in history as one of the great leaders of that body. I admire her, appreciate her friendship, and extend to anyone with-in the sound of my voice my apprecia-tion for the work that she did on this bill. 
As to the White House, I have al-
ready indicated the President did a wonderful job on this, but he also as-signed two really terrific, good, out-standing people. I can’t say enough about them. Brian Deese was one of the White House negotiators, along with Katie Fallon. Katie is a woman whom we all know in the Senate. She worked for Senator S
CHUMER for a number of 
years, and she worked for the Demo-cratic Policy Committee. She was on the committee for a number of years. We admire her very much. She was so helpful with everything we did in this legislation. She was always easy to get ahold of. She was easy to reach. 
It is now time for this important leg-
islation to pass the U.S. Senate. 
I have to say a few words about 
Speaker B
OEHNER . I have to admit that 
I was skeptical when he said that he wanted to clean out the barn before he left, but he found a way to clean out the barn by passing a clean debt limit and a 2-year budget agreement, which should go a long way to returning the appropriations process to the way it should work. 
I will always consider him my friend, 
and I will miss him. I wish him the very best in everything he does in the future. I listened to his final remarks on the House floor, which were very moving. It wasn’t only J
OHN BOEHNER  
who shed a tear over there today, but many Members of the House of Rep-resentatives and a number of us who watched his final speech shed a tear or two. 
There has been a lot of talk about 
the appropriations process. I have been

an appropriator since I came to the 
Senate. I was very fortunate as a brand new Senator, which was many decades ago, to be on the Appropriations Com-mittee. What an honor. 
The Appropriations Committee’s 
work is not as it used to be. We have to get back to doing individual appropria-tions bills. 
I say to my Republican friends: Let’s 
do the appropriations bills. Let’s get rid of these foolish riders that they stick on appropriations bills. We need to understand that there is a time and place for doing that. There is author-ization. Do the bills, authorize stuff, but don’t mess up the appropriations process. Next year, we will be happy to support individual appropriations bills that come to the floor. We don’t need motions to proceed. We will be happy to move to the bill as long as they get rid of those vexatious riders that have nothing to do with the bill brought be-fore us. The Defense appropriations bill doesn’t need something dealing with women’s health in the sense of directly attacking Planned Parenthood. We don’t need on Commerce, State, Jus-tice something that basically does away with the Environmental Protec-tion Agency. There are many examples that I could use. Let’s get to doing ap-propriations bills the way we used to. I want to do them. We don’t need to have a motion to proceed as long as my Re-publican colleagues get rid of these foolish, ideological amendments that have nothing to do with the bill before us.

AFFORDABLE CARE ACT 
Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday 
the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families released a stun-ning report detailing the sharp in-crease in the number of Nevada chil-dren who have health insurance. At one time, we were the most underinsured State in the country for health insur-ance. 
According to the Georgetown study, 
the number of Nevada children without health insurance fell by 35 percent in just 1 year. In 2013, 15 percent of chil-dren in Nevada lacked health insurance coverage. One year later, that number fell to 9.3 percent. 
Reading directly from that report: 
States with the sharpest declines in the 
rate of uninsured children were Nevada, Col-orado, West Virginia, Mississippi, and Rhode Island. Nevada’s decline was considerably larger than any other State. 
A 35-percent increase in the number 
of insured children in 1 year is remark-able. It means more children have ac-cess to the care they need to stay healthy. A number of these children will be able to go to the doctor for the first time in their lives. It is yet fur-ther proof that the Affordable Care Act is working in Nevada and across Amer-ica. 
Again, I say to my friends, the Re-
publicans: Let’s start working together to improve health care. We want to work with you. If there is a problem 
you see with ObamaCare, let’s work to-gether. We have been able to make some improvements in this law, and we want to make more improvements. We just need cooperation from our Repub-lican friends. 
The spike in the number of insured 
Nevada children is also due to the fore-sight of the Governor of the State of Nevada. Brian Sandoval is a Repub-lican. He is a proud Republican who supported the State’s Medicaid expan-sion option. He took on all the naysayers. 
Why did Brian Sandoval do this? Is 
he really one of ours? He did this be-cause he thought it was the right thing to do for the State of Nevada, and it has been proven that, in fact, is true. By expanding Medicaid in Nevada, many, many more parents were able to secure affordable health care for their kids. Quite frankly, Governor Sandoval’s courage stands in stark contrast to many of his fellow Repub-licans. 
Governors in a number of States 
dominated by Republican State legisla-tures have refused to expand coverage to the needy. These Republicans have blocked expanded coverage despite the fact that it means fewer Americans and their children have access to the health care they need. This means that people are dying as a result of this. 
Two States with the highest rates of 
uninsured children, Alaska and Texas, have rejected Medicare expansion, and others have done the same. There were many Republicans in Nevada who wanted to go the same route. The Re-publican State legislature within the 
Nevada congressional delegation op-posed all efforts to increase access to health care. They have voted to repeal ObamaCare time and time again, but Governor Sandoval was not swayed by the cynics in his own party. He refused to let politics stand in the way of chil-dren’s health, and today Nevada’s chil-dren are better for it. 
I repeat, the Affordable Care Act is 
helping American families, it is help-ing Nevada families, and it is working especially well in States that are actu-ally using the law as it was intended. 
I hope more Republicans will follow 
Governor Sandoval’s examples, thus helping their States and their constitu-ents by expanding access to quality health care. I am an admirer of Gov-ernor Sandoval, and that is saying a lot. His opponent in the last election was my son. But I have to say this: In spite of the fact that my son came in second, Brian Sandoval has done an outstanding job as Governor. I admire him and appreciate what he has done. I don’t agree with everything he has done. I had some disagreements with what he did in the legislature. None of us are perfect, and he certainly isn’t, but I appreciate what he has done for the betterment of the State of Nevada. LATINA EQUAL PAY DAY 
Mr. REID. Mr. President, earlier this 
year we recognized Equal Pay Day—a day that highlights the disparaging wage gap between women and men in the United States. Equal Pay Day marks the day when women’s wages fi-nally catch up with men’s wages from 
the previous year. 
On average, American women make 
about 77 cents for every $1 that their male colleagues make while doing the very same job. This unjust and im-moral reality is even more pronounced for women of color. 
Tomorrow is Latina Equal Pay Day, 
the point at which wages of Latina women in America catch up to men’s earnings from the previous year. It is today. They have had to work all of this time to catch up. The fact that a Hispanic woman must work a full year, plus 9 months and 30 days, just to make what her male co-workers make is cer-tainly unacceptable. 
In Nevada, Latina women earn 53 
cents for every $1 their fellow male workers make. It is not just a problem in Nevada; it is a problem nationwide. Nationwide they earn 55 cents for every $1 a man makes for doing the exact same work. All told, the wage gap that Latina women face results in a loss of over $25,000 a year for these women. That is $25,000 that could be used to help these women sustain their fami-lies. 
To make matters worse, the wage 
gaps that exist between Latina women and their male counterparts dispropor-tionately affect Hispanic families. Why? Because Latina women are more likely to be the primary breadwinners for their families. Thirty percent of all Hispanic families in the United States are headed by a single mother, and 40 percent of married Latina women earn more than 50 percent of their family’s income. 
As legislators, it is our duty to seek 
the well-being of all Americans. Demo-crats don’t take that responsibility lightly. We understand that when wages of women do not reflect their hard work, it undermines the strength of families and communities through-out the Nation. That is why we have continually and consistently fought to secure equal pay for equal work. 
Five times in 5 years Republicans 
have stood in the way of equal pay for women. They have stood in the way of equal wages for their own sisters, daughters, and wives. Even Republican women—that is Republican Members of Congress—have refused to address this important issue. The proposal that Re-publicans have put forward falls short of ensuring real equal pay protections and ignores the realities women face in fighting for fair pay. In so doing, Re-publicans have proudly placed their stamp of approval on unequal pay-checks across America. 
The wage gap Latina women endure 
is a disgrace to this Nation. No woman should make less than a man who does the exact same work. Latina women

deserve the hard-earned wages for 
which they work. They also deserve elected officials who will advocate on their behalf. 
As we recognize Latina Equal Pay 
Day, I call on Republicans to support a pay equity bill that empowers women to receive equal pay they have so right-ly earned, not just because it strength-ens families and benefits our country but because it is the right thing to do.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today we 
are kicking off a debate on major bi-partisan legislation. Chairman H
ATCH  
and I are also involved in an important Senate Finance Committee hearing. He will be here a little bit later today. 
I ask unanimous consent that our 
colleague, Senator D
URBIN from Illi-
nois, be allowed to speak after I do. I believe that his remarks will also be completed before Chairman H
ATCH ar-
rives. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Presiding 
Officer. 
Chairman H ATCH and I will be man-
aging this bill, and we want our col-leagues to know that we are anxious to give everyone an opportunity to speak out on this extraordinarily important issue. If Senators who wish to speak come down and consult with the Fi-nance staff—majority and minority—in 
our respective cloakrooms, we are going to work very hard to accommo-date all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. 
Here, in my view, is what this issue is 
all about. Fiscal battles in the Con-gress come and go, but nothing should ever be allowed to threaten America’s sterling economic reputation, and this legislation will preserve it. Without this agreement, the Congress is staring at a potential debt default—a debt de-fault that would be literally days away, when the Treasury would lose its authority to borrow in order to make payments. 
By now, I think a lot of Senators un-
derstand the disastrous consequences of default: housing costs shooting up-ward, retirement accounts shrinking, jobs disappearing, and consumer con-fidence dropping. We also understand that no one can get particularly thrilled by the prospect of raising the debt ceiling. Yet it is a job that must be done. 
Our country is an economic rock in 
tumultuous seas, and we certainly have disagreements. Disagreements prac-tically come with every news cycle and election. But what doesn’t change is that our country pays its debts and we pay them on time. That is why this legislation is so important. 
The bipartisan compromise reduces 
the threats of a potential government shutdown in December. When this be-comes law, the pin, in effect, goes back in the grenade, where it belongs. That is positive news, as we look for some predictability and certainty, and we all hear from our businesses, our employ-ers, and our citizens that this is so im-portant. 
Congress ought to look at this com-
promise, in my view, as a springboard to a full and productive debate over the budget in the upcoming 2 years. The fact is, last-minute deals have become too commonplace and they have left a lot of important policy reforms and policy improvements on the cutting room floor. 
For example, with America’s West 
getting hotter and drier each year, our broken system of budgeting for wildfires is in drastic need of improve-ment. The same goes for many pro-grams and services that are a lifeline for rural America. Fortunately, this legislation lays the groundwork for the Congress to go back to having robust budget debates that can actually solve these challenges. 
With my time this morning, I wish to 
address some specific elements of the bill, starting with what I see as several particularly constructive policies. 
First, the legislation staves off the 
full brunt of the automatic budget cuts known in the corridors of Washington as sequestration. This policy was de-signed in effect to be painful from the get-go, and it would weaken Medicare, the lifeline for older people, and other domestic programs. It was supposed to be considered so god-awful that it would vanish 2 years after it began, but 
it continues to haunt budget debates to this day. 
It is important that this legislation 
eases the burden by $80 billion over 2 years. That means more opportunities to invest in education, in medical and scientific research, in housing assist-ance, in public health, and more. 
Second, this bipartisan plan is going 
to prevent a big spike in Medicare 
costs for millions of older people. Sev-eral weeks ago, the news came down that seniors were facing a hike in pre-miums and deductibles in Medicare Part B, the outpatient portion of Medi-care, of potentially more than 50 per-cent. That would amount to an in-crease of hundreds of dollars—perhaps more—in a year when Social Security benefits are not expected to grow. From my years as codirector of Or-egon’s Gray Panthers, I can tell my colleagues that for many seniors living on a fixed income, that would have really hit them like a wrecking ball. 
When we got those initial reports, 
several of my Democratic colleagues and I got together and introduced leg-islation that would fully shield older people from this huge financial hit. Following our work, the bipartisan compromise before the Senate includes a version of this important fix. It is not as generous as the proposal my col-leagues and I introduced. There are questions about how it will affect the landscape a few years down the road. But, make no mistake about it, this approach goes a long, long way toward protecting seniors, particularly the dual eligibles—seniors eligible for Medicare and Medicaid—and this is a very important part of this legislation. 
Third, the budget compromise takes 
an extraordinarily important step to shore up one of our country’s most vital safety net programs: the Social Security Disability Insurance Pro-gram. Without a fix, what is called SSDI—Social Security disability insur-ance benefits—that workers have earned would have been slashed by 20 percent, and that 20-percent cut would have hit those affected very quickly. 
This proposal is going to follow what 
has been a frequently used bipartisan approach of shifting funding within the Social Security Program to make sure that those who depend on this program are protected through 2022. I intro-duced legislation earlier this year, along with 28 of our colleagues, which would have gone further by guaran-teeing that the program remain sol-
vent through 2034, but this compromise package strengthens the program for several years, and we will have a chance to come together—hopefully on a bipartisan basis—and go even further. 
Fourth, the budget package makes 
real progress on what is called com-plying with our tax laws—tax compli-ance. It is important to note that these are not tax hikes. This is a question of enforcing tax law so that when taxes are owed, they are actually paid. 
In the tax compliance area, there are 
several important proposals that are

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7605 October 29, 2015 
going to crack down on taxpayers who 
seek to dodge their responsibilities and pass the buck to other Americans. For example, enforcing the tax laws with respect to large partnerships has been a challenge for some time. There are more than 10,000 of these complex busi-nesses in our country. More than 500 of them have at least 100,000 partners. So there has not been an effective way to conduct audits under the current rules because the rules are basically decades old and haven’t kept up with the times. In my view, the proposal before the Senate makes meaningful improve-ments. More taxpayers will pay what they owe instead of using sleight-of- hand approaches to dodge their respon-sibilities. 
We all understand that the Tax Code 
almost boggles the mind in terms of its complexity. I think it would be fair to say there may be more work that goes into getting this policy right as it re-lates to partnerships and several of the other issues, and my colleagues and I on the Finance Committee intend to keep giving the scrutiny the partner-ship issue deserves on an ongoing anal-ysis. 
Those are four specific areas of 
progress in this compromise that staves off a risky budgetary battle. 
I do feel it is important to share one 
of my concerns with the bill at this time, and it is a provision that really has little to do with the budget. It is called section 301, and it allows debt collectors to make robocalls directly to Americans’ cell phones. Here is my view. Debt collectors should not be gifted broad permission to harass our citizens, particularly through robocalls, running up costly charges in many cases. The Federal Communica-tions Commission has limits on the number and duration of calls, and they are not sufficient. In a healthier budget process, this kind of proposal would get weeded out. So I would like to say to our colleagues in the Senate, both Democrats and Republicans, that I am going to do everything I can to reverse this action in the weeks ahead. 
Finally, in my capacity as ranking 
member of the Finance Committee, I wish to discuss how these fiscal agree-ments ought to be financed in the fu-ture. Medicare and Social Security ab-solutely cannot become the honey pots that Congress raids whenever it needs to pay for legislation. If we go around the country—to Oregon, to Illinois, to Georgia, to the Dakotas, to Texas—and we ask typical Americans what they want their representatives in Congress to do, protecting Medicare and Social Security is right at the top of the list. I hear it in every townhall meeting. I have had more than 700 of them in my home State. And I have to believe many colleagues in South Dakota and Illinois and elsewhere hear the same thing. 
There is a longstanding tradition 
that says changes in Medicare policy should be for strengthening Medicare in the future. The same principle goes for Social Security. Yet, twice now, 
these vital programs have been used to fund budget deals, and Medicare se-questration is sticking around long past its original expiration date. 
This legislation preventing a calami-
tous default is coming down to the wire. I would tell colleagues that this is a must-pass bill. I support it, and I urge Democrats and Republicans to do so as well. 
I would also say as we talk about 
where we go from here that it is impor-tant to recognize that Medicare and Social Security must not be used as ATMs for other spending in the future. The bottom line has to be that the process of reaching a budget and keep-ing the lights on in this wonderful in-stitution—the people’s branch—keep-ing the lights on in the process of reaching a budget has to change. The Congress cannot continue to just go from crisis to crisis to crisis. It is our job as lawmakers, working in a bipar-tisan way, to set the right temperature in our economy with smart, forward- looking policies that help our busi-nesses succeed and give everybody in America—I want to emphasize that; ev-erybody in America—the opportunity to get ahead. It is pretty hard to do when we lurch from one crisis to an-other. 
Let’s use this legislation as an oppor-
tunity to get back to writing the budg-et in a bipartisan fashion through the traditional approaches that have been used in what is called regular order, pass this bill now so as to ensure that America’s sterling economic reputa-tion is intact, and then let’s look to the future around some of the prin-ciples I have laid out. 
Again, Chairman H
ATCH will be here 
in a bit. He and I, as the managers of the bill, want to make it clear we want to try to accommodate as many col-leagues as we can, and we ought to be able to. I look forward to the remarks of the distinguished senior Senator from Illinois. I believe that before too long Chairman H
ATCH will be here as 
well. 
With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The as-
sistant Democratic leader. 
UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX  
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, yester-
day the senior Senator from Arizona, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, came to the floor to speak to an issue and mentioned my name several times during the course of his remarks on the floor. I come here this morning to respond to the senior Senator from Arizona. 
The issue is a decision by the Depart-
ment of Defense on October 7 of this year to place the University of Phoe-nix, a for-profit university, on proba-tion and prohibit the company from en-rolling new Department of Defense tui-tion assistance and MyCAA bene-ficiaries. Under this Department of De-fense order, the company—University of Phoenix—was barred from accessing military bases. This is a serious action, and there is a reason for it. The senior Senator from Arizona 
came to the floor to protest this deci-sion by the Department of Defense and to also protest other actions that have been taken relative to other for-profit universities. I come this morning to re-spond. 
What is at stake is something that is 
very essential. When men and women volunteer for our military and hold up 
their hands and say ‘‘I am willing to die for this country,’’ they make a promise and we make a promise. Our promise is that if you will serve this country and risk your life for America, we will stand by you when you come home. If you are injured, we will pro-vide medical care. If you want to pur-sue education and training, we will help you do it; in fact, we will help your family do it. And there are many other benefits that we rightly promise to these members of the military. 
Department of Defense tuition assist-
ance and the GI bill, which has been characterized as the GI bill since World War II, is really the vehicle that gives to many of these servicemembers, while they are serving and after they have completed their service, a chance to build their lives. They are generous programs, and they should be. MyCAA is generous to their families, and it should be. But these are virtually once- in-a-lifetime opportunities. We hope these members of the military choose well in terms of the courses they need to take and the training they need to prepare for their lives after they have served our country. We have a respon-sibility when it comes to those who are currently in the service to monitor the activities of the schools that are offer-ing education and training as part of these programs. We would be derelict in our responsibility if we did not. 
The Department of Defense wrote a 
memorandum of understanding to all schools saying: If you want to offer Tuition Assistance program training and education, if you want to offer training for the families of service-members, here are the rules to play by. And I think virtually every institution of higher learning knows going in to follow the rules, whatever the institu-tion may be. 
Let me say a word about the Univer-
sity of Phoenix. This is not just an-other for-profit school; it is the largest by far. At the height of its enrollment, the University of Phoenix, a for-profit university largely offering online courses, had as many as 600,000 stu-dents. That is dramatically more than the combined enrollment of all the Big Ten colleges and universities. Over the years—in the last 5 years, the size of their student body has declined; it is now slightly over 200,000. As an indi-vidual institution, it is the largest in America, and it certainly is the largest of the for-profit colleges and univer-sities. You can hardly escape the ad-vertising, the naming rights to the sta-dium where the Arizona Cardinals play their football games in Arizona. They have advertising on television, radio,

and billboards. It is a company that 
markets in every direction and as a consequence has built a large student enrollment. 
How about the University of Phoenix 
in terms of dollars it receives? That is interesting. Unlike universities and colleges around the United States, whether in North Dakota, South Da-kota, Nebraska, Illinois, or wherever, 
these for-profit universities get a sub-stantial portion of their revenue di-rectly from the Treasury through Pell grants and student loans. Dramatically higher percentages of their revenue come from Treasury than virtually any other college or university. This is unique to the for-profit college and university sector. They are the most heavily subsidized for-profit private businesses in America today. 
Let me give an example of what I am 
talking about. Eighty-two percent of the revenue going to the University of Phoenix—$2.7 billion—comes out of title IV. When it comes to Department of Defense tuition assistance, Univer-sity of Phoenix is the fourth largest re-cipient in the United States—$20 mil-lion. Under the GI bill, it is the largest recipient from the Department of De-fense and the Treasury—$346 million. Their CEO, Mr. Cappelli, is paid $8 mil-lion a year in total compensation, which is dramatically more than vir-tually any other university president in the ordinary course of higher edu-cation—what is a record. 
University of Phoenix students cu-
mulatively owe more in student debt than any educational institution in America. University of Phoenix stu-dents owe $35 billion in student loans. Only half of the University of Phoenix borrowers are paying down their debt 5 years after graduation or after they have dropped out of school. Phoenix’s overall 3-year repayment rate—that means how many borrowers are mak-ing payments on their debt after 3 years—is 41 percent. Less than half of the University of Phoenix students and graduates after 3 years are paying back. Their 5-year repayment rate is 47 percent. Nearly one out of every two students who graduated or dropped out in 2009 has defaulted within 5 years. The University of Phoenix’s 5-year co-hort default rate—students who grad-uated in 2009 and defaulted by 2014—is 45 percent. The Arizona location— which includes online students across the country—the 4-year bachelor’s- seeking graduation rate is 1 percent and the 6-year bachelor’s-seeking grad-uation rate is 10 percent. 
In the for-profit college and univer-
sity industry, there are three numbers to remember. Ten percent of the stu-dents graduating from high school go to these for-profit schools. Twenty per-cent of all the Federal aid for edu-cation goes to these schools. Why? They are very expensive. The tuition they charge is dramatically more than colleges and universities across the country. But here is the number to re-member: As an industry, 40 percent of all the student loan defaults are stu-
dents who attend for-profit colleges and universities. Why? It is so darned expensive that students can’t continue the education and drop out or they complete the education and many times find that the diploma is worth-less. 
Let’s go back to the Department of 
Defense. We want to protect our men and women in uniform from being ex-ploited by any college or university, for-profit or not. The Department of Defense wrote a memorandum of un-derstanding and said: If you want to offer courses to our men and women in uniform, here are the rules to play by. 
On October 7, the Department of De-
fense announced that they placed the University of Phoenix on probation and prohibited them from enrolling new servicemembers in the DOD Tuition Assistance and MyCAA Programs. They barred them from accessing mili-tary bases. The decision, the Depart-ment said, was based on violations of the memorandum of understanding, which I described this morning, based on their own review. 
Yesterday the senior Senator from 
Arizona came to the floor to protest the decision by the Department of De-fense. There were several things he said during the course of his floor state-ment which I would like to address. 
The senior Senator from Arizona 
claimed that the Department of De-fense’s ‘‘actions were taken without due process’’ and based on ‘‘an outside investigative report.’’ The Senator went on to say that it ‘‘wasn’t a de-partment investigation. There was no scrutiny.’’ He said that on the floor to protest the Department of Defense de-cision. 
Here are the facts. The Department 
of Defense conducted nearly 4 months of review of the University of Phoenix’s practices after the report by the Center for Investigative Reporting raised alle-gations relating to the company strat-egy using corporate sponsorship of events on military bases to skirt the Federal rules on recruitment that had been spelled out in the memorandum of understanding. 
The Department of Defense placed 
the University of Phoenix on probation when its review ‘‘revealed several vio-lations of the Department of Defense Memorandum of Understanding.’’ DOD also gave the company 14 days to pro-vide the Department of Defense with materials in response to the decision. 
To argue that there was no due proc-
ess in this is betrayed by the facts. 
The senior Senator from Arizona 
went on to say: ‘‘If the University of Phoenix is guilty of some wrongdoing, I want to be one of the first to make sure that proper penalties are en-acted.’’ 
Here is the fact: The Department of 
Defense confirmed that the University of Phoenix is guilty of wrongdoing. The Department of Defense’s notice to the university stated that ‘‘it conducted a review of the agreements between the University of Phoenix and the DoD, as 
reflected in the DoD MOU. . . . This re-view revealed several violations of the DoD MOU attributed to the University of Phoenix, including, but not limited to, transgression of Defense Depart-ment policies regarding use of its offi-cial seals or other trademark insignia and failure to go through the respon-sible education advisor for each busi-ness related activity requiring access to the DoD installations. . . .’’ They go on to say that they found that ‘‘the fre-quency and scope of these previous vio-lations of the DoD MOU is dis-concerting.’’ 
Despite this, the senior Senator from 
Arizona is urging the Department of Defense to ignore what they found in their investigation and to reverse their decision putting the company on pro-bation. 
The senior Senator from Arizona 
went on to call Phoenix’s violations ‘‘minor breaches in decorum’’ and ‘‘technical in nature.’’ 
The Department of Defense found 
that the University of Phoenix violated terms of its memorandum of under-standing—a legal document laying out the rules and standards every institu-tion must adhere to in order to be eli-gible to participate in voluntary mili-tary education programs. For instance, this document specifies that the base’s education officer, not the base com-mander, is the sole approving author-ity for any and all access to the base. In their violation of this memorandum of understanding provision, the Depart-ment of Defense called the University of Phoenix’s violations disconcerting in their frequency and scope. 
The company had a corporate strat-
egy of spending millions of dollars to sponsor events on military bases to skirt Department of Defense rules and the 2012 Executive order that was de-signed to prohibit institutions from re-cruiting servicemembers on military bases. 
Mr. President, let me spell out some 
of the things that were being done by the University of Phoenix. Remember what we are talking about. This uni-versity is receiving $20 million a year through DOD tuition assistance and $346 million through the GI bill. Of course, it is a big profit center for them to continue this pursuit of the military, and they spent a lot of money to support it, and that is what got them in trouble. 
The University of Phoenix spent over 
$250,000 in the last 3 years just in one location—Fort Campbell, KY—spon-soring 89 events. One event featured a performer named Big Smo; that alone cost $25,000. Across the country, the University of Phoenix sponsored events on military bases, including rock con-certs, Super Bowl parties, father- daughter dances, Easter egg hunts, a chocolate festival, and even brunch with Santa. 
The University of Phoenix paid the 
Department of Defense to have its staff serve as exclusive re ´sume´advisers in

Hiring Our Heroes job fairs and work-
shops, many on military bases. A Cen-ter of Investigative Reporting hidden camera documented that all of the re´sume´workshop materials, presen-
tation slides, and sample ‘‘successful’’ re´sume´s were labeled with University 
of Phoenix marketing, and trainers urged attendees to go to the University of Phoenix Web site for more informa-tion. 
The University of Phoenix used 
‘‘challenge coins’’—which the Senator from Arizona raised on the floor—with DOD seals and logos to show its close relationship with the military without receiving prior approval. The Senator from Arizona noted that other schools have done the same thing, including, he mentioned, Southern Illinois Uni-versity. This Senator is not going to send a letter to the DOD protesting if they hold SIU or any school account-able for the same conduct as the Uni-versity of Phoenix. The senior Senator from Arizona did, and I think he ought to reflect on that for a moment. 
The senior Senator from Arizona 
says the University of Phoenix has a long history of serving nontraditional students, such as Active-Duty military and others. According to Paul Reickhoff of the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the university of Phoenix ‘‘is constantly reported as the single worst by far’’ when it comes to for-profit colleges taking advantage of its members. 
The Senator from Arizona says the 
Consumer Financial Protection Bu-reau, the Education Department, and the California attorney general, Kamala Harris, drove another for-prof-it school, Corinthian, out of business without ever proving misconduct, and now we are attempting to do the same to the University of Phoenix. 
The fact is, there are ongoing inves-
tigations into the University of Phoe-nix by the Federal Trade Commission related to unfair and deceptive prac-tices, including military recruitment and the handling of student personal information. There is an investigation underway of the University of Phoenix by the Department of Education’s in-spector general related to marketing, recruitment, enrollment, financial aid processing, fraud prevention, student retention, personnel training, attend-ance, academic grading, et cetera. 
There is an ongoing investigation 
into the University of Phoenix by the Security and Exchange Commission re-lating to insider trading, and not one but three different state attorneys gen-eral are investigating the University of Phoenix for unfair and deceptive prac-tices. The Senator from Arizona comes and protests that we are involved in some sort of ideological grandstanding—that is what he said, ideological grandstanding—ignoring the evidence which I have presented this morning about the investigations into the University of Phoenix going on across agencies, State and Federal, and the investigation by the Depart-ment of Defense that led to this deci-
sion. 
He also went on to say yesterday in 
his remarks: 
Last year, the Education Department, Con-
sumer Financial Protection Bureau— 
And an individual named Ms. Har-
ris— 
mounted a coordinated campaign that drove 
for-profit Corinthian College out of business without ever proving misconduct. 
They were able to drive a college out 
of business. What a coincidence that he would make that statement on the floor of the Senate yesterday, the same day it was reported that a Federal judge in Chicago ordered Corinthian College—now bankrupt—to pay $530 million to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, resolving a year- long lawsuit against the for-profit chain for allegedly steering students into predatory student loans. 
The CFPB Director, Richard Cordray, 
said in a statement, ‘‘Today’s ruling marks the end of our litigation against a company that has severely harmed tens of thousands of students, turning dreams of higher education into a nightmare.’’ I don’t understand how the Senator from Arizona could come to the floor the same day this Federal decision was reported and raise this 
issue without some knowledge of what the Corinthian Colleges were doing. What they were doing was lying. They were misrepresenting to the Federal Government how many students were employed after they graduated. It turns out Corinthian was paying em-ployers several thousand dollars to hire their students—graduates—for a month or two so they could report to the Fed-eral Government they had jobs. 
Of course, when the money ran out 
from Corinthian, the students lost those part-time jobs. Corinthian was caught. They were asked to provide in-formation to refute what I have just said. Instead of doing that, they start-ed dissembling and going out of busi-ness. They were also steering students to what they called genesis loans at Corinthian College. Students were pay-ing outrageous tuition and fees for bachelor’s degrees, $60,000 or $75,000, and then they were facing genesis loans, they called them, with interest rates as high as 15 percent. 
This industry does have good schools 
and good courses in the for-profit busi-ness sector, I am sure, but there has clearly been misconduct. We have to call them on it and hold them respon-sible. It is our Federal Government that virtually acknowledges the ac-creditation of these schools that offer Pell grants and direct student loans to their students, creating the impression among students and families that these are perfectly good colleges and univer-sities. We have a responsibility to stu-dents and families across this Nation to police their ranks when there is mis-conduct. In this case, the Department of Defense looked closely and decided that the University of Phoenix was in-volved in misconduct. That is why they reached their decision. There was a letter that was prepared 
by a number of organizations—I will not read all of their names—but it was sent October 27 this week to the Honor-able Ashton Carter, the Secretary of Defense, thanking the Department for their recent action when it came to the University of Phoenix. These organiza-tions went on to catalog the things I have said this morning. They also talk about the students these organizations have worked with. This letter says servicemember complaints regarding the University of Phoenix fall into three categories: servicemembers who were signed up for loans without their knowledge or permission after being promised they would incur no loans, servicemembers who were misled about the cost of tuition increases at the Uni-versity of Phoenix, servicemembers who were misled about the accredita-tion and transferability of University of Phoenix credits. 
Yesterday, the senior Senator from 
Arizona cited three students. I would like to read from this letter. They note three students who were members of the military commenting on the Uni-versity of Phoenix. First, Cody Edie, of the U.S. Marines said: 
I was told these credits would transfer any-
where nationwide but as I began my transi-tion from active duty I found out they will not transfer to the schools in my home state. I wasted my time and 15 credits for nothing. 
A statement from Erin Potter, U.S. 
Army: 
I was told by the University of Phoenix 
that I would be eligible for grants that I did not have to pay back. I came to find out they 
enrolled me in loans and now I cannot afford the payments. 
From Dennis Chamberlain, U.S. 
Army: 
I attended the University of Phoenix to ob-
tain my bachelors degree. I racked up close to $20,000 in debt to attain my degree. I feel they targeted me for my military student aid. I struggle every month paying back the student loans I could have avoided. I was shot twice in Afghanistan by shrapnel from RPGs. 
The letter is signed by about 20 dif-
ferent organizations: the Air Force Sergeants Association, the Association of the U.S. Navy, the American Asso-ciation of State Colleges and Univer-sities, Blue Star Families, Paralyzed Veterans of America. 
I ask unanimous consent to have this 
letter printed in the R

There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the R

D
EAR SECRETARY CARTER : We write to 
thank you and your staff for the Depart-ment’s recent action to enforce its Tuition Assistance Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the University of Phoenix. The MOU is the Department’s main tool for im-plementing Executive Order 13607 and its di-rective to protect service members from de-ceptive recruiting, including surreptitious recruiting on military installations. 
In these difficult financial times, pro-
tecting the integrity of the Tuition Assist-ance program is essential to preservation of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7608 October 29, 2015 
the program and its goal of military readi-
ness and professional development for our men and women in uniform. In this context, the Department’s action to enforce the MOU is a prudent measure, and we feel more needs to be done to protect the integrity of the program. Failure to take swift and serious action against violations of the MOU harms service members, taxpayers, and the pro-gram itself, and sends the wrong message to other MOU signatories about the accept-ability of violations. 
The Department’s investigation concluded 
that ‘‘the frequency and scope’’ of the Uni-versity’s violations was ‘‘disconcerting,’’ in-cluding ‘‘transgression of Defense Depart-ment policies regarding use of its official seals or other trademark insignia and failure to go through the responsible education ad-visor for each business related activity re-quiring access to the DoD installations.’’ The Department’s letter to the University also raised concern that ‘‘several additional provisions’’ of the MOU may have been vio-lated if allegations are substantiated about deceptive marketing, recruiting, and billing of U.S. military personnel raised in the law enforcement inquiries of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and California Attorney General. We also would draw to your atten-tion similar allegations that also, if substan-tiated, would violate provisions of the MOU, raised in ongoing investigations of the At-torneys General of Delaware, Florida, and Massachusetts; the Enforcement Division of the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission; the Mid-Atlantic Region of the U.S. Edu-cation Department’s Office of Inspector Gen-eral; and the whistleblower suit brought by University of Phoenix military recruiters filed in the federal district court in Ken-tucky. 
Although signatories to the MOU promise 
to eliminate unfair and deceptive marketing and recruiting, such practices continue. For example, many of our organizations are help-ing service members and veterans who expe-rienced deceptive recruiting, and nearly 1,000 of these attended the University of Phoenix. Their experiences over the past decade, and through 2015, demonstrate a pattern con-sistent with the allegations made by current law enforcement investigations. Service 
members’ complaints regarding the Univer-sity of Phoenix tend to fall into three cat-egories: (1) service members who were signed up for loans without their knowledge or per-mission, after being promised they would incur no loans; (2) service members who were misled about the cost and tuition increases at University of Phoenix; and (3) service members who were misled about the accredi-tation and transferability of University of Phoenix credits. Below is a small sampling of complaints about the University of Phoenix from service members who used Tuition As-sistance. The first student attended the Uni-versity as recently as 2015: 
‘‘I was told these credits would transfer 
anywhere nationwide but as I begin my tran-sition from active duty, I found out they will not transfer to the schools in my home state. I wasted my time and 15 credits for noth-ing.’’—Cody Edie, U.S. Marines E–4 
‘‘I was told by University of Phoenix that 
I would be eligible for grants that I did not have to pay back. I came to find out they en-rolled me in loans and now I cannot afford the payments.’’—Erin Potter, U.S. Army E–5 
‘‘I attended University of Phoenix to at-
tain my bachelors degree. I racked up close to $20,000 in debt to attain my degree. I feel they targeted me for my military student aid. I struggle every month paying back the student loans I could have avoided. I was shot twice in Afghanistan by shrapnel from RPGs.’’—Dennis Chamberlain, U.S. Army 0–3 
Because the Department’s action affects 
only prospective students, we also urge you to alert service members currently enrolled 
at the University about the probation and current law enforcement investigations, and remind them about the availability of the Department’s complaint system. Doing so would aid those students and enhance the Department’s ability to identify MOU infrac-tions. As you may know, the University was required by SEC rules to notify its investors of these actions; current students deserve to be informed as well. 
We thank you for your efforts to protect 
the integrity of the Tuition Assistance pro-gram and to protect service members from deceptive recruiting practices. We hope the Department will continue to take action against violations and consider that rein-statement following a short probation could indicate to other MOU signatories that vio-lations are met with little repercussion.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am 
going to wrap up. I read carefully what the senior Senator from Arizona had to say yesterday. I hope I have addressed each of the major points he raised. There was indeed an investigation. There were standards which the Uni-versity of Phoenix agreed to follow and then failed to follow. There is an effort underway to make sure we protect the men and women in the military and their families from exploitation when it comes to their GI bills. We should continue that effort. 
I hope my friend and colleague from 
Arizona who has made a record in the Senate of speaking up, standing up to avoid those misuses of Federal funds, will continue in that same vein when it comes to this issue. We want money well spent. We want our men and uni-form well served. 
I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. 
F
LAKE ). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President. I 
ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CROP INSURANCE PROGRAM  
Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
chairman of the Senate agriculture committee is on the floor, and I thank 
him for his tenacity and diligent work on behalf of America’s farmers and rural communities. 
I have discussed with the chairman 
his concerns about crop insurance pro-visions in the fiscal agreement and their impact on farmers, concerns which are shared by our counterparts in the House of Representatives. I also have concerns about the changes to crop insurance and what it will mean to the future farmers in my State. We have a big agricultural community in Kentucky, and I have certainly heard from them in great numbers over the past couple of days. 
Farming has been a long tradition in 
my State. Kentucky is made up largely of smaller family farms—farms that have been passed down from generation to generation. These folks rely heavily on the notion that a bad-crop-yield year will not stop their ability to con-tinue farming because of the certainty provided through this crop insurance program. 
It is our joint understanding that the 
House leaders will work to reverse these crop insurance changes and find bipartisan alternative deficit reduction savings when they consider the omni-bus appropriations bill later this year. 
So I assure my friend from Kansas 
and the other Members of our con-ference who care about this that I will work closely with him to support the House in these efforts. 
Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, will 
the distinguished leader yield? 
Mr. M
CCONNELL. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise 
to engage in this colloquy that our dis-tinguished Republican leader has al-ready mentioned or stressed. I also thank our majority whip, the Senator from Texas, and the senior Senator from South Dakota, Mr. T
HUNE , with 
regard to a commitment made between all of us on the floor. 
This commitment is in reference to 
the obvious need to remedy the lan-guage adversely affecting our Nation’s farmers and ranchers that is now in-cluded in the Bipartisan Budget Act. This provision, section 201, included in the underlying bill, should it go into effect, would greatly damage the crop insurance program as we know it, not to mention the farmers who purchase this crop insurance. 
The commitment we have reached is 
to reverse these damaging cuts and pol-icy changes to the crop insurance pro-gram in order to protect our producers’ primary risk management tool and their No. 1 priority. In all of the great talk and effort that we had to pass the farm bill—over 400 days—the No. 1 issue to farmers, ranchers, and every commodity group and every farm orga-nization was crop insurance. 
This legislative action—or fix, if we 
want to call it that—will take place in consideration of the year-end spending bill. I have been working very closely

with House Agriculture Committee 
Chairman M IKE CONAWAY , who has 
reached a similar position with the House leadership. It was a tough trail, but M
IKEgot it done. 
We have all agreed here to restore 
these funds to the program and reverse this policy and do so with support from the House and the Senate. 
I yield to our distinguished majority 
whip. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ex-
press my gratitude to the majority leader and to the chairman of the agri-culture committee in the Senate, as well as to the two Senators from South Dakota, Mr. T
HUNE and Mr. R OUNDS , 
for their cooperation and their com-mitment to address this issue. 
I particularly wish to join the chair-
man of the agriculture committee, Senator R
OBERTS , in commending M IKE 
CONAWAY , a good Texan, who is chair-
man of the House Agriculture Com-mittee, whom I know cares very deeply about this issue. 
Texas is a huge agricultural State 
and 98 percent of our agricultural pro-duction is run by families and employs one out of every seven Texans. Texas ranchers and farmers are no strangers to the perils caused by drought and other weather-related events beyond their control. 
With the current regulatory environ-
ment and unforeseen perils they face, I understand the necessity and the via-bility of the crop insurance program to their livelihoods. 
So I wish to say that I too stand 
ready to support our colleagues, work-ing together to find a solution to this important problem. 
I yield the floor. Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I yield 
to my distinguished friend and col-league from South Dakota, the senior Senator from South Dakota, Mr. T
HUNE . 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Dakota is recognized. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I wish to 
thank the Senator from Kansas, who is the distinguished chairman of the agri-culture committee, on which I serve, as well as the leader and the whip in the Senate. 
I rise in support as well of restoring 
what would be some very devastating cuts to an important program, the crop insurance program. The cuts were sup-posed to be imposed by the budget agreement that was reached and that we are going to be voting on later today. 
Crop insurance plays a critical role 
in supporting South Dakota agri-culture. It is my State’s No. 1 industry. Crop losses due to drought, wind, hail, and excessive moisture provide the greatest challenges to economic sur-vival and sustainability in production agriculture. Crop insurance provides the only viable risk management tool to meet those challenges. So it is im-perative that we preserve crop insur-ance and maintain its viability. I support the agreement that has 
been discussed on the floor today. I will work with the leader, the chairman, my Senate colleagues, and my col-league from South Dakota, Senator R
OUNDS , who has been involved in these 
discussions, to make sure we find a rea-sonable alternative to the unworkable cuts to crop insurance that are found in section 201 of the Bipartisan Budget Act. 
I thank the majority leader, the 
whip, and the chairman of our agri-culture committee for their commit-ment to our farming families and rural economies across this great country. I also thank those who have worked in the House to come to a point where we can have this discussion and move for-ward in a way that will preserve what is a very important program for pro-duction agriculture in this country. 
I ask the chairman of the agriculture 
committee, Senator R
OBERTS , through 
the Presiding Officer, if the House has reached a similar agreement in terms of the discussion that we are having in the Senate today. 
Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I 
thank my friend for the question. I re-spond to my friend that, yes, the chair-man, M
IKECONAWAY , has reached a bi-
partisan agreement with the House leadership and also the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, Mr. R
OGERS from Kentucky. So there is bi-
partisan agreement with the House leadership, and it is now time for the Senate to respond. 
I also echo the comments of the sen-
ior Senator from South Dakota, with the help of Senator R
OUNDS , and I 
would be remiss in not mentioning vir-tually every member of the ag com-mittee who has been involved in this effort as well. I appreciate the work of my colleagues and the work of our ranking member, Senator S
TABENOW . I 
especially want to thank her for rais-ing this issue and helping to find an agreement. 
I note that I have worked my entire 
career to build crop insurance as a pub-lic-private partnership that best pro-tects our producers, taxpayers, and consumers, not to mention a very hun-gry and malnourished world. This agreement reached today continues in that effort to fulfill that mission. I thank the majority leader, the major-ity whip, and Senator T
HUNE for their 
commitment. I also thank many of our colleagues who helped reach this solu-tion today. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to 
speak in support of the bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, the legislation that passed in the House last night and that I expect we will be voting on soon in the Senate. 
Anyone who hasn’t been living in a 
cave for the last few weeks is aware of the controversy surrounding this legis-lation. However, while the bill is likely no one’s idea of an ideal path forward, I believe the controversy stems more 
from political considerations than from policy or substance. 
Let me say one thing up front. I don’t 
love this legislation. If we were living in the ‘‘United States of Orrin Hatch’’ this bill would look very different, but while I may not like parts of this deal very much, there are other things I like much less, including political brinksmanship on important matters and election-year posturing on com-plicated issues. 
This budget deal, while far from per-
fect, will help eliminate several hur-dles that must be overcome in the near term and hopefully allow Congress to function and to actually govern over the next year. That said, there are some very important provisions in this bill that I think will be counted as wins for good government and will help us address some important issues. So I would like to take just a few minutes and talk about some of the specifics of this legislation and why I believe these provisions are important. 
First, as we all know, the bill would 
suspend the statutory debt limit through mid-March of 2017. I have heard a number of my colleagues decry this provision, arguing that any in-crease in the debt limit should be ac-companied by fiscal reforms, and on that count my colleagues are right. 
I think you would be hard-pressed to 
find many Members in this Chamber who have spent more time than I have talking about our Nation’s debt and calling for reforms. I have spoken ex-tensively about the need to rein in our broken entitlement programs, which are the main drivers of our debt. Un-like most Members of Congress, I have actually come up with specific pro-posals that would help stave off the growing entitlement crisis. On top of that, as chairman of the Senate com-mittee with jurisdiction over the debt limit, I have repeatedly called on the Obama administration to do what past administrations have done, which is to use debt limit increases as opportuni-ties to reexamine our fiscal situation and work with Congress to find a path toward reforms that will improve our fiscal outlook. 
Unfortunately, these calls and simi-
lar calls made by other leaders in Con-gress have largely gone ignored as the administration refuses to even consider fiscal changes in the context of a debt limit increase. I am as frustrated as anyone by the refusal of this adminis-tration to even engage on this issue. However, the President’s refusal to be reasonable and to do his job when it comes to our debt is no excuse for Con-gress failing to do its job and prevent a default. 
I know some of my colleagues either 
don’t believe a default would be that bad or that the result of hitting the debt limit would even be classified as a default. I will not delve into the se-mantics of the issue, I will just say that hitting the debt limit would pre-vent the government from meeting a

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7610 October 29, 2015 
large number of its obligations. Noth-
ing good and many things that are bad will come from that result. No reason-able person would dispute that. 
In addition, I don’t think any reason-
able person wants to see Congress push up against debt limit deadlines mul-tiple times throughout 2016. Mixing a looming possibility of default with election-year posturing—and I am talk-ing about posturing on both sides of the aisle, by the way—is, in my view, a recipe for disaster. This budget bill will suspend the debt limit and spare Con-gress and the American people the spectacle of ticking debt clocks in the middle of an election season. Once again, this isn’t my preferred result, but it is much better than the alter-native. 
In addition to raising the debt limit, 
the bill would extend the life of the So-cial Security disability insurance, or SSDI, trust fund through a temporary reallocation of resources from the re-tirement trust fund into the disability insurance program. 
As we all know, the SSDI trust fund 
is set to be exhausted sometime late next year, which would lead to benefit cuts of around 20 percent for disabled Americans. I am not willing to do that. Right now, the beneficiaries in the dis-ability program face enormous uncer-tainty, and that will only get worse be-tween now and the end of 2016 if Con-gress fails to act. 
I have been urging action on this 
issue for quite some time and have put forward a number of proposals to re-form various aspects of the disability insurance program. Sadly, despite many calls for bipartisan cooperation, the administration has decided to re-main silent, aside from the very simple and overly broad reallocation proposal. Nonetheless, the budget bill will, as I mentioned, provide an interfund re-allocation that will add an additional 6 years of viability to the SSDI trust fund, preventing benefit cuts to dis-abled American workers and removing the current uncertainty. 
That is not all. The bill would also 
put in place reforms to the SSDI Pro-gram, including some of the proposals I put forward earlier this year and re-flecting a great deal of work between Chairman P
AUL RYAN of the House 
Ways and Means Committee and Rep-resentative S
AMJOHNSON , who chairs 
the Social Security Subcommittee, and me. Our work led to a number of fea-tures of the budget bill’s treatment of SSDI that will help combat fraud in the program, make it easier for those who can and desire to return to work to be able to do so, and improve the overall administration and integrity of the disability program. 
As I said before, this is not a budget 
bill that I would have written, and I think there are a number of other ways to improve the SSDI Program and So-cial Security more generally. However, nothing in the bill prevents us from continuing our work to develop and re-fine ideas and come up with additional improvements. Given the 
unsustainability of the Social Security System generally, we will have to con-tinue to work on reforms to ensure these programs are available to future generations. 
For now, we must be realistic. If we 
don’t act now to prevent next year’s benefit cuts, we will create a cliff that will occur right in the middle of an election campaign, when fundamental reforms to an entitlement program will be virtually impossible. Instead of a real debate over the future of this im-portant program, we would see accusa-tions lobbed back and forth about which side is responsible for the im-pending benefit cuts. Why would any-one want that? What good would that accomplish? 
I would also like to remind my col-
leagues that the SSDI reforms in this budget bill represent the most signifi-cant changes to any Social Security program since 1983—more than three decades ago. That is nothing to sneeze at. So while critics may be right that these changes aren’t the only types of long-term fixes the SSDI Program needs, they should not by any means be overlooked. 
While we are on the subject of enti-
tlements, I also want to point out that this budget bill will avert an unprece-dented and large increase in Medicare Part B premiums for millions of elder-ly Americans. Under the law, there is a complicated interplay between the So-cial Security and Medicare Programs, where under what is called the ‘‘hold harmless’’ rule, the majority of Medi-care beneficiaries cannot see a pre-mium increase greater than their cost- of-living adjustment under Social Se-curity. However, due to very low infla-tion, there will be no cost-of-living ad-justments in Social Security in 2016, meaning there can be no premium in-creases for the majority of Medicare Part B participants. This means the full amount of what the Medicare sys-tem needs to collect in Part B pre-miums for next year will be charged to the nearly 30 percent of Medicare bene-ficiaries who do not have their pre-miums deducted from their Social Se-curity payments. 
Long story short, absent some kind 
of action, more than one-quarter of all Medicare Part B beneficiaries will see their premiums go up as much as 52 percent in 2016. This bill is important, with all its faults, and that is a great reason to vote for it. The legislation before us will prevent this increase, once again allowing Congress to avoid a contentious fight and preventing many seniors from becoming pawns in the unending liberal political games-manship and demagoguery. Most im-portantly it would do so in a respon-sible manner. 
In addition to sparing our country 
some needless political fights over So-cial Security and Medicare, this bill will also repeal the employer autoenrollment requirement under the so-called Affordable Care Act. This pro-vision, once implemented, would re-
quire large employers to automatically enroll new employees in health insur-ance plans, putting the burden on em-ployees who prefer alternative plans to opt out. This provision, like many pro-visions of ObamaCare, never made sense and ultimately had few cham-pions outside left-leaning think tanks 
that continually advocate for the gov-ernment to ‘‘nudge’’ citizens into what some technocrats believe are preferred outcomes by removing certain nonpre-ferred choices. 
So with this legislation we have bi-
partisan agreement on the need to re-move at least part—and not an insig-nificant part—of ObamaCare. That is important. That is a good reason to vote for this. Obviously, we need to do more, but in my view any acknowl-edgement from my friends on the other side that any part of the President’s health care law doesn’t work is good progress. We haven’t been able to get them to admit that in all these years of this failing program that is going on. 
Finally, and for many most signifi-
cantly, the bipartisan budget legisla-tion would partially lift the budget caps established under the Budget Con-trol Act both for domestic spending priorities and national defense. While very few people in Congress or else-where are big fans of the sequester threat, it did result in the only legiti-mate measurable spending cuts we have seen in quite some time. It is es-pecially noteworthy, given the current administration’s seemingly insatiable desire for more debt-fueled spending. 
I sympathize with my colleagues who 
might be hesitant to lift those spend-ing caps. However, I think we need to keep a few things in mind. First, the increase in the spending baseline under this bill is fully offset. That is impor-tant. While not all of the offsets are ideal, it is important that the spending cap relief will not result in increased debt or a tax hike. Let me repeat that. It is important to note that the spend-ing cap relief will not result in in-creased debt or a tax hike. In that sense, the spending caps, even with the relief included in this bill, continue to be successful. Let me repeat that again. In that sense, the spending caps, even with the relief included in this bill, continue to be successful. 
Second, lifting the spending caps will 
help us ensure our military is properly funded, although many of us would like to do more with the world in the tur-moil it is in. Many Members of Con-gress, particularly on the Republican side, have expressed concern regarding the impact of the spending caps on our men and women in uniform and our overall military readiness.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7611 October 29, 2015 
Syria, Russian aggression in Eastern 
Europe, and our newly prolonged troop presence in Afghanistan, now is not the time to underfund our military. We need to be sure our troops have all the resources they need to succeed. 
As we know, President Obama has 
conditioned any budget-cap relief for defense on similar relief for other do-mestic spending programs. While I agree with many of my colleagues that this represents an odd set of priorities for a Commander in Chief—his No. 1 duty is to keep us safe—we should not let the President’s refusal to do right by our military lead us to do the same. 
In addition to criticisms of the sub-
stance of the bill, some of which I agree with, I have also heard com-plaints about the process that led us here. On that front as well, I share some of my colleagues’ concerns. It certainly would have been better to 
move this legislation through regular order, including committee consider-ation and an open amendment process. I can’t speak for anyone else, but I would assume that almost everyone in-volved would prefer to see legislation of this magnitude move through the House and Senate in a more delibera-tive process and a longer timetable. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, that is not what happened. 
However, much of the time, effective 
government is about the art of doing what is doable. Though Republicans control both Chambers of Congress, there is a Democrat in the White House and enough Democrats in the Senate to sustain a filibuster. That is just a fact. We have to live with that. If we want to get anything done around here, we cannot demand perfection, nor can we operate in a zero-sum environment where every victory for the other side, however minor, is considered a loss for yours. 
I get that there are some who sin-
cerely and truthfully believe that com-promise inherently means failure, and I know there are others with different agendas in mind that lead them to op-pose anything resembling a concession to the other side, no matter what their side may get in return, but I have been around here long enough to know that such an approach does not often yield satisfactory results. If you are going to wait for that perfect bill to come around, my experience has taught me that you are likely to wait a very long time. 
The budget bill before us is far from 
perfect. But, as the saying goes, the perfect should not be the enemy of the good. Under the circumstances, I be-lieve this bill needs to pass so we can solve these problems, remove many dangerous obstacles directly in front of us, and give ourselves a chance to gov-ern effectively without the cliffs, cri-ses, and deadlines that all too fre-quently dictate what we do around here. For these reasons I plan to vote yes on this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
Having said that, I would like to 
compliment our majority leader. He has one of the toughest jobs ever on 
Capitol Hill. 
I want to compliment the House as 
well. I have worked very closely with the distinguished new Speaker of the House. He is a tremendous human being. He does not reject the doable. He is a very strong conservative, one of the strongest people in either House of Congress, as is our majority leader. Both of them are doing what has to be done, and they deserve to have support in doing that. I compliment my friends on the other side for the successes they consider they have made. 
On the other hand, I wish to pay trib-
ute to our majority leader and the work that he is doing, trying to keep this fractious group of people together in so many ways and to get important legislation like this passed so that we are working on even more important legislation in the future. 
I want to personally pay tribute to 
P
AULRYANfor his election to Speaker 
of the House. We have worked very closely together, as he has been chair-man of the Ways and Means Com-mittee. We have met almost weekly ever since he took over as chairman of that committee and I as chairman of the Finance Committee. He is one of the truly great people in the Congress, and I personally want to express my view that we are lucky to have him. We are lucky to have our distinguished majority leader as well. 
I want to compliment my friends on 
the other side who have been working to do the art of the doable and, though imperfect, have worked with both of these leaders to get this done. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
THE MIDDLE EAST  
Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I rise to 
discuss a very troubled part of the world, the Middle East, a region that is experiencing perhaps the greatest tur-moil it has seen since the end of the First World War. 
After more than 4 years, with over 
200,000 people killed and 4 million forced to flee, Syria’s civil war and hu-manitarian crisis continues to drag on. President Assad still clings to power, and he clings to that power with the help of Iran, Russia, and Hezbollah. 
Opposition groups remain divided, 
and they are weak, while terrorist groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda’s al- Nusra Front exploit the chaos. ISIS also exploits sectarian tensions across the border in Iraq, where its fighters battle Iraqi and Kurdish forces, as well as Shia militias, for control of large parts of the country. And, according to press reports, a Saudi-led coalition meanwhile battles Iranian-backed Houthi rebels for control of Yemen, home to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Pe-ninsula. 
In addition to its support for Assad 
and terror and proxy groups, Iran con-tinues other hostile activities, such as testing ballistic missiles, attacking in cyberspace, and violating human rights. I think this is an important 
thing to remember, as the expectations of the Iranian joint nuclear agree-ment—this was not a panacea for all of the things that Iran is doing. As a mat-ter of fact, it specifically was a nego-tiation to prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapon, which I think has been achieved for at least 10, if not 15 to 25, years. 
Then, to add to the complications re-
garding Iran, there are still four Amer-icans detained or missing. One that is missing, of course, is our Floridian Bob Levinson, a former FBI agent. 
These are tough challenges that re-
flect a changing balance of power, and we have already taken important steps to meet them. I am talking about steps other than the Iranian nuclear joint agreement. American and coalition air strikes against ISIS in both Iraq and Syria and the training and equipping of Iraqi and Kurdish forces in Iraq have blunted ISIS’s momentum, and we are starting to see some reverses there. As the Secretary of Defense just a few days ago told our Armed Services Com-mittee, we are changing our approach to supporting the moderate Syrian op-position and equipping those forces al-ready on the battlefield against ISIS. It is much more difficult in Syria, and we have not had a lot of success in training and equipping those so-called moderate forces in Syria. 
So now the changing strategy is that 
the United States is focusing on what the Secretary of Defense referred to as the ‘‘three R’s’’—the ISIS strongholds of Raqqa in Syria and Ramadi in Iraq and then targeted raids in both to build battlefield momentum. We saw such a raid that tragically took the life of a senior enlisted Special Forces Special Operations sergeant the other day, but that raid was particularly successful in that it rescued 70 people who were about to be executed the next morning. In those raids, the three R’s the Sec-retary mentioned are underway. 
Turmoil and violence in the Middle 
East may seem distant to everyday Americans, but the consequences ex-tend far beyond those regions. We see it daily on our television screens. Tens of thousands of Syrians have sought refuge in Europe. ISIS, we are re-minded, uses the Internet and social media to spread its propaganda and radicalizes young people far from Iraq and Syria and even some in the United States. 
So in this whole perplexing problem, 
as we try to get our arms around it, meeting these challenges, protecting our national security and interests, in-cluding those of our allies like Israel, is going to take strong and patient leadership on the part of our country. 
I wanted to share these thoughts 
with the Senate. 
I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The

EXPORT -IMPORT BANK  
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it is 
not always easy to get a majority of Congress to agree on something. But when it comes to the Export-Import Bank, the numbers are now clear. Three days ago, the House easily passed a bill to reauthorize this criti-cally important program, 313 to 118. Months before that, here in the Senate, we approved reauthorization 64 to 29. That is a supermajority in both Cham-bers, so no one should think we should not be able to pass this. But right now, the will of a bipartisan supermajority is being blocked by Senate Republican leaders who have so far refused us the opportunity to act. This lack of move-ment on this critical issue is unaccept-able, and people across the country are not going to stand for it. 
Every single day that passes without 
this program in operation, America’s businesses—most of them small busi-nesses—are at a disadvantage. That is because one of the main goals of the Export-Import Bank is to level the playing field for American companies to sell their goods overseas. 
There are 60 other export credit agen-
cies worldwide, including several in China. While companies around the world are enjoying the support of their own lending programs, this Congress allowed one of its best tools to grow the economy to go dark. That is now hurting our economy at a time when we should be continuing to work to build and grow and create jobs. 
For months, I have heard from busi-
nesses in my home State of Wash-ington that they are being held back by partisan grandstanding nearly 3,000 miles away. Businesses in Washington State make great products, and they 
want to ship what they make overseas and continue to build their business at home, and Congress ought to be a good partner in that effort. 
This isn’t a Republican issue or a 
Democratic issue. This is about sup-porting American companies that are creating local jobs, adding to our econ-omy, and helping our economy grow from the middle out. It is why the Ex-port-Import Bank has had the support of this body now for more than 80 years. 
I urge Republican leaders to stop al-
lowing extreme members of their party—a minority of their party—to hold our economy hostage. It is time to renew the Export-Import Bank on be-half of American businesses, American workers, and American families. 
I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST —H.R. 597 
Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, once 
again we are down on the floor of the Senate, begging, pleading, and trying to get anyone to listen to our pleas to once again open the Export-Import Bank. As we look at the consequences of having closed—for the last 3
1⁄2 
months—the Export-Import Bank, it becomes readily apparent every day and every hour that we are losing American manufacturing jobs and we are stressing small businesses that have a strong history of reliance on the Export-Import Bank, and that we are, in fact, not only not helping American business, but we are hurting American manufacturers in this country. 
Why would we do that? Why would 
we wait one more day? Before the char-ter expired on the Export-Import Bank, we were told that the reason why—even though we had 64 votes in the Senate for the Ex-Im Bank—we couldn’t pos-sibly get this done was because the House of Representatives would not take this up. The House of Representa-tives would not move on the Ex-Im Bank, and, in fact, if it came to the floor, it was doubtful that we would ac-tually get a vote that was favorable to the Ex-Im Bank. Well, a funny thing happened when we looked at the re-ality of where the House of Representa-tives is today. 
When we counted the votes this week 
for the Ex-Im Bank, guess what; over 70 percent of the House of Representa-tives voted to reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank. And probably even more remark-able, a majority of Republicans in the House of Representatives voted to re-authorize the Ex-Im Bank. 
Now, you might wonder: What 
changed? What happened? How could we possibly have been so wrong? 
Well, let me tell you that no one in 
their right mind in the business com-munity ever believed that we would let the Ex-Im Bank charter expire, and so everybody assumed that we would do the right thing here—that the charter would go on and that this would hap-pen. Guess what happened. When we shut down the Ex-Im Bank and people weren’t able to approach the Ex-Im Bank to get credit guarantees to do the work of manufacturing and exporting, all of a sudden, those small business men and women and those employees of those institutions picked up their phones and started calling their Mem-bers of Congress. When they called their Members of Congress, that is when we saw action. That is when we saw things moving in a direction that actually supports American manufac-turing. 
This is an institution that has been 
reauthorized many times. This is an in-stitution that has been in existence for decades. It is an institution that is in 
competition with dozens—in fact, about 80 or 90 export credit agencies are run by other countries—of credit agencies every day. They are com-peting against those same agencies. 
What we have now is unilateral disar-
mament. Imagine this: American man-ufacturers—longstanding manufactur-ers—are actually considering moving their manufacturing facilities offshore so that they can compete for this ex-port business. We can’t wait another minute. We can’t wait another day. We can’t wait for another opportunity to present itself. We have to do this now. 
I understand and know that I am new 
to this institution. But most times when you have supermajorities in sup-port of something, it shouldn’t be that hard to get it done, and we know the President will sign it. 
I am always a little shocked when 
people say: Well, you know, we still can’t get that done because we need to find a vehicle. And I think: Well, what does that mean when you actually in-troduce a bill and the bill itself is sit-ting at the desk and there is an oppor-tunity not to try to attach something so that somebody can hide their vote or not to try to attach it to something because you might be able to leverage another idea on there but to actually move this bill forward? 
We don’t need to look for a vehicle. 
We don’t need to look for another op-portunity to advance the Ex-Im Bank. Guess what we need. We need to bring this bill to the floor right now. We need to ask our colleagues to engage in what we should be doing here, which is de-bate and legislation on the floor of the Senate. We need to resolve this issue and wrap it up. 
When we started this journey, we 
were told the Ex-Im Bank was in need of reform. In a very bipartisan way, my office sat down with Senator K
IRK’s of-
fice, joined by Senator B LUNT , Senator 
LINDSEY GRAHAM , Senator M ANCHIN , 
and Senator D ONNELLY and said: What 
do we need to do to make the Ex-Im Bank better? What do we need to do to make the Ex-Im Bank more accessible and more accountable? 
We negotiated something that is rare 
here, which is a bipartisan bill, the Kirk-Heitkamp Ex-Im Bank reauthor-ization bill. That bill has been the ve-hicle and the kind of blueprint for how we are going to move forward. In fact, when the House did their discharge pe-tition, they discharged the bill that is, in fact, the Kirk-Heitkamp bill. There 
is nothing in there where we have to balance this or somehow reconcile a House version and a Senate version. 
We can get this done today. We can 
move this forward. We can send the message to the rest of the world that the Ex-Im Bank and American manu-facturers are open for business. It makes absolutely no sense for us to wait any longer and in any way delay the movement of the Ex-Im Bank. 
I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7613 October 29, 2015 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
thank my colleague from North Da-kota for her continued leadership on this issue and for pointing out to our colleagues that we really could be just a short step away from reauthorizing a very important business tool for small businesses, manufacturers, and the ag-riculture industry by making sure that we reauthorize the Export-Import Bank. 
What my colleague is referring to is 
that it would take just a short agree-ment here this morning to go ahead and take the House-passed bill that, as she explained, was passed after col-leagues got a discharge petition, but it is the same as the language that we have had over here in the Senate. 
The process to move forward on this 
reauthorization would be very simple. I am sure Senator H
EITKAMP pointed out 
before I got to the floor that a fili-buster-proof majority of our colleagues approve of this legislation. I think 67 of our colleagues approve of this, and now we have this tremendous support—313 votes—from the House of Representa-tives. 
As Senator H
EITKAMP said, we are 
just a short step away. Why are we so emphatic about that? Why wait? When we look at what has just come out, the financial numbers show a 1.5 percent job growth. I think it is something like that. It shows very anemic numbers for our economy. 
I don’t know about anybody else, but 
since we are a very cyclical economy in the Northwest, or we have been for var-ious periods of time in our history, my constituents expect me to get up every day and fight for things that will im-prove the economic opportunity of America, and that is what we are doing here. 
When we look at 2014, it supported 
$27.4 billion in U.S. exports and 164,000 jobs. My colleagues know how much the economy outside of the United States is growing. So we want to sell them U.S.-made products. I think it is one of the biggest economic opportuni-ties in front of us. I believe in what we make. 
I complained because I think exotic 
financial instruments got us into trou-ble, and I want to be known for some-thing in the United States of America besides exotic financial instruments. I like that we make airplanes and auto-mobiles. 
The Senator from Michigan has 
joined us on the floor. I like that we make great agriculture products from North Dakota that are then exported around the globe. 
I visited Bob’s Red Mill in Oregon. 
That company makes a great variety of various grain products that are shipped all over the world. They use the Ex-port-Import Bank as a way to gain ac-cess because not every bank in Oregon is brave enough to take on a deal in Tanzania or some other country. Why? Because the banking doesn’t exist there. So the Oregon bank says: OK, I will bank you. I will get Bob’s Red Mill sold in all of those places, but I want 
some credit insurance. I want to be sure that you have an insurance pro-gram in case something goes wrong, and that is where the Export-Import Bank comes in. 
In 2014, we had $27.4 billion in U.S. 
exports and 164,000 jobs. 
Where have we been since 2008? It has 
helped us with 1.4 million jobs. Our economic information shows that we have had a somewhat anemic quarter in our country. I would say it is inter-esting that it did coincide with this issue of the Export-Import Bank, and this whole malaise here of not getting work done probably didn’t make any-body happy in business, and there is the fact that a lot of doubt and uncer-tainty plagued us. 
So if you want to help the economy, 
let’s just agree this morning that the Export-Import Bank is a great tool to help U.S. manufacturers grow their economic opportunities outside of the United States. Let’s just agree this morning and get this done, and we will be moving ahead on this important issue. 
Now, some people are saying: Let’s 
just wait. I am saying: What we are risking by waiting is more job loss, more small businesses at risk, and the U.S. economy at risk. There are more than $9 billion in pending Export-Im-port Bank deals on the table—$9 bil-lion. That can’t get done because the Bank doesn’t exist anymore. If you just think about that, those are U.S. com-panies that have economic activity to do around the globe to help us grow the U.S. economy at a time when we have been anemic. If no one objects to my motion, we would restart that engine today. 
Ms. STABENOW. Will the Senator 
from Washington yield for one quick question? 
Ms. CANTWELL. Yes. 
Ms. STABENOW. Was that $9 billion? Ms. CANTWELL. Yes. Ms. STABENOW. We have economic 
activity that is hanging in the balance, and because of this inactivity, we are losing $9 billion every single day? 
Ms. CANTWELL. Yes. Ms. STABENOW. That is billion with 
a ‘‘B’’? 
Ms. CANTWELL. Yes. That’s the dol-
lar value of deals for U.S. companies being held up that could be moved for-ward. 
Ms. STABENOW. Shocking. Ms. CANTWELL. So I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 282, H.R. 597, the Export-Import Bank Reform and Reauthorization Act, and that the bill be read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Republican leader. Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
would remind my colleagues that we voted on the reauthorization of the Ex-port-Import Bank already. There are 
numerous objections on this side of the aisle; therefore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
hope our colleagues realize that the economic activity we could be seeing today could help us in everything we are doing moving forward. 
While the Senate has passed the Ex-
port-Import Bank, it is part of a larger transportation package that this Sen-ator hopes will actually get done. But there are many people who don’t want to see the Export-Import Bank reau-thorized. In fact, some of our col-leagues suggested in the recent budget deal that they put a 1-year provision in for the Export-Import Bank. I don’t support a 1-year provision. We support a 5-year reauthorization, and we want to get to that now. We do not want to see more jobs shifted overseas as we continue to have this debate, because that is what is happening. We are giv-ing economic opportunity to other countries to take advantage of our businesses. 
I hope we will take this up and move 
it forward so that we can get economic opportunities back in front of the American people at a time when we most critically need to. 
I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Ms. HEITKAMP. Will my friend from 
Washington yield for a question? 
Ms. CANTWELL. Yes. Ms. HEITKAMP. We have now had 
this experience of 3
1⁄2months—really 4 
months because we are at the end of October—with no opportunity for a small business to actually look at how they could grow that small business. We know we have lost jobs all across America in States where they are eco-nomically challenged. Opportunities are there. We know that the large in-stitutions, the large manufacturers in our country, some of which are in Sen-ator C
ANTWELL ’s State, rely on this 
small business chain of businesses, and those are the businesses that have been hit the hardest. 
If we wait, again, for another promise 
that we are going to put it on another vehicle—how much more inactivity, how much more disruption to these small businesses can these small sup-ply chains have given their economics? Isn’t it true that a small business is much more challenged by a day’s delay in opening up the Ex-Im Bank than a large corporation? 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
thank the Senator from North Dakota for her question because she is right on the pinpoint of what this issue is about. It is really about small busi-nesses that don’t have huge capital re-serves to set aside money so that they can guarantee the sale of their product. 
As I said, there is $9 billion of pend-
ing issues before the Bank right now, and many of those are small busi-nesses. So those small businesses could

be opening up economic opportunity 
that might grow their revenue signifi-cantly and allow them to create more jobs. When we think about the motion I just made, if no one had objected, that $9 billion would have been free to go out into the economy, those deals would have gotten done, those small businesses would have been empowered, and we would be on our way to winning in what is an export economy. 
Why is it an export economy? Be-
cause the growing middle class around the globe is going to double in the next several years. Ninety-five percent of consumers live outside the United States of America. So we want to win economic opportunity, and we have to be able to sell outside the United States of America. It is hard because not every place in the United States of America is so developed that their banking system is there to do deals. 
This great company in my State, in 
Spokane, SCAFCO—two of my col-leagues here—the ranking member on the Agriculture Committee, from Michigan, and my colleague from North Dakota, Senator H
EITKAMP —are 
very active in agriculture issues and will get it. He is basically making and selling aluminum grain containers, silos, all over the world. That is his business. He has expanded it, built new buildings, and he has an incredible workforce. 
As the rest of the world—particularly 
in Africa and South America but even in Asia—starts to grow their agricul-tural economies, guess what they need. They need agriculture equipment. I am sure the Senator from Michigan under-stands that because she has some of those manufacturers. So those manu-facturers have a huge opportunity to sell U.S.-made agriculture equipment. 
I like to say: Guess what we are still 
No. 1 at in the United States of Amer-ica? Agriculture. We know how to do agriculture. Guess what the next big opportunity is around the globe? Feed-ing the growing middle class around the globe. It is one of the biggest eco-nomic opportunities. But we have to be able to sell them things. We have to be able to sell them Michigan-manufac-tured products. We have to be able to sell them agriculture products that my colleague from North Dakota makes. SCAFCO needs to be able to sell their grain silos, but they can’t because peo-ple want to hold up this process, all to put a trophy on someone’s desk saying they did the bidding of a very conserv-ative think tank that—the last I know, I don’t think they created any of these manufacturing jobs in America. 
I hope my colleagues will help us 
continue this debate because I know there are some who will say: Well, we passed this bill, and it is going to get done someday. Someday, really? Be-cause everybody said we will get it on the Transportation bill in April. OK. That didn’t happen. They did an exten-sion. It didn’t happen. We will get it on the Transportation bill in July. The Bank won’t expire. Guess what. It ex-pired. Now they are telling us to wait 
again, and we do not want to wait on creating more U.S. jobs. 
Several Senators addressed the

Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, if I 
might just wrap up one statement. I know my colleague from New Jersey is here. 
I want to thank my colleagues who 
are such great leaders on the Export- Import Bank, the Senator from Wash-ington State, Ms. C
ANTWELL , and Sen-
ator H EITKAMP from North Dakota. 
I just want to put on the record that 
100 businesses in Michigan alone were assisted in $1 billion in exports, which meant jobs in Michigan last year. We can’t wait. We need those jobs. Our businesses need the support. We need to get this done now.

Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask

SIONS , Senator D AINES be recognized. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF SUPERSTORM SANDY  
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
rise on the third anniversary of Superstorm Sandy to reflect on where we have been, how far we have come, and what is still left to accomplish, and to praise the people of New Jersey who have remained New Jersey proud and New Jersey strong during this long, 3-year recovery process. But, most importantly, it is to remind ev-eryone in this Chamber and all around the Nation that the job isn’t done yet. Many people believe that this is over and that everyone just moved on, but I know that for many Sandy victims, that is not the case. 
In these last few years, we have made 
a lot of progress. Billions of dollars of Federal funds have flowed to the State and were used to rebuild bridges, roads, boardwalks, help businesses reopen, and keep people working. Those fortu-nate enough to navigate the maze of Federal and State programs have re-built their homes stronger and more resilient than before. The Jersey Shore has enjoyed a resurgence in tourism which fueled the local and State econ-omy, creating jobs and supplementing the recovery. 
But while the beaches have been re-
plenished and the boardwalks have been rebuilt, 3 years later, for far too many working-class New Jerseyans, the recovery not only is incomplete, in some cases it has still barely begun. There are still parts of the State that remain neglected. There are still fami-lies who haven’t stepped foot in their homes for 3 years. They may not have a reality TV crew following them around, but they are the real New Jerseyans, the salt of the Earth, and the backbone of our great State. They are the unsung, hard-working New Jer-
sey families who suffered loss and pulled themselves back up and kept going, one foot in front of the other, every day, not only because they want-ed to but because they had no other choice. 
For these families, even after the 
storm passed, the clouds parted, and the Sun came out, a different kind of disaster—this time manmade—was looming on the horizon. They went from filling up sandbags to fend off the Atlantic Ocean to filling out endless forms to fend off insurance companies and government officials. They had en-dured the fight against Mother Nature but were simply no match against Uncle Sam. 
Doug Quinn, a constituent of mine 
who served as a marine—and once you are a marine, you are always a marine, so I won’t say former marine but who served as a marine—and who served his country with distinction, encapsulated this sentiment perfectly in a letter he wrote to me. In it he said: 
I was in my home the night the flood-
waters rushed in. I waded out through waist deep water at midnight to escape while elec-trical transformers exploded and houses burned down. That was the easy part. It’s the year-and-a-half since then that has been the tragedy. 
Let me repeat that. He says the flood 
was the easy part. This is a picture of him in that flood and the consequences to his home afterward. 
Doug had maximum coverage of 
$250,000 and received estimates of dam-ages in excess of that—$254,000—but he received only $90,000, just over a third of what he needed to rebuild. And Doug was not alone. 
Chuck Appleby is another one of the 
thousands of New Jerseyans who has had to engage in this fight for the past 3 years to just get what he deserves. Like many others, Chuck, who joined us recently, was lowballed by FEMA and his insurance company, which somehow claimed it wasn’t Sandy that severely cracked the foundation of his home. According to them, it was all a preexisting condition that just hap-pened to magically appear the day after Sandy hit. Imagine that. He played by the rules, he faithfully paid for flood insurance for 10, 20, or 30 years, never had a claim until Sandy, came only to find out it wasn’t enough. 
People assumed that since they have 
insurance, they would be made whole and that the resources necessary to re-build would be there. But after sur-viving the wind, the rain, and the storm surge, he woke up to another nightmare: A flood insurance claim process that threatened to take what the storm had not. 
As much as I wish it were an aberra-
tion, Chuck’s story is not unique. Thousands of New Jerseyans were lowballed by their insurance company, stunting the recovery and leaving fam-ilies out of their homes.

able to convince FEMA to allow all 
Sandy survivors to have their claims reviewed, which will result in tens of millions of dollars going to the recov-ery. Chuck is one of those people who opted into the process, and FEMA re-cently admitted its mistake and ac-knowledged he was shorted at least $50,000. 
Dawn and Sonny Markosky are an-
other example. They stood next to me in Belmar this week after having re-ceived a check for $56,000 from FEMA’s claims review money that they should have received the first time around. Sonny served our country as a retired Army reservist and a police chief. He is now only receiving the justice he de-served and the chance to rebuild. And even Dawn’s mom, who was lowballed $17,000 on her house, got an additional $17,000 from the claims review—money she had been owed all along. And it goes on and on. 
It shouldn’t have taken this long, nor 
should the path have been this winding and difficult, but these successes illus-trate the incredible resiliency of all the Sandy survivors who wouldn’t give up no matter how dark things appeared on the morning of October 30, 2012, and throughout the 3 years that followed. 
I will continue to fight to help every-
one recover. I will continue to be a voice for everyone in the Sandy com-munity as we seek to repair what hap-pened and make our communities more resilient in the future and more capa-ble of dealing with storms like Sandy, which left incredible devastation in its wake. 
As we take a moment to think back 
on that day 3 years ago today, when the clouds finally parted and the omi-nous seas receded, the destruction Sandy left is almost unimaginable. We remember images like these of Seaside Heights. In fact, I actually took this photo while touring the damage with Vice President B
IDEN. 
This is a photo of Hoboken, in north-
ern New Jersey, where street after street looked like a series of canals. Thousands of families lost everything and suddenly found themselves home-less. Billions upon billions of dollars’ worth of property, roads, bridges, trains, schools, fire stations, and hos-pitals were in ruins. Most tragically of all, dozens of people lost their lives. It was a dark time for our entire State, no doubt about it, but, as the proverb goes, the darkest hour is just before the dawn. 
Today, as we remember that dark 
hour, we commit ourselves to com-pleting the job and entering the dawn of a new era in the long journey to re-build and recover not just to where we were before the storm but to a place where we are stronger, more resilient, and more prepared. I have no doubt we will get there together, not just through our efforts here in Washington but because of the indefatigable, dog-ged character of the people of New Jer-sey. We showed that character in the immediate aftermath when, despite the level of devastation, New Jerseyans 
were true to their reputation of being New Jersey strong. Communities united, families took in neighbors who lost their homes, and we all came to-gether and worked together. It was a testament to the fundamental nature of community action, community in-volvement, and to what real commu-nity service is all about. 
After seeing the impact of the dam-
age that day, I came back to Wash-
ington with a heavy heart but a deter-mined mind, solely focused on rep-resenting the countless victims of our State who had their lives turned upside down. They didn’t ask for handouts; they asked for help and kept moving forward. 
I remember working closely with my 
late colleague and dear friend Senator Frank Lautenberg, and we made it our No. 1 priority to bring every available resource back to the victims of our State. I continued to work with Sen-ator B
OOKER , who jumped head first 
into the fight from the moment he en-tered the Senate to do the same. And to be clear, we had to fight from the very beginning. We had to fight a tea party-inspired opposition that was blocking the relief we so desperately needed. We had Senators and Congress-men who said no to disaster victims in New Jersey with one side of their mouths, while asking for Federal funds when a disaster struck their State on the other side. Ultimately, we over-came the calloused and ideological at-tacks and secured more than $50 billion for the entire region. These Federal funds have been absolutely critical to our recovery, but mistakes by govern-ment agencies at the Federal and State level hindered our progress. 
On this third anniversary of Sandy, I 
don’t come to the floor to point fingers at FEMA or the State or to play a blame game. This is not about politics or scapegoating; it is about continuing to do all we can to deliver for the peo-ple in every disaster who still need help, and that requires cooperation and teamwork from all levels of govern-ment. 
One example of bipartisanship was 
our effort to stop the draconian flood insurance rate increases that Sandy survivors were facing after the storm. These families were being confronted with skyrocketing premiums which threatened to take what the storm had not. In response, I led a broad, bipar-tisan coalition from all parts of the country and passed legislation to stop these egregious hikes and restore fair-ness in the flood insurance program. 
A recovery requires more efforts like 
this. It requires the State to be trans-parent and open to correcting any inef-ficiency that causes delays and for every Federal Government agency to step up, step in, and make corrections when needed. It requires strong over-sight and technical assistance from Federal agencies, such as Housing and Urban Development. 
As we have seen in the past, this co-
operation can result in significant im-provement. For example, when I dis-
covered that homeowners were being needlessly delayed from rebuilding be-cause the State chose to conduct his-torical and environmental reviews at the end of the application process— therefore, further delay—I worked with then-Secretary Donovan to clarify to the State that they could conduct these reviews at the front end of the application process, allowing victims to begin rebuilding sooner without jeopardizing their funding. This was a perfect example of eliminating unnec-essary obstacles and inefficiencies, and I was proud to be in charge. 
We always need to find more opportu-
nities like this. We need HUD to con-tinue to work with the States to dis-cover these inefficiencies and to get people fully restored. It is our responsi-bility to make the system and the process work for them. 
When I look at two of these fami-
lies—a marine serving with distinction for his country and a former Army re-servist and police chief—their country didn’t ultimately respond to them the way it should have. It made life more difficult when, in fact, it should have been the other way around. 
We cannot allow partisan and geo-
graphical politics into our Nation’s dis-aster response priorities. There is a reason we call our Nation the United States of America. I have cast my vote time and time again for flooding in Mississippi, wildfires out West, Hurri-cane Katrina—the list goes on and on— because I believe in this we are one. No matter where a disaster occurs, no matter if it is across the street or 
across the country, we come together as a nation ready to go. 
With that, Mr. President, I look for-
ward to our continuing effort to get ev-eryone in New Jersey back in their homes.

REMEMBERING CHARLES ‘‘CHARLIE ’’ DECRANE  
Mr. DAINES. Today I rise to honor 
Montana World War II veteran Charlie DeCrane, a member of the Crow Tribe, who passed away earlier this week in Billings, MT. 
Charlie was an incredible person. He 
was hard-working and dedicated to serving his country as well as his tribe. He was a quiet and gentle spirit, and that was apparent to anyone who came into contact with him. Charlie was a man of principle and honor. 
I had the privilege of spending time 
with Charlie in Washington, DC, when

he accompanied me as my one special 
guest to the State of the Union Ad-dress. I was able to witness firsthand truly what an amazing man he was. Our walk from my office to the House Chamber is one I will never forget. To personally know a man who fought so courageously in World War II was a great honor. Many freedoms we have today stem from the sacrifices made by Charlie and men and women like him. His accomplishments in life will con-tinue to live on. 
It is my hope that through Charlie’s 
life we will remember how important our veterans are and how much respect and care they deserve. 
His passing is one that will affect 
many, and not just his close family and friends. Cindy and I will be keeping Charlie’s family and the entire Crow community in our thoughts and pray-ers in this most difficult time. 
I thank my colleague from Alabama 
for allowing me to speak. 
I yield back to Senator S
ESSIONS . 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the 
budget passage that will soon be before us essentially does a number of things. One of the more basic is that it spends a lot more money than the current law allows, and it is done in a way that the new Speaker of the House said ‘‘stinks’’ a day or so ago. 
Once again a massive deal is crafted 
behind closed doors and is being rushed through Congress under the threat of panic. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 serves as a reminder that the most important and controversial legisla-tion is still being drafted in secret with little or no input from the Members of this Chamber. We have been cut out of the process. No amendments will be al-lowed to this massive package, and the cloture vote will be filed immediately after the bill is placed on the floor in order to force a vote, limiting the de-bate to the shortest possible time under the rules of the Senate. Those who question, object, and want more time, are accused of wanting to shut down the government and disrupt the machinery of the government. They say that President Obama will accuse us of shutting down the government. They say that we should cower under our debt at this great charge he might make against us. As if insisting that we have a right to read and study a bill of this magnitude is out of order. 
It should not be run through the Con-
gress in the shortest possible time. They can bluster and they can huff and puff, but I say the arguments that I am going to make in opposition to this deal are bricks of truth, and this house will not fall down. They will not be able to sustain a charge that somehow we have bad motives by objecting to what is set about here. 
At its core, this deal with President 
Obama provides what the President has demanded throughout. 
First, it lifts the Federal spending 
caps for 2 years, including a $40 billion increase in spending on the Federal bu-
reaucracy. 
A ‘‘yes’’ vote affirms that this spend-
ing level—the new high spending level—is correct and that we need to spend this much money. 
Second, it erases the current debt 
limit we have that stops spending or borrowing money above a certain amount. It erases that debt limit until March of 2017, allowing for approxi-mately $1.5 trillion more to be added to our debt of $18.4 trillion, and it could be more than that. 
The text states that at that date the 
debt ceiling shall be raised to whatever level of public debt is at that time. Un-like in the past, when we had a debt ceiling, it was a dollar amount, and we would raise it and approve a certain dollar amount. Suspending this limit is a very unwise process. It was done last time and should not be done in the fu-ture—raise it to a date in the future and indicate, in effect, that as much debt as Congress or the President wants to add in that time is approved. We don’t even know the amount. This is a covert and clever way of raising the debt ceiling without having to en-gage in a real discussion of Washing-ton’s runaway spending problem. It en-sures that no further serious conversa-tion about our debt course or any cor-responding action to alter it will take place. 
The debt ceiling has always been a 
pivotal point. It is the classic case of the parents calling the young man home from college. He has overrun his credit card, and they have a little pray-er meeting about this spending and de-mand certain reforms in the young man’s spending habits if he wants to continue to have a credit card. 
Congress has the debt ceiling power 
to call in the President and say: We are on an unsustainable debt course. We need to have reform. 
That was done in 2011, and that is 
why we have these numbers in place today that contain spending but are being violated by this act. 
Finally, the deal submits the unac-
ceptable precedent that every dollar of increased defense spending should be met with a dollar of increased non-defense spending. How silly is this? What possible logical argument can you make for this? This is upside down. 
If an emergency requires more de-
fense spending—as I think it does—we could dispute the amount, but we have had the Russians in Crimea since 2011, Russians in Syria, refugees by the mil-lions in the Middle East, ISIS threat-ening the very government of Iraq, Af-ghanistan is still a problem, Yemen, Libya, and so forth. All of these have happened in some part due to the in-consistent, incoherent policies of this President. It has happened. We have a lot of problems out there. We need some more money for defense. 
Common sense says we should seek 
to identify reductions and not demand spending hikes because we have to spend more money on defense. I think this is a deeply troubling problem that 
we have. 
Raising these budget caps, as we go 
forward now, removes the moral au-thority of Senators who vote yes and 
approve this process and reduces our ability to talk with integrity to our friends and voters back home to whom we promised reform and more prin-cipled spending decisions in Wash-ington. 
How can we with a straight face say 
this is a good policy? If we approve these higher spending levels, those who vote for it are prohibited in many ways from objecting to the levels in the fu-ture. If they find some waste and cut it, it does not mean we will reduce spending. Instead, the Congress, lack-ing the moral authority to decrease spending below these levels, will spend that money up to the higher levels in the future. It is a big decision and I think it is wrong. 
Furthermore, I would note, as a 
member of the Armed Service Com-mittee, my concern about defense, but the defense account takes a larger per-centage of the budget than does the nondefense account for discretionary spending. By increasing defense and nondefense by the same amount, the nondefense category actually receives a larger percentage of the increase, all to pay for more bureaucracy, employ-ees, and government in Washington. 
So let’s be clear. The spending caps 
in law today were placed in as a part of the 2011 Budget Control Act agreement which lifted the debt ceiling by $2.1 trillion. We objected. Congress objected to raising the debt ceiling without re-form. Senator M
CCONNELL stood firm, 
and the Budget Control Act of 2011 is the reform that came. Then we raised the debt ceiling. We approved a raising of the debt limit on the credit card only after we got a containment of the growth in spending. So supporters are calling this bill sequester relief as if that is OK, but sequester and the Budg-et Control Act were just simply limits on spending. That is what they were. 
The fact is, we have never followed 
the sequester. In 2013 the Congress passed the Ryan-Murray budget deal. That deal raised the discretionary spending $64 billion over 2 years. Now that deal has ended, and instead of re-turning to regular order and agreed- upon limits, the President wants us to yet again break the Budget Control Act and raise spending an extra $80 bil-lion over the next 2 years. 
This deal will obliterate future 
spending restraint, it does do so, de-stroying our credibility to achieve meaningful spending reform. The Budg-et Control Act represented a bipartisan commitment to cap spending, limiting it at a fixed amount. It is a good, re-sponsible policy. In fact, I thought it did not limit the spending enough. It was passed by a Republican House, a Democratic Senate, and signed into law by President Obama. He agreed to these limits. 
This deal shatters that commitment 
by spending $80 billion more than we

promised over the next 2 years. It is 
problematic because it is filled with gimmicks. They contend, not cor-rectly, that all of this new spending is offset by new revenues or cuts in spending somewhere else. However, I would suggest and would show here that is not accurate. These are a lot of gimmicks we have here. 
Secondly, if we have wasteful spend-
ing, and some of this is wasteful spend-ing, it needs to be eliminated. But the spending cuts ought to be used to re-duce the deficit, which was over $400 billion last year, will be $400 billion next year, and will double in the next 10 years according to the Congressional Budget Office. We need to be using this wasteful spending—these low-hanging- fruit problems—to reduce government expenditures and reduce our deficits, not using that opportunity to reduce deficits to instead spend more money somewhere else. 
So they offset. It appears the deal is 
built on the same principles as the deal in 2013. It exchanges instant increases in Federal spending for distant prom-ised savings in the future, as much as 20 years, or two decades down the road, many of which are unlikely to occur. It funds increased spending through in-creased revenues, violating a core budget principle by extracting ever-more money from Americans to expand an already-too-large Federal bureauc-racy. 
We need to be reducing the bureauc-
racy, not adding to it. 
The deal trades ending spending lim-
its for the promise of new spending limits 10 years from now. We just agreed to limits in 2011. They promised that we are going to have new spending limits in the future. My time in the Senate says promises about the future seldom come to pass in this body. 
We need to fight tenaciously to hold 
the spending limits that are in law today and not exchange those limits for a promised limit in the future. This is how a country goes broke. We are heading to financial catastrophe on the path we are going. 
The deal also uses a common gim-
mick where alleged savings in an enti-tlement program—a trust fund—are used to boost unrelated spending in the general discretionary budget. This is a bigger issue than most of our col-leagues understand. Any savings found in the entitlement programs faced with insolvency must be used to shore up those programs, those trust funds, not for spending somewhere else. Yet this deal claims illusory savings from dis-ability insurance, part of Social Secu-rity. That is the disability trust fund. There are two trust funds of Social Se-curity, disability and a retirement fund. Every American pays into both from their paycheck. So 2.2 percent of your paycheck goes to fund the dis-ability fund, the rest of it funds your Social Security, and then there is addi-tional money that comes out of your paycheck to fund the Medicare trust fund. So this deal claims illusory savings 
from the disability insurance and in-creased pension insurance fees in order to boost bureaucratic budgets. Perhaps even worse, the deal attempts to stave off the shortfall in the fraud-ridden So-cial Security Disability Insurance Pro-gram that has a host of problems. We all know and have known for years it is 
coming into default by the end of 2016. How does it get around the default in the disability program? It raids the So-cial Security retirement fund to pay for the deficient, ineffective, badly managed disability fund. 
It weakens Social Security. We need 
to be looking at ways to strengthen So-cial Security, not raid it and weaken it. Some $150 billion in funds will be si-phoned off from Americans’ payroll re-tirement contributions and taken out of the Social Security fund and trans-ferred to the disability program—four- tenths of a percent each year of the in-come of an American. 
This will weaken the Social Security 
trust fund by $150 billion while politi-cians all over America continue to promise that what they are doing is acting to strengthen the Social Secu-rity trust fund. We have seen the dis-ability trust fund heading for disaster for several years now. Now, ‘‘60 Min-utes’’ and program after program have shown abuse, fraud, and total mis-management in Social Security Dis-ability. It has not been reformed. It needs fundamental reform. They made a few changes in the program that I am sure are worthwhile, but none that come close to putting the disability fund on a long-term sound basis. It is basically a gimmick to get past the im-pending insolvency crisis, to kick it down the road, and then create some money to justify the new spending above the spending limits imposed by the Budget Control Act. 
People want to end wasteful Wash-
ington spending. The people want that. Lifting the budget caps and raising the debt ceiling through 2017 only ensures that our ineffective bureaucracy con-tinues its wasteful ways, while momen-tum in Washington for deficit reduc-tion stalls out. That is what is hap-pening. We are losing momentum. Sev-eral years ago we were in serious dis-cussions about the dangers we faced fi-nancially. That conversation has been eroded. It eliminates a powerful oppor-tunity, the debt ceiling, to advance the case for fiscal discipline. 
What about Social Security? The 
deal uses the same fraudulent account-ing methods our Democratic colleagues used to pass ObamaCare on a straight party-line vote. We just received a let-ter from the Social Security Actuary, Mr. Goss, who stated that the ‘‘enact-ment of these provisions [in this pro-posed legislation] is projected to re-duce the long-range 75-year OASDI [the combined Social Security trust funds] actuarial deficit by 0.04 percent of tax-able payroll,’’ which is a lot. However, the savings going in are being counted as both, creating money that can be spent to increase new spending, and 
also creating money that can be spent to shore up the retirement insurance program. This is an important concept, colleagues. The funds are used to pay for more government spending outside the retirement and disability funds. 
Even worse than the promise of sav-
ing Social Security, which has been overstated as major entitlement re-form, the savings are being counted as money that can be spent on the discre-tionary account. It basically provides cover to extend the debt of the United States. 
This is the very same tool the Demo-
crats used to pass the ObamaCare bill, amazingly, and to produce a phony score so the President could say that every penny of it is paid for—saying it would not increase the deficit. Our col-leagues used the same tactic in this deal by counting the funds they cut from your retirement account as being able to fund new discretionary spend-ing. 
During the Obamacare debate, the 
Democrats reduced payments to hos-pitals and doctors and others, but Medicare is a trust fund. They claimed some $500 billion would be used both to extend the life of Medicare and to pay for the new ObamaCare spending. They openly and directly claimed that these savings could be used for two different things—$500 billion. It was one of the largest, I contend, misrepresentations of finances—fraudulent activities—in the history of the world. 
You cannot have money that is used 
for two different purposes. Mr. Elmen-dorf, the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, has said: You cannot spend the same dollar twice, even though the conventions of accounting might suggest otherwise. So they used an accounting gimmick to make it ap-pear that this money was available to strengthen Medicare and fund ObamaCare. It is the same money. 
We accepted that kind of improper fi-
nancial analysis. The bill was passed on the promise it would not add to the debt. It certainly did. The same ac-counting gimmick lies at the heart of the proposed legislation to waive Fed-eral spending caps and to raise the debt limit by at least $1.5 trillion. 
Promoters of the Bipartisan Budget 
Act of 2015 boast of long-term future savings to Social Security disability, but those savings need to extend the life of the disability program, which is nearing insolvency. Instead, they are spent on new discretionary spending, basically adding to the debt. This is not entitlement reform, this is an ac-counting gimmick. Any savings to be captured in the future from disability insurance cannot be spent today on bu-reaucratic budgets for Federal depart-ments such as the EPA, the Depart-ment of Labor, or the Department of Health and Human Services. 
A second and no less egregious ac-
counting trick siphons off as much as $150 billion from the Social Security trust fund for retirees and transfers

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7618 October 29, 2015 
that money to the fraud-ridden dis-
ability program. But there is no sur-plus in the retirement trust fund. We know the Social Security retirement trust fund is heading toward insol-vency. Taking this money out and moving it to the disability program shortens the lifespan, the solvency of the retirement program. All this re-form accomplishes is advancing the in-solvency date of the retirement fund, while bailing out the mismanaged dis-ability fund by taking working Ameri-cans’ pension contributions and reallo-cating them to the disability fund. Again, the authors of the bill double count the savings as both increasing the sustainability of Social Security disability and paying for the new spending. 
So instead of implementing much 
needed reforms to fix the disability program, which is projected to go broke next year, this deal robs $150 bil-lion from the Social Security trust fund and uses it to pay disability checks through 2022. The Social Secu-rity trust fund is never reimbursed. They reduce the amount of dedicated money going to the Social Security re-tirement fund on everybody’s paycheck and redirect it for 3 years to the dis-ability fund, and the Social Security retirement fund is never reimbursed for the money they lost. So Social Secu-rity is left in a worse financial situa-tion than it is currently. It is also a violation of the budget law to do that; I am confident. 
Furthermore, this bailout lasts only 
6 years. In 2022, the disability fund runs out of money again, and Congress will have to bail it out once again. This bill removes the incentive to provide seri-ous reform to fix that broken program and put it on a sound basis. It kicks the can down the road once again. 
In conclusion, I would say to my col-
leagues that we don’t have to pass this bill today. There is no crisis that re-quires us to pass it today. There are a number of interim steps we could take to allow this bill to be out there for the Members who actually study it, to offer amendments on it, and maybe im-prove it for the American people to un-derstand just what it is the Members of Congress are doing to their Social Se-curity and to the fiscal debt of Amer-ica. 
As I have mentioned, the Budget 
Control Act of 2011 increased the amount that we can borrow in ex-change for $2.1 trillion in spending cuts that we were able to win in 2011. What we did when we faced the debt ceiling issue was that we were able to enforce our new spending law, which limited the growth of spending in the future, saving $2.1 trillion over that period of time. We are still in that time period, and we are ceasing to save money be-cause we are violating the law. 
We were able to win a concession 
from the President. We didn’t cower under our tables. We didn’t retreat from the huffing and puffing of the President on this issue. We stood up as Members of Congress, committed to 
fiscal integrity in America, and we told the President: You are not going to get an increase in the debt ceiling unless you agree to some spending reforms. That is what happened. We did that when there were only 45 Republicans in the Chamber. Now there are 54 Repub-licans in the Chamber, and the House has a huge majority. 
I think we can do better. I don’t 
think this should be rushed through the Congress, and I object to its pas-sage. 
I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. 
S
ASSE). The Senator from Indiana. 
Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be recog-nized for up to 20 minutes and that Senator S
ANDERS be recognized imme-
diately following my remarks for up to 15 minutes. 
Mr. SANDERS. I thank the Senator. 
If you could extend that up to 20 min-utes, that would be great. 
Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I amend 
that to 20 minutes for Senator S
AND-
ERS, if there is no objection. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. COATS. Mr. President, having 
previously served in the Senate, I came to the floor once again for the second time as a freshman Senator, in the early months of 2011, full of optimism and a sense of purpose. 
Back for a second time as a newly 
elected freshman, I delivered my inau-gural speech, which included the fol-lowing thoughts: 
For each of us serving today, I believe it is 
our duty to rise to the immediate challenge and resolve the problems which now confront us. It will take all of us, united behind a common purpose—that above all else we must first restore and strengthen our fiscal security. We must articulate a clear vision, set specific goals and make the tough deci-sions needed to bring our nation out of debt and preserve prosperity and opportunity for future generations. 
Those remarks outline a major part 
of my vision for what I hope to achieve in my term as a Senator. It is now 5 years later. What I came back to try to accomplish hasn’t been accomplished. 
At the time, I saw—and it was the 
reason why I answered the call to come back—that our fiscal health was erod-ing right before our very eyes. I didn’t want to be a part of the first genera-tion of Americans to leave our children and the country worse off than the one we inherited. 
Anyone who reads through our his-
tory knows the sacrifices that have been made by generation after genera-tion after generation so that their chil-dren and their grandchildren and their country could be in a better position so that they wouldn’t be saddled with the burdens that might not allow them to live the American dream. 
I asked Hoosiers to send me back to 
Washington to focus on taking on these essential issues. It was the first thing in my very first debate, where I put it on the table and said: Unless we go back and address our runaway manda-
tory spending and entitlement pro-grams, it is not worth going back, and I will not ask you to send me back there unless you give me the mandate that this is a task that has to be under-taken. 
It was called political suicide at the 
time: Oh, you can’t bring that up. I mean those who are on Medicare or Medicaid or Social Security will make sure that you will never be sent back to the Senate if that is what your goal is. 
I said: I just want every Hoosier to 
know, when you walk in that voting booth, what you are voting for and what you are not voting for. 
And I received the mandate to come 
back to address that because people in my generation understood that as to the privileges they had received and the opportunities they had received throughout their lives, they wanted to pass them and that same opportunity on to their children and their grand-children. They wanted us to come back and make difficult decisions so that would happen. 
It is not that this issue wasn’t 
worked on. Whether it was to fix the debt or the Business Roundtable, Domenici-Rivlin, Simpson-Bowles, the Gang of 6, the super committee result-ing from the Budget Control Act, and the dinner club of Senators—all of these efforts over the early years I threw myself into and in support of. And many of us—even on a bipartisan basis—were working together to try to address this gorilla in the room, the runaway mandatory spending. It is now eating up over 70 percent of our total budget and ever-decreasing discre-tionary spending. 
The President, unfortunately, walked 
away from every effort that was made. The efforts were divided, and nearly 40 of us—20 Democrats and 20 Repub-licans—sent the President a letter stat-ing: We need to address that, and we are willing to step up and address this if you will join us in this process. 
I was very much a part of the final 
effort with the President—the so-called dinner club—at the President’s initia-tive. We were working with the Presi-dent himself, his Chief of Staff, his top Director of OMB—now Secretary Burwell at HHS—and his political di-rector. Over the months, eight of us met privately—there was no press, no staff—working to see, as principals, if we could come up with something. In the end, it fell apart. It fell apart be-cause the President, in the end, wouldn’t even accept his own previous proposals—his own White House pro-posals to address this problem. 
Here we are 5 years later. Currently, 
what we have gone from, under this ad-ministration, is a $10.6 trillion debt at the beginning of this Presidency to now 18-plus, or almost $18.2 trillion. 
There was almost a doubling in just two terms of one President, almost a doubling of our debt. 
And here we stand with injunctions 
from the Congressional Budget Office

saying that we are headed toward a cri-
sis and it is holding down our economy. We are not growing as we should and putting people back to work as we should because this is a drag on us. It is an anchor holding us down. 
Every Member of this Senate under-
stands that the issue here is not this particular program or that particular program. The issue is runaway manda-tory entitlements that are eating up everything—virtually three-quarters of everything they spend money on. 
There are essential functions of the 
Federal Government that have to be addressed: the National Institutes of Health and, obviously, our defense and national security. There is the CDC, which deals with communicable dis-eases, education funding, veterans pro-grams, law enforcement, border secu-rity, and food safety, just to name a few. Those are essential functions. But the money available to do what govern-ment needs to do is ever shrinking in terms of our ability to allocate it for that to be done, and the mandatory spending is just simply running out of control. 
Is anyone in this Senate or in this 
Congress saying we should end Social Security, end Medicare, and end Med-icaid? Everyone here is saying no. Ev-eryone has to understand, however, that to preserve those programs we have to bring on sensible reforms, and that has been the challenge. 
CBO said earlier this year: ‘‘Large 
and growing federal debt would have serious negative consequences, includ-ing increasing federal spending for in-terest payments; restraining economic growth in the long term; giving policy-makers less flexibility to respond to unexpected challenges; and eventually heightening the risk of a fiscal crisis. 
The evidence that we read and talk 
about in the Senate every day comes to the same conclusion. Congress too often has governed to avoid a crisis and failed to make the tough but necessary choices. 
Now here we are in another crisis 
looming, another leverage for us to try to achieve some sensible forward move-ment in terms of dealing with this run-away mandatory spending, and this is the raising of the debt limit. Given all the failure of previous efforts, the ex-haustion of the private sector and con-gressional efforts, we are left with very few options to address our fiscal prob-lems. Now we have a debt limit that is hitting us just days from now, Novem-ber 3, and we won’t be able to pay our bills unless we raise that debt limit. 
So what have we done, using this po-
tential leverage, to try to achieve something of significance? We end up basically waving the white flag and saying: There is really nothing more we can do. We just have to simply raise this. We have to live with it. We have to continue spending more. Oh, and by 
the way, those caps that we put in terms of discretionary spending, we have to break those also. 
There is a legitimate argument for 
the need to provide additional funding for our Department of Defense and our 
national security. All you have to do is turn on the television and watch what is happening around the world to un-derstand that America is in a weak-ened position and that national strength and defense strength are im-portant for the future of our country. 
So I do think that was a legitimate issue to try to deal with. But to break the caps on an equal basis for more government spending on the discre-tionary side simply is something we shouldn’t have to do. 
These so-called pay-fors that were 
put out there are the same old, same old. It is spend now and maybe we will adjust the program later and that will help cover the cost now. That hasn’t worked before, and it won’t work now. It is a gimmick, in most instances. It is something to sell the program, but it doesn’t begin to address the problem of out-of-control debt. 
Along with that, Social Security dis-
ability, the trustees have said, is going to go broke in just a few months, and the benefits are going to have to be dramatically cut unless it is fixed. So do we come in with a real fix for the real future of the Social Security-re-lated programs? No, we transfer money 
from the old age fund—actually, there is no money in that fund, we simply al-locate the money that is owed to that fund to pay for solvency for the dis-ability part of that fund. 
First of all, the thing we need to do 
is to be honest with the American peo-ple is to rename the Social Security trust fund to something else because the trust tells us there is money there to pay these benefits when there isn’t. There are IOUs there, locked in a box or a safe somewhere. There are simply piled up pieces of paper saying: We have to pay you back at some point. Without addressing this—and we saw this last evening in the debate, those of us who watched. I was going back and forth, to be truthful, between the World Series and the debate, trying to catch both of those. But we saw a few Members stand up and tell the truth— tell the American people exactly what the situation is and why we need to do what we need to do. I commend those few who had the courage to go forward and tell the American people straight up that this is the problem and it must be solved. 
Anyway, speaking of this vote that is 
coming up—the vote that will allow more spending for Federal programs, many of which are not priority pro-grams—the arrangement will simply allow us to take a pass on raising the debt limit. We are not going to use it as leverage to try and achieve anything meaningful in terms of entitlement— frankly, offsets that we have used be-fore and we use over and over again. It is the same old shuffle game where we move pieces around, but it doesn’t ac-complish the purpose. All of that leads me to the conclusion that I cannot sup-port this particular arrangement. 
There are reforms that must be put 
in place. We have to get to the point where we stop talking about these re-
forms and put them in place, where we make the political decisions that I be-lieve will be supported back home. But even if they aren’t supported by every-one back home, even if they are dis-torted by organizations that are funded by trying to scare seniors into believ-ing Congress or the government is tak-ing away their benefits—which is not the case; we are trying to save those benefits and we are trying to put our future generations, our children and grandchildren, in a better position so they won’t be so saddled with that debt—there are many ways we can go forward. 
We have talked about balancing our 
budget. What entity in the world doesn’t have to balance a budget at some point? What entity can keep bor-rowing money, saying on a piece of paper they will pay it later—that they are going to spend it now and pay it later? What businessman or woman, what small, medium-sized, or large business, what family, what organiza-tion continues to deal with their fiscal issues the way the Federal Government deals with its fiscal issues and sur-vives? We are careening toward a cri-sis. There are solutions for this, but it takes political will, and we have seen far too little of that political will. 
More importantly, it takes support 
from both branches of government, both the legislative and the executive, if we are going to accomplish this. Un-fortunately, it appears now we are going to have to wait for yet another Presidency, yet another Congress, be-cause we are kicking the can down the road. We are dumping this problem on the next group coming in. Boy, I feel for whoever winds up with the Presi-dency, whether it is Democrat or Re-publican, because of what they will in-herit, given the damage that has been done over the past several years. 
Clearly, we need to address the go-
rilla in the room. Clearly, we need to stand up and be truthful with the American people, as some of our can-didates were last evening. We must tell them exactly where we are, what we need to do, and then put the long-term reforms in place that will save these programs and put America in a solid fiscal situation. 
Getting a balanced budget amend-
ment in place is something we have talked about. We have made an effort, and we need to continue that. Without the discipline of putting your hand on the Bible with your right hand up and swearing you will uphold the Constitu-tion of the United States, which in-cludes balancing our budget and not spending more than we take in, we will never get there. You have to put people under oath in order to achieve that. We have come close on a couple of occa-sions but, unfortunately, not close enough. 
Therefore, I am resorting to a pro-
gram that has worked in the past re-garding our national defense and our military and proposing that what we

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7620 October 29, 2015 
do is create another BRAC. BRAC was 
the Base Realignment Commission—a process we finally agreed to because there was no way we could touch or close anything, and we were just over-run with excess spending and excess bases in the United States. And that worked. It worked very well. All of us here know exactly or very closely what the parameters of that were. 
In this case, if we cannot summon 
the courage and the will to stand up 
and do this, as we are required to do under the oath of office we take, but which we avoid doing, we should turn to a commission that would provide a solution. It would be a budget reduc-tion accountability commission. We can use the same BRAC title on the thing. Let’s call it the budget reduc-tion accountability commission, which would bring forward a plan to achieve the goal of bringing us back to fiscal health. We would put it before this Congress, both the Senate and the House, with a straight up-or-down ma-jority vote—yea or nay. 
Here is the plan. You haven’t been 
able to do it yourself, you have tried it, we appreciate your trying it, but it has come up short, whether it is the execu-tive branch or the legislative branch. So the outside commission presents the path forward, and we say yes or no. Then the people back home all know exactly where we stand in terms of the future fiscal health of this country. They will know exactly where we stand in terms of how we want to leave our legacy to the next generation and fu-ture generations, how we want to treat our children and our grandchildren. 
Each Member will have to go home 
and not talk about procedures and not talk about bumping up to the crisis level of spending and how we have to do something to avoid a government shutdown or avoid chaos or avoid eco-nomic collapse. Every Member will go home and say they were presented with a plan to get us there, and they were either for it or against it. Nobody could say: Well, we had to do this, we had to do that, it was late, we bumped up against the ceiling, it was running out, and so forth. I am tired of hearing all of that. 
Mr. President, clearly solutions exist 
to deal with this problem. Clearly, we must summon the courage to set aside politics and do what we all know we need to do and suffer the consequences. I think the consequences will be ap-plause and support because finally someone is standing up and saying we are going to fix this problem for the fu-ture of America and the future of our children and grandchildren; we are going to take that risk. If the groups outside are going to rally against this kind of thing and try to take us down, fine; we will go down doing the right thing. But I think we will be rewarded for doing so. 
I want to close this today with the 
same words I used to conclude my in-augural speech in 2011, where I said: 
I am standing here today to find solu-
tions—to make the hard decisions—and to leave behind a country that is stronger and 
more fiscally secure for future generations. This crisis is not insurmountable. We can overcome it by doing what great generations before us have done—mustering our will to do what is right. If we do, I know America’s greatest days are not behind us, but still lie ahead of us. 
Mr. President, with that, I yield the 
floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
MARIJUANA LEGALIZATION  
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I want 
to spend a few minutes discussing a major crisis in this country that must be addressed. Tragically, in the United States of America we now have 2.2 mil-lion people in jail. We have more peo-ple incarcerated than any other coun-try on Earth, including China, which is a Communist authoritarian country four times our size. We have more peo-ple in jail than does China. 
Further, at a time of large deficits 
and a very large national debt, we are spending about $80 billion a year in Federal, State, and local taxpayer money to lock up people—$80 billion a year to incarcerate people. 
Our criminal justice system is bro-
ken, and we need major reforms in that system. I think there is no debate in this country that violent and dan-gerous people must be locked up and they must be kept in jail and away from society. I think nobody argues that. On the other hand, I hope there is also no debate that nonviolent people— people who have been convicted of rel-atively minor crimes—should not have their lives destroyed while they do time in prison and create an arrest record which will stay with them for their entire lives. The important point is, it is not just the year or 2 years somebody is in prison; this record will stay with them for their entire lives and do enormous damage to their lives. 
In 2014 there were 620,000 marijuana 
possession arrests. That is one arrest every minute. According to a report by the ACLU, there were more than 8 mil-lion marijuana arrests in the United States from 2001 to 2010—8 million marijuana arrests—and almost 9 in 10 were for possession. Arrests for mari-juana possession rose last year nation-wide even as Colorado, Washington, Or-egon, Alaska, and the District of Co-lumbia became the first States in the Nation to legalize personal use of mari-juana. 
Let’s be clear that there is a racial 
component to this situation. Although about the same proportion of Blacks and Whites use marijuana, a Black per-son is almost four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than a White person. In other words, as we try to understand why our prison 
population today is disproportionately Black and Latino, one reason is be-cause in overpoliced Black neighbor-hoods, African Americans are much more likely to be arrested for smoking or using marijuana than will Whites. Here is the simple truth: An upper mid-dle class White kid in Scarsdale, NY, has a much lower chance of being ar-rested for using marijuana than a low- income Black kid in Chicago or Balti-more. Those are just the facts. 
Too many Americans in this country 
have seen their lives destroyed because they have criminal records as a result of marijuana use. That is wrong. That has to change. Let’s be clear. A crimi-nal record could mean not only jail 
time, but much more. If a person has a criminal record, it will be much harder for that person later in life to get a job. It is not so easy to come out of jail and get a job, and if you don’t get a job, there is a strong likelihood you will go back into your same old environment and end up in jail again. If somebody has a criminal record, it may be impos-sible for them to obtain certain types of public benefits and in fact make it difficult for them to even live in public housing. A criminal record stays with a person for his or her entire life until the day he or she dies. A criminal record destroys lives. 
Right now, under the Controlled Sub-
stances Act, marijuana is listed as a Schedule I drug, meaning it is consid-ered to be a drug that is extremely dangerous. In fact, under the act, mari-juana is considered to be as dangerous as heroin. I know there are conflicting opinions about the health impacts marijuana may have, but nobody I know seriously believes marijuana is as dangerous as heroin. This is absurd. Nobody believes that. 
In my view, the time is long overdue 
for us to take marijuana off of the Fed-eral Government’s list of outlawed drugs. In my view, at a time when Col-orado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska, and the District of Columbia have al-ready legalized the personal use of marijuana, every State in this country should have the right to regulate mari-juana the same way that State and local laws now govern sales of alcohol and tobacco. Among other things, that means recognized businesses in States that have legalized marijuana should be fully able to use the banking system without fear of Federal prosecution. 
In response to the initiatives that 
Colorado and other States have taken, the Obama administration has essen-tially allowed these States to go for-ward and do what the people in those States have chosen to do. That is a good step forward, but it is not good enough because a new administration with a different point of view could simply go forward and prosecute those marijuana businesses and individuals in those States who use marijuana de-spite what the people in those States have decided to do legislatively. 
What I am saying is not that the 
Federal Government should legalize

marijuana throughout the country. 
This is a decision for the States. I hope many of my colleagues, especially those who express support for States’ rights and our Federalist system of government, those who often decry the power of the big bad Federal Govern-ment in undermining local initiatives, would support my very simple and straightforward legislation that will be introduced next week. 
All my legislation says is that if a 
State chooses to legalize marijuana, that State should be able to go forward without legal impediments from the Federal Government. 
CAPITAL PUNISHMENT  
Mr. President, I want to talk about 
an issue of great importance in this country. I believe the time is now for the United States to end capital pun-ishment. I know this is not necessarily a popular point of view, but in my view it is the right point of view. Virtually every Western industrialized country has chosen to end capital punishment. I would rather have our country stand side-by-side with European democ-racies than with countries like China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and others that maintain the death penalty. 
We are all shocked and disgusted by 
the horrific murders we see in this country, including massacres in schools and on college campuses that seem to take place every week. All of us are tired and disgusted with what we are seeing, but it seems to me that at a time of rampant violence and murder all over the world, where people are being blown up and their heads are being cut off, it is important that the state itself, the Federal Government in America, say loudly and clearly that we will not be part of that process. 
When people commit horrendous 
crimes—and we see too many of them— we should lock them up and throw away the key. I have no problem in saying that people who commit terrible murders should spend the rest of their lives in jail, but the state itself, in a democratic civilized society, should itself not be involved in the murder of other Americans. 
I know there are strong differences of 
opinion on this issue. In fact, I think I am in a minority position, but I think those of us who want to set an exam-ple, who want to say that we have to end the murders and the violence we are seeing in our country and all over the world, should in fact be on the side of those of us who believe we must end capital punishment in this country. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.

HOMELESS VETERANS SERVICES 
PROTECTION ACT OF 2015 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want 
to take a few minutes to talk about an issue that is very important to me, and that is the care of our Nation’s vet-erans. As the daughter of a World War II veteran, I realize what it means for 
a family member to be willing to sac-rifice their life for their country. We promise our men and women in uni-form that the country will be there for them after they leave service, and sometimes that means long after the war is over. But I am concerned our country is about to turn its back on thousands of veterans, and I am here today to say we have to fix it. 
Last year, the VA told homeless serv-
ice providers they needed to cut off services to certain veterans who had other than honorable discharges or had not served a certain length of time. If that policy had been enacted, it would have been a major setback for veterans across the country. It would have set us back on our goal of ending veteran homelessness, a goal that the adminis-tration has set for itself and hundreds of mayors across the country have committed to. It would have been sim-ply unacceptable. These are veterans who need our support. Many of them struggle with mental illness and sub-stance abuse or simply finding employ-ment. 
According to some of our leading vet-
erans and homeless groups—including the American Legion, the National Al-liance to End Homelessness, the Na-tional Low Income Housing Coalition, and the National Coalition for Home-less Veterans—if the policy had been enacted, the VA would have had to stop serving about 15 percent of the home-less veteran population. In some urban areas, up to 30 percent of homeless vet-erans would be turned away. 
Thankfully, after hearing concern 
from around the country, including from my home State of Washington, the VA was able to put off that terrible policy change. But, unfortunately, the VA is now expected to announce their final decision any day that the reprieve is over, and they are going to have to go ahead with this change and force homeless providers to turn away vet-erans who have nowhere else to go— veterans whose providers have been serving them for decades. That is wrong. This policy change would be heartless. It is a bureaucratic move that would put thousands of veterans on the streets practically overnight, and it has to be stopped. 
The VA is going to enact this policy 
when the final decision is made. So Congress needs to act now to stop this from happening. Earlier this year, I in-troduced the Homeless Veterans Serv-ices Protection Act. That is a bill that would ensure our most vulnerable vet-erans would be assured continued ac-cess to critical homeless service pro-grams, regardless of their discharge status or length of service. In other words, it fixes the problem the VA says it has and makes sure they do not have to cut off homeless veterans from care. 
My bill will make it clear that our 
country takes care of those who served and that we do not allow bureaucracy to dictate who gets a roof over their head and who does not. But it is crit-ical that we act now. The VA has said 
it would issue this legal position in No-vember, which could put thousands of veterans on the street. We are running out of time. But the solution to this crisis is now before us, and we can do it by passing the Homeless Veterans Services Protection Act. 
I don’t believe there is any Member 
of this body who would deny our obli-gation to ensure that veterans are taken care of and have a roof over their head. While our country has made great strides in recent years providing homeless services to the men and women who so bravely served our coun-try, I believe that even one veteran sleeping on our streets in the United States is one too many. We know we have a lot of work ahead of us. 
Veterans are at a greater risk of be-
coming homeless than nonveterans. On any given night, as many as 50,000 vet-erans are homeless here in this coun-try. With an influx of veterans now re-turning from the wars in Iraq and Af-ghanistan, the numbers of veterans seeking care will continue to go up. 
In short, this problem is not going 
away. Our veterans have made great sacrifices serving our country. We can-not turn our backs on them when they come home. That commitment in-cludes providing benefits, medical care, support, and assistance to prevent homelessness. It is a commitment that shouldn’t stop simply because we have run into a policy roadblock. 
I am very pleased to call this up now 
with the Heller amendment which is the text of S. 1105. It is a bill that I strongly support. The provision will in-crease the availability of care for homeless veterans with children by re-imbursing facilities funded by the VA Grant and Per Diem Program. 
I want to thank Senator H
ELLER for 
his leadership on this issue. I want to thank Senator I
SAKSON and Senator 
BLUMENTHAL for their leadership, as 
the heads of the Veterans Affairs’ Com-mittee, and for their support in being here today. 
I am hoping Democrats and Repub-
licans join us today to right this wrong and prevent this problem from hap-pening. It shouldn’t be a partisan issue. It is not a political issue. This is a vet-erans issue. It is one that should bring us all together. 
With that, I ask unanimous consent 
that the Committee on Veterans’ Af-fairs be discharged from further consid-eration of S. 1731 and the Senate pro-ceed to its immediate consideration. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report the bill by title. The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A bill (S. 1731) to amend title 38, United 
States Code, to waive the minimum period of continuous active duty in the Armed Forces for receipt of certain benefits for homeless veterans, to authorize the Secretary of Vet-erans Affairs to furnish such benefits to homeless veterans with discharges or re-leases from service in the Armed Forces with other than dishonorable conditions, and for other purposes.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want 
to thank Senator H ELLER , Senator 
ISAKSON , and the other Members who 
worked so hard for this. I would like to yield some time to the Senator from Nevada. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nevada. 
Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I want 
to thank Senator M
URRAY for her ef-
forts here today and for her willingness to work with me on including a provi-sion that we worked on together for several years now as members of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Af-fairs. Senator M
URRAY ’s legislation en-
sures that homeless veterans continue to be eligible for the VA’s Grant and Per Diem Program. 
With my provision that Senator 
M
URRAY agreed to include, this legisla-tion will also extend this eligibility to 
the dependents of homeless veterans. Given the work that I have done with Senator M
URRAY on eligibility for 
homeless veterans’ dependents, I be-lieve it was important we addressed both the needs of the veteran as well as their dependents. 
In cities such as Las Vegas, where 
veteran homelessness remains a serious problem, the support of housing and service centers that receive VA funding is absolutely critical in getting these veterans back on their feet. Not only do the programs provide housing but they also offer services, such as case management, education, crisis inter-vention, and other services to special populations and important populations such as homeless women veterans. 
This Congress has a responsibility to 
ensure that existing veterans under this program remain eligible, but also that dependents of veterans, especially their children, are taken care of when their veteran parents have fallen on hard times. 
That is why I introduced the CARE 
for Veterans’ Dependents Act with Sen-ator M
URRAY , to make dependents eli-
gible for care at VA-funded facilities. These children and their parents de-serve the certainty that they will able to access supportive housing during their serious time of need. I am proud that we were able to move forward on this measure, which was just accepted a few moments ago by unanimous con-sent. 
Senator M
URRAY and I have a proud 
history of working together to advo-cate on behalf of our Nation’s veterans, and today’s passage of this legislation is another testament to our strong partnership on behalf of veterans. I am also grateful to the chairman of the committee, Senator I
SAKSON , and to 
Ranking Member B LUMENTHAL of the 
Senate Committee on Veterans’ Af-fairs, for working so diligently with us to make this happen. 
Mr. President, I yield back to the 
Senator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 
back.

gest the absence of a quorum.

TRADE ACT OF 2015—Continued 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST —S. RES. 222 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as the 
proud parent of a wonderful daughter and the proud grandparent of three wonderful granddaughters, like so many others, I was proud of the U.S. Women’s National Team and their his-toric World Cup victory. I was even more proud on Tuesday when I saw

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7623 October 29, 2015 
them at the White House with Presi-
dent Obama. 
I know all Americans are so proud, as 
well as honored. The reason why so many Americans are proud of it is that earlier this year, with more than 25 million Americans watching, this elec-trifying group of athletes led the United States to a record third World Cup title. We all cheered, but then along with a lot of other Americans, I was surprised to learn that the U.S. Women’s National Team—even though there were enormous receipts from the TV coverage of this—received $2 mil-lion for winning the Women’s World Cup. The 2014 Men’s World Cup winners were awarded $35 million. When the women won, it was $2 million. When the men won, it was $35 million. To make it even worse, the men’s teams that lost in the first round of the 2014 Men’s World Cup were awarded $8 mil-lion. In other words, if you lose and are a man, you get $8 million. If you are a woman and you win, you get $2 million. 
That is really not acceptable. I can-
not imagine anybody finding it accept-able. I wanted to raise some awareness of this. I introduced a Senate resolu-tion calling on soccer’s international governing body, FIFA, to eliminate its discriminatory prize awards structure. 
It highlights the gross pay disparity 
in their award structure and calls for immediate change. All Democrats sup-port this call. I have heard some oppo-nents of an equal prize awards struc-ture in sports who say: Oh, no, we must pay men more than women. They point to revenue as the reason behind this disparity. Revenue cannot be accepted as a means for discrimination. Awards should not be determined by gender. That is why major sporting events, in-cluding the U.S. Open Tennis Cham-pionships and Wimbledon changed their prize award structure to assure that both female and male athletes are treated with the same dignity and re-spect they deserve. 
This proud father and grandfather 
feels that my sons and my daughter should be treated the same and my grandsons and granddaughters should be treated the same. In fact, it is why the U.S. Women’s National Team was rightly honored with a Ticker-Tape pa-rade and magazine covers for each player and their head coach by Sports Illustrated. 
These athletes, recognized at the 
White House on Tuesday, are global icons. Not just here in America but around the world they are recognized. They are role models to young athletes and fans everywhere. 
This includes fans such as 13-year-old 
Ayla Ludlow. She wrote to President Obama and the First Lady after the Women’s World Cup. She said: ‘‘It makes me mad that people do not treat girls equally.’’ I agree. It is time to recognize all athletes for their con-tributions—not make women second- class citizens. By taking an overdue but important step toward pay equity, we send a resounding message not just to women and girls but also to men and 
boys around the world. Equal pay for equal work should not be an ideal we talk about, but a reality. 
The men’s teams that lost in the 2014 
Men’s World Cup was awarded $8 mil-lion. The women’s team, which was watched worldwide as they won, was awarded $2 million. The men’s team that did win was awarded $35 million. I cannot imagine anybody who could stand up for that kind of disparity and treat men so much differently and so much better than women. These are athletes who worked hard from the time they were young to be the best of the best. They made America proud. But I think we make America a little ashamed if we do not stand up and say: We want women treated the same as men. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the HELP Committee be dis-charged from further consideration of S. Res. 222, and that the Senate pro-ceed to its immediate consideration— this is the resolution calling on FIFA to pay the same; and that the resolu-tion be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to recon-sider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Tennessee. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object, I listened carefully to the distinguished Sen-ator’s comments. Gender discrimina-tion is wrong, and we all know that. We have enacted laws in the United States for sports and for the workplace to make sure that we reflect those values. 
I support those laws, but we have a 
budget to pass, a debt crisis to fix, an education system that needs reform, and a humanitarian crisis in Europe that we ought to address. That is what the U.S. Senate ought to be spending its time on rather than offering opin-ions and resolutions about a private international entity and how they should distribute prizes and awards. So I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last night 
we passed resolutions, and here we are talking about taking 30 seconds out of our busy, busy schedule. Of course, we were in a quorum call for a few hours today. We could take 30, 50, or 82 sec-onds out of the 100 hours or so we will spend during the month sitting here doing nothing and pass a resolution that calls for the equal treatment of male and female athletes. 
If we cannot even do that, is it any 
wonder that the approval ratings of the Senate are in the tank? If we cannot even pass a nonbinding resolution, how can we ever achieve real pay equity for women? What is the real objection? We are simply urging for the equal treat-ment of female athletes. Treating peo-ple differently solely because of their gender is unacceptable. It sends a ter-rible message to mothers, daughters, 
and granddaughters across the globe. 
As I said, every single Democrat sup-
ports this resolution. I am very dis-appointed that the Republicans are blocking it. 
I will leave after saying one more 
thing. The women’s team won to inter-national acclaim, and they were award-ed $2 million. The men’s teams that lost in the first round was paid $8 mil-lion. The men’s team that won was awarded $35 million. 
Wimbledon knows better. The U.S. 
Open Tennis Championships said enough is enough. Women should be treated the same as men. 
A 13-year-old girl wrote to the Presi-
dent and said: ‘‘It makes me mad that people do not treat girls equally.’’ Well, I have a granddaughter who will be 13 in December. How do I speak to her? How do I tell her that the U.S. Senate—which is sort of waiting around here and has not done anything today—is unwilling to take 10 seconds, 30 seconds, 50 seconds to say: Let’s treat women athletes the same as men. 
I thank my Democratic colleagues 
for supporting this legislation. I hope my Republican colleagues will change their minds and say: Let’s treat female athletes the same as male athletes, es-pecially since the World Cup organiza-tion made a fortune on TV rights. They certainly made a heck of a lot more money on those TV rights while the women were winning than they were making when the men’s team lost, but the men’s teams that lost in the first round were still paid $8 million. They made four times more than the women who won the championship were paid. It is sexist, and it is wrong. 
In this day and age we need to stop 
treating women as second-class citi-zens. I do not want my daughter treat-ed that way. I do not want my grand-daughters treated that way. I do not want the women in Vermont treated that way. I do not want women any-where in this country to be treated that way. I want to say to that 13-year- old girl who is angry because of the un-fair treatment of girls: I am sorry the U.S. Senate would not stand up for you, but I, and others, stand up for you, and I always will. Let us hope someday the Senate stands up for you too. 
We can see how busy we are at this 
time. There is not a single Senator on the floor, except for the distinguished Presiding Officer, of course, and so I will suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7624 October 29, 2015 
works for the American people, but 
time and time again, whether it was in the Appropriations Committee or here on the Senate floor, Members of this body refused to have a conversation about how to do that. They dug their heels in and said: It is my way or the highway. 
Now here we are, down to the wire, 
and they finally realize that sequestra-tion is damaging. It is something that we have been saying from day one. Un-
fortunately, it cost the Speaker of the House his job, it wasted months of time, and it continued to erode what is left of the faith that the American peo-ple have in Congress. 
Coming from Montana, I find this in-
credibly frustrating. Folks back home are reasonable. They talk to their neighbors even if they don’t agree with them. They compromise, negotiate, give a little, and most of the time they get a lot. This body could learn a lot from my constituents. 
The Senate was designed to be a de-
liberative body. It was supposed to be a place where conversations and com-promise happen, where we reach across the aisle and partner with our col-leagues with whom we might not al-ways agree. That kind of bipartisan-ship requires more time, harder work, and tougher conversations. Sure, it is a lot easier to scream and yell at the other side so the super PACs and mil-lionaires who fund too much of our pol-itics these days know we didn’t back down, but at the end of the day, that doesn’t move the country forward, and unfortunately that happened again this year. 
Had we started these budget negotia-
tions back in July when 10 moderate Members of this body first rang the alarm, we wouldn’t be in a last-minute scramble today. I am disappointed. I am disappointed in the Senate. The only time folks are talking to one an-other is when there is a crisis. The only time folks are working together is when we are faced with fiscal cliffs, economic meltdowns, and catastrophes. I hope we realize that Congress is the only place in this country that oper-ates like this. Businesses and families plan, talk, and they certainly don’t wait until the last minute to get their financial house in order. 
Why does it take an emergency for 
Congress to govern? Why does it take a looming deadline for folks to come to their senses and to do their jobs? It is because the voices in the middle are getting drowned out by the voices on the fringes. We have become afraid of compromise. In many circles it is a dirty word, one that should never be uttered. 
So here we are today, just a few days 
before we default on our debt, and we have wasted so much time. Our inabil-ity to tackle these issues earlier this year caused the appropriations process to break down. It caused an unneces-sary veto of the Defense authorization bill, something our troops are waiting for us to resolve while they stand on the frontlines. I know this budget deal isn’t perfect, 
but it is the product of compromise, however last minute it may be and however limited the ability of Senators to weigh in on it is. But by raising the debt ceiling, we will prevent interest rates from skyrocketing and the value of the dollar from plummeting. By end-ing the sequester, we will do away with severe budget cuts that are hurting our veterans, seniors, students, and work-ing families. 
We will shore up Social Security and 
allow ourselves to make responsible in-vestments in our national security, education, health care, and public lands. It will reduce a massive pre-mium hike that was scheduled to im-pact 46,000 Montana seniors who use Medicare for their health insurance. This legislation will keep those pre-miums more manageable. 
Those accomplishments are critically 
important to our economy and worthy of this Senate’s support, but as with anything that comes together at the last minute, there are provisions I don’t like, things that could have been fixed if we had taken more time to ne-gotiate. Take, for instance, the budg-et’s impact on our rural hospitals. There are provisions in here that could severely limit access to rural health care. I am committed to addressing those concerns in the upcoming appro-priations process because folks in Mon-tana and other rural States shouldn’t have to drive hundreds of miles to see a doctor. 
As I said, this budget isn’t perfect. 
The most disappointing thing is that it could have been so much better. But in the spirit of compromise that got us here today, we need to use that con-versation to make sure we get things done. 
I know there will always be those 
who refuse to get off the ideological soapbox and who like to watch others do the hard work of governing, but those folks usually don’t last long with my constituents. 
With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
CONGRATULATING SPEAKER PAUL RYAN  
Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, 
when responsibility calls, it is usually not at a time of our choosing. The deci-sion to answer is rarely easy or straightforward. P
AUL RYAN knows 
this. He spent his nights dreaming about tax policy, not the Speakership. But our country is fortunate that he stepped up to lead, and I know I am grateful that he did. 
Speaker R
YAN is thoughtful about 
the issues facing our Nation. He is sober-minded. He knows the job he is walking into is tough. He also under-stands the potential it holds in terms of conservative solutions for our coun-try and in terms of more opportunity for the middle class. 
When I called to congratulate Speak-
er R
YAN, we discussed our many shared 
goals in Congress. We pledged a strong partnership. We aimed to continue ad-vancing conservative reform. I look 
forward to working closely with him as we move forward. 
Speaker R
YAN knows what it means 
to work hard. He knows what it means to dream big dreams. He knows what it means to achieve them as well. Some-thing we all admire about Speaker R
YAN is his determination to ensure 
others are able to achieve big things in their lives too, to ensure others can lead fulfilling lives defined by meaning and punctuated with purpose. 
There is no doubt he cares deeply. He 
cares about combating poverty effec-tively. He cares about lifting up the middle class successfully. And because he cares, he is willing to call out failed policies when they hurt those they are supposed to help, and he has suggested better ways forward as well. 
In short, here is what we can say 
about Speaker R
YAN: He has a big 
heart, he has an extraordinary intel-lect, and he knows how to lead with both. That quality is rare around here. So is having a reputation that so great-ly precedes oneself in such a positive way. But that is Speaker R
YAN. 
Nothing is going to come easily in 
his new role, and he certainly knows that. Neither of us will be under any il-lusions about the positions we hold. We face a Democratic Party that con-tinues to move left. We face a Presi-dent who doesn’t seem very interested in cooperation on the big things or the hard things, nor on making divided government work. These are the reali-ties that face us, and we might as well acknowledge them, but it won’t stop us from working together to advance con-servative reform as well as to achieve solutions for the middle class whenever we can. 
Today, though, let’s celebrate Speak-
er R
YAN’s extraordinary achievement. 
He has already proven his stature as a leader in our party. From leading the Nation on responsible budgeting and pro-growth tax reform to serving as an extraordinary candidate for Vice Presi-dent, he always rises to the challenge. 
I would note for my House colleagues 
that their incoming leader campaigned vigorously to become President of the Senate, but he was drafted into the Speakership. 
But, look, on a more serious note, 
P
AULRYANmay not have asked for this 
job, but the moment called for him to lead, and I am grateful that he will be-cause we know he is a leader who has repeatedly demonstrated the talent, the vision, and the experience to suc-ceed. 
I look forward to building a strong 
partnership on behalf of our country.

TRADE ACT OF 2015—Continued 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise 
today in opposition to raising the debt ceiling. I rise particularly in opposi-tion to raising the debt ceiling without getting any sort of spending reform or budgetary reform in return. In fact, it will be completely the opposite. We will be raising the debt ceiling in an unlimited fashion. We will be giving President Obama a free pass to borrow as much money as he can borrow in the last year of his office—no dollar limit. Here you go, President Obama, spend what you want. We do this while also exceeding what are called budget caps. 
We have been trying to have spending 
restraint in Washington. It hasn’t worked very well, but at least there are some numbers the government is not supposed to exceed. These include spending caps for military spending as well as domestic spending. 
When I first arrived in 2010, I was 
part of the movement called the tea party movement. We came into promi-nence, and I was elected primarily be-cause I was concerned about the debt, worried about the debt we were leaving to our kids and our grandkids, worried that we were destroying the very fabric of the country with debt. 
We came here in 2010, and we nego-
tiated and negotiated, and President Obama said: I won’t negotiate with you. I won’t negotiate with a gun to my head. 
The media said: You always have to 
raise the debt ceiling. It is irrespon-sible to use that as leverage to get re-form.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7626 October 29, 2015 
But you know what. We did get re-
form. The conservatives put together something called cut, cap, and balance. It was passed overwhelmingly in the House, blocked in the Senate, but ulti-mately there was something passed called sequestration, which put caps on both military and domestic spending. It did slow down the rate of growth in government for a little while. 
This is the problem with Congress: 
Congress will occasionally do some-thing in the right direction, and then they take one step forward and two steps back. In 2013 we gave up on the sequester and we added back in about $60 billion worth of money. Now they are doing the same thing again. This time we are going to add back in $80 billion—$50 billion in 2016 and another $30 billion in 2017. 
We are doing the opposite of what we 
should be doing. We should be using the leverage of the debt ceiling by saying: We are not raising it again until you reform your ways, until you begin spending only the money you have. 
Instead, we are saying: Here, Mr. 
President. You can raise the debt as much as you want. You can spend as much as you want while you are in of-fice, and we are going to do nothing. In fact, we are going to help you. We are going to exceed the caps so everybody gets what they want. 
So everyone in Washington is going 
to get something. The right is going to get more military money, the left is going to get more welfare money, the secret handshake goes on, and the American public gets stuck with the bill. 
I think one of the most important 
things that we do is defend the coun-try. If you ask me to prioritize the spending, I will say we have to defend the country above and beyond and be-fore all else. But that doesn’t mean we are stronger or safer if we are doing this from bankruptcy court. 
I think the No. 1 threat to our coun-
try, the No. 1 threat to our security is debt, this piling on of debt. The debt threatens our national security. Yet we just want to pile it on and pile it on. 
This deal will do nothing but explode 
the debt. In fact, it doesn’t even limit how much the debt can go up. We are 
giving the President a blank check. 
We are in the middle of a filibuster. 
This filibuster will go on until about 1:00 in the morning, and then we will find out who the true conservatives in this town are. If you are conservative, you will say: There is no way I am going to vote to give an unlimited power to the President to borrow money. If you are a conservative, you are going to say: We shouldn’t be ex-ceeding the budget caps; if anything, we should be passing more stringent budget caps. 
It disappoints me greater than I can 
possibly express that the party I belong to that should be the conservative party doesn’t appear to be conserv-ative. This is a big problem. 
I am traveling the country, and I 
have asked Republicans everywhere. I have yet to meet a single Republican 
who supports this deal. 
In the House, they voted on this yes-
terday. Do you know what the vote was? Two to one among Republicans say that this is a god-awful deal and that we shouldn’t touch it with a 10- foot pole. It is a terrible deal. House Republicans understood this. 
We should be doing the opposite. We 
should be taking the leverage of saying we are not going to raise the debt ceil-ing unless we get reform. Instead, we went to the President and said: Here, raise the debt ceiling as much as you can possibly spend over the next year, and we will let you exceed the budget caps. It is irresponsible. It shows a lack of concern for our country, for the debt, and it should go down in defeat. 
When I ran for office in 2010, the debt 
was an enormous issue. The debt was $10 trillion. Some of us in the tea party were concerned because it had doubled in the last 8 years. It doubled from $5 to $10 trillion under a Republican ad-ministration. Many of us were adamant that Republicans needed to do a better job. We had added new entitlement pro-grams, we added new spending, and the deficit got worse under Republicans. Now we are under a Democratic Presi-dent and it is set to double again. This President will add more to the debt than all of the previous Presidents combined. So we will go from $10 tril-lion now to nearly $20 trillion. We may get close to $20 trillion, and now that we have increased the debt ceiling an unspecified amount, we may well get to $20 trillion by the time this President leaves. 
Is that a problem? Some people say: 
It is just a big number. I don’t know what $1 trillion is. 
If you want to imagine $1 trillion, 
take thousand-dollar bills and put them in your hand. Thousand-dollar bills 4 inches high is $1 million. If you want to have $1 trillion in thousand- dollar bills, it would be 63 miles high. We are talking about an amount of money that is hard to fathom. 
You say: What does that mean? How 
does that hurt me or my family? 
Economists say we are losing 1 mil-
lion jobs a year through the burden of debt. Economists also say that when your debt becomes as large as your economy, you are in a worrisome place; that when the debt is as large as the economy, there is a possibility that you may enter into a period where you might suffer a panic or a collapse or a burden so great that your economy can’t withstand it. In 2008 we were very close to a panic. I think we get closer with each day. 
The No. 1 priority up here shouldn’t 
be trying to scrounge around and find new money to spend. It should be try-ing to conserve. It should be doing something that some say is radical but I say is the absolute essence of com-mon sense; that is, we should spend what comes in. 
So often up here, things become par-
tisan and people just want to point fin-gers and say: Oh, it is that party that 
did it; they are the ones responsible for the debt. 
But I want to let you in on a secret. 
This is a secret that goes on and on and on up here. It is something I call the unholy alliance. It is the unholy alli-ance between right and left—they both have sacred cows they want to spend money on. Instead of saying: The debt is a real problem, and we both have to conserve in both areas, they get to-gether secretly and raise the money for their sacred cows. So on the right we are busting the limits because the right wants more military spending. The left wants more for welfare. The unholy alliance is the secret hand-shake. And what gets worse? The debt. We are borrowing $1 million every minute, and it is not going to end in a pretty way. 
What do other conservatives have to 
say about this deal? Stephen Moore at the Heritage Foundation writes: ‘‘It is the worst budget deal to be negotiated by the GOP since George H.W. Bush violated his ‘no new taxes’ pledge in 1990.’’ 
Rush Limbaugh says: ‘‘The Repub-
lican party cannot campaign by run-ning around blaming the Democrats for destroying the budget, for over-spending, for threatening the very fab-ric of the country.’’ They can’t do it because they are now complicit. 
We can’t point fingers and say the 
Democrats are the big spenders. We now, by this deal, become complicit. We become equally guilty of sup-porting new debt. 
Some say: Well, gosh, you have to 
raise the debt ceiling, right? If you don’t raise the debt ceiling, there will be a default. 
Hogwash. Do you know how much 
money comes into this place every month through taxes? About $250 bil-lion comes in in taxes. Do you know what our interest payment is? About $30 billion, might be as high as $60, $70, $80 billion. There is never not enough revenue to pay for interest. People say we couldn’t pay for everything. I say maybe we shouldn’t spend it on every-thing. We have plenty of money that comes in every month to spend on in-terest, to spend on Medicare, to spend on Social Security, and to spend on sol-diers’ salaries and veterans affairs and the rest, but maybe government shouldn’t be doing much else. 
These are the questions we would 
have to ask: What would happen if the debt ceiling didn’t go up? We would have a balanced budget. How bad would that be? If your debt ceiling didn’t go up, you would spend what comes in. That is what every American family does—they spend what comes in. 
I think this is absolutely what we 
need to do, but even I am willing to compromise, so I have put forward a compromise. I put forward a com-promise that we tried in 2011 called cut, cap, and balance. My compromise would cut the deficit in half in 1 year— a dramatic lessening of the burden of

debt. That is the cut. The cap is that 
my bill would actually cap spending at 18 percent of GDP—18 percent of the total amount of money spent on the economy. Why did we pick 18 percent? Because that leads to a balanced budg-et. The last part of my bill of cut, cap, and balance is we would pass a bal-anced budget amendment to the Con-stitution. I have kind of jokingly said— but probably seriously—if we pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution and we pass term limits, I will go back to being a doctor, which is my first love anyway. 
We have to fix the country. We are 
destroying the country with debt. We are drowning in a sea of debt, and nei-ther party seems to be concerned with it anymore. 
So what I would do is I would say, 
yes, I will compromise. I will raise the debt ceiling under these three condi-tions: cut the deficit in half, cap the spending, and pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. 
People say: Well, there aren’t the 
votes for that. 
Why don’t we have a vote? Why don’t 
we allow a vote on cut, cap, and bal-ance, the conservative alternative to this deal we have on the floor? Why don’t we vote on an alternative? Be-cause there won’t be any amendments allowed. This will be pushed through without amendments. I really object to that. This is supposed to be a body of deliberation. We are supposed to be able to deliberate over how we are going to fix the problems of the coun-try. And I think this is the No. 1 threat to us. We are accumulating debt at $1 million every minute. Someone has to stand up and do something about it. 
Taxpayers for Common Sense says 
about this: ‘‘We’re not a fan of the Bi-partisan Budget Agreement of 2015.’’ 
CATO writes: ‘‘The Gipper’s [Ronald 
Reagan’s] ghost is probably looking down from heaven at the new budget deal between congressional leaders and the Obama administration and saying ‘there they go again.’’’ 
‘‘So let’s rephrase the question: What 
do advocates of fiscal restraint get in exchange [for raising these spending caps]? Well, if you peruse [this] agree-ment, it’s apparent they don’t get any-thing.’’ 
What we have traded is an increase in 
the debt ceiling—not just an increase, an unspecified increase in the debt ceil-ing. We have said to President Obama: You can spend as much money as you want throughout the rest of your Presi-dency—no limits. 
The National Taxpayers Union 
writes: 
If the question on the budget and debt ceil-
ing package is ‘‘Deal or No Deal?’’ taxpayers should clearly opt for the latter. 
While the agreement contains a few 
meritorious provisions, it fails other sufficient savings and structural re-forms necessary to address our Na-tion’s $18.1 trillion debt problem. The debt is without question the No. 1 prob-lem in the country. We will have a vote this evening, and that vote will be: Do 
you care? Are you willing to do some-thing to slow it down? Do you think we ought to use the leverage of the debt ceiling to slow down spending or are you a profligate spender who will vote to bust the caps and who will vote to give President Obama unlimited bor-rowing authority? 
I think it is a clear-cut question. I 
will vote no, and I will continue this filibuster as long as there are enough votes to allow it to continue. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST —S. 2182 
Mr. President, at this point, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consider-ation of my bill, Cut, Cap, and Balance, which is Calendar No. 274, S. 2182. I fur-ther ask that there be 1 hour of debate equally divided in the usual form; that following the use or yielding back of time the bill be read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Sen-
ate is now considering a bipartisan budget agreement. I believe it is impor-tant to pass that bipartisan effort to avoid catastrophic default and to put an end to the mindless sequestration and pass funding to keep the govern-ment open. Regrettably, because I often agree with my friend from Ken-tucky and we team up on so many issues, the request to take up the Cut, Cap, and Balance legislation is a step in the wrong direction. 
When you push for cut, cap, and bal-
ance in this context, you are pushing for default, recession, and joblessness because that is what all of the inde-pendent financial authorities tell us is what is ahead if we don’t act in the Senate. The desire to set aside what we are working on and pursue this other legislation is specifically an approach that would throw aside the bipartisan agreement before the Senate. 
This bipartisan effort is exactly the 
kind of bipartisan work where Demo-crats and Republicans come together to tackle a major issue. The American people expect their leaders to find com-mon ground on key issues. That is what this legislation does. 
For those reasons, I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Kentucky. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I agree 
with the Senator from Oregon that bi-partisan agreement is necessary in this body, but I think we have in this agree-ment bipartisan agreement in the wrong direction. The bipartisan agree-ment we need is to conserve across the board, for both sides to say that our sa-cred cow, whether it is military on the right or domestic spending on the left—that they all will have to be con-served. We will not be able to spend money we don’t have. I think we are becoming weaker as a 
nation the more we borrow. If we pass this bill, it is not a difference or a choice between calamity and con-tinuing to add to the debt—which this bill will do. I fully believe we can con-tinue to make our payments. We have $250 billion a month that comes in. In-terest payments are $30 billion. There is absolutely no reason we would ever default. In fact, I have a bill called the Default Protection Act, which would ensure that Social Security, Medicare, our soldiers’ salaries, and the interest on the debt were paid for. So I think what we should be doing is doing the opposite kind of compromise. Right and left should come together and say: You know what. I really want spending on this. The right says: I really want spending on the military. They should come together and say: You know what. We don’t have any money. We are borrowing $1 million every minute. 
So I think this bipartisan com-
promise goes in the wrong direction. What I would ask for is a bipartisan compromise to actually save money and borrow less. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
SYRIA  
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to 
talk about the conflict in Syria, and in particular what is happening over the next couple of days and weeks. We know that in the last 4 years, starting in 2011, this conflict has resulted in the deaths of a quarter of a million Syr-ians. More than 4 million Syrians have fled and registered as refugees in neighboring countries. We are told that 7.6 million Syrian are displaced from their homes within Syria itself. 
So when you combine those who have 
fled the country because of the vio-lence and combine that with the num-ber of folks displaced in the country, you have about half the population of Syria. If we had the equivalent number here in the United States—of over 300 million people—that would be some-thing on the order of 150 million Amer-icans displaced from their homes. We cannot even imagine the scale of that suffering. 
At the center of this horror, this hor-
rific war and humanitarian catas-trophe, sits Bashar al-Assad, the dic-tator, who in the estimation of many experts and world leaders, and this is my opinion as well, has lost all legit-imacy as the leader of Syria. A conflict that began with peaceful protests by Syrian young people for change quick-ly gave way to fighting on the streets of Homs, Daraa, and Aleppo. 
Assad’s security forces have at-
tempted to quash dissent with brutal beatings, imprisonment, starvation, use of chemical weapons, and wholesale destruction from indiscriminate barrel

bombs, which, by the way, is a viola-
tion of international law. These ac-tions prove to be a recruiting windfall for extremists and terrorist groups like ISIS, which now operate along many major transportation routes and cities in parts of Syria. 
The Institute for the Study of War 
just this week assessed that ISIS is now challenging the Assad regime for control of the supply line to Aleppo, expanding their reach westward. As I have said before and some others have said—it is what I will continue to maintain—the conflict in Syria and the international effort to degrade and ul-timately defeat ISIS are inextricably linked. 
We cannot expect to bring about a 
lasting defeat of ISIS without bringing about a political transition in Syria. The atrocities perpetrated by these two evils, one the Assad regime and also ISIS—these atrocities are too numer-ous to catalog today. Neither entity of-fers a stable, secure, and prosperous fu-ture for Syria. Several times the United States has participated in inter-national negotiations with an eye to-ward ending this horror and paving the road toward a third choice for Syria. 
That is what this would be, a real po-
litical transition featuring inclusive-ness, rule of law, and the primacy of citizenship over sect, ethnicity, and other divisive categories. These con-versations have yet to bear fruit, most-ly because the regime in Iran and the Russians continue to offer a lifeline to the murderous Assad, but we must keep trying. We must keep trying. 
One look at the images of the de-
struction in Aleppo or the faces of Syr-ians fleeing to Europe for a better life reminds us of the human costs of inac-tion. It is because of this that the Ira-nian and Russian escalation in recent weeks is so outrageous. These coun-tries look at Syria as a ground line of communication to Hezbollah or a friendly host for a warm-water naval outpost. They turn a blind eye to the suffering of ordinary men, women, and children in an effort to exert their international influence. Russia’s war-planes have struck in areas where the Syrian opposition, not ISIS, operates. Their strikes appear indiscriminate and have killed many civilians. 
Now, in the case of Iran, the recent 
visit of a designated terrorist and IRGC commander, Qasem Soleimani—his movement to Syria indicates that Iran and its proxies like Hezbollah are still central elements of this fight. I am on the floor today as leaders from major countries meet in Vienna. Yesterday in a speech at Carnegie Endowment, Sec-retary Kerry described his diplomatic task as ‘‘charting a course out of hell.’’ That is how he described the way out through a political resolution in Syria. 
Although news reports indicate that 
these talks will not deal directly with the question of Bashar al-Assad, our policy must remain firm. Assad has no place—no place in Syria’s future. No bombing campaigns, no promise of sham elections should change that. I 
commend the work Secretary Kerry is doing. I commend him for the speech he gave yesterday. 
One month ago I wrote to him calling 
for greater U.S. leadership on at least three tracks: political, multilateral, and humanitarian. In the response to my letter, the State Department em-phasized, ‘‘The only way to sustainably end the suffering of the Syrian people is through a genuine political solution consistent with the Geneva principles.’’ 
I appreciate and agree with this com-
mitment. However, I am concerned that the Governments of Syria, Iran, and Russia remain in clear violation of multiple U.N. Security Council resolu-tions, including flouting arms control restrictions and travel sanctions. These regimes do not appear to be ready for dialogue consistent with the Geneva principles. Secretary Kerry said during his Carnegie speech yester-day that the United States and Russia have many points of common ground on Syria. However, the areas of diver-gence are stark. 
We know there is no military solu-
tion to this conflict. Only a political settlement can heal the deep wounds across Syria. We must continually as-sert that no political solution can in-clude a role for Bashar al-Assad. For a ruler who indiscriminately barrel bombs children over and over again, presides over the death of over one- quarter of a million civilians, there must be no soft political landing. 
We have said over and over again— 
and I will continue to say it—that Assad must go. It is important our ne-gotiators in Vienna insist that these talks are a vehicle to effectuate the re-moval of Assad, not continue his brutal rule. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. C
AS-
SIDY). The Senator from Georgia. 
Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak as in morning business and following my speech that Senator L
EEfrom Utah be 
recognized. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
TRIBUTE TO M .H. ‘‘WOODY ’’ WOODSIDE  
Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, all of 
us know that back in our home States today and every day, there are men and women working hard to plant the fields, manufacture the products, run the chambers of commerce, sell the groceries, cut the lawns, make the beds, make our States work, and make our economy work. We also know that as politicians serving in the Senate, there is not one of us who doesn’t owe our career to community leaders back home who take the time to lend their support to us, bring their communities to us, and give us the fortification we need to serve our great State. 
Back in Georgia there is one such 
person who means a lot to me and who meets all those criteria. His name is Woody Woodside. Woody is the presi-dent of The Brunswick-Golden Isles Chamber of Commerce in Brunswick, 
GA. On November 5, he is going to be honored for 30 consecutive years as president of that chamber. And Woody is one great chamber president, let me tell you. 
He got his start right here in Wash-
ington, DC, working 11 years for Bo Ginn, the Congressman from Georgia’s coast, and for 3 years following that for Bo’s successor, Lindsay Thomas. Woody worked hard for our State, he worked hard for his district, and he worked hard for those members of com-merce. 
But he comes back to us every year 
now as the president of the chamber of commerce. He brings his board with him. He brings the issues that are be-fore them and he lobbies hard for his community. But he also lobbies hard for the environment. Woody represents a chamber that promotes tourism on the coast of Georgia but fights equally for the preservation of the estuary of the Atlantic, the Marshes of Glynn. 
He is proud of his community and 
proud of the work he does. He is a tire-less worker on behalf of his State and his community. He loves his beautiful family—his wife Ellen, his daughter Mary Gould, his late son Jay, his grandson James ‘‘Woods’’ Woodside, and his granddaughter Mary Bremer Moorhead. 
He is one of those priceless citizens 
who means so much to our State and so much to me personally. On this occa-sion on the floor of the Senate, I pay tribute to Woody Woodside for his 30 years of service to the Brunswick-Gold-en Isles Chamber of Commerce and thank him for everything he has done for his country, his State, and his com-munity. 
May God bless Woody Woodside, and 
may God bless the United States of America.

Mr. LEE. Mr. President, the budget 
deal before the Senate today is not just a horrible piece of legislation that is undeserving of this Chamber’s support, it also represents the last gasping breath of a disgraced bipartisan belt-way establishment on the verge of col-lapse. 
The bill is the product of an unfair, 
dysfunctional, and fundamentally un-democratic process—a process that is virtually indistinguishable from what we promised the American people a GOP-controlled Congress would bring to an end. We made that promise pre-cisely because negotiating legislation behind closed doors without input from the majority of Members and then rushing it through to final passage without debate or opportunity for amendments violates our party’s core principles. It also inevitably leads to bad policy. 
The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 is 
a case in point. This bill would suspend the debt limit for 17 months and in-crease government spending beyond its already unsustainable levels. It would

do so while failing to make reforms 
that would put us on a path toward fis-cal sustainability. 
Many proponents of this budget deal 
challenge this claim. They say: Well, the bill isn’t perfect, but while it isn’t perfect it does include some meaning-ful entitlement reforms. 
The sales pitch we hear most often 
alleges that this budget deal will save the Social Security disability trust fund from insolvency, but we are never told exactly how this bill would do this. That is because, as always, the devil is in the details. 
I rise today to discuss these very de-
tails, details that prove this budget deal’s so-called entitlement reforms are nothing of the sort. At best, they are well-intentioned but ineffectual tweaks to a program that desperately needs fundamental, structural over-haul. At worst, they are accounting gimmicks unbecoming of the U.S. Con-gress. 
According to the Social Security 
trustees, the Social Security Disability Insurance Program—or SSDI—is sched-uled to run out of money in 2016, which means that without serious reform dis-ability benefits would be slashed across the board by nearly 20 percent. 
Under the Budget Control Act of 2015, 
the bankruptcy deadline of SSDI would be pushed off for an additional 6 years until 2022. But here is the kicker: It would do so by raiding the Social Secu-rity trust fund to the tune of $150 bil-lion. That is right. Our grand, bipar-tisan solution to the impending insol-vency of our Nation’s disability insur-ance program amounts to stealing $150 billion from our Nation’s largest retire-ment insurance program. 
This isn’t the only phony pay-for in 
this budget deal. There are others that simply move money around from else-where in the Federal budget, such as the Crime Victims Fund and the Assets Forfeiture Fund. There are also new heavyhanded instruments that purport to implement cost savings in Medicaid reimbursements but actually only im-pose misguided price controls on the generic drug industry. Only in Wash-ington, DC, could something so decep-tive and ineffective, something so un-fair to America’s seniors and future generations, be considered a reform. 
To be fair, there are a couple of 
sound entitlement reforms in this budget deal that deserve to be com-mended. First, there is a position that would correct a design error in the So-cial Security program that amounts to an unfair and wasteful loophole. Fixing this would save a significant amount of money over a 75-year window. There are also measures that would increase the penalties for fraud, create new pilot programs, and prohibit doctors with felonies from submitting medical evidence. But these minor changes don’t even come close to putting SSDI on a path toward fiscal sustainability and sanity, and they represent only a tiny fraction of the sensible reform proposals put forth by our conference. Many of my colleagues, such as Sen-
ator L
ANKFORD and Senator C OTTON , 
have already spoken or will soon speak on the floor about the long list of structural reform ideas that are still sitting on the sidelines of this debate. I wish to take a moment to touch on just a few of them. 
Senator C
OATS has a proposal that 
would protect the SSDI trust fund from being drawn down by fugitive felons il-legally receiving disability benefits. 
Senator H
ATCH has put forth a plan 
that would prevent an individual from receiving both unemployment insur-ance and disability insurance simulta-neously, ensuring that SSDI funds would remain focused on their intended population. 
I also have a proposal that would ex-
pand the footprint of private disability insurance program, which I intend to file as an amendment to this bill. 
That is not all. My friends, Senator 
C
OTTON and Senator L ANKFORD , have 
their own proposals, and there has been an equal amount of policy innovation by our colleagues in the House of Rep-resentatives. 
They are all commonsense ideas that 
would bring us much closer to real SSDI reform than what is found in this budget deal, but you won’t hear much about them in this debate because there won’t be any real debate on the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015—no amendments, a fast-approaching dead-line and, in the end, a take-it-or-leave- it choice forced upon us with our backs up against a cliff. 
This is not how Congress is supposed 
to operate. This is not how we prom-ised the country we would conduct the American people’s business if given control of the House and the Senate. We should be the party of ideas, but we won’t be so long as we continue to tol-erate a legislative process that stifles our most innovative proposals from 
getting a fair hearing. We should be the party of reform, but we won’t be so long as individual Senators are blocked from offering amendments to legisla-tion. We should be the party of fiscal sanity and responsible governance, but we won’t be so long as we continue to govern by crisis and by cliff, delaying the inevitable while working only 3 days a week in our legislative calendar. We should be the party that looks out for the most vulnerable among us, but we won’t be so long as we lack the courage to enact the structural reform that our retirement and disability pro-grams need to survive for generations to come. 
We can be all of these things. I know 
we can, but it is going to take hard work—a fair, open, and inclusive legis-lative process, and all the policy inno-vation we can muster. It is going to take something more, something bet-ter than this budget deal. 
I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, in re-
cent weeks I have spoken three or four or five times on the question of wheth-er we are going to realistically and honestly fund the transportation im-provements our country so badly needs. I don’t know if it is my imagina-tion, but every time I am here speak-ing on the subject, you are here. We have any number of people—50-some Republican Senators in the majority— who cycle in as Presiding Officer, yet you always seem to draw the short straw and get to hear me wax elo-quently about transportation infra-structure. I am honored you would be back again today for more of the same. Pretty soon, you will be able to give these talks for me and I will sit up there and preside. I won’t ask unani-mous consent for that, but it is a good thought. 
Mr. President, this is a picture that 
was taken, gosh, 60 or 70 years ago, and there is a quote here by a fellow who was a great military leader for our country during World War II and later one of our Presidents. In fact, he was President when I had just about come into the world and left as President a few years after that. The photograph says, ‘‘This is the first project in the United States on which actual con-struction was started under provisions of the new Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956.’’ 
This is in Missouri. They have the 
contractor and some of the local folks there. I don’t see Ike anywhere, but his words are here at the bottom of this old photograph. His words that day were: ‘‘A modern, efficient highway system is essential to meet the needs of our growing population, our expand-ing economy, and our national secu-rity.’’ 
There is a word—‘‘prescient’’—that 
indicates something is wise and for-ward-looking. Those words are just that—wise and forward-looking—and they were first spoken almost 60 years ago by President Eisenhower. 
This week, President Obama and 
leaders in the House of Representatives and the Senate reached a long-sought compromise on a budget deal for 2 years, through 2017. And while there are certainly some aspects of that budget deal that are disappointing, other aspects of it, at least for me—in terms of finding ways to save money, going after program integrity, and looking for waste and fraud—bring a good deal to like about it as well. 
It is encouraging that Democrats and 
Republicans were able to come to-gether to reach an agreement—any agreement—that will pause the cycle of crisis government, from crisis to crisis, where we find too much of our time across the Federal Government, as we run up to these crises, spent not doing work—the work we ought to be doing—

but actually trying to figure out how 
we deal with a shutdown. At least we can say this agreement will prevent that and for the next couple of years enable people across the Federal Gov-ernment to do their work, whether it happens to be agriculture, environ-ment, law enforcement, border secu-rity, or you name it. 
The other thing I would say is by pre-
venting a default on our Federal obli-gations and lifting the harmful spend-ing cuts—particularly in the areas of our budget where we actually invest money that create economic oppor-tunity—this deal will help to encour-age continued economic growth and re-covering from low job creation and job preservation. 
I heard today that this agreement is 
worth about an extra one-third of a million jobs, and in a little State like mine, Delaware, with fewer than a mil-lion people, that is quite a few jobs. However, if we really wanted to focus on economic growth and job creation, we would be talking a lot more about transportation, and I mentioned the words here of Dwight Eisenhower, but let’s go on to the next poster. 
While there is much to like in the 
budget agreement we are debating today and into the night, I am dis-appointed that it fails to offer a long- term plan to increase investment in America’s infrastructure, particularly in our transportation infrastructure. A budget deal like this offered a prime opportunity to address our chronic underinvestment in the roads, high-ways, bridges, and transit systems of this Nation. 
I have looked high and low in this 
budget agreement, and when it comes to transportation, there is a ‘‘whole lotta nothing’’ in there with respect to transportation and infrastructure in-vestment. Instead, Congress is now poised to pass not the 13th but the 14th extension of our Federal transpor-tation programs since 2008. We have done this 14 times. Fortunately, this extension does not require us to add to the $74 billion we have spent since 2008 to bail out the highway transportation fund time and again, but it only con-tinues the cycle of uncertainty and cri-sis governing that prevented our States and our cities from planning major transportation projects. 
I would just insert here that if you 
look at the country from coast to coast, our State transportation budg-ets use a mix of funds from different sources, but on average, about half the money they spend—from Delaware and the other 49 States—comes from the Federal Government. 
We have missed another opportunity 
to give our Nation’s economy a serious boost. This is a little bit of what I am talking about. This poster says: ‘‘Here’s why Congress needs to reau-thorize funding to rebuild America’s infrastructure.’’ Here are a few num-bers to keep in mind: 25 percent, 45 per-cent, and 65 percent. Twenty-five per-cent of our bridges require significant repair. Either that or they cannot han-
dle today’s traffic at all. Twenty-five percent. Forty-five percent of Ameri-cans lack access to transit. Forty-five percent. Sixty-five percent of Amer-ica’s roads are rated in less than good condition. Sixty-five percent. 
There is an outfit called the Amer-
ican Society of Civil Engineers. One of the things they do every year is to rate highways, roads, and bridges. They as-sign a grade. It could be an A. 
We have our pages here. They are 
here doing their school work while they are paging in the Senate, so they do double duty, but hopefully they are all getting A’s in their courses. Our roads, highways, and bridges do not re-ceive any A’s. They do not receive B’s. Hopefully our pages get B’s and better, but our roads, highways, and bridges do not. In fact, our roads, highways, and transit systems are earning a D. D is disappointing. D is degraded. D is dog-ged. And our Nation’s bridges earn a C- plus. Those aren’t grades that our pages would be proud of or that their parents would be proud of, and those certainly aren’t grades we should be proud of as a country. 
In the most recent World Economic 
Forum ranking, in less than a decade the United States has fallen from sev-enth overall in the quality of our transportation infrastructure. A dec-ade ago we were No. 7; today we are No. 18. In Billboard magazine, when they are rating the top record across the country—a record on the rise gets a vote. A No. 5 in the vote means it is heading up the charts. Ten years ago we were No. 7, and now, like a bullet, we are heading right the other way— from No. 7 to No. 18. We are heading in a very wrong direction. 
Here in this poster we can see that 
highways and transit spending as a share of GDP has not been going up. 
In 1962 John Kennedy was President 
and I was a junior in high school, just like you pages. In 1962 the share of GDP that we spent for highways and transit was right at 3 percent—right at 3 percent. Over time it started drop-ping. Around 1972, in the middle of the Vietnam war—I spent some time over-seas in Southeast Asia with my compadres—it dropped to 2 percent. We were trying to pay for guns and bullets. It really dropped rather steeply there, probably because of the war. What has gone on since 1972 is to trend down, down, and down, and now the number is somewhere between 1 and 1.5 percent. It has diminished by more than half since 1962. 
Let me mention a couple of other 
numbers. The infrastructure spending is only about 2.5 percent of GDP in the United States. Actually, it is only about 1.5 percent in the United States. What is that compared to? Compared to what? 
I have a friend, and when you ask 
him ‘‘How are you doing?’’ he says ‘‘Compared to what?’’ Well, how is the United States doing? Well, compared to what? We are at 1.5 percent—actually, a little less than that—of GDP for 
transportation infrastructure. Where are our Canadians up to the north? They are at 4 percent—more than twice the number we are. Australia, South Korea—where are they? They are at 5 percent, and 5 percent for most of Eu-rope. China is at 9 to 12 percent. They are spending 9 to 12 percent of their GDP on transportation and infrastruc-ture. We are spending 1.5 percent. That is not a good thing. That is not a good thing. 
The National Association of Manu-
facturers estimates that their invest-ments in roads and highways dropped significantly between 2003 and 2012. How significantly? By another 20 per-cent. 
To meet our country’s needs in ways 
that support American business and families, an outfit called McKinsey Global Institute—most of us have heard of the McKinsey Consulting Company, but they have an arm of their company called McKinsey Global Institute—estimates that we need to increase infrastructure investment by $150 billion annually through 2020 to catch up the backlog of projects that are badly needed—roads, highways, bridges, and transit. 
Our lack of transportation invest-
ment is hurting families, individuals, and businesses. There is an outfit down in Texas, Texas A&M, which is famous in recent years for their football teams, but they are also well known because every year they give us a re-port on congestion on the roads, high-ways, and bridges in the United States. They found that the average commuter across the country wastes 42 hours per year in traffic—42 hours per year just sitting there or barely moving. If you actually look at cities such as New York City or Philadelphia or Dallas or Denver or L.A., that number is 82 hours per year. Think about that—82 hours per year here in the greater Wash-ington area and a lot of other places, such as L.A. and New York City. The resulting wasted fuel and lost produc-tivity cost the Nation’s economy $160 billion this year—$160 billion. That works out to about $960 per commuter. 
In addition to congestion, we have 
other costs to commuters—people out on the roads, highways, and bridges— that come from our repairs. 
Not everybody can see this, but obvi-
ously there is a guy working on pot-holes and talking to his supervisor. It says: Warning, potholes. But here is the number that is really the key: There is $516 per driver in increased re-pair and maintenance costs every year. 
There was an editorial in the Phila-
delphia Inquirer last week, talking to consumers and voters, that said: The next time you get a bill for replacing your tires, your steering, your rims or whatever, send the bill to your Con-gressman, your Congresswoman, your Senator. 
Even if it is only half of that, it is 
still a lot of money. I don’t have reason to believe it is half, but even if it is, it

is a huge amount of money that we are 
spending. Add to that the waste of time, and this adds up. 
This is a sad commentary. Some of 
the charts I use are humorous; this one is not. Poor roadway conditions were a significant factor in approximately one-third of the 32,000 traffic fatalities last year. About 10,000 people who would be alive today are not. The pri-mary contributing factor to their death was the poor condition of the 
highways, roads, and bridges on which they were traveling. 
I mentioned the McKinsey Global In-
stitute a minute ago. They said that if we were serious about making real progress and doing it promptly on the condition of roads, highways, bridges, and transit systems, we ought to be in-vesting about $150 billion a year. Here is another report from the McKinsey Global Institute. It says that about a $150 to $180 billion in annual invest-ment is needed for 15 to 20 years. That is a lot of money for a long time. They say that if we are serious and con-sistent in robustly investing in trans-portation infrastructure, we would add to GDP, not once but every year, some-where between 1.4 percent and 1.7 per-cent per year, and we would add about 1.8 million jobs if we are willing to make the kind of investments that we need. Those aren’t my numbers. Those are McKinsey’s. 
Put it all together, and this explains 
why Senator D
ICKDURBIN and I intro-
duced a month or so ago what we call the TRAFFIC Relief Act. It raises about $220 billion in new money, user fee revenue—revenue that can only be used for roads, highways, transit, and bridges, and not for anything else—not for foreign aid, not for wars, not for some other domestic program. But $220 billion would go into roads, highways, bridges, and transit systems. 
The legislation Senator D
URBIN and I 
introduced permanently eliminates the annual highway trust fund shortfalls. Every year we run out of money. We run out of money in the transportation trust fund and take money out of the general fund to fill up the transpor-tation trust fund. When the general fund runs out of money, we go around the world cup-in-hand borrowing money from people such as China to re-fill the transportation trust fund. Then, when we call China on their mis-behavior—it might be manipulation, it might be dumping various goods and services on our country, it might be messing around in the South China Sea and other places—we say to them: You can’t do that. 
If I were them, I would say to us: We 
thought you wanted to borrow our money. We shouldn’t be in that posi-tion. So the TRAFFIC Relief Act Sen-ator D
URBIN and I introduced raises an 
additional $72 billion over 10 years for new transportation investments, over and above what would otherwise be generated. We could use that $72 billion and more. 
Not everybody can read the script 
here, but this one fellow here is saying: ‘‘There is no way I can afford an in-
crease in the gas tax.’’ Then over here it goes on to say, as his car is towed away: ‘‘I spend all my money fixing my car because of these terrible roads.’’ Think about that. There are a lot of terrible roads, highways, and bridges, and some pretty lousy transit systems as well. I spent money on my minivan 
last year replacing a tire that cost me about $200 because of a problem with the road. I am not the only person. That happens to a lot of folks during the course of the year. 
Those are all the posters I have. I 
will close by saying that on the Envi-ronmental and Public Works Com-mittee, where I serve, we have reported out unanimously authorizing legisla-tion that would authorize investments in transportation systems—roads, bridges, highways, and transits—for the next 6 years. It is actually very smart legislation. I give Senator B
OXER  
and Senator I NHOFE , the lead Democrat 
and the lead Republican on the com-mittee, a lot of credit for leading that effort. 
The House of Representatives is com-
ing up with a 6-year transportation au-thorization plan that reflects in many ways what we have done in the Senate. To the extent that is the case, then we applaud their efforts as well. 
Some may remember another poster 
I showed earlier, an enlarged photo-graph of a fellow wearing a cowboy hat as if he were asleep on his back. The cowboy hat was covering his face. He didn’t look like the ‘‘Marlboro Man.’’ He looked like a cowboy who had been ridden hard and put up wet. The cap-tion at the bottom of the poster was talking about the hat: ‘‘All hat, no cat-tle,’’ suggesting the guy wasn’t a real cowboy. ‘‘All hat, no cattle.’’ 
It is great that we have sound, smart 
transportation authorization legisla-tion, and we do. What is really dis-appointing is ‘‘all hat and no cattle’’ when it comes to paying for this stuff, not coming close to the amount of money we need to invest. We are not even close. I think we are going to look at a 6-year transportation authoriza-tion with maybe 3 years of funding. Some of that funding we create by bor-rowing and spending, which is like 8, 9, 10 years down the road and bringing it forward to pay for spending today. I don’t feel good about that. I expect you don’t either. In some cases we are tak-ing money that is supposedly being col-lected for TSA, for aviation safety and our security in the skies, and using that money for roads, highways, bridges—taking TSA funding increases and using it for a couple of months on roads, highways, bridges, and improve-ments. We do the same thing with Cus-toms fees along our border. People and a lot of commerce come across our bor-der. Another idea we have used in the past is taking money out of the Stra-tegic Petroleum Reserve, maybe from oil we bought for $80, $90 a barrel and turning around and selling it for half that price. Buy high and sell low—I don’t think that is a very smart strat-
egy for investing in or for funding transportation projects. The American people deserve better than this. 
Ronald Reagan, Eisenhower, and oth-
ers—even Democrats—have said that the way we have funded transportation for years in this country and improve-ments to transportation—roads, high-ways, bridges—is a user approach. The folks and the businesses that use our roads, highways, and bridges ought to pay for it. That is what we have done. We have come to a place in this coun-try where we are finding it hard to pay for the things we need and the things we want. Somehow we have to summon the courage to do what the American 
people expect us to do, which is to work together, to work smartly, and to make some tough decisions. 
The legislation I alluded to that Sen-
ator D
URBIN and I and another col-
league or two have introduced and sponsored would raise the gas tax and diesel tax in this country. It hasn’t been raised in 22 years. The gas tax, which 22 years ago was raised to 18 cents, because of inflation is now worth less than a dime. The diesel tax, which 22 years ago was worth about 23 cents, is now not even worth 15 cents. Mean-while, the cost of concrete, asphalt, steel, and labor have all gone up, and we are still stuck with the same pur-chasing power from these user fees that we had 22 years ago. The math doesn’t add up. As a result, we earn nearly fail-ing grades for the transportation sys-tem that we have. 
If we were to somehow wave a magic 
wand and the House and the Senate would come to their senses and pass by acclamation an increase in the user fee of 4 cents a year for 4 years, we would get to 2020 and we would have added 16 cents over that period of time to what is one of the lowest user fees on gas and diesel of any advanced nation in the world. I think we are No. 33 out of 34 of the OECD nations. In 2020, after an increase of 4 cents a year for 4 years was put in place, the cost to the aver-age driver is the cost of a cup of coffee a week. Think about it. For the aver-age driver paying an additional user fee of 4 cents a year for 4 years, indexing for inflation, the cost is the cost of a cup of coffee a week. 
The question I would ask my col-
leagues—and I think we would ask most people—is this: Would you rather put up with really—one of my favorite, good senatorial words—‘‘crappy’’ roads, highways, bridges? Would you rather continue to put up with that? 
We could have a transportation sys-
tem that we could be proud of for a cup of coffee. I don’t think that is asking too much. 
I don’t have a magic wand. I don’t 
think it is likely that my colleagues will rush to the floor after these re-marks today and say: Let’s do some-thing real. Let’s see if we can’t get our roads, highways, and bridges making the kinds of grades that our pages are making doing their schoolwork while they serve us here in the Senate.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7632 October 29, 2015 
In the Bible there is a parable where 
some seeds were sown on the hard ground and never bore fruit. Some came up for a little while and raised up some plants but then died away in the hot sun. But others took root and grew a hundredfold. I am going to keep sow-ing these seeds, and hopefully someday soon—sooner rather than later—some of these seeds will fall on fertile soil. 
Until then, I look forward to joining 
the Presiding Officer on the floor to keep this up until you say ‘‘uncle’’ and then we will change places. 
I see my friend from Kansas—my 
many talented friend—here with our friend from Nebraska. I am tempted to wait and see what they have to say. 
I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, in the 
morning we will vote on a budget agreement and I will vote no. I think it is useful and important for my con-stituents to understand my thinking and the basis on which I reach that conclusion. 
In my mind, one of the most impor-
tant issues that we face in this country today is the fiscal condition of our country. The amount of debt that we incur and the amount of debt that we continue to incur is a significant drag on our economy, on job creation, and, in reality, on the American dream. 
It is an economic issue. At some 
point in time, if we don’t get our fiscal house in order, we will pay a signifi-cant price. We can either deal with this issue in a gradual, incremental way, in which we set ourselves on a path to right, or we can wait for the crisis to occur, which I have no doubt will hap-pen. 
While it is often said that this is an 
economic issue, and fiscal issues mat-ter to the country, I also would point out that this is not just an economic issue. It is a moral issue. The bor-rowing of money to pay for services and goods that the government pro-vides the American people is a selfish circumstance in which we take the so- called benefits of government programs today and expect future generations of Americans to pay for those benefits. It is wrong economically for us to con-tinue down the path of fiscal irrespon-sibility, but it is also morally wrong to expect someone else to pay for the so- called benefits we receive today. 
As to this issue today, this Bipar-
tisan Budget Act—this bipartisan ef-fort to resolve the circumstance we find ourselves in because we face a debt limit problem—the problem is that if we don’t do something, then we reach the debt limit. There are those who will argue that the consequences of not raising the debt ceiling are so dra-matic, so damaging that we need to do that regardless of the fiscal con-sequences of doing so. 
I come down on the side of fiscal re-
sponsibility, and I want to explain why. I want Kansans to know how I think about this issue. In fact, one of the first letters I ever wrote to Presi-
dent Obama as a new U.S. Senator, March of 2011, was an explanation to the President that he needed to work with Congress, and I offered to work with the President and the administra-tion and my colleagues in the Congress and the Senate to see if we couldn’t find a solution so that when we raised the debt ceiling, we actually did some-thing that would change the course, the path of spending we are on. 
I explained to Kansans, by publishing 
that letter and explaining my com-ments in the letter to the President, what I believed was important, most important. Unfortunately, since 2011 we are no more on a course of fiscal sanity than we were when I wrote the letter to the President. 
Here is the point I want to make. If 
we give up the leverage, the oppor-tunity that this issue presents to us as Members of Congress, to force us to do things that we apparently don’t have the will, the courage, the political de-sire to do, how do we ever get it done? Again, I guess there will be editorial-ists—certainly across the country and perhaps a few in Kansas—who will say that we need to raise the debt ceiling because it is irresponsible not to. Isn’t it also true that it is irresponsible sim-ply to raise the debt ceiling every time we need it? If we don’t take advantage of the circumstance we are in to force ourselves to do the things that need to be done, we are irresponsible. 
I read a lot of history. For a few 
years I have studied our country as a private citizen, and I have been in-volved in the political process in Wash-ington in trying to resolve problems our country faces. Here is an observa-tion: Things have changed over time. It used to be a bipartisan desire, a bipar-tisan understanding that balancing the budget was important. One of things that has changed over time is there no longer seems to be the desire on the part of many in Congress—many don’t see it and in my view Democrats in particular don’t see deficits as a bad thing. We look the other way. 
Maybe in days gone by, when there 
was broad consensus from Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents that balancing the budget was some-thing that mattered, that reducing the debt at least over time was important, that when we incurred expenditures going to war that we paid for them, that was something that was generally believed across the country by the vast majority of Americans and by the vast majority of Members of Congress, re-gardless of what political party they associate with. 
That consensus, that drive, that in-
sistence that we do that no longer ex-ists, which highlights for me that the necessity of using this issue of whether the debt ceiling should be raised to de-termine what we should do about re-ducing spending, reducing the debt, fig-uring out what the balance is between taxes and expenditures is all the more important. If I had any faith that this Congress, 
this President were going to deal with the deficit, regardless of what hap-pened with the debt ceiling, then I wouldn’t be interested in using the debt ceiling as a tool to force change in behavior in Washington, DC, but unfor-tunately I have no faith that there are enough people here who care enough about the deficit to do something about it unless we are forced to do so. 
At the moment, the only tool I have 
is to insist we use this opportunity, in which we are requested to raise the debt ceiling, to change the course our country is on in regard to spending and deficits. Again, the argument may be by some it is irresponsible. In fact, I have heard so many times that all we are doing is authorizing the borrowing of money to pay for the things we have already encumbered. 
Wouldn’t it seem a better solution 
for us to quit encumbering over time rather than coming after the fact and saying let’s raise the debt ceiling? But the reality apparently is there is no will to do that. We can say it is irre-sponsible not to raise the debt ceiling. We can say we are only paying for the things we have already decided to spend money on, but if that is the only thing we say, we never take it to the necessary step of doing anything about the problem. 
It is irresponsible not to use this op-
portunity to force us to behave in ways that are good for the country today, that are economically solid and sound, that are morally correct. Borrowing money ad infinitum is not an option for this country under either economic or moral circumstances. 
It is irresponsible for us to once 
again decide we will try to solve this problem later. I have always thought that the most important political issue we face, the one that has been most im-portant to the country since I was elected to the Senate, was how do we make certain that the economy is growing, there are job opportunities, people feel secure in their employment, they have the opportunity to advance their careers, and they have the sense that they are saving for their kids’ education, that they are saving for their own retirement. This issue of the fiscal condition of our country inhibits the ability for that economic security to be available to Americans. 
I wish to conclude by saying we need 
to do what is responsible. What is re-sponsible is making certain we pay our way and that we don’t expect others to do so in the future. To only say that we have to reach this agreement in order to avoid greater challenges in our country is to walk away from some-thing that I think is a primary and im-portant responsibility of Congress and the President. It is unfortunate. 
In my time and service in the Senate, 
President Obama has been the Presi-dent, but I have seen no political will on the part of this administration to do anything about the long-term con-sequences of spending more money

than we have. That means we have no 
choice but to insist that something be done, and the only opportunity before us is this question of whether the debt ceiling should be raised without cor-responding reductions in spending. 
In my view, those reductions in 
spending take priority. It is important. Our primary responsibility as Amer-ican citizens, as an American citizen, not just as a U.S. Senator but all of us as American citizens—we have a re-sponsibility to do two things for the fu-ture of our country: protect and pre-serve the freedoms and liberties guar-anteed by our Constitution and make sure the American dream is alive and well so future Americans have the chance to pursue their dreams in this country. 
To continue to borrow money to put 
our country’s fiscal condition in jeop-ardy once again means we will have failed that responsibility because the spending and borrowing of money in-hibits our personal liberties and free-doms and reduces economic oppor-tunity, the American dream for all Americans. 
I will vote no. I yield the floor to the Senator from 
Nebraska.

EQUAL PAY  
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise 
to respond to the minority leader’s ear-lier comments today regarding equal pay. Pay discrimination is wrong. It is also illegal. Republicans and Demo-crats alike believe that violations of the Equal Pay Act and the Civil Rights Act should be punished to the full ex-tent of the law. 
Let me be crystal clear. The lack of 
consensus on proposals like the Pay-check Fairness Act does not mean that Republicans do not support the prin-ciple of equal pay. I am tired of hearing that Republicans don’t have any new ideas on this issue. 
I have offered legislation, the Work-
place Advancement Act, which would prohibit retaliation against employees who discuss their wages. My proposal has a strong record of success, and un-like other proposals out there, it has bipartisan support. 
In April of 2014, before Republicans 
had the majority, I, along with Senator A
YOTTE , Senator C OLLINS , and Senator 
MURKOWSKI , offered an amendment to 
the Paycheck Fairness Act that would make it illegal to retaliate against em-ployees for seeking or sharing informa-tion on their wages. Unfortunately, that amendment was not considered. 
This March I offered a similar 
amendment to the budget that would reaffirm and strengthen equal pay laws and make it illegal to retaliate against employees for seeking or sharing infor-mation on their wages. This non-retaliation measure was adopted to the budget resolution with bipartisan sup-port. The legislative progress of my ef-forts to protect women in the work-place from retaliation for trying to en-sure fairness in pay suggests a clear bi-
partisan way forward in this Chamber. 
When women are fighting to be paid 
what they are worth, they need to know what they are up against. Knowl-edge is power, especially in the case of equal pay. Ensuring transparency will make it easier for workers to recognize pay discrimination and ensure that they are being paid fairly. How can workers negotiate for fair pay when they don’t know how their industry or their employer compensates other workers? How can a woman know that discrimination is taking place if she is prohibited from asking about what other workers are making? 
I want to empower women to be their 
own best advocates, secure in the knowledge that they have every tool available to them as they negotiate for the wages they deserve. It is time to remove this issue from our election- year politics. Let’s have a real con-versation about a substantive policy change that will improve the lives of all workers. I hope the Senate will soon consider my legislation because I be-lieve Republicans and Democrats can come together on this issue and we can make a real, needed difference in en-suring equal pay. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, prior to 
being elected to the U.S. Senate, I spent 28 years in business. When you are in business, you know you can’t keep spending more money than you are taking in or you go broke, you go out of business. I was elected to help get our country back on track and get the reckless spending and record debt of Washington, DC, under control. In fact, the very first bill I introduced in the U.S. Senate was the Balanced Budget Accountability Act. It is pretty simple. It requires that the Members of Congress pass a balanced budget or they don’t get paid. The people of Mon-tana deserve real solutions to address the failures of Washington, DC, not more budget gimmicks and backroom deals. In fact, Montana’s farmers will suffer because of this budget deal. The crop insurance program was gutted as a way to make this deal work. Where was the voice of Montana? Where was the voice of rural America as this backroom deal was cut? 
This deal takes our Nation in the 
wrong direction, and that is why I am voting no. This budget deal would in-crease our spending by $117 billion over the next 2 years and raise the debt limit through 2017. How big are these numbers? We are currently at about $18.1 trillion of debt. By the end of this 2-year agreement, sometime in 2017, we will be above $19 trillion. How big is 1 trillion? Do you know how long it takes to count to 1 million? If we were to count to 1 million 1 digit per second, 24 by 7, it takes less than 30 days to count to 1 million. 
How long does it take to count to 1 
billion? To count to 1 billion would take 32 years. Then the question is, 
How long would it take to count to 1 trillion? We are throwing around these numbers without much sense of how big they truly are when we are talking about $18 trillion—and soon to be $19 trillion—worth of debt. How long would it take to count to $1 trillion? It would take 32,000 years. 
It is irresponsible for Washington to 
increase the limit on the Nation’s cred-it card while at the same time busting the budget and increasing government spending with the false promise of far- off savings and new revenues that will never materialize. It is time that Washington, DC, takes a page out of Montana’s playbook and stops spending more than we are taking in. It is time for commonsense solutions that pro-tect the taxpayer and make elected of-ficials accountable for delivering re-sults to the people they serve because Americans deserve a thoughtful and open discussion, not one with back-room deals, about how to best support the Nation’s priorities while also cut-ting wasteful spending and reining in this national debt. The current budget fails to provide a more secure future for the next generation of Montanans. 
I thank the Presiding Officer and 
yield back my time.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY  
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, back 
in August several western States and Indian tribes suffered an enormous en-vironmental disaster. It has been called the Gold King Mine spill. In this dis-aster, the Environmental Protection Agency spilled 3 million gallons of toxic wastewater into a tributary of the Animas River in Colorado. This plume of toxic waste threatened people in Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah. It stretched to the land of the Navajo Na-tion and the southern Ute Indian Tribes. 
Last month, I chaired a hearing of 
the Indian Affairs Committee that looked at the spill. The EPA was there to testify. The EPA claimed that it was taking full responsibility, and then it did everything it could to deflect ac-tual blame. They said they were taking full responsibility; then they did every-thing they could to deflect actual blame. 
The agency administrator actually 
told our committee that this spill was inevitable. She said it was ‘‘inevi-table.’’ Does that sound like someone who is actually taking full responsi-bility? 
Well, last week we got the results of 
the investigation by the Department of Interior about what actually happened at the Gold King Mine. On Friday the Washington Post reported: ‘‘EPA gets blame for mine spill into rivers.’’ Well, according to this report, the EPA’s crew didn’t take engineering into ac-count when it was working on the mine. It didn’t take engineering into account. The agency didn’t understand that waters in these mines, according

to the report, ‘‘can create hydraulic 
forces similar to a dam.’’ How could the experts from the EPA, the U.S. Government’s Environmental Protec-tion Agency, not know that? The re-port also said that ‘‘the conditions and actions that led to the Gold King Mine incident are not isolated or unique, and in fact are surprisingly prevalent.’’ 
Remember, the EPA said it was inev-
itable. This spill was inevitable only because the EPA is so inept, so neg-ligent, and so incompetent that it was inevitable the agency would cause a disaster like this someday, and now they have. It is inevitable that the agency is going to keep making the same mistakes unless something changes at this irresponsible, incom-petent agency. 
What has changed? It has been al-
most 3 months since this disaster hap-pened. The Environmental Protection Agency has not named a single person whom it is holding responsible for poi-soning the river. If the EPA’s incom-petence is ‘‘surprisingly prevalent,’’ as the investigation found, you would think that this agency should be trying to get its house in order before it takes on new jobs. That is not what the Obama administration is doing. Oh, no, it is not slowing down at all. It is not slowing down in its quest for power or in finding more ways that it can con-trol what people do. 
On Friday, the Obama administra-
tion published the final rule for what it calls its Clean Power Plan. This regula-tion would create more Washington control over how electricity is pro-duced across the country. That very same day 26 States, including mine and that of the President’s, filed lawsuits in Federal court to stop this disastrous rule. These States say that the Envi-ronmental Protection Agency went far beyond anything that the law allows and far beyond anything Congress ever intended. I completely agree. This rule is too expensive, it is too extensive, and it is too extreme. 
The EPA does have a job to do, and it 
is failing dramatically at its job. In-stead of going back to basics and doing its job right, the EPA wants more power, more control, and less account-ability. This so-called Clean Power Plan will cost billions of dollars. Ac-cording to one estimate, it will destroy the jobs of more than 125,000 Ameri-cans. None of that seems to matter to the President of the United States or his administration and the EPA. They are driven by ideology, not by the facts, and their ideology is driven by their desire for more control. That is why it is so urgent that we focus our attention on all of the ways this Wash-ington bureaucracy is trying to re-strict people’s freedom and take more control for themselves. 
The Obama administration isn’t even 
satisfied telling States how to get their energy. Now the Obama administration wants to be involved in making these decisions for the whole world. It is try-ing to negotiate a climate change trea-ty that will impose broad new limits on 
American energy. This treaty will also do incredible damage to the American economy. At the same time, the admin-istration wants to pay billions of American taxpayer dollars—hard- earned dollars—to other countries. In return for these other countries adopt-ing green energy sources like solar panels, the Obama administration will help prop up their economies, not at their expense but at America’s expense. It wants to do all of this behind closed doors without any oversight from Con-gress or the American people. 
The administration wants to make 
sure that nobody can do anything to stop it until after it is too late. It wants to tie the hands of the American economy, dole out billions of taxpayer dollars, and not even ask the American people if that is what they want. The U.S. Congress cannot stand for that. It is the wrong choice for America, and it is the wrong choice for the rest of the world as well. 
There was an op-ed in the Wall Street 
Journal last Thursday by Bjorn Lomborg. He is the director of a non-partisan international group called the Copenhagen Consensus Center. The headline is ‘‘This Child Doesn’t Need a Solar Panel.’’ It has a photo of a child in a slum in Mozambique. The author points out that the Obama administra-tion is wrongly focused on the kind of climate change payoff that the Presi-dent is promoting. 
In the op-ed he writes: 
This effectively means telling the world’s 
worst-off people, suffering from tuberculosis, malaria, or malnutrition, that what they really need isn’t medicine, mosquito nets, or micronutrients, but a solar panel. It is ter-rible news. 
He goes on: 
In a world in which malnourishment con-
tinues to claim at least 1.4 million children’s lives each year, 1.2 billion people live in ex-treme poverty, and 2.6 billion lack clean drinking water and sanitation, this growing emphasis on climate aid is immoral. 
That is the assessment coming out of 
the Copenhagen Consensus Center. The President’s actions are immoral. There are some very real dangers facing the United States and other countries today, such as the threat from global terrorists and from countries like Rus-sia, Iran, and North Korea. There are desperate humanitarian crises around the world. That is where the Obama ad-ministration should focus its foreign policy. 
Here at home, the EPA should be 
cleaning up the environment, not poi-soning America’s rivers and lakes. Until the Obama administration gets its priorities straight, Congress will have to act to stop it. 
Republicans have introduced legisla-
tion to block some of the administra-tion’s most egregious new rules. Sen-ator E
RNST has filed a resolution 
against the so-called waters of the United States or the WOTUS rule. I have introduced legislation to replace the WOTUS rule with one that actually protects waterways while preventing 
Washington’s takeover of nonnavigable waterways. Senator M
CCONNELL and 
Senator C APITO have filed resolutions 
against the extreme limits on power-plants. Senator F
LAKE has filed one on 
the burdensome new ozone standard. 
We are going to keep a spotlight on 
this administration as it negotiates this new climate change treaty. We are going to stop it from committing this country to another bad deal—and the rest of us will be paying for that bad deal long after President Obama is out of office. 
Congress is going to hold the Obama 
administration accountable—account-able—and rein in the Washington bu-reaucrats before they do additional damage. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I rise to 
express concern about the budget deal that seems to have been reached that we will vote on later today or tomor-row morning. 
This Senator has a broader concern 
that we simply aren’t cutting spending and that we aren’t holding to the budg-et agreements we made. What we are doing here is getting rid of or extend-ing the budget caps on the budget con-trol agreement, spending about $80 bil-lion more than we would have other-wise. 
We have told ourselves that we have 
offset this spending. Here is my con-cern. It is clear that we haven’t. Some of the so-called offsets are simple budg-et gimmicks. Many have been tried and true in the past, such as just extending the sequester a little longer. One that is of particular concern was raised ear-lier today. There is in this budget agreement a modest crop insurance savings provision. In farm bills over the past few years, we have tried to rein in some of the massive subsidies and waste that have gone on in terms of direct payments and some of the other methods. A lot of that funding has gone toward crop insurance, and it is quite a generous program. In fact, the taxpayer subsidizes crop insurance on average of I think about 70 percent. Seventy percent of the premium is paid for by the taxpayers. 
What we are doing in this agreement 
or what we have tried to do in previous farm bills is say that the savings—if we reform these programs through so- called standard reinsurance agree-ments, or SRAs, if we realize some sav-ings, than we plow those savings into the deficit or against the deficit. But what came out of the last farm bill was a provision that said if there are any

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7635 October 29, 2015 
savings in this program, they have to 
stay within the program. 
Now, we don’t have that type of pro-
vision in just about any other program of government, where if you realize some savings by reform, you have to spend those savings on the program itself, just in another way. That doesn’t save the taxpayer any money overall. 
In this case, we have tried to get 
those savings, but the farm bill said no, it had to be plowed back into the pro-gram. So the reform that was agreed to in this budget deal was to do what we had been trying to do—to make sure that any savings that result from a standard reinsurance agreement be plowed into or be put against the def-icit to actually save some money. 
There is also a small provision which 
set a target rate for crop insurance companies at 8.9 percent rather than the 14.5 percent that it is currently at now. Opponents of this deal are saying that this minor change will gut crop insurance. I don’t think that is true at all. Crop insurance is far from a suf-fering industry. It is a significant driv-er of the cost of our Nation’s farm pro-gram. 
Government costs for crop insurance 
have increased substantially over the decades. In fact, after ranging from $2.1 billion to $3.9 billion during fiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2007, costs rose to a total of $14.1 billion by fiscal year 2012. In fiscal year 2013, the total costs were $6 billion, and in fiscal year 2014, $8.7 billion. Taxpayers are footing about 70 percent of the total costs of the pro-gram and 60 percent of all premiums paid. 
This change would not impact the 
coverage that is received; it would sim-ply trim some of the profits. Some say that will drive crop insurance out of business. I don’t think so. There isn’t a crisis here when taxpayers are footing 60 percent of the premiums and 70 per-cent of the overall cost of the program. Typically, it is the type of program the private sector would like to get into. If there is a problem with people fleeing the program, it hasn’t been dem-onstrated. This is not an industry under siege; it is a industry which has seen dramatic expansion and which now faces a slight trimming of its prof-its. Yet we are saying that we can’t stand it. What we are saying is that we are going to undo that deal as part of the budget deal before we even vote on the budget deal. 
Earlier today on the floor, there was 
an agreement reached with the appro-priators in the form of a colloquy that in the omnibus coming up in a couple of weeks, we would remove that provi-sion, that savings of some $4 billion or $8 billion would simply be made up somehow by extending the sequester. 
This reminds me of the last budget 
agreement we had, the Ryan-Murray budget, where there was a provision to very slightly adjust the cost-of-living increase for Active-Duty military re-tirees. This is something that the mili-tary actually asked us to do because 
they wanted to take a portion of the savings and put them into other areas of the military, but also it would real-ize a savings for us. This was a small adjustment for just Active-Duty mili-tary retirees who retired before the age of 62. If they made it all the way to 62, they could recover all the savings that were there for the COLA adjustment. 
Three months after the agreement, 
because of lobbying by one particular small subset of those receiving these benefits, we reversed that change. Just 3 months after we signed the deal, we reversed part of the deal. 
In this case, what we are doing with 
the Crop Insurance Program is we are not even waiting 3 months after the deal. We are not having a separate vote. 
That vote, by the way, was 97 to 3 to 
reverse it, just because of some lob-bying against it. I was one of the three opposed to reversing the program for the slight cuts. 
But in this case, the Crop Insurance 
Program in this budget deal, we aren’t even waiting until the ink is dry. In fact, we aren’t even waiting until the ink is applied to the paper signing this deal. We are reversing this change be-fore we even pass the deal. We are agreeing that in the omnibus in a cou-ple of weeks, we are going to reverse these savings, we are going to reverse these offsets. 
I had a lot of problems with this 
budget deal prior to today, but the more I look at this and the more I learn, I don’t know how we can vote for this deal. 
I don’t know when we are going to 
get serious about our deficit and our overall debt. If we can’t do it now, when will we do it? If we can’t get seri-ous now, when are we going to get seri-ous? If we have a budget agreement with the BCA now and we can’t stick to it now, what makes us think we are going to in the future? 
It makes me think, if we are revers-
ing changes we made to get some sav-ings before we even have the deal signed, what are we going to do a month after? What are we going to do in the next month? Are there other provisions in the other so-called offsets that we are going to address and say: We did not really mean it; we are going to reverse that as well. 
It is very discouraging to see what is 
happening with the budget. We cannot continue to simply spend, spend, and spend and just ignore the real offsets that are needed. I would have been fine with spending additional money on 
nondefense discretionary if we had been serious about going into entitle-ment spending and the mandatory spending and finding real savings, sav-ings that were significant. We have a couple of reaches into mandatory spending but not significant reaches. Who knows whether they will last or whether we will reverse them as well in a couple of months. 
This is very discouraging. I will vote 
against this, and I would encourage my colleagues to vote against this agree-
ment as well. 
I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise 
this afternoon in strong opposition to the 2-year budget agreement before the Senate. This so-called budget deal was negotiated at the last minute. It is now being rushed through Congress with in-adequate time for proper scrutiny. While the devil is typically in the de-tails when Congress negotiates these eleventh-hour deals, the flaws in this agreement are evident from merely taking a glance at what is in it. 
This budget agreement would in-
crease the current Budget Control Act spending caps, which we enacted in 2011 in an effort to restrain Washington spending, by approximately $80 billion or more over the next 2 years. On top of raising the caps by $80 billion or more, this deal also adds $32 billion in additional spending totals. That is $112 billion in new spending over the next 2 
years—yes, $112 billion in new spending over the next 2 years. 
Not only would this agreement allow 
for increased spending, it would also raise the debt ceiling through March of 2017—yes, through March of 2017— where we can borrow more money, add-ing an estimated $1.5 trillion of bor-rowing. 
President Obama has continually 
called for more government spending and a blank check, to raise our Na-tion’s debt limit with no corresponding reforms or spending cuts. The deal be-fore us today represents a victory for President Obama and his liberal allies, not for the American people. As long as Washington continues to spend far be-yond its means and remain on the same unsustainable track, our economy will suffer. 
While I believe we should safeguard 
the full faith and credit of the United States, I also believe we should do so in a manner that puts our Nation on a more responsible fiscal path. We can-not—I repeat, we cannot continue to raise the debt limit without taking re-sponsible steps to tackle the under-lying problems facing our Nation: wasteful government spending. 
Taking on more debt to facilitate 
more government spending is not the answer and is simply unacceptable. 
Hard-working Americans in Alabama 
and across the country are looking for Washington to have serious conversa-tions about how to tackle our coun-try’s $18 trillion debt that is growing. Instead, this deal before us continues the never-ending cycle of bad policies that grow our bloated government, im-pede job growth, and perpetuate a stag-nant economic recovery.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7636 October 29, 2015 
I believe our constituents deserve 
better than a last-minute, flawed budg-et deal that not only exacerbates our debt crisis, but it adds more and more to our children’s debt. There is abso-lutely no excuse for continuing to in-crease our Nation’s debt. Americans are frustrated that Congress continues to push policies that empower Wash-ington instead of the people of this great country. This deal is more of the same. Borrow more, spend more, be ac-countable less and less. That is why I adamantly oppose this budget deal and will continue to fight for a smaller, more effective government that puts the American people first. 
I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I come 
to bring a very important subject to the attention of my colleagues. 
‘‘Sequestration’’ is just a fancy word 
for cuts, mindless cuts. That is why I have always opposed sequestration. This thoughtless, across-the-board ap-proach to the Federal budget has harmed States across the country, but its effect on Massachusetts has been disproportionate. 
Sequestration significantly reduced 
Federal research and development funding for science and medicine. That is Massachusetts. Investments in those fields are critical to our economy with its world-class universities, medical centers, industry-leading bio- and high- tech companies, and clean-tech indus-tries exploding with new technologies. This is the future of our country. This is the future of the 21st century. This is what we must be investing in: research and technology, research and science. 
I am pleased that for the next 2 years 
this budget agreement will give us des-perately needed relief from sequestra-tion and will extend the debt limit. This legislation will also protect vul-nerable Americans who rely on Medi-care and Social Security. It will ensure that for the next 7 years, millions who depend on the Social Security dis-ability program do not face a benefit cut. The legislation will also help mil-lions of seniors by avoiding a Gronk- like spike in Medicare premiums. But this bill comes with a price: more un-wanted calls and texts to Americans. 
Back in 1991, consumers were con-
stantly harassed by unwanted tele-marketing phone calls that interrupted their family dinners. In 1991, my bill, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, stopped these intrusive and un-wanted calls from telemarketers. 
Yes, this budget being debated today 
actually makes it easier to harass con-sumers on their mobile phones. That is wrong, just plain wrong. Current law contains important safeguards against 
abusive practices. Before a caller can make autodialed or prerecorded calls or send texts, that caller must have the consent of whoever is being called. 
Section 301 of this legislation before 
this body today removes that precall consent requirement if someone is col-lecting debt owed to the Federal Gov-ernment. The provision opens the door to potentially unwanted robocalls and texts to the cell phones of anyone with a student loan or a mortgage, calls to the cell phones of delinquent tax-payers, calls to farmers, to veterans, or to anyone with debt backed by the Fed-eral Government. 
That is why, once the Senate takes 
action on this budget bill, I plan to file a bill that strikes that provision. I also intend to ask the majority leader for a vote on my bill at the earliest possible time. We must protect American stu-dents and consumers. 
That rollback of protections against 
abusive telemarketers is not the only problem with this legislation. The bill also would sell off part of our Nation’s oil stockpile simply to raise revenue. The Presiding Officer is an expert in this area. Our Strategic Petroleum Re-serve is there to protect American con-sumers and our security in the event of an emergency, but now it is increas-ingly viewed as a piggy bank to fund other priorities. 
If we are going to sell oil from our 
strategic reserve, we should at least do so strategically to get the best deal for our taxpayers, but the budget deal that we are considering would require the sale of a specific amount of oil each year from 2018 to 2025 regardless of its price. 
When the majority attempted to use 
similar Strategic Petroleum Reserve sales to fund the highway bill, Senator C
ASSIDY of Louisiana and I authored a 
bipartisan amendment to fix the prob-lem. Our commonsense amendment gave the Secretary of Energy flexi-bility to sell more oil when prices are high and thereby maximize the return for taxpayers. 
Unfortunately, that bipartisan fix is 
not part of this legislation, but I will continue to work with Senator C
ASSIDY  
on this important issue. You know that we are right when a conservative Re-publican from Louisiana and a liberal Democrat from Massachusetts agree on an issue. It is foolish to buy high and sell low. That is essentially what this legislation is now mandating. 
Rather than saying to the govern-
ment that you have to find just the right time when the price of oil is high to sell it over the next 7 years, it says sell it on this schedule regardless of whether or not you are going to get a good return on your investment. That is not the way this government should be operated. We should be using some common sense, especially since the Senator from Louisiana and I had al-ready drafted the legislation and had already attached it to the Transpor-tation bill when that was going to be the place where they use the Strategic 
Petroleum Reserve money. 
This is a very bad provision that is in 
a bill which is going to pass—and it should pass—but this is a flaw. It is going to lose a lot of money if it con-tinues on with the language that is in this bill. 
I am going to continue to work with 
the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Louisiana, so that we can correct it. It will save a lot of money if we do it the correct way. 
We need to ensure that we have a ra-
tional approach to budgeting—unlike sequestration—which will finally allow us to get back to the business of legis-lating instead of lurching from crisis to crisis. That is not possible unless we begin a new era in this institution. Hopefully, that is what today and per-haps tomorrow will represent. Maybe we can work together again across the aisle the way I think all Americans want us to. I pledge to work on these two pieces of legislation going forward to correct real flaws that are built into this legislation. 
Thank you for allowing me to have 
the floor at this time. I hope the Pre-siding Officer and I can partner to cor-rect at least one of the problems in this bill. 
I yield back the remainder of my 
time. 
Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, before we 
move to a vote on the Bipartisan Budg-et Act of 2015, I want to take a moment to discuss the part of the bill that is in-tended to be an offset for partially lift-ing the budget caps established under the Budget Control Act. 
Under current law, large partnerships 
are subject to a special set of tax pro-cedural rules. They are known as the TEFRA partnership rules because they were included in the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982. 
These rules are complex and 
unwieldly for both the taxpayers and the Internal Revenue Service. Most tax experts agree that these rules are in bad need of reform. I agree. 
The Treasury Department, former 
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp, and Congress-man J
IMRENACCI have all put forward 
reforms of the TEFRA partnership rules. And, on the Senate Finance Committee, we have been looking at those reforms and other proposals as well. We have also held discussions with the Ways and Means Committee, as well as tax professionals and mem-bers of the business community. These efforts, so far, have been bipartisan. 
Because any such reforms would have 
a significant impact on a large number of taxpayers, we were prepared to tack-le this problem the same way the Fi-nance Committee has dealt with other widely applicable tax compliance meas-ures. Specifically, we had planned to release various discussion drafts that would be open for public comment and subsequent modification. That is the way the Finance Committee handled issues like stock basis reporting and

merchant credit card reporting, and 
the process has worked well in the past. 
However, as these efforts were ongo-
ing, bipartisan leaders from both the House and Senate identified TEFRA partnership reforms as a potential off-set for this budget legislation. As per usual, the Finance Committee was con-sulted, and we provided assistance in drafting the offset language. I am pleased to say that many of our rec-ommendations were adopted in the final version of the bill. 
However, for those who might be con-
cerned about this process, it is impor-tant to note that the effective date for the TEFRA partnership reforms in the budget bill is delayed for 2 tax years. In the coming weeks and months, the Fi-nance Committee will treat the TEFRA partnership reforms as a work in process. As planned, we intend to hear comments and will be prepared to address issues raised by taxpayers, es-pecially those issues that may not have been anticipated. 
As an example, we have heard from 
stakeholders who were concerned that particular partner-level tax attributes that may be known by a partnership, such as certain passive losses under tax code section 469, should be identified in the legislation for purposes of modi-fying the so-called imputed under-payment amount with respect to the partnership. 
In sum, I want the record to be clear: 
The TEFRA partnership reforms are not effective for a couple of years. We plan to use that window to properly ad-dress problems raised by affected par-ties. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for 
months, Democrats have called on Re-publican leaders in both the Senate and the House to work with us to avert the economic crisis that default would have wrought on this country. With our backs against the wall, congres-sional leaders and the White House have reached an agreement to not only raise the debt ceiling—ensuring that our government can pay its bills—but to limit the devastating impacts of se-questration for the next 2 years. 
This agreement is far from perfect. 
This deal uses funding identified and supported by the Senate to extend the critical highway trust fund. The trust fund has limped along, one short-term extension after another, for far too long. Despite the progress made on ad-vancing a 6-year authorization, we will now have to move back to square one to find a way to pay for it. I am as con-cerned now as I was in July that we are stealing from ourselves by selling off strategic oil preserves at a time of low prices when we purchased at a time of high prices, and I am deeply concerned that this deal raids the Crime Victims Fund of $1.5 billion. Democrats and Re-publicans alike have long supported the Crime Victims Fund—unique in that it comes not from taxpayer dol-lars, but from penalties and fines paid by the criminals themselves. This fund was set up to be a dedicated resource to 
help victims of crime. Given the ongo-ing level of unmet need in that commu-nity, it is simply unacceptable that this fund was raided to pay for unre-lated things. This one-time rescission must not become a new precedent. We cannot turn our backs on the victims of crime. 
Nonetheless, I support the Bipartisan 
Budget Act. It is the product of com-promise that will offer a measure of stability and help pave the way for an omnibus appropriations bill to keep our government open past December 11. But this is only the first step. While we will avert a calamitous default next week, we now must undertake the dif-ficult process of crafting an omnibus spending bill that will meet our finan-cial obligations and properly invest our resources. We have come together— across the aisle and across Congress— to support this budget deal. Let’s not squander those bipartisan efforts in the next phase by derailing the appropria-tions process with needless partisan policy riders intended to do nothing more than score political points. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I would 
like to address a small but important aspect of the hospital outpatient policy that is included in the budget agree-ment. The legislation does not address what happens to outpatient depart-ments that are currently under con-struction. The bill allows current out-patient departments to continue to re-ceive the Medicare outpatient payment rate because hospitals rely on those payments. Hospitals that want to build new facilities in the future go in with ‘‘eyes open’’ because they know they will not receive the higher outpatient rate. But that is not the case for out-patient departments that are currently being constructed as we speak. These hospitals made the decision to build, understanding that these facilities would receive the outpatient rate— they had no idea that Congress would be voting on this policy as part of this bill at this exact time. Facilities under construction should be treated the same as current facilities. I think it is unfortunate that this was not ad-dressed when the bill was drafted, and I hope my colleagues will join me in ensuring this issue is addressed, either through regulations or through a tech-nical legislative fix. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I come to 
the floor today to voice my support for the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. This is a credible compromise that accom-plishes three key objectives: it pre-vents an economically catastrophic de-fault, establishes 2 years of rational budgets for defense and domestic prior-ities, and provides our military with the resources they need without an overreliance on the emergency war fund accounts. 
Specifically, the agreement takes the 
threat of default off the table until March 2017 and provides $80 billion in sequester relief over the next 2 years, evenly split between defense and do-mestic spending. Throughout this proc-
ess to reach a budget agreement, I have urged my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work together to find a bal-anced, responsible way to address de-fense and domestic spending—because they are both essential to the security and financial well-being of the Amer-ican people. And while this bill relies on emergency war fund accounts, it more accurately reflects the costs of our overseas military operations and provides the Department of Defense with some additional budgetary sta-bility and flexibility to plan for the fu-ture. With the sequester relief that the bill provides, we will have greater fis-cal certainty and the additional re-sources we need to maintain a strong defense and economy. 
The bill also contains offsets that im-
prove tax compliance among large partnerships and reforms federal crop insurance. These are the sorts of new revenue and spending cuts we should see more of instead of revenue and spending cuts that come off the backs of seniors and the middle class. 
Now, while I would prefer to elimi-
nate the sequester all together, this compromise sets an encouraging prece-dent for future sequester relief, which is balanced and allows the government to keep making investments in areas that spur economic growth like edu-cation, transportation, health care, and defense. And that is why it’s im-portant for the Senate and House Ap-propriations Committees to quickly reach a consensus and produce a de-tailed spending package before the ex-piration of the continuing resolution on December 11. 
I urge my colleagues to quickly ap-
prove this budget agreement and move on to a bill to fund the government. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I want to 
speak about the compromise budget legislation we are debating on the Sen-ate floor. This is a good deal that cov-ers so many important topics: seques-ter relief for defense and nondefense accounts, the debt limit, Medicare pre-miums, Social Security Disability In-surance, and many more items. These are all items the Senate needed to ad-dress, and I am happy to support this bipartisan budget accord. 
In my 3 years in the Senate, I have 
done everything I can to address the nonstrategic sequester cuts that have been hurting our national security and economy. When I was sworn into the Senate and put on the Budget Com-mittee, we were about to let go into ef-fect the arbitrary sequester cuts set forth in the Budget Control Act of 2011. So in 2013, we got to a bipartisan Mur-ray-Ryan budget deal. I supported that deal because it provided sequester re-lief for 2 years and gave certainty to businesses and families, teachers and shipbuilders, around the Common-wealth and Nation to plan for their needs. 
Since 2013, we have seen the uncer-
tainty presented by short-term budget deals and continuing resolutions has

actually been shown to harm the econ-
omy. In addition, the world is a very different place now than it was in 2011 when the Budget Control Act passed, and we need to adjust our budget poli-cies to respond to today’s challenges, from the rise of ISIL to increasing cyber attacks. 
The deal before the Senate today pro-
vides more than $100 billion in seques-ter relief over 2 years for both defense and nondefense accounts, which will provide much-needed certainty to Vir-ginia’s families while helping busi-nesses and the defense community bet-ter plan for the future. It also prevents certain Medicare beneficiaries from ex-periencing a significant increase in premiums next year and protects dis-abled Americans from a potential 20 percent reduction in benefits. It raises the debt ceiling, avoiding a default on our debt and disaster in financial mar-kets. The agreement is not perfect. But that is the nature of compromise. 
Everyone can find something in this 
bill they dislike, and that is usually the marker of an honest compromise. I wish we were able to fully replace se-questration and reach that long-term budget deal which would fully replace sequester cuts, make Medicare and So-cial Security solvent over the long term, and reform the Tax Code. But that budget deal will take time to ne-gotiate, and we face government debt default in less than a week. Given that reality, this compromise is a dramatic improvement over a government debt default, across-the-board budget cuts, and crisis budgeting. 
I especially applaud the fact that we 
will do a 2-year budget deal, just like we did when we reached the Murray- Ryan compromise in December 2013. Two-year budgets provide certainty, and that has a significant positive im-pact on the economy. I came to the Senate a strong supporter of 2-year budgeting due to my experience as Governor, and it is good to see others in Congress finally embracing this helpful reform. I support this budget compromise and look forward to mov-ing this bill to the President’s desk. 
Mr. MARKEY. I suggest the absence 
of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, peo-
ple in my home State are trying to fig-ure out what they missed on this budg-et deal. It was announced by the White House today that this is a great job- creating achievement, but all they see is more spending and no change in the status quo. 
Everyone throws around numbers, 
but here is the one number people in my State want to hear. How much does it save the American taxpayer? Put an-other way, does it help us to balance 
our budget or to address the debt prob-lem? 
We need two things to be able to bal-
ance our Federal budget: spending re-straint and a growing economy. Right now we have neither. We have $18.5 trillion in debt and over $430 billion in deficit in this year. To start paying down our debt, we have to first balance our budget. 
The Presiding Officer knows very 
well that we passed a budget earlier this year that took the next 10 years to be able to balance our budget. Let’s play pretend for a moment in this body. Let’s say we put that budget into place, and over the 10 years we work down a little bit each year and get to a balanced budget 10 years from now. Let’s take a guess in this body, and let’s say the year after that we had a $50 billion surplus. It took us 10 years to get back to balance, and in year 11 we had a $50 billion surplus. How many years would we have to maintain a $50 billion surplus until we paid off our debt? The correct answer would be: 360 years in a row we would have to have a $50 billion surplus to pay off our debt. We need to start doing budgets that ac-tually deal seriously with our debt and deficit. 
Today, our GDP growth was an-
nounced again. It is a whopping 1.5-per-cent growth in the American economy. With new regulations on every busi-ness, the assault on American energy, new loan restrictions on banks, and ObamaCare cost increases—including in my State of Oklahoma, where pre-mium increases are hitting 35 percent for next year on individuals—people know inherently that if you keep over-spending, it limits our economic growth in America. We have fewer jobs because of it. It is harder to start a business because of it. 
The President keeps saying if we will 
just spend a little more, we will have more jobs. But people don’t believe it anymore because they have seen it is not true. After 6 years of ‘‘if we just spend a little more, spend a little more, this will get caught up’’ we still have a 1.5-percent growth rate in the Amer-ican economy. That is pathetic. 
While we have a great number of ter-
rific people in the Federal workforce, people inherently know if you just keep adding jobs in the Federal work-force, it hurts our economy because it continues to take money out of private hands and puts it into government con-trol. What people want is not unreason-able. They just want a plan. People want to know that if we are going to spend money, we use it efficiently and that there is a plan to be able to get us out of debt. 
What we heard through the negotia-
tions was that any increase in spending would be offset with pay-fors that were real. The spending negotiations that were done were supposed to develop that plan. What we have as a final doc-ument is not a plan to get us out of debt. In fact, it increases our debt again. What we have is not a plan to 
handle the long-term consequences of deficit. In fact, it obfuscates that again. We need a plan to deal with enti-tlements, and what we have done is just scratched the surface dealing with entitlements. 
What I have heard over and over is 
that at least the pay-fors are real, that for any increased spending that was done, at least there were offsets for that. Let me give a couple of examples of these real pay-fors, as I read the bill. 
Here are a couple of real pay-fors. 
One is called pension payment accel-eration. This is listed as one of the real pay-fors in the document. Pension pay-ment acceleration in section 502 changed the due date for pension pre-miums from October 15, 2025, to Sep-tember 15, 2025, in order to get another $2.3 billion into the 10-year budget win-dow. 
You see, this is all laid out to say 
that in the next 10 years we will pay this off. So they took a payment that was due 10 years and 2 weeks from now and moved it forward a month. So lit-erally, yes, it adds $2.3 billion into the 10-year window, but if we had a 10-year- plus-2-week time period, it would be exactly the same. It is actually zero savings. It is not real. They moved the payment a month and said that is a pay-for. It is not a pay-for. That is the pension payment acceleration. 
How about this one? We have this one 
in the Federal Government called the Crime Victims Fund. The Crime Vic-tims Fund is money seized from crimi-nals and designated not for general use but to compensate the victims of crime—hence the name Crime Victims Fund. Apparently, this budget agree-ment qualifies as a victim of crime be-cause $1.5 billion is taken from the Crime Victims Fund and dedicated not to victims of crime but to spending in other areas. 
We literally take $1.5 billion out of 
the Crime Victims Fund and spend it on the EPA, the IRS, and silent Shake-speare festivals out there in Federal funding—so much for helping crime victims. 
We have 12 appropriations bills we 
have done in the Senate. It is the first time in a very long time that the Com-mittee on Appropriations has done all 12 appropriations bills through com-mittee. In this agreement, all 12 of those appropriations bills will have to be redone. Here is how they will be redone. The defense bill will be cut, and the other 11 will all go up in spending. The top of that debt ceiling is without reform. 
The final straw for me in looking at 
this deal is Social Security disability. The Presiding Officer knows full well I have worked for 3 years on Social Secu-rity disability reform, knowing that the day was coming when we would have to fix Social Security. 
The CBO has warned us for 4 years 
that Social Security disability would reach insolvency in 2016, so my office has spent the last 3 years preparing for

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7639 October 29, 2015 
how we could actually reform this pro-
gram to make sure we stabilize the So-cial Security disability program. I have interviewed individuals within the disability program—attorneys that work with it, Federal judges, adminis-trative law judges, representatives, So-cial Security staff in all of those cubi-cles across the Social Security Admin-istration offices, advocacy groups, par-ents of the disabled, and we held bipar-tisan hearings to look for common- ground solutions and worked with the inspector general and the GAO to hear other practical solutions they had dis-covered. We have a long list of real so-lutions to solving Social Security dis-ability for the disabled and for the tax-payer. We have submitted those solu-tions as an amendment to this bill be-cause there are real answers to solving Social Security disability, if you do the work. We have actually done the work to prepare for this. 
Instead, this budget bill renews a few 
demonstration programs, changes a few names, transfers some funds from re-tirement Social Security over to dis-ability Social Security, and calls it re-form. If you look at the way the actu-arial tables work out, of the 100 per-cent that needs to be done to bring sol-vency, they do 1.5 percent of what needs to be done to bring the program to solvency. The estimate is 1.5 percent of the 100 percent that needs to be done, and it is called real significant disability reform. I wish it were, be-cause it is desperately needed. 
Everyone knows this Congress only 
seems to do anything when they have to. A deadline is coming to deal with Social Security disability. This is the time we have to do the reforms. This opportunity will not come around again for 7 years, because this extends out this program for 7 years with al-most no reforms at all. We are missing our window. 
These are the most vulnerable indi-
viduals in our society who are on dis-ability. These are individuals who lit-erally cannot work in the economy in any way, and they need our help and they need real reform in this program, and we have punted. There is 1.5 per-cent of reform of the 100 percent that is needed to actually stabilize the pro-gram. 
What does real reform look like? It 
helps those stuck in the painful process of disability applications and gets them the help they need at the time they need it. Real reform helps with those who game the system to get out of the system. It gives clarity, account-ability, and oversight to the system itself. That is what real reform would look like. 
Let me give a couple of examples. 
The grid—it is called a vocational grid—which is used to determine if someone can work in the economy, has not been updated since 1978. It needs to be updated not just now but every 10 years in order to have a regular cycle of updating, and not every 40 years. But that is not required in this bill. We need to have good record keep-
ing—evidence for disability. That is not required in this bill. We need to have a standard to be able to rotate off disability and to bring some clarity to it. Right now it is medical improve-ment. The problem is there are no good records often for those individuals on disability. So there is no way to rotate off of it. An individual is permanently trapped in it because the records were 
so bad at the start. There is no change in that. 
What does that look like in real life? 
Let me give a couple of real-life exam-ples. In Puerto Rico, the Office of the U.S. Attorney accepted a case for pros-ecution about 4 years ago. The inspec-tor general initiated a Federal grand jury investigation, working closely with the Office of the U.S. Attorney, the FBI, and the Puerto Rico Police Department. In August of 2013, 74 indi-viduals, including 47 medical profes-sionals and a nonattorney claimant representative, were indicted and ar-rested for their involvement in a large- scale disability fraud scheme. 
On January 15, 2015, the U.S. Attor-
ney’s Office in Puerto Rico announced the indictments of an additional 40 in-dividuals, including a psychiatrist, for their alleged involvement in this con-spiracy when they undertook an early- morning arrest operation for those in-dividuals. All of these individuals were apprehended, and at the end they esti-mate the cost to the taxpayer is $100 million of fraud in that one case alone. 
In Huntington, WV, in May of this 
year, the Social Security Administra-tion mailed letters to approximately 1,500 individuals informing them of their need to redetermine their eligi-bility for Social Security disability— many of those individuals have been on disability for years—because the Social Security Administration and the In-spector General’s Office noted that many of these individuals were put on in a case that did not match facts with what actually happened in their lives. They were led to believe this by a rep-resentative, an attorney in this case, fraudulent work behind the scenes by physicians, and the inside work of indi-viduals within Social Security who tracked them through the process. What happened? There were hundreds of millions of dollars in fraud. 
These things still continue. Nothing 
changes on this. I wish this bill would correct some of these issues today, but it doesn’t. Those individuals were told by someone that they fit into the dis-abled category, only to find out later that they had also been defrauded in the system. 
There is nothing in this bill man-
dating the Social Security Administra-tion to update its medical and voca-tional listings. There is nothing in this bill to prevent people who receive un-employment insurance, who by defini-tion must be employable, from also re-ceiving disability insurance—people who by definition cannot also work. 
There is nothing in this bill to 
streamline the adjudication process or to eliminate the second level of appeal, 
which is called reconsideration. Many individuals within the process who are legitimately disabled and who just want to have their cases heard get stuck in this long process. There are actually more appeals in Social Secu-rity Administration, in the Social Se-curity disability program, than there are on death row, which puts people in this cycle of endless appeals, year after year, and continues to rack up the cost to the taxpayer and the effect on those who are disabled. 
There is nothing in this bill to ensure 
that a claimant’s medical record is well developed so that when they come up for a continuing disability review, a disability determination service exam-iner can make an informed judgment and actually evaluate whether they are medically improved. 
There is nothing in this bill to con-
duct oversight of the administrative law judges or claimants’ representa-tives. The bill increases the number of administrative law judges but not the oversight. I am not sure if many in this body are aware that some of the ad-ministrative law judges in this country have an overturn rate of 95 percent or higher, and we are adding more but not increasing the oversight. 
There is no opportunity given for 
greater accountability or even to im-prove the Code of Judicial Conduct—a basic element of reform that should be in this. 
As for the claimant representatives, 
according to the Social Security Ad-ministration’s Office of Inspector Gen-eral, in tax year 2013, the top 10 highest earning claimant representatives made $23 million. Remember that the pay-ment for the claimant representatives comes directly out of the money that should go to the disabled individual, not from another fund. It is from the individual who should have received that money as disability. So the more the reps make, the less tax money that actually gets to the disabled indi-vidual. There is no change in this model. It continues to provide funding for claimant representatives and attor-neys and continues to leave the dis-abled exposed. 
By the way, today in Social Security 
Administration offices all around the country, they are processing the money from the disabled and sending checks to the representatives because although the reps are hired by the dis-abled individual, they are paid and processed by the Federal workforce from the disabled person’s money. We can do better than this. We should do better than this. 
This is not a deal the American peo-
ple are looking for. This is not a budget agreement the people of Oklahoma say fixes our debt and deficit issues and stabilizes disability. This is a deal that is done, apparently, but not a deal that is done well. Based on where we are in debt and deficit, we need to do better, and I pray we do in the days ahead. We have much to get fixed. It is time to

actually fix some things, not just to 
stay operational. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to speak for an additional 5 min-utes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION  
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, 
there is a football coach in Washington State. He is the head coach of the JV team, and he is the assistant coach of the varsity football team. Tonight is the last game of the season for them, but he will not be coaching on the side-lines today because last night he was dismissed from his duties in Brem-erton, WA. According to the attorneys at the school, he was dismissed from his duties because last Friday night at the football game, he had the audacity to kneel down at the end of the game and silently pray at the 50-yard line when the game was over, when the school had instructed him that he was not to silently pray at the end of a game. 
Help me understand this. The night 
before the last game of the season, they kick the football coach off the field because he had the audacity to si-lently pray when they told him not to. 
To his defense, this is not brand new. 
Since 2008, this same coach, at the end of the games—each game—has had the habit of kneeling and praying at the 50- yard line after the kids have gone, after the game is over, to thank God for the safety of his kids. It is a habit he started 7 years ago, but for some reason the Bremerton School District has determined this is completely un-acceptable. Their perspective is that you can only have faith if no one sees it. They have literally set a new stand-ard. What they are taking from the Borden case, which I will explain in a moment—they are saying that if you are a school official, no one can see that you have faith because if anyone sees that you have faith, they will take that as the establishment of religion from the school district. That is a standard no court in America has set. That would mean any individual who is Jewish couldn’t wear a yarmulke if they were also a teacher. That would mean anyone who is Muslim couldn’t wear a head scarf because clearly that is a visual display of faith. That would mean no teacher could bow their head and pray before their meal in the school lunchroom. That would mean no football coach could kneel down with 5 seconds to go in the game in, the fourth quarter, before their 16-year-old is about to kick a field goal. They would say: No, you can’t kneel down and pray on the sidelines. 
The absurdity of this is they set this 
brandnew standard that says you can-not have anyone see you have faith. That would mean that in this situa-tion, this district has created a new legal standard that no one else has ever agreed to, literally created in the school district a faith-free zone, put up a sign on the front door that says ‘‘No one can express any type of faith in 
this building.’’ That is absurd. 
The school district quoted multiple 
times from the Borden case, which is the Borden v. School District of the Township of East Brunswick case. This is what the actual case was. It was a football coach who, before the game, at a mandatory meeting of the team, led them in a prayer. The only similarity here is prayer and football because this is not a mandatory meeting before the game; this is not a required closed time; this is an individual, after the game is over, kneeling down on his own and freely expressing his faith without requiring anyone else to be there, any-one to listen. This is an individual liv-ing their faith. That is free in America, whether you are Muslim, whether you are Wiccan, whether you are Hindu, whether you are Christian, whether you are Jewish, whether you are a Fed-eral employee or a State employee or a private citizen. Every individual re-tains their constitutional right to the free exercise of their religion. Does that mean they can coerce people or proselytize in that situation? No, it does not. The Court has been very clear on that. But that is not what this was. This is not a situation where the coach was coercing his players to participate in a prayer or proselytizing his players while he was on school time. He was simply kneeling down to pray, and for whatever strange reason the school dis-trict has put him on paid administra-tive leave and has started the process of firing the coach. 
I bring this up because it suddenly 
becomes a national issue when a school district creates a new legal standard for every person of faith in America. Every person of faith in America has the right to live their faith. A school district does not have the right to say to someone: Your constitutional right ends here. 
I can go through in great detail the 
different standards they leave out there, but their accommodation was this one simple thing: He could pri-vately pray in a room of the school dis-trict’s choosing. If he wanted to pray, they would put him in a spot and say: You can pray in there, in a place we pick, but you can’t pray out there. 
May I remind Americans that we do 
not have freedom of worship in Amer-ica; we have the free exercise of reli-gion in America. The government does not have the authority to confine your faith to the location of the govern-ment’s choosing. A government entity like a school district cannot say to an employee: You can only live your faith over there, where we pick. 
I don’t know what the school district 
is going to do in the days ahead, but I know what Americans of all faiths and people of no faith should do. They should rise up and say: We are a nation that protects the free exercise of reli-gion. And people who disagree with that coach should rise up in the same way with people who agree because I can assure you—if they will silence a Christian who is silently praying on 
the 50-yard line, I can assure you they will be after every other faith in the country and say: You can only practice your faith in the place of the govern-ment’s choosing. That is not who we are. 
Coach Joe Kennedy has the right to 
pray anywhere he wants to pray as long as it doesn’t interrupt his school responsibilities. I pray that this school district and the attorneys who are try-ing to manufacture a new requirement on people of faith will see that in the days ahead. 
I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wisconsin. 
HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES  
SENIOR AIRMAN QUINN LAMAR JOHNSON -HARRIS  
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I come 
to the floor today to pay tribute to one of the finest among us, a young man from Wisconsin whose service to his country was cut short by tragedy in Af-ghanistan. 
SrA Quinn Lamar Johnson-Harris, a 
21-year-old from Milwaukee, was among six airmen and five civilian pas-sengers who lost their lives when a C– 130 crashed on takeoff from Jalalabad Airfield in Afghanistan earlier this month. Every one of those individuals was a grave loss to our country. Every one deserves to be remembered and re-vered before the Senate. 
Today it is my solemn duty and par-
ticular honor to tell you about Airman Johnson-Harris. Quinn graduated from Homestead High School in Mequon, WI, in 2012. The very next year, he joined the Air Force. It was a foregone con-clusion that he would serve his country long before that, however. His grand-father served in Vietnam. His oldest brother, Jeremy, is a proud marine. His other older brother, Lamar, graduated from West Point just last spring and is now proudly serving in the Army. 
His mother told the story about how 
her three sons—Quinn was only 2 years old at the time—saluted at the grave of their grandfather and vowed to serve their country. 
For men such as these, our Nation is 
eternally grateful. 
Quinn went to rebuild houses in New 
Orleans after Hurricane Katrina while he was still in school. Later one of his comrades, a sergeant who served with him in the Air Force, said he was: ‘‘the heart of the squadron’’ and that ‘‘He was the best of us.’’ 
For 239 years, our service men and 
women have guarded our freedom, more than 42 million of them. Since the Revolutionary War, more than 1 million of those heroes have given their lives, including more than 27,000 sons and daughters of Wisconsin. Now Airman Johnson-Harris has been added to that terrible toll. His brothers, his sister Fatia, his parents Yvette and LaMar, and all his family and friends grieve their loss. Our hearts go out to them, and we pray that they will find comfort and peace.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7641 October 29, 2015 
I saw the grief of Airman Johnson- 
Harris’s family this past weekend dur-ing his funeral service at Christian Faith Fellowship Church in Milwaukee. I saw the respect they had for him and the honor granted him by a family who knows the meaning of earned honor. Quinn swore to support and defend the Constitution of the United States, to put his life on the line for the liberties we all enjoy. We must never take that type of dedication for granted. We owe him the honor of taking our own cor-responding oath of duty as seriously as he took his. 
May God bless Airman Johnson-Har-
ris’s loved ones, may He guard all of those in our Armed Forces who defend our Nation’s liberty, and may God bless America. 
I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. S
UL-
LIVAN ). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I spoke a 
few moments ago on the Senate floor, and as I was leaving I was made aware of an article in which the minority leader, Senator R
EID, was quoted. I 
wish to highlight something I want my colleagues to hear and know. 
What the Senator from Nevada indi-
cated was—the article begins: Having secured their goal of getting a budget deal addressing the debt ceiling and se-questration cuts, Democrats are now looking forward to the appropriations process. 
As an appropriator, so am I. I am in-
terested for us to have the opportunity, if this budget agreement passes, to make decisions about the priorities of spending within those budget numbers. What is so troublesome to me is that the indication was that President Obama and Democrats stand firm against efforts to target environmental regulations and other contentious rid-ers. 
I am quoting the Senator from Ne-
vada: 
We’re holding hands with the president, 
we’re all holding hands. We are not going to deal with these vexatious riders. We feel comfortable and confident. . . .’’ 
He goes on to talk about the agree-
ment. 
This is a Congress that is supposed to 
deal with contentious and vexatious issues. Why does anyone have the op-portunity to say it is off the table? It happened in these budget agreements in which we were told dealing with mandatory spending is off the table. Yet it is one of the most important issues we need to address, and you ought not start negotiations by saying we are not even going to talk about an issue. In this case, ‘‘off the table, not subject to discussion’’ is the issue of contentious or environmental regula-
tions. 
Congress—Republican and Demo-
cratic Members—ought to care about the power of Congress that is granted to us by the Constitution in our rep-resentation of the American people. We need the days in which the Congress and Members of Congress are not wed-ded to a Republican President or a Democratic President just because they happen to be Republicans or Democrats. We need to make decisions based upon what is good for the coun-try, not whether we are backstopping a President who happens to be a Member of our political party. Where are the Members of Congress who say congres-sional authority is the constitutional grant of power to act on behalf of Americans? 
We need not only to establish prior-
ities as a Congress when it comes to the spending process, but we need to make decisions when an agency or a department exceeds their authority, when they operate in ways that are contrary to what we believe is in the best interest of the country, in cir-cumstances in which they are doing things that lack common sense. The role of Congress is to direct the spend-ing. It is granted to us by the Constitu-tion of the United States. We are say-ing that while we are pleased we have a budget agreement, we will not stand for Congress determining whether the money can be spent in a certain way, whether it can be prohibited from being spent in a certain way. We are taking vexatious riders off the table. 
This is our responsibility. It is just 
as important for us to determine whether money should be spent at all as it is for us to determine how much money can be spent on a government program. It is particularly true, I don’t think there is any question but that this administration has been the most active, many of us would consider act-ing in an unconstitutional way in the development of regulations, of policies, of the bureaucracy of what the depart-ments and agencies are doing. This is an administration that cries out for congressional oversight, not for some-one who says it is not even on the table to be considered. 
I would think Republicans and Demo-
crats both ought to have an interest in determining how money is spent as well as whether we should tell an agen-cy, a department they can’t spend that money at all. Many of my Democratic colleagues have indicated they support a number of riders, including ones that are considered environmental. 
Waters of the United States is one 
that I have been told numerous times that my colleagues on the Democratic side of this Congress support the rider that is in the appropriations bill. Nu-merous times I have been told that many Democrats support reining in the regulations that are coming from the Department of Labor related to a fidu-ciary rule. Now we hear that vexatious environmental riders are off the table. We ought not allow that to stand. It is 
not that I expect every rider that I am for to receive approval of Congress, but those votes ought to be taken. That is our responsibility and majority rules. 
Again, the circumstance we now find 
ourselves in, this is nothing that we are even going to talk about. It is trou-blesome to me that those of my col-leagues who have expressed support for those riders—I guess I should explain to Kansans and to Americans, a rider is a provision—language in the appropria-tions bill that oftentimes says no money can be spent to implement this idea, to implement this regulation. 
It is an absolutely important respon-
sibility for Congress. It is not unusual. It is not something outside the bound-aries of what we are supposed to be doing. It is absolutely a significant component of our responsibility. Now those who claim they are for a rider, say the Waters of the United States or the fiduciary rule that the Department 
of Labor is promulgating—we have col-leagues who say they are for that. Now they will be able to say: I am for it, but I never had a chance to vote on it be-cause it was off the table. 
I would again ask my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle, don’t fall into this trap in which we are here to sup-port ad hoc, at every instance, the ex-ecutive branch just because they hap-pen to be a Member of our political party. When there is a Republican 
President, I hope to abide by those same rules. I am here on behalf of Kan-sans and on behalf of Americans, not on behalf of an administration regard-less of their political party, and we ought to demand that Congress do its work. We had an election, the people of this country asked for something dif-ferent, and once again we are back in the circumstance in which no longer are we able to move forward on legisla-tion. 
I assume by what the former major-
ity leader is saying that when he says it is off the table, he means there will not be 60 votes for us to even consider an omnibus bill in which those riders are included. Now, what I will say is that before long, we are going to be hearing about how Republicans are in-terested in shutting down government because they want these riders. Well, the reality is that the Senator from Nevada is indicating there is no discus-sion, and the blame ought not fall on those of us who actually wanted Con-gress to work. The allegation of shut-ting down government ought to rest on those who say: We won’t even discuss an appropriations bill that includes vexatious or contentious riders. 
Who would want to be a Member of a 
Congress that is unwilling to deal with contentious issues? It is our constitu-tional responsibility. The American people ought to demand the oppor-tunity for us to address issues of im-portance to them, and it ought not be off the table before the conversation even begins. 
Again, the point is that we have a 
constitutional responsibility that we

are made, it is off the table. We need a Congress that works, and we need a Congress that puts the American peo-ple above defending a President, re-gardless of his or her political party.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant 
to 42 U.S.C. 2159(i) and section 601(b)(4) of Public Law 94–329, S.J. Res. 20 is dis-charged and placed on the calendar, 45 days of the review period having elapsed. 
Mr. MORAN. I suggest the absence of 
a quorum.

Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, for 
the information of our colleagues, the cloture vote on the House-passed budg-et and debt limit package will occur an hour after we reconvene, which is at 1 a.m. under the regular order. Once clo-ture is invoked, the Senate will remain in session and on the message until we vote on passage. 
Senators will be permitted for up to 
an hour to speak postcloture. That is after 1 o’clock, under the rules. It is my hope that the debate time will be extremely limited and that we will be able to move to a passage vote almost immediately after 1 a.m. The timing, however, is up to any individual Sen-ator who claims debate time after the 1 a.m. vote. 
ORDERS FOR FRIDAY , OCTOBER 30 , 2015 
So I ask unanimous consent that 
when the Senate completes its business today, or at 11:55 p.m. today, whichever comes first, it adjourn until 12:01 a.m. on Friday, October 30; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, and the time for the two leaders be re-served for their use later in the day; fi-nally, that following leader remarks, the Senate resume consideration of the House message to accompany H.R. 1314, with the time until 1:01 a.m. equally di-vided between the two leaders or their designees. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
ORDER FOR RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF

HEALTH CARE COSTS  
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, we 
are embarked on a significant budget agreement that has as one of its com-ponents adjustments to America’s health care costs. In the case of this particular agreement, I support the ad-justments that have been proposed— things such as preventing drug manu-facturers from raising their costs high-er than the rate of inflation. We have seen people come in and buy companies and jack up the costs 10 times because they can. They haven’t added any value to the products; they have just raised the costs. I support that. Paying hospitals the rate for physician prac-tices that the physician practices were paid before the hospital bought them— nothing changed in the physician prac-tices; just ownership changed, and that shouldn’t allow a windfall to the buyer. I think we have done well with what we have done to reduce health care spend-ing in this particular bill, but I recall that in the sequester we did an across- the-board haircut right across Medi-care. Whatever you were being paid be-fore, you got paid 98 percent of that afterward if you were a Medicare pro-vider. 
I want to come today to offer a 
thought that I hope can percolate a bit, and if we go back and look at those costs again I would like to get this thought into the conversation. The backdrop of this is the extraordinary increase of health care costs that we have seen more or less in my lifetime. 
This chart shows 1960, and it is a $27 
billion American expenditure on total health care. Here it is in 2013, with $2.9 trillion, an increase of more than 100 times over those years in what we spend on health care. And as we have done that, what we have done is we have become the most expensive per- capita health care country in the world—and not by a little but by a ton. Over at the far side of the chart is the United Kingdom, then Germany, Japan, Switzerland, France, the Neth-erlands, and here is the United States. Again, this is 2013 data. We are way above the most expensive competitors that we have. So there is something that can be done here with this excess cost, because people aren’t getting bad health care in Germany. They are not getting terrible health care in the United Kingdom. They are not suf-fering in Japan or Switzerland or France or the Netherlands. These are competitive systems with ours, but ours costs half again as much. There is a big target in savings here. 
Here is another way of describing it. 
If you look at the cost and you com-pare it to a quality measure, here the quality measure is life expectancy in years, how long people can expect to 
live in these different countries, and this is the same per-capita cost infor-mation I showed in the last bar chart. What you see is that most of the coun-tries that we compete with are grouped right up in here, as shown on this chart—Greece, Great Britain, Japan. Most of the EU is right in here. As you run up the cost curve you get to Swit-zerland and the Netherlands. They are the two most expensive countries in the world in per-capita health care, not counting us. Look where we are. We are out here. Our costs are about half again as much as the least efficient health care providers in the industri-alized world. We are more inefficient by nearly a factor of a third than the least efficient health care providers in the industrialized world. That is not a prize we want to own. We want to be able to move this back. 
If you look at this gradient of life ex-
pectancy, we compare with Chile and the Czech Republic. Where we want to be is up here. Where we are is here. So once again, it proves there is enormous room for improvement in our health care system and we know that because other countries are doing it. They can do it. Darn it, we ought to be able to do it too. 
Now we change the scope of this a lit-
tle bit. This chart shows the American health care system State by State. Each State is marked as one of the dots on this graph. This graph has the same thing across the bottom—Medi-care spending per beneficiary. The last one was national spending, and this is Medicare spending per beneficiary. Here are the quality rankings of the States. There are a variety of quality rankings, and this assembles them into a consolidated quality rating. 
What you see is that within the 
United States of America you have the 
States. This goes back a bit. This is an old ranking that the Journal of the American Medical Association pro-duced. It shows that there are some States that were just under $5,000 per capita. They were doing something right. There are other States here, in-cluding an outlier, all the way over to $8,000 per capita. But there is a bulk of States here that run about $7,000 per capita. That is a $2,000-per-Medicare- recipient difference between this group of States and that group of States. That is interesting. Why is it that there is this big difference? 
Here is another interesting factor. 
Look who is doing better on quality— the States that spend less. The lesson from this is if you are delivering high quality health care, you can deliver it less expensively than if you are deliv-ering low quality health care. At a $2,000-per-beneficiary increase in costs, these States are way at the bottom on quality compared to the others. The re-lationship between quality of the care people receive and the cost it takes to deliver it to them is reversed. This

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7643 October 29, 2015 
isn’t like Lexus and Mercedes, where 
you pay more and you get a better car. This is the opposite. You have a really crummy car and it costs more to run it, it doesn’t work, and it is expensive because it is not working well. It is backward. It is interesting that way. 
If you bring that forward, this shows 
a recent graph from the Common-wealth Fund that shows the same thing, overall quality score relative to the U.S. median and costs in total Medicare spending. Here is the average right here for cost and the average for quality, and here you have these States down here in the bad box. They are way out here in costs. They are very expen-sive States. They are all above average. Some of them here are way above aver-age—25 percent above average, 15 per-cent above average, 20 percent above average. Look what their quality meas-ure is. They stink. They deliver ter-rible quality health care. Over here you have a bunch of other States that are way above the quality median and at the same time they are way below the cost average. So the principle from that first graph back in 2000 still holds true, according to the Commonwealth Fund. 
With that background, here is an-
other way to describe it. These are the 10 worst States in terms of highest cost per capita, and these are the best 10 States. I know we have a country with 50 States. This is only 20. We leave out the middle 30. These are the worst 10 in terms of cost, and these are the 10 best in terms of cost. 
Here is the idea. Why should we be 
reimbursing above average the States that have a per-capita cost above aver-age, instead of the way we did it on the sequester, by taking a 2-percent cut on everybody across the board that no-body can do anything about—just a cold, wet blanket of funds denial? Why not look and say this is the most that a State would get paid—whatever the cost would be—if it were at the aver-age. The rest, you just take it back per capita across the entire reimbursement for that State. 
This is what would happen with these 
high cost States. The very next meet-ing of the State medical society, the very next time the State met with the Governor, the very next time the Med-icaid program got together, they would be hollering, saying: What on Earth? I do a good job. I am going to get my re-imbursement cut because of that? 
No, we have to fix this. It would give 
them a massive incentive to stop be-having like this and start behaving like this. If we built in some lead time so they had the chance to actually get there, they might actually never have to cut. They might not ever have to face that cut because what they would have done in the time leading up to when the cut was scheduled to be im-posed is begin to behave like the States that have lower costs than average. 
We know this could be done because 
so many States are already doing it. Why would we ever again look at an across-the-board Medicare-provider cut 
when we have an enormous discrepancy between these high-cost, low-quality States and these low-cost, high-quality States—like this one all the way over here? Oh, my gosh, it is a bargain there; it is top quality care. 
That is my point for the day. I hope 
that anybody listening who is looking at the proposed cuts in the budget and who is looking at the need to manage this exploding health care cost curve that America has had for the last 50 years—steepening health care cost curve—starts to think about ways to do not just dumb and bloody cuts, but smart cuts—smart cuts that give the States that are costing us much more money than their peers the inventive to actually start behaving like their peers and bring down the cost for ev-eryone. That is what I would consider to be a serious win-win. 
I look forward to continuing this dis-
cussion. We have a couple of years be-fore we are going to face this again with any luck, but I think this is an idea that is worth considering. 
Once again, if you give the States 
enough warning within the 10-year budget period so we can score it but with enough warning that they have got the chance to react—I encourage anybody to read Atul Gawande’s last article about Texas. He wrote an arti-cle about the terrible cost differential between—I think it was El Paso and a town called McAllen, TX—huge. Then they brought in the ObamaCare afford-able care organizations—accountable care organization models and down came the price in McAllen. 
So it can be done. We have seen it 
being done. 
With that, I yield the floor.

TRADE ACT OF 2015—Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, for many 
months I have been speaking about what I call the Washington cartel. The Washington cartel consists of career politicians in both parties who get in bed with lobbyists and special interests in Washington and grow and grow and grow government. I believe the Wash-ington cartel is the source of the vol-canic frustration Americans face across this country, and it is difficult to find a better illustration of the Washington cartel than the charade we are engaged in this evening. This deal we are here to vote on is both shockingly bad on the merits and it is 
also a manifestation of the bipartisan corruption that suffuses Washington, DC. 
What are the terms of this budget 
deal? Well, in short, what the House of Representatives has passed, and what the Senate is expected to pass shortly, is a bill that adds $85 billion in spend-ing increases—$85 billion to our na-tional debt, $85 billion to your children and my children that they are some-how expected to pay. I don’t know about your kids, but my girls don’t have $85 billion lying around in their rooms. 
This bill is put together in a way 
only Washington could love. The spend-ing increases, when do they occur? Sur-prise to nobody, $37 billion in 2016, $36 billion in 2017, and $12 billion in 2018. But we were told, fear not; there are some spending cuts to offset them. And wonderfully, miraculously, ostensibly there are supposed to be a few spending cuts in 2020, then 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024. At the very end, 10 years from now—when my daughter Caroline will be getting ready to graduate high school, she is 7 now—we are told $33 billion will be cut in 2025. 
If you believe that I have a bridge to 
sell you in Brooklyn and I have some beachfront property in Arizona. No-body in this Chamber believes that. No-body in the House of Representatives believes that. No member of the press believes that. Everyone understands this is a lie. It is an agreed-to lie by ev-eryone. We will spend now for a prom-ise that 10 years hence we will magi-cally cut spending that will never ever, ever occur. 
That is on the face of it, but beyond 
that it is worth thinking about just how much $85 billion is. It is more than the Senate negotiated with the House when H
ARRY REIDwas majority leader. 
When H ARRY REIDwas majority leader 
the Ryan-Murray budget agreement— which was a flawed agreement and an agreement I voted against—increased spending by $63 billion over 2 years. 
So what does it say that a supposedly 
Republican majority of the Senate ne-gotiates a bigger spending bill than H
ARRY REIDand the Democrats? When 
HARRY REIDand the Democrats were in 
charge of this body they jacked up spending and our debt $63 billion. When the Republicans take charge, whoo baby, we can do it better—some $85 bil-lion. 
Not only that, this deal is not con-
tent with spending increases. It also takes the debt ceiling and essentially hands President Obama a blank credit card. It says to the President: You can add whatever debt you like for the re-mainder of your term with no con-straint from this body. We are abdi-cating any and all congressional au-thority over the debt that is bank-rupting our kids and grandkids.

every breath in our body to stop the 
spending and debt that is bankrupting our kids and grandkids. How, pray tell, does handing President Obama a blank credit card for the remainder of his tenure do anything to follow those commitments? 
Let me note that for the remaining 
15 months we are going to see a binge from this President that makes the preceding 6
1⁄2years pale. For 61⁄2years 
we have seen an assault on rule of law, an assault on our constitutional rights, a retreat from the world stage, all of which I think will pale compared to what is coming in the next 15 months. In the next 15 months abroad, I have said before, we are essentially in a Hobbesian state of nature, where the enemies of America have made the judgment that the Commander in Chief is not a credible threat, so they are limited only by the limits of their own strength. It is like ‘‘Lord of the Flies.’’ 
On the regulatory side, we are seeing 
a press on every front to go after eco-nomic freedom—to destroy small busi-nesses, to destroy jobs, to destroy our constitutional liberties. When it comes to spending, I shudder to think what President Obama for the next 15 months will do with a blank credit card that the Republican majority in the House of Representatives and the Re-publican majority in the Senate are preparing to send him. 
American Express has a whole series 
of credit cards. It has the green card, the introductory card. I remember when I was a freshman in college—I was 17 years old. I got an application for an American Express card. I was really excited. I got an AmEx when I was 17. It was a green card. Now, if you spend more and you spend more, even-tually you can upgrade to a gold card, then you can upgrade to a platinum card, and then you can actually up-grade to a black card above that. 
Well, I have to say, a multi-trillion- 
dollar Presidential card has to be an extraordinary card. I assume it is en-crusted in diamonds and glows in the dark. That is what the Republican ma-jorities have just given President Obama—a diamond encrusted, glow-in- the-dark AmEx card, and it has a spe-cial feature. The President gets to spend it now, and they do not even send him the bill. They send the bill to your kids and my kids. It is a pretty nifty card. You don’t have to pay for it. You get to spend it, and it is somebody else’s problem. 
Not only is this bill spending us deep-
er and deeper into a hole, it is chock- full of gimmicks. These are gimmicks that everyone writing them knew were there. For example, it contains a spending gimmick that targets single- employer pension plans while ignoring the oncoming union multi-employer pension plan funding tsunami. 
Beyond that, this bill also addresses 
ObamaCare. But what does it do? It provides a targeted ObamaCare fix for big business—those with more than 200 employees. By repealing the law’s automatic enrollment provision, which 
requires employers to automatically enroll new full-time employees in one of the company’s health plans unless the employee opts out. 
What does it say that the Congress of 
the United States exists to provide a special exemption for giant corpora-tions but turns a blind eye, turns a deaf ear to the small businesses being driv-en out of business over and over and over again by ObamaCare? What does it say? If you are a giant corporation in America, if you have armies of lobby-ists, then fear not, the Washington car-tel is here for you—a special carve-out, no doubt just as soon as you hand over your campaign contribution. 
For the small business we are facing 
a time unique in recorded history, 
where more small businesses are going out of business than are being created. For as long as they have kept records, that has never been true until recent years under the Obama economy. Why does that matter? That matters be-cause over two-thirds of all new jobs come from small businesses. When you hammer small businesses, you end up getting the stagnation, the misery, the malaise we have right now. When you hammer small businesses, you have young people coming out of school who can’t find jobs, who have student loans up to their eyeballs but can’t find a job. When you hammer small busi-nesses, you have people like my father, who in the 1950s was a teenage immi-grant washing dishes, unable to find a job. 
What does it say that Congress will 
pass a special exemption for giant cor-porations, but for the single moms, for the teenage immigrants, for the young African-American teenagers struggling to achieve a better life there is no an-swer to their plight? To some 6 million Americans who had their health insur-ance canceled and their doctors can-celed because of ObamaCare, there is no answer to their plight. To the mil-lions of Americans who have seen their health insurance premiums skyrocket so they can no longer afford them, there is no answer to their plight. But fear not, the cartel is here for the giant corporations. 
Let us be abundantly clear. The car-
tel is not a partisan phenomenon. It is not just the Democrats—although it is most assuredly the Democrats—but there are far too many Republicans as well who are card-carrying cartel mem-bers who, when the K Street lobbyists summon action, snap to attention. 
Look at what else this deal does. 
This deal additionally takes $150 bil-lion the next 3 years from the Social Security trust fund and moves it to the disability insurance fund. I would ad-vise all Members of this body the next time you are home and visiting with a senior, the next time the topic of So-cial Security comes up, if you vote for this deal tonight, be sure to say: Ma’am, just so you know, I voted to take $150 billion out of your Social Se-curity. Because that is what they are doing. That is what they are doing. They 
are saying to seniors: Well, there is a little bit of money here, and we are going to take it and move it over here. Why? Because actually fixing the dis-ability program, reforming the pro-gram would be too difficult. Stepping forward to address the fraud in that program would be too difficult. Step-ping forward to put in place work in-centives to help people with disabil-ities find meaningful work, even if it is not everything they are capable of—a great many people with disabilities are capable of meaningful work—reforming that program to help people work to provide for their families makes a dif-ference in people’s lives, but that isn’t easy. That is hard work. That is actu-ally what we were elected to do. It is far easier just to raid the Social Secu-rity trust fund, far easier to pull $150 billion from our seniors and reallocate it and do nothing, zero, to fix the un-derlying problem. 
The deal also sells 58 million barrels 
of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It is always interesting to see the Federal Government selling off Federal assets. I have argued for a long time that we should be selling off Fed-eral land, far too much of which in this country is owned by the Federal Gov-ernment. I am not talking about na-tional parks, which are a treasure that should be preserved; I am talking about the vast amounts of land that are held, utterly nonproductive, by the Federal Government. 
So it is a good thing that this bill is 
selling some assets, but it is inter-esting, No. 1, that they estimate that will yield $5 billion because they esti-mate it will be selling at $86 a barrel. I have to say, representing the State of Texas, if you know how to sell oil today at $86 a barrel, you are truly a magician because it is selling at about half that right now. But when it comes to budget trickery, just make up a number and put it in there. As I said before, on this chart everyone knows it is a lie. Nobody believes it is true. It is a game. It is the Washington game. 
I would note that in selling 58 million 
barrels of oil, they are not using that revenue to pay down our national debt. If they are actually selling assets, we would think it would go to something at home. If you sell an asset and have a massive credit card debt, the prudent thing to do would be to use the revenue from that asset to pay down that credit card debt. Oh, no. It is just more and more spending. 
A group called the Conservative Ac-
tion Project consists of the CEOs of over 100 organizations representing all of the major elements of the conserv-ative movement, the economic, social, and national security conservatives. They sent a letter to this body. The letter reads as follows: 
The latest budget deal negotiated by the 
White House and outgoing House Speaker John Boehner, the bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, proposes increasing spending by $85 bil-lion over the next three fiscal years. What

the deal doesn’t include are meaningful ac-
countability measures that ensure respon-sible spending levels. 
The deal would allow Treasury unfettered 
borrowing power until 2017 in exchange for theoretical budget cuts down the road. The included offsets are spending gimmicks, at best. According to budget analyses from the Congressional Budget Office and The Herit-age Foundation, the deal would result in spending increase of $85 billion over the next three years, while significant spending cuts would not take place for another ten years— until 2025. Furthermore, we cannot reason-ably expect that a future Congress will abide by these measures. Moreover, the busting of the caps presently is proof that the gim-micks which promise reform later are hol-low. 
This ‘‘bipartisan deal’’ indicates a dan-
gerous trend that has become commonplace in Washington—rather than hard questions about spending, the Congress is choosing to eliminate the possibility of those conversa-tions or votes for the next two years. Fur-thermore, the deal represents total surrender on important conserve principles, while capitulating to every demand of the White House. 
It is this sort of irresponsible spending 
that has resulted in a national debt of over 18 trillion dollars. For the first time in near-ly six years, Republicans have control of both Houses of Congress and a real chance to send responsible budget reforms to the Presi-dent’s desk. A responsible alternative would acknowledge the importance of appro-priating funds for government operations while simultaneously addressing our statu-tory debt limit and staying within the budg-et caps. 
Instead, lawmakers have forgone the 
chance at meaningful reforms and instead are digging us deeper into the mire of debt our nation has already accrued. 
In potentially the most egregious portion 
of the deal, the Overseas Contingency Oper-ation or ‘‘OCO’’ fund, which is dubious in and of itself, is typically designated for efforts to support troops on the ground in emergency situations, is turned over to a slush-fund for non-defense spending. 
We oppose the Bipartisan Budget Act of 
2015 not only because it fails to curtail spending, but it prevents future reform for an entire two years. Lawmakers should re-ject this deal, and attach earnest, meaning-ful reform to any hike of the debt limit. 
It is signed by former Attorney Gen-
eral Edwin Meese, the Honorable Becky Norton Dunlop, and dozens of respected conservative leaders across this coun-try, across the full spectrum of the conservative movement—across fiscal conservatives, social conservatives, na-tional security conservatives, all united, the conservative movement. 
Many of the people who worked very 
hard to elect us to this body, many of the people who worked very hard to give us a Republican majority in the Senate are now all speaking in unison saying: What in the heck are you doing? Some of them may be using stronger language than that. 
This bill we are voting on was not 
cooked up overnight. This wasn’t a slap-dash on a Post-it last night. This represents days or weeks or months of negotiations. This represents the cartel in all of its glory because this is the combined work product of J
OHNBOEH-
NER and N ANCY PELOSI and M ITCH 
MCCONNELL and H ARRY REID. The entire time Republican leaders 
have been promising ‘‘We are going to do something on the budget; we are going to rein in the President,’’ they have been in the backroom negotiating to fund every single thing President Obama did. I am reminded that it wasn’t too long ago that we saw El Chapo dug out of his prison cell. One of the first things you realized when El Chapo was dug out is that tunnel wasn’t dug overnight; the drug cartels spent many weeks or months digging that tunnel. Well, our leadership, the leadership of the Washington cartel, has spent many weeks and months breaking El Chapo out on the Amer-ican people, digging us deeper into debt. It is contrary to the promises our leaders have made. 
In August of 2014, Majority Leader 
M
ITCH MCCONNELL was quoted as say-
ing: 
So in the House and Senate, we own the 
budget. So what does that mean? That means that we can pass the spending bill. And I assure you that in the spending bill, we will be pushing back against this bu-reaucracy by doing what’s called placing rid-ers in the bill. No money can be spent to do this or to do that. We’re going to go after them on healthcare, on financial services, on the Environmental Protection Agency, across the board. . . . All across the federal government, we’re going to go after them. 
Let me ask, have we done any of 
that—any of that at all? Now wait, leadership might come back and say: Well, sure. We have appropriations bills. There are riders. But the Demo-crats are filibustering. 
Everyone understands why the 
Democrats are filibustering appropria-tions bills. When Republican leadership begins the negotiation by peremptorily surrendering, by saying, ‘‘We are going to fund everything, 100 percent of what you want,’’ what rational Democrat would ever agree to allow an appropria-tions bill to go forward? 
I am reminded of a football game. In 
a football game, if the coach comes out at the beginning of the game when the coin is being flipped and forfeits, we know the results in 100 percent of those games. In 100 percent of those games, that team will lose. Sadly, that team is the American people because it is Re-publican leadership that goes out and forfeits at the coin toss over and over again. 
That was in 2014. In 2015, Senate Majority Leader 
M
ITCH MCCONNELL vowed ‘‘some big 
fights over funding the bureaucracy,’’ saying that his party would use spend-ing bills now being written in the GOP- controlled Congress to extract policy concessions from President Barack Obama. Where are those policy conces-sions? Where are those fights? I don’t recall seeing any fights. Actually, that is not fair. There are fights—fights against conservatives; fights against efforts to rein in the Obama adminis-tration; fights against efforts to stop the spending; fights against efforts to turn around our debt. On that, Repub-lican leadership fights ferociously. But where are the promised fights against 
the Obama agenda, on anything? Name one concession. 
Let’s go back to the substance of this 
deal. One of the things this deal does is it utterly makes a mockery of the Budget Control Act. It abrogates the budget caps. It wasn’t too long ago that Republican leadership was touting the Budget Control Act as one of the greatest successes of Republican lead-ership. Indeed, when asked ‘‘Well, why does it matter to have Republicans in control?’’ typically the answer would be ‘‘Look at the Budget Control Act.’’ 
Here is another quote from Majority 
Leader M
ITCH MCCONNELL : 
Politicians regularly come to Washington 
promising fiscal responsibility, but too often they can’t agree to cut spending when it counts, and that is why the Budget Control Act is such a big deal. 
Mind you, a big deal that right now 
the Republican Congress is abrogating. 
Since Congress passed the BCA with over-
whelming bipartisan majorities in 2011, Washington has actually reduced the level of government spending for 2 years running. That is the first time this has happened since the Korean war. 
Leader M CCONNELL continuing: 
The BCA savings are such a big deal, in 
fact, that the President campaigned on it endlessly in 2012. 
Yet the lone fiscal accomplishment 
supposedly of the Republican majority, this deal throws overboard. They didn’t have much to point to, but they had this one: We have the budget caps. Guess what. We don’t have those ei-ther. 
Then there is the debt ceiling. In 
2011, then-Minority Leader M
ITCH 
MCCONNELL talked about what the debt 
ceiling should be used for. This is a quote from an op-ed he wrote: 
What Republicans want is simple: We want 
to cut spending now. 
Does this do this? No. 
We want to cap runaway spending in the 
future— 
Does this do this? No— 
and we want to save our entitlements and our country from bankruptcy by requiring the nation to balance its budget. 
Again, this does not do this. 
We want to finally get our economy grow-
ing again at a pace that will lead to signifi-cant job growth. 
Well, surely there are some pro- 
growth measures in this. No. 
That wasn’t an isolated statement. 
Earlier in 2011, Leader M CCONNELL ex-
plained that ‘‘no president—in the near future, maybe in the distant future—is going to be able to get the debt ceiling increased without a re-ignition of the same discussion of how do we cut spending and get America headed in the right direction.’’ That was 4 years ago. 
Why is it that the Republican leader-
ship is giving President Obama tril-lions in more debt without any—let’s go back to Leader M
CCONNELL ’s 
words—‘‘re-ignition of the same discus-sion of how do we cut spending and get

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7646 October 29, 2015 
America headed in the right direc-
tion’’? That was a clear promise made to the American people, and this deal makes that promise a mockery. It makes it an utter mockery. Instead, Republican leadership is taking the lead to remove the debt ceiling from Barack Obama. He will never have to worry about it again. 
Why do these matter? Why do we 
have these fights? To understand why, we have to understand the dynamics of Congress today. 
In Congress today, there are essen-
tially three types of spending bills. No. 1, there are show votes. Show votes are a particular favorite of leadership. Show votes are anything, frankly, that men and women who are elected care about. They will tee up a show vote. We have had show votes on Planned Parenthood. We have had show votes on the Iran nuclear deal. We have had show votes on amnesty. Show votes are designed for all the Republicans to vote one way, all the Democrats to vote the other, and for us to lose. Show votes are a game of political posture. 
Leadership is happy to give show 
votes. Frankly, leadership is irked that the men and women who elected us are not satisfied with show votes anymore. There was a time when politicians in Washington could look down at our constituents and say: They don’t un-derstand what is going on. If we give them a show vote, they will be satisfied with that. 
Well, a funny thing happened on the 
way to the floor: The electorate has gotten much more sophisticated, much more educated, and much more in-formed. With the advent of the Inter-net, with the advent of social media, people can now tell a show vote. A vote that is designed to lose from day one, that is an exercise in political theater, in Kabuki theater, is not, in fact, hon-oring the commitments made to the men and women who elected us. 
There is a second type of legislation 
which is simply a collective spending bill that pays off the Washington car-tel, pays off the lobbyists, and that can often get bipartisan agreement. If you are giving money to giant corpora-tions, it is amazing how many Demo-crats and Republicans can come to-gether to say: Hey, these corporations write campaign checks; we are all for that. The pesky taxpayers don’t know enough to fight against this. We can keep them in the dark, so let’s keep robbing the single moms waiting tables to take her paycheck and give it to the giant corporation. That stinks. Do you want to know why America is mad? That is it right there, the legalized looting that occurs in this city every day. 
Then there is a third type of vote. 
That is the must-pass legislation. I would note that this year in the Senate there are a number of Senate freshmen. Senate leadership has done what Sen-ate leadership always does, which is wrap their arms around Senate fresh-men and bring them into the bosom. One of the things I am hoping Senate 
freshmen observe firsthand—I have not been here much longer than Senate freshmen, but one of the things you quickly realize is the only fights that have any chance of actually changing law, the only fights that have any chance of actually changing policy are must-pass bills. 
If you want to do more than a show 
vote, if you want to actually fix a prob-lem, if you want to actually address a wrong, you either fight on the must- pass votes or you do nothing. Those are the choices. Leadership knows that must-pass votes are typically one of three things: They are continuing reso-lutions, they are Omnibus appropria-tions bills, or they are debt ceiling in-creases. 
If you look historically at how Con-
gress has reined in a recalcitrant Presi-dent, it has been through continuing resolutions, Omnibus appropriations, or debt ceiling increases. If leadership foreswears using any of them, we will not use any must-pass legislation to do anything. Do you know what that means? That means Congress in the United States has become all but irrel-evant. That is what leadership has done. 
It is all captured in one innocuous 
little statement: no shutdowns. That is what leadership has promised. We are going to have no shutdowns. Listen, to most folks that sounds like a very rea-sonable proposition. In the private sec-tor, you generally don’t shut a business down. Saying we are not going to shut things down seems very common-sensical, but here is the problem. When you are dealing with zealots and when you are dealing with ideologues and you tell them if they do the following, I will surrender—if you tell them ‘‘if you say the word ‘zucchini,’ I will give in,’’ we all know what will happen. Im-mediately they will begin saying ‘‘zuc-chini, zucchini, zucchini.’’ 
That is Washington today. Repub-
lican leadership in both Chambers has told President Obama we will never ever allow a shutdown because, Lord knows, the last time we had a shut-down, it resulted in us winning nine Senate seats, taking control of the Senate, retiring H
ARRY REIDas major-
ity leader, winning the largest major-ity in the House, and, goodness gra-cious, we don’t want that to happen again. 
Once Republican leadership tells 
Obama we will never ever allow a shut-down, then suddenly the President has a little furry rabbit’s foot in his pock-et. On any issue, any fight, any topic that comes up whatsoever, all the President has to do is whisper quietly in the wind ‘‘shutdown’’ and Repub-lican leadership runs to the hills. It is a wonderful negotiating tactic. Why is this happening? Because President Obama whispered ‘‘shutdown,’’ and leadership said, ‘‘We surrender.’’ 
If you are not willing to fight on any 
must-pass legislation, we will not win anything. Leadership responds, though, that it is not reasonable. You cannot 
win. You can never win a fight on must-pass legislation. 
The problem with that is history is 
to the contrary. As John Adams fa-mously said, ‘‘Facts are stubborn things.’’ Of the last 55 times Congress has raised the debt ceiling, it has at-tached meaningful conditions to that 28 times. It has historically proven the most effective leverage Congress has. 
When leadership says—and by the 
way, when press outlets echo leader-ship in saying that it is hopeless, noth-ing can be done, do not fight on these issues, they never seem to address the reality of history that is directly to the contrary. Gramm-Rudman, one of the most significant spending re-straints in modern times, came from the debt ceiling. If Congress wasn’t willing to fight on the debt ceiling, you would have no Gramm-Rudman. Yet leadership might respond: OK. Fine. Historically that was true but not with Barack Obama, not with H
ARRY REID. 
This current incarnation of Demo-crats—they are too partisan, they are too extreme, they are too zealous, and it will never work with them. The only problem is that is not true either. 
Indeed, what we are talking about 
right now—the Budget Control Act— came from the debt ceiling. The newly elected majority in the House of Rep-resentatives used the debt ceiling to extract the Budget Control Act from President Obama, which until just re-cently leadership hailed as their great-est fiscal success in modern times. 
If the tool that yielded their greatest 
fiscal success was the debt ceiling, why would leadership say we will never use it again? It is like the San Francisco 49ers of great saying that we are never going to again allow Joe Montana to throw to Jerry Rice. That worked too well—never again. 
If you discover a tool that works, 
who in their right mind would say we will take off the field forever the tool that has proven most successful in reining in the President? I don’t know if anyone in their right mind would, but that is in fact what congressional Republican leadership has done. This debt ceiling is kicked down the road until the end of the Obama Presidency. 
I would note that when Speaker 
B
OEHNER announced his resignation on 
that day, I predicted this outcome. On that day, within minutes of Speaker B
OEHNER announcing his resignation, I 
stated publicly that what this means is that he has cut a deal with N
ANCY  
PELOSI to raise the debt ceiling and to 
fund the entirety of Obama’s agenda for the next 2 years. 
It was interesting. When I said that, 
there were those in the media who criticized me: Oh, you don’t know that. Why are you so cynical? Why would you say such a thing? 
I would say such a thing because I 
understand how the Washington cartel operates, how it is not two parties, but it is in fact one party—the party of Washington. I mentioned that this deal

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7647 October 29, 2015 
took months to negotiate. We are see-
ing the fruits of it right here. This is exactly what I predicted the day J
OHN 
BOEHNER resigned. Why? Because that 
then freed the Speaker to pass this through the House of Representatives. How many Democrats do you think voted for this? I will tell you. It was every single one of them. One hundred percent of House Democrats who voted, voted for this, and 79 Republicans voted for it—a handful, a small minor-ity of Republicans. So how did this pass the House? With all the Demo-crats, House leadership, and a handful of Republicans. How is it likely to pass this body? Every Democrat will vote for it. Republican leadership will vote for it, and they will get some of the Re-publicans. That pattern—a lameduck Speaker of the House cutting a deal with a lameduck President to add $85 billion to our national debt and to give away any and all leverage for the Obama administration—that is what this deal means. 
It is worth understanding. This deal 
means Republican majorities in Con-gress will extract nothing of signifi-cance from President Obama. This deal means that Republican leadership has fully surrendered. 
It is interesting. They call it clearing 
the decks. That is a uniquely Wash-ington term. You recall back in De-cember the trillion-dollar CRomnibus bill. The very first thing we did after winning majority in both Houses was also called clearing the decks. Boy, these decks need a lot of clearing. I have to say, these chairs get rear-ranged like they are on the deck of the Titanic, and no one addresses the fact that the ship of the United States is headed toward the iceberg. 
With $18 trillion in debt that the 
party of Washington, the Washington cartel, has created—and it is complicit and growing—the only people losing are our kids and their kids and the fu-ture of this country and the future of the free world. That is all that is being lost. But, hey, there are cocktail par-ties in Washington this week. Lobby-ists are hosting them. They are writing checks. 
If we actually stood up to that, that 
would be difficult. There is a reason so many politicians talk about standing up to Washington. Yet so few actually do it because it is far easier to take the path of least resistance. It is far easier to go along to get along. It is far easier simply to agree, to be agreeable, to get along. Why can’t you get along with the politicians who are bankrupting your children and my children? Do you know what? I don’t make it a habit to acquiesce to people who are doing enor-mous damage to this country. That is what we are seeing. 
What could have been done instead? 
Imagine a hypothetical. Imagine we had Republican leadership that wanted to fight on something, on anything. For Pete’s sake, at this point, I think most voters would say: Give me some-thing that matters and fight on that, whatever it is. They are so frustrated. 
How can it be that we won majorities in both Houses and there is nothing, nothing that matters to the people that we are willing to fight on? 
Do I think the continuing resolution 
or the debt ceiling could have magi-cally transformed this country? Do I think we could have done fundamental, wholesale reforms? Probably not. That would have taken truly inspired leader-ship. That may be asking too much. If we couldn’t have solved every problem, is the alternative really that we could have solved nothing? Is the alternative really that we had to give Obama ev-erything and do nothing to fix the problems? 
Let me suggest seven things this deal 
could have included. How about the De-fault Prevention Act? It is legislation P
ATTOOMEY introduced. He also calls 
it the Full Faith and Credit Act. Every time we have a debt ceiling fight, the Democrats scaremonger. They say: If you don’t raise the debt ceiling, Amer-ica will default on its debt. 
Let’s be clear. That is a blatant lie. 
They know it is a lie. I will note that when Barack Obama was Senator Obama, he voted against George W. Bush raising the debt ceiling. He said it was unpatriotic to raise the debt ceil-ing. That is when the debt was about half of what it is now. 
Everyone who votes here later to-
night, you should remember that Sen-ator Obama said that if you are voting to raise this debt ceiling, what you are doing is unpatriotic. Those are the words of a young Barack Obama, but there is reason it is a lie. Every month’s Federal revenue is about $200 billion. Interest on the debt runs be-tween $30 billion and $40 billion a month, which means in any given month there are ample revenues to service the debt. No responsible Presi-dent would ever allow a default on the debt. Indeed, what a responsible Presi-dent should do is stand up at the very outset and say: Let me be clear. Under no circumstances will the United States ever, ever default on its debt. That is what a responsible President would do. Sadly, that means that is not what President Obama has done. In-stead, what he does consistently when we approach a debt ceiling is to threat-en to default on the debt if we don’t give him a blank credit card. 
What does the Default Prevention 
Act do? It says that in the event the debt ceiling is not raised, we will al-ways, always, always service our debt. We will never ever, ever, ever default on the debt. I recognize that there are some skilled demagogues in Wash-ington, but how exactly does the Democratic Party demagogue Repub-licans for risking a default on the debt in order to pass legislation preventing defaults on the debt? That is some slick talking. But you know what. The Republican leadership didn’t want to do that, because if we did that, then when we face the next debt ceiling, conservatives would expect us to say: OK, let’s use this leverage to fight for 
something, and they don’t want to fight for something. 
The Democratic scaremongering is 
useful because they are working to meet the same priorities. If you pass the Default Prevention Act, then sud-denly some spines might stiffen and people might be prepared to fight, and that is a nightmare to leadership—that we would actually fight. So, no, no, no, no, we will not attach the Default Pre-vention Act. 
How about another one—shutdowns? 
Senator P
ORTMAN has legislation pre-
venting government shutdowns. There is one promise that Republican leader-ship has made that is carved in stone, and that is that we will never, ever, ever, ever allow a shutdown. So if there was anything on Earth to attach to this deal, it would be that. Senator P
ORTMAN ’s legislation says: In the 
event a continuing resolution isn’t passed, in the event that appropria-tions expire, funding will continue, but it will gradually ratchet down slowly over time. If we pass that bill, there will never ever, ever again be a govern-ment shutdown. 
Gosh, if I listened to the rhetoric of 
leadership, I would think they would want to pass that bill. Why isn’t it in this? The answer is simple: Because if it were in this, Members of this body would actually expect us to stand up and fight for something. Instead, lead-ership wants to be able to tell the freshmen—the new Members of the Senate—that a shutdown is terrible. It is the worst thing in the world. So we can’t fight for anything; so you must acquiesce in everything that Obama wants. If we actually passed legislation prohibiting shutdowns, that scare-mongering would be taken off the table. Democrats don’t want that be-cause Democrats support shutdowns. 
If we look at the last shutdown over 
ObamaCare—revisionist history aside, because the media loves doing revi-sionist history—Republicans voted over and over and over to fund the gov-ernment, and it was H
ARRY REIDand 
Barack Obama who shut down the gov-ernment. Reporters scoff at that when they hear it without ever acknowl-edging that H
ARRY REIDvery publicly 
said: Gosh, we think shutdowns help Democrats politically. Why is it a dif-ficult proposition? If the leader of the Democratic Party says that we think a shutdown is politically beneficial, why is it difficult to understand that they are the ones forcing a shutdown? The last thing Democrats want is to take shutdowns off the table. 
The dirty little secret—the men-
dacity in this body—is that the Repub-lican leadership doesn’t want that ei-ther. They don’t want us standing and resisting anything because it is not two parties; it is one party. 
What else could we have done? How 
about growth? Remember M
ITCH

nomic growth? Why doesn’t this bill have a provision lifting the ban on

crude oil exports? That would produce 
economic growth across this country. It is a no-brainer economically. Is this in there? No. Did we try? No. Maybe it was brought up behind closed doors, and the Democrats laughed and said no and we surrendered. I don’t know. It doesn’t matter because leadership is not willing to fight for it. If you are not willing to fight for it, it won’t hap-pen. 
What else could we have done? We 
could have repealed the waters of the United States rule, one of the most crushing rules that is hammering farm-ers and ranchers and poses an immense threat to jobs across this country. By the way, there is even some bipartisan opposition to it in this body. But fear not, next week we have a show vote on the waters of the United States bill scheduled. Leadership is very happy. We will have a show vote. We will get to vote, and it will fail. 
Every farmer and rancher that is fac-
ing hundreds of thousands of dollars in costs because of this rule should rest assured that our show vote will allow us to pretend to be with them. Why not attach to this a provision rescinding the waters of the United States? Be-cause that would actually prompt a fight. 
How about another option on the 
spending side? How about putting in a work requirement for welfare? In the mid-1990s, welfare reform was one of the most successful policy reforms in modern times. It moved millions peo-ple off of welfare and into work, out of poverty and into the middle class. It lifted their spirits, their hopes, their dreams. It provided the dignity of work. It provided children with homes that were more stable, had more future and more opportunity. We could have added that to this. Is that here? No. Why? Because President Obama would fight it. It is contrary to his big gov-ernment agenda to expect anyone re-ceiving welfare to work or look for work. 
By the way, let me say as an aside, 
that you are not helping anyone when you make them dependent on govern-ment. You are not doing them a favor when you sap them of the dignity and self-respect of going to work. Arthur Brooks has a wonderful new book out. One of the things that he talks about is the happiness that comes from going to work and working hard, the dignity that comes from looking your kids in the eyes and having a job. 
The Democrats are not helping the 
people they trap with dependency; they are hurting them profoundly. I have said many times that when my dad was a teenage immigrant in the 1950s, washing dishes and making 50 cents an hour, and he couldn’t speak English, thank God some well-meaning liberal didn’t come put his arm around him and say: Let me take care of you. Let me make you dependent on govern-ment. Let me give you a check. Let me sap your dignity and self-respect. It would have been the most destructive thing you could have done to my fa-
ther. 
We could have fought that fight. But 
did we do that? No. 
What about adding a provision of 
Internet tax freedom—permanently? The Internet will be tax free in per-petuity. I tried to bring that up numer-ous times. The Democrats can be ex-pected to routinely block it. Why? Be-cause they want to threaten taxing the Internet. That is some money. Ain’t nothing politicians in Washington like more than a chance to get their grubby little hands on our dollars and our free-dom. 
How precisely did we lose this fight if 
in the course of this we simply at-tached permanent Internet tax freedom to this fight? Are Republicans really that lousy at political battle that we fear the President would shut down the government, blame us, and we would collapse in ignominy because we fought for Internet tax freedom? Holy cow—if we are that bad at this, why are we doing this? 
I have one other option. How about 
auditing the Federal Reserve? That is something else that has bipartisan sup-port, something else that would ad-dress the effects of debasing the cur-rency. One of the effects of debasing the currency is seniors, people who saved their whole lives are seeing their savings devalue. They are people who are struggling and living paycheck to paycheck. Single moms are finding it harder and harder to make ends meet. Those are seven things we could have added to this. 
By the way, I would note that when 
leadership says, ‘‘Gosh, you are being unrealistic to expect us to fight,’’ I didn’t say any one of those is a must- have. I gave a choice of seven. Is it really the case that we could have fought for nothing? Is that really the case? That is what leadership tells us. No, nothing pro-growth, nothing lim-iting spending, nothing addressing any of the promises we make—that is the position of leadership. 
I ask my Republican colleagues to 
name one thing President Obama is un-happy with regarding this deal. There is an old line that if it is a good nego-tiation, both sides are unhappy, both sides will have given something. Name one thing that President Obama is un-happy with. What did we get in return? Name one thing. The answers to both questions are exactly the same—noth-ing. 
The fact is, President Obama has al-
ready told us what he thinks of this deal. Just this week he stated: ‘‘I’m pretty happy about the budget deal be-cause it reflects our values.’’ Whose values are those? He is right. This budget deal reflects the Obama values. Who negotiated this budget deal? That would be Republican leadership. What does it say that Republican leader-ship’s budget deal gives President Obama everything he wants because it reflects Obama’s values? This is why the American people are so frustrated. We keep winning elections and nothing 
changes. 
In 2009, we were told that if only you 
had a Republican majority in the House of Representatives, then things would be different. We rose up, and mil-lions of us in 2010 won a majority. And very little changed. Then we were told the problem was the Senate—H
ARRY  
REIDand the Senate. If only we had a 
Republican majority in the Senate, then things would be different. In 2014, millions of Americans rose up again, and we won another historic tidal wave victory. We won nine Senate seats and retired H
ARRY REIDas the majority 
leader. The Presiding Officer and I have been here 10 months. Is there one single accomplishment we can point to that the Republican majority has given to the men and women who elected us? Mind you, there are things we have ac-complished. It just wasn’t anything we promised the men and women back home. 
One of the things I discovered as a 
freshman is how often leadership would effectively pat you on the head and say: Now, son, that is what you tell the folks back home. We don’t actually do it. You don’t expect us to actually do those things. 
A few weeks back, I was meeting 
with a number of House Republicans. I suggested to them to go back to their districts and convene a townhall and set up a whiteboard and just ask their constituents: What should be the top priorities of Republican majorities in both Houses of Congress? Make a list. If you make a list of 20 things from your constituents—the Presiding Offi-cer is from Nebraska and I am from Texas—I guarantee you that of those 20 things at least 18 of them will be no-where on the leadership’s priority list. They are simply not what majorities are endeavoring to do. 
The second thing I suggested to the 
House Republicans was to go down to K Street and assemble the biggest lobby-ists in Washington. Take out that same whiteboard and ask them: What are your top priorities? Write a list of 20 things, and 18 of them will be leader-ship’s priorities. That is the divide. 
People ask me: Is it that leadership 
is unwilling to fight? Is it that they are not very good? Do they not know how to fight? Sadly, it is worse than that. They know how to fight. They are ac-tually quite capable of it. They are willing to fight. It is whom they are fighting for. Washington is working, but it is just not working for the Amer-ican people. It is working for the giant corporations, it is working for the lob-byists, and it is working for the rich and powerful. Six of the 10 wealthiest counties in America are in and around Washington, DC. That is whom the Washington cartel works for. That is the basic divide. 
Indeed, as we look back over the last 
10 months, one is left with the conclu-sion—and a rather shocking conclu-sion—that Majority Leader M
CCONNELL  
has proven to be the most effective

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7649 October 29, 2015 
Democratic leader in modern times. 
Now, that is, in the parlance of Wash-ington, a surprising statement. 
Let’s take a moment to review the 
statistics. Between January and Sep-
tember 30 of this year, there have been a total of 269 rollcall votes. In the same time period in the prior Congress under H
ARRY REID, there were 211 rollcall 
votes. Let’s look at the differences, and in particular, I want to focus on the total number of times a majority of Democrats voted aye, a majority of Re-publicans voted no, and the measure passed. 
Now, if someone is an effective 
Democratic leader, you would expect them to be able pass legislation when a majority of Democrats support it and a majority of Republicans oppose it. In-deed, if you are a partisan Democrat, that would be almost the definition of an effective Democratic leader. Nine-teen times in the last 9 months, this so-called Republican majority has passed legislation and has had a vote succeed where a majority of Democrats supported it and a majority of Repub-licans opposed it. 
One example we can look to is DHS 
funding—funding for the Department of Homeland Security when President Obama issued his lawless and unconsti-tutional Executive amnesty. 
Republicans across the country cam-
paigned, promising to stop it. The Pre-siding Officer and I campaigned to-gether in his home State of Nebraska. I spent 2 months in the year 2014 cam-paigning with Republican Senate can-didates all over this country. I think for those 2 months before that election I slept in my own bed about 5 days. Over and over again, Republican Sen-ate candidates said: If you give us a majority in the Senate, we will stop this unconstitutional amnesty. 
I have to tell my colleagues I shared 
with Republican leadership, How about we honor that commitment. The re-sponse from leadership was, I didn’t say that. I can tell my colleagues Sen-ate candidates across this country did because I was standing next to them when they said it. 
What happened? When we voted, all 
45 Democrats voted aye; 100 percent of them. That is impressive for a leader to get 100 percent unanimity among his party. Notice I said ‘‘his party.’’ There is a reason I said that. Right now, sadly, the majority leader M
ITCH 
MCCONNELL is the most effective 
Democratic leader we have seen in modern times. One hundred percent of the Democrats were united. How about Republicans? Well, 31 voted no and 23 voted yes. So under this majority lead-er, the Democrats had their way and a majority of Republicans lost. 
Surely that is an outlier. Yes, the 
President was behaving lawlessly. Yes, he was behaving unconstitutionally. Yes, indeed, he was behaving, in his own terms, like an emperor. Let me note calling a President an emperor, that is fairly overheated rhetoric, but it is not my rhetoric, it is President Obama’s. President Obama was asked by activ-
ists, could he decree amnesty unilater-ally, and he said: I don’t have the con-stitutional authority to do so. I am not an emperor. Those are Barack Obama’s words: I am not an emperor. Just months later, magically, that same power he said he didn’t have under the Constitution—just months before a Presidential election—it materialized. Suddenly, the man who said ‘‘I am not an emperor’’ apparently became an em-peror, in his own assessment. Yet what did the Republican majority in the Senate do? It joined with 100 percent of the Democrats to overrule a majority of the Republicans in funding President Obama’s lawless amnesty, acting as an emperor. 
The Presiding Officer and I both sat 
through a Republican lunch a couple of weeks ago where our colleagues were quite puzzled why approval of the Re-publican majority is at such low levels. They couldn’t understand why right now Republicans in Congress have a 10- percent lower approval rating than we had in the middle of the shutdown. They were utterly befuddled by this. I am going to suggest a very easy rea-son. When our leader acts like an effec-tive Democratic leader, the people who elected us, their heads explode. Surely one might say this is an isolated exam-ple. 
Well, let’s look at the next example, 
yet another example, the Bennet cli-mate change amendment. This climate change amendment said climate change is real, it is manmade, it is a national security threat, and we need to act to stop it. Listen, let me say something on global warming. I am the son of two mathematicians and sci-entists. I believe we should be driven by the scientific evidence. Sadly, the far left is not interested in science or evidence, they are interested in poli-tics and political power. So when it comes to global warming, they do not want to confront the inconvenient truth, as Al Gore might put it, that the satellite data demonstrates there has been no significant warming whatso-ever for 18 years. They get very angry when we point that out. 
We had an amendment on that. How 
many Democrats voted for it? Oh, look, again, 46, 100 percent, every single Democrat. How many Republicans voted against it? Forty-seven and just seven Republicans voted for it. Yet it passed. 
That is an impressive victory for a 
Democratic leader. We just have 46 Democrats. For a Democratic leader to get a win with just 46 Democrats, that is impressive. That is what the current majority leader did. He produced a win, ran over the wishes of 47 Republicans. 
Let’s use another example: a motion 
to waive the budget rules on H.R. 2. This was the so-called doc fix. The doc fix has been a perennial challenge in Congress. It is part of Medicare that assumed unreasonable cuts in doctor reimbursement rates. For a time, it served a purpose. It actually allowed Washington politicians to shake down 
the doctors election after election after election to write checks. So for a time the Washington cartel liked the doc fix, but it came time to get rid of it, and getting rid of it was a good thing. Here is the problem. When we got rid of it, we didn’t pay for it. We just put it on a credit card. We didn’t do the hard work of figuring out how to pay for it, we just accepted more debt. Well, but at least it is not that much more debt. Well, unfortunately, it is. This so- called doc fix will spend more than $200 billion and add more than $140 billion to our deficits over the first 10 years and more than $500 billion to our Na-
tion’s deficits over 20 years—$500 bil-lion. Look, even in the world of Wash-ington, $500 billion is real money, but surely it is unreasonable to expect any-one to figure out how to pay for a doc fix. 
It is interesting that since 2004 Con-
gress has passed periodic doc fixes, and since 2004 doc fixes have been fully off-set 94 percent of the time—and 98 per-cent of the time if we count some of the budget gimmicks. If we count the gimmicks, it is 98 percent of the time. Just this time, $500 billion, no, we are not going to offset that. We are just going to put it on the credit part. After all, Obama has a platinum-encrusted, glow-in-the-dark AmEx. We will put it on your kids and my kids. 
What does that irresponsible prof-
ligate spending do? Well, how many Democrats voted for it? There is a sur-prise, every single one of them: 46 Democrats. The Republicans: 29 Repub-licans vote no, 25 vote yes. Now, for a Democratic leader, what a great vic-tory. A Democratic leader, with just 46 Democrats, added $500 billion in spend-ing without paying for it. Holy cow. I don’t recall H
ARRY REIDever being able 
to campaign saying: Give me a Demo-cratic majority and I will add $500 bil-lion in spending without paying for it. This is an accomplishment the prior Democratic leader, H
ARRY REID, was 
not able to achieve. Yet the current majority leader got this win for the Democrats. 
Let’s look at the next example: Con-
firmation of the Attorney General, Lo-retta Lynch. I serve on the Judiciary Committee. I participated in multiple hearings where Ms. Lynch over and over again refused to acknowledge any limits on President Obama’s authority whatsoever. When Ms. Lynch was asked how she would differ from Eric Holder, who has been the most lawless and partisan Attorney General this Na-tion has ever seen, she said: No way whatsoever. When pressed repeatedly if she could articulate even a single limit on the authority of this President, who has since implicitly declared himself an emperor, she refused to articulate even a single limit. When asked if she would appoint an independent pros-ecutor to investigate the IRS for wrongfully targeting citizens because of their free speech, because of their political views—mind you, something

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7650 October 29, 2015 
that when Richard Nixon tried to do it, 
the career professionals at the IRS re-fused. Richard Nixon was rightly de-nounced in bipartisan terms for at-tempting to use the IRS to target his political enemies. When the Obama ad-ministration not only attempted but succeeded in doing so, no one has been held to account. Instead, the Holder 
Justice Department, appointed and charged with the investigation a major Democratic donor who has given over $6,000 to President Obama and the Democrats. There is a Yiddish word for that, ‘‘chutzpah.’’ When you appoint a major Obama donor to be in charge of the investigation as to whether the Obama administration is targeting the political opponents of the President, miraculous, miraculous, the results we just saw: a whitewash, everyone was exonerated. 
Mistakes were made, we were told. It 
was rather classic. They used the same passive tense, passive voice as in the Watergate scandal: Mistakes were made. Yes, mistakes were made. Well, Ms. Lynch told us, no, she would not appoint a special prosecutor. 
Now, a number of Members of this 
body, a number of Republicans voted to confirm Eric Holder. That may or may not have been a mistake. I was not here at that time. I did not have the opportunity to examine his record prior to his being appointed Attorney General. I can understand those who voted yes. Prior to becoming Attorney General, Eric Holder had built a rep-utation, by and large, as a law-and- order prosecutor, and so we can under-stand Senators who would believe that his tenure as U.S. attorney, his tenure as Deputy Attorney General might sug-gest he would not be partisan in laws. With Ms. Lynch it was qualitatively different. With Ms. Lynch she told us she would do the very same thing. 
I suspect that quite a few people on 
this side of the aisle have given speech-es about the IRS target. No one should be surprised the Department of Justice has now exonerated everyone, because, you know what, we confirmed the At-torney General who basically told us she would do that. I would note, by the way, the majority leader had complete and unilateral authority. If we hadn’t taken up this nomination, she would not have been confirmed. Indeed, when President Obama put in place his ille-gal Executive amnesty, I publicly called on the soon-to-be majority lead-er. If the President violates the checks and balances of the Constitution, if the President usurps the authority of Con-gress, if the President ignores our im-migration laws, then the majority leader should have responded and said the Senate will not confirm any Obama nominees, executive or judicial, other than vital national security positions, unless and until the President rescinds his illegal amnesty. 
Now, that would have been strong 
medicine, to be sure. That is a serious pushback. It happens to be an author-ity directly given to the Congress by the Constitution as a check and bal-
ance. How do we get an imperial Presi-dency? We get an imperial Presidency when the other branches of the govern-ment lie down and hand over their au-thority. Nothing prevented the major-ity leader from doing so, other than that violates the norms of the Wash-ington cartel, and so instead it was the majority leader who brought this up for a vote. And what happened? Sadly, there is no drama or suspense anymore in looking to what happened. With the Democrats, all 46 Democrats voted to confirm Loretta Lynch—all 46—and 34 Republicans voted no. Yet she is con-firmed, and the lawlessness continues at the Department of Justice. 
I have to say for a Democratic leader, 
it is not clear to me H
ARRY REIDcould 
have gotten this done. H ARRY REID, in 
charge of this floor, with just 46 Demo-crats, it is not clear to me at all he could have gotten this done, but I have to say, Leader M
CCONNELL has proven 
to be a very effective Democratic lead-er. With just 46 Democrats, the out-come is exactly what H
ARRY REIDand 
the Democrats would want. 
Is this not a curious state of affairs? 
Why is a Republican majority leader fighting to accomplish the priorities of the Democratic minority? 
We will look at one other example, 
the Export-Import Bank. Now, Presi-dent Obama, when he was Senator Obama, described this as a classic ex-ample of corporate welfare. Over $100 billion in taxpayer-funded loan guaran-tees going to a handful of giant cor-porations, predominantly. Yet as we talked about before, if there is one thing the Washington cartel is good at, it is corporate welfare. The Export-Im-port Bank, how many Democrats? Here is a shot: Only 42 Democrats, not 100 percent. We had one, I believe it was B
ERNIE SANDERS . I will commend Sen-
ator S ANDERS for standing up against 
this corporate welfare. On that, he and I are on exactly the same page. Yet 42 Democrats, just 22 Republicans in favor of this corporate welfare; 28 Repub-licans voted no. Yet what happens? It passes. Now, it is not at all clear that H
ARRY REID, as Democratic leader with 
just 42 Democrats—it is not at all clear he could have gotten this done, but Leader M
CCONNELL , once again, is a 
very effective Democratic leader. 
And I would note one of Speaker 
BOEHNER ’s parting farewells was to tee 
up the Export-Import Bank in the House of Representatives. It expired this summer. We talked before about how the Budget Control Act was one of the few victories Republican majorities could point to. Actually, the expiration of the Ex-Im Bank is another one. An example of over $100 billion of taxpayer loan guarantees to a handful of giant corporations, and it expired. 
What does it say that in the period of 
2 weeks Republican majorities in both Houses are working to undo not one but both of the only two meaningful victories the Republican majorities have produced? And, mind you, for the same reason—because the cartel de-
mands it, because the giant corpora-tions want it, and because they want checks. 
What does that say? What does that 
say, indeed. Well, if you want to know what it says, we can look to the pre-vious Democratic leader, H
ARRY REID, 
who tweeted out: 
I commend Senate majority leader for set-
ting up a vote to reauthorize the Export-Im-port Bank. This bill is critically important for U.S. businesses. 
Set aside how rich it is for the Demo-
crats to be claiming to be fighting for U.S. businesses. Any time they say that, what they mean is cronies, be-cause when Washington, particularly under the Obama administration, fights for U.S. businesses, it is giant corporations and not the little guys. Over and over and over again it is those who employ armies of lobbyists and lawyers and accountants who get favors from Washington, because when Washington is handing out favors, it empowers politicians. Ayn Rand wrote in ‘‘Atlas Shrugged’’ about how produc-tive members of society, business own-ers, would be forced to go to parasitical politicians—although some suggest that is a redundant phrase—to go to parasitical politicians on bended knee begging for special dispensation. When you are standing for business, it means giant corporations that pay little to no taxes because they have tax loopholes carved in. It never means the mom and pop, it never means the little guy, it never means the Sabina Lovings of the world. 
Who is Sabina Loving? Sabina Loving 
is a woman who testified before the Senate in a hearing I chaired a couple of weeks ago. Sabina Loving is an Afri-can-American woman, a single mom who started a small tax preparation company on the South Side of Chicago. The Obama IRS put in place new rules regulating tax preparation authority, rules for which they had no legal au-thority. In fact, they used a statute called the Dead Horse Act as their jus-tification for regulating tax returns. 
The Obama IRS regulation exempted 
lawyers, it exempted high-priced ac-countants, it exempted the rich and powerful, the giant accounting firms, but Ms. Loving, who started this busi-ness on the South Side of Chicago, was facing thousands of costs—costs she felt that would drive her out of busi-ness. Ms. Loving sued the IRS and Ms. Loving won. If you want a historic and incredible story of a single mom stand-ing up against Big Government and the lawless regulations of the Obama IRS— well, you know what. Sabina Loving has no lobbyists in Washington. The Washington cartel doesn’t listen to the Sabina Lovings. It listens to the rich and powerful corporations that write checks to both parties because it is one party, the party of Washington. That is the sad reality of where we are.

people are frustrated. You want to know why they are ticked off. You

want to know why they cannot under-
stand. It is not that we keep losing elections. That would be frustrating, but you could understand. We have to do a better job. We have to motivate people. We have to convince people. We have to get a message that resonates. We keep winning and the people we elect don’t do what they said they would do. 
By the way, to leave the Ex-Im Bank 
unauthorized all Congress had to do was do nothing. If there is one thing the U.S. Congress is good at doing, it is doing nothing. 
Yet the phrase that gets repeated so 
often—Washington is broken—is actu-ally not true. Washington is working. It is just not working for the American people. It is working for the cartel, it is working for the lobbyists, the giant corporations, and those with power and influence in the Obama administration. This deal is a classic example of the Washington cartel. 
I would note, by the way, today we 
have a new Speaker of the House, P
AUL 
RYAN. I congratulate P AULRYANon his 
speakership. I hope we see bold, prin-cipled leadership from the new Speak-er. One of the things Speaker R
YANar-
ticulated was the Ryan rule, that under Speaker R
YANthey would not bring to 
the floor of the House any bill that didn’t have majority support among the Republican conference. 
I ask the Presiding Officer: Why 
doesn’t Majority Leader M
ITCH MCCON-
NELL articulate a similar rule for the 
U.S. Senate? If the Ryan rule is good enough for the U.S. House, why is the Ryan rule not good enough for the U.S. Senate? 
In every one of the examples I just 
gave were a majority of Democrats—in fact typically unanimous Democrats— beat a majority of Republicans. Every one of those would never have come to the floor if the Senate followed the Ryan rule. How about that for a mean-ingful reform; that if the majority leader disputes the characterization that he is the most effective Demo-cratic leader modern times has seen, how about the majority leader promul-gate a similar rule to the Ryan rule, that we will not bring to the Senate floor something that does not have ma-jority support from Republicans. That would be a sensible reform. Sadly, I think the odds of it happening are not significant. 
Here is the reality that the American 
people understand and it frustrates them. The cartel is all one happy home. The lameduck Speaker on his way out will no doubt land in a plush easy chair in the Washington cartel, will soon be making millions of dollars living off the cartel. The lameduck President when he moves on, like Bill Clinton before him, will make hun-dreds of millions of dollars. The cartel operates as one. In the Senate we have one leadership team. It is the McCon-nell-Reid leadership team, and in the House we have had the Boehner-Pelosi leadership team. They operate in com-plete harmony in Washington. That 
frustration is what is driving the grow-ing and growing rage of the American people every day. 
The truth is Republican leadership 
does not spend time thinking, How do we beat President Obama? How do we beat H
ARRY REID? How do we beat 
NANCY PELOSI ? How do we change any 
of these disastrous policies that are hurting millions of Americans? In-stead, leadership spends all their time thinking, How do we beat the conserv-atives in the House? How do we crush this freedom caucus—these crazy radi-cals who actually believe we do what we said we would do. What a shocking, revolutionary, radical statement for Washington, DC, that elected officials actually do what we told our constitu-ents we would do. 
Republican leadership with recent 
deals on Planned Parenthood—Repub-lican leadership led the fight to fund Planned Parenthood. Indeed, their press team went to the press and said: Isn’t it great, we boxed out conserv-atives. We played the procedural game so there was nothing conservatives could do to stop $500 million in tax-payer funding for Planned Parenthood. What does it say when I said Majority Leader M
CCONNELL is the most effec-
tive Democratic leader we have seen in modern times? You know what. H
ARRY  
REID didn’t spend that much time 
thinking about how to beat Repub-licans. Leader M
CCONNELL spends more 
time focused on how to defeat conserv-atives than H
ARRY REIDever did. That 
is the problem. It is our own leadership that cooks up deals. 
Why do you think we are voting at 1 
o’clock in the morning? Is that an acci-dent? It is by design, 1 o’clock in the morning. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain. Pay no attention to another $85 billion in debt. Pay no at-tention to the fact that it is the Repub-lican majority giving a blank credit card to Barack Obama. Votes at 1 in the morning, Republican leadership hopes no one notices, so right after we vote on it we can run out, get on planes, and fly home to our constitu-ents, and say: We have to stop the debt. 
I shudder to think for anyone stand-
ing too close to a politician who says we have to stop the debt after voting for this, the lightning strike that may hit them—the mendacity of this city. 
Leadership always counsels prudence 
and reasonableness. How is it prudent to continue bankrupting this Nation? How is it prudent to have gone from $10 trillion to over $18 trillion in debt? How is it prudent to stay with lan-guishing economic growth. From 2008 to today, the economy has grown on average 1.2 percent a year. That is pru-dent? How is it prudent to watch as your children and my children’s future is washed away? How is that reason-able? How is that pragmatic? 
Why are we not instead trying to fix 
these problems and not even just fix them all, not even solve everything with a perfect magical bow—because leadership plays this game: ‘‘You can’t 
let the perfect be the enemy of the good.’’ Where is the good? 
Leadership’s position is we can’t do 
anything. Leadership’s position is that with Republican majorities in both Houses, we should spend more—$85 bil-lion—than we did with a Democratic majority, $63 billion. Leadership will harumph us about expectations. You shouldn’t set unreasonable expecta-tions. Gosh, it seems to me it was lead-ership who said if we had a Republican majority in the Senate then we would fight. 
On what are we willing to fight? We 
may have some more show votes. By the way, we just had a show vote on sanctuary cities and Kate’s Law. Why wasn’t Kate’s Law attached to this bill? Why wasn’t sanctuary cities at-tached to this bill? Because that was something we actually campaigned on and we promised our constituents and the Democrats wouldn’t like that. 
Remember my question: What in this 
is Barack Obama unhappy about? Nothing. Because leadership’s position is we can do nothing. If we can do noth-ing then it makes one wonder what was all the fuss about winning the major-ity? 
I don’t believe we can win every 
fight. I don’t believe we can magically transform everything—at least not without winning the Presidency—but surely the alternative is not we can do nothing. Is there not a reasonable mid-dle ground that we can accomplish something? 
I would note the last time we had Re-
publican majorities in Congress and a Democratic President was Newt Ging-rich as Speaker of the House and Bill Clinton as President. We accomplished a great deal. We accomplished welfare reform. We balanced the budget. What have these Republican majorities done? Made the problem worse. 
As a result, with apologies to the late 
great journalist Michael Kelly, I want to sum up my views as simply saying I believe. 
I believe. I believe what Republican 
leadership tells us. I believe that every time the mainstream media echoes, leadership listens. Of course it is right that we cannot set expectations too 
high. We cannot promise too much. We cannot be expected to deliver on any of our promises. 
I believed Republican leadership 
when they said if only we had a Repub-lican majority in the House, then we would stand and fight. After winning the House in 2010, I believed the leader-ship, that if only we had a Republican majority in the Senate also, then we would stand and fight. 
Today I believe Republican leader-
ship that if only we had 60 votes in the Senate, then we would stand and fight. And if we were to get 60 votes, I will believe Republican leadership when they tell us, that if only we had 67 votes in the Senate, then we will fi-nally stand up and fight. 
I believe that there is no way Con-
gress could do anything whatsoever to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S7652 October 29, 2015 
stop ObamaCare or even to try to pro-
vide meaningful relief to millions who are hurt by that failed law every day. 
I believe that Congress has no power 
to do anything about the President’s unconstitutional Executive amnesty or sanctuary cities or anything else that might secure our borders. 
I believe that Republican majorities 
in both Houses of Congress can do nothing meaningful on spending or the debt or tax reform or regulatory re-form, that we can do nothing to rein in the EPA or CFPB, no matter how many millions of jobs they kill. 
I believe that Congress must acqui-
esce to the Obama administration’s de-claring the Internet to be a regulated public utility and the administration’s attempt to give away control of the Internet to an international cartel of stakeholders, including Russia and China. 
I believe that Congress can do noth-
ing—absolutely nothing—to stop this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal. Yes, it will send over $100 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who chants ‘‘Death to America’’ in front of mobs burning American and Israeli flags, and even though it threatens the security of Israel and potentially the lives of millions of Americans. 
I believe that Congress has the con-
stitutional power of the purse, but I be-lieve Congress can still do nothing whatsoever to protect the American citizens. 
I believe that Congress can do noth-
ing to protect religious liberty or free speech, that Congress must quietly ac-cept an IRS that targets citizens for exercising their constitutional rights and a President who ignores Federal law and Federal judges who disregard the text of the Constitution. 
I believed Republican leadership 
when they promised the American peo-ple that if only we had congressional majorities, we would fight ObamaCare and amnesty and lawlessness. And today, I believe Republican leadership when they say: Of course we cannot and will not do any of that. It was un-reasonable for anyone to have believed those promises in the first place. 
I believe that anytime President 
Obama threatens a shutdown, Repub-lican leadership is exactly right to sur-render and fund all of Obama’s Big Government priorities, to fund ObamaCare and amnesty and Planned Parenthood and the Iranian nuclear deal. Otherwise, Obama might shut down the government and it would be our fault. So we must do whatever he demands no matter what. 
I believe that it is unreasonable—rad-
ical even—to expect Congress to do any of the things we promised the voters on the campaign trail. 
I believe that when a Republican 
Speaker joins with N
ANCY PELOSI and 
the Democrats to fund all of Obama’s priorities, that it is the Republican Freedom Caucus who are the crazy ones saying we should stand for some-thing. I believe that when the Republican 
Senate majority leader publicly prom-ises there is no secret deal to reauthor-ize the Export-Import Bank and then 1 month later contorts procedural rules to force through the deal that he had claimed did not exist, that it is not his public lie that matters but, rather, it is the junior Senator who has violated de-corum by pointing it out, out loud. 
I believe that the only thing we can 
expect Republican majorities to do is expand government, reauthorize cor-porate welfare, and grow the debt. That is called governing—always said one octave lower in Washington. Governing is measured by how many bills you pass, and one cannot govern without agreeing with Democrats across the board. If we pass a lot of bills, even if they do nothing to address the debt or bring back jobs or economic growth and even if they actually expand Wash-ington power and make the problem worse, then I believe we should cele-brate. 
I believe that Democrats can never 
be forced to compromise on anything, that it is always unreasonable to ever try to win a political battle with them, and so it must always be the Repub-licans who agree to the Democrat’s Big Government priorities. I believe the only way Republicans can win is to continue making these same mistakes over and over and over again. 
Of course, I do sometimes wonder 
why it matters if we have Republican majorities in Congress. After all, lead-ership has told me that they cannot ac-complish anything different from the Democrats, that it is an unreasonable demand to expect them to fight Obama on anything. Since it is only the crazy ‘‘kamikaze caucus’’ who thinks we can fight Obama on any issue, anything whatsoever, I believe that leadership is right to fight on nothing, to pass the very same bills filled with pork and corporate welfare, the Export-Import Bank, ObamaCare funding, and am-nesty, and confirm the very same At-torney General the Democrats would have confirmed. 
I do wonder sometimes, as Hillary 
Clinton would have put it, what dif-ference does it make? But then I put aside such foolish thoughts. Instead, I believe.

MORNING BUSINESS 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that the Senate proceed to a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. 
R
OUNDS ). Without objection, it is so or-
dered.

JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Repub-
licans continue to object to requests for unanimous consent on basic things we should be able to do in a bipartisan manner here in the Senate. In addition to my request about gender discrimina-
tion, Republicans have previously ob-jected to unanimous consent requests to allow votes on noncontroversial ju-dicial nominees with bipartisan sup-port to fill vacancies in our Federal ju-diciary. These requests are not re-motely controversial; yet the Repub-licans continue to obstruct for obstruc-tion’s sake. 
Since the Republicans took over in 
January, their leadership has allowed only nine judges to be confirmed. A few district court judges have been con-firmed in the last few weeks, but this recent increase in activity is in sharp contrast to their inaction all year. When Senate Democrats were in the majority during the last 2 years of the Bush Presidency, we had already con-firmed 34 judges by this point—nearly four times more judges than Repub-licans have confirmed this year. 
Republicans have tried to justify 
their poor record by accusing Senate Democrats of scheduling votes for 11 judges during the lameduck session last December. They suggest that those 11 confirmations under last year’s Democratic majority should somehow be counted towards this year’s con-firmation numbers. First, it is well-es-tablished Senate precedent to approve all pending consensus nominees before the end of a year. And second, even if we did ignore reality and count these 11 judges towards the Republicans ma-jority’s record, that would only bring their count up to 20 confirmations this year. That is still far behind the 34 nominees that Democrats confirmed in the last 2 years of the Bush administra-tion. 
The glacial pace in which Repub-
licans are currently confirming uncontroversial judicial nominees is a failure to carry out the Senate’s con-stitutional duty of providing advice and consent. We should be responding to the needs of our Federal judiciary so that, when hard-working Americans seek justice, they do not encounter the lengthy delays that they currently face today. Because of Republican obstruc-tion, judicial vacancies have increased by more than 50 percent since they took over the majority this January and caseloads are piling up in courts throughout the country. 
We can and should take action right 
now to alleviate this problem by hold-ing confirmation votes on the 16 judi-cial nominees pending on the floor. A number of these pending nominees have the support of their Republican Senators; yet they continue to lan-guish on the calendar without a vote. 
If Republican obstruction continues 
and if home State Senators cannot per-suade the majority leader to schedule a vote for their nominees soon, then it is unlikely that even highly qualified nominees with Republican support will be confirmed by the end of the year. These are nominees that members of the majority leader’s own party want confirmed, including several from Ten-nessee and Pennsylvania. Last week,

we had a hearing for two Iowa nomi-
nees. I expect they will be reported out of the Judiciary Committee soon. We also have nominees from Massachu-setts, Florida, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Hawaii, and Maryland who are waiting for their confirmation hearings. None of these nominees are likely to be confirmed by the end of the year if Senate Republicans continue at this historically slow pace. 
I hope Republican Senators will im-
plore their leadership to vote on the pending judicial nominees without delay for the sake of the American peo-ple who seek justice before those courts.

60TH ANNIVERSARY OF NATIONAL 
ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORK-ERS 
Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish 
to recognize and commend the Na-tional Association of Social Workers, NASW, which is celebrating its 60th an-niversary this year. Today NASW is the largest membership organization of professional social workers in the world, with 130,000 members, including 3,500 in my home State of Maryland. As a social worker myself, I am proud to be a dues-paying, card-carrying mem-ber of NASW, and I congratulate them on 60 wonderful years. 
In 1955, seven organizations had the 
vision to come together to form NASW in an effort to unify and strengthen the social work profession. The visionary leaders of those organizations under-stood that we can achieve more when we work together. 
And they have achieved so much. In 
the six decades since NASW’s founding, members have been on the front lines, advocating and organizing for just causes such as fighting for child wel-fare and juvenile justice, working to end poverty, and protecting victims of domestic violence. NASW was directly involved in passing the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, and the Vi-olence Against Women Act and sup-ported the creation of Medicaid and Medicare. I have seen the importance of this work firsthand, as I began my own career as a social worker in Balti-more, helping at-risk children and edu-cating seniors about the Medicare pro-gram. 
NASW has been there time and again, 
to help social workers do what they do best—care for people at every stage and every age. Social workers reach every part of our communities, from hos-pitals and mental health clinics to cor-porations and schools. Working every day and in every way for others, social workers truly put service above them-selves. They meet people where they are—in their communities, in their homes, in their everyday lives. 
I am so glad that NASW has been 
such a wonderful champion and part-ner, fighting to make sure social work-ers have what they need to make a dif-ference for countless people nation-wide. From professional development, to ethics consultation, to publications 
on standards and changing trends in the profession, NASW continues to make a difference in the social work profession as it reaches its 60 year mark. 
Social workers do so much, and they 
deserve someone in their corner who works as hard for them as they work for others. That is why I was proud to reintroduce the Social Work Reinvest-ment Act this year, which would create a National Coordination Center for supporting and sharing the good work and research that social workers are doing around the country. The bill also includes grant funding for education, training, and research; and it is going to help address the social worker short-age with better recruitment, retention, and compensation. Just this month, I was also glad to be an original cospon-sor of the Improving Access to Mental Health Act of 2015, which would help seniors gain access to vital mental health services provided by social workers through the Medicare Pro-gram. 
Social workers constantly seek solu-
tions that reduce economic inequality, racism, hunger, and all forms of dis-crimination. They also ensure access to health care and mental health care for our Nation’s most vulnerable popu-lations. For the past 60 years, NASW members have cleared paths to bright-er days in America. And I am excited for what social workers and NASW will do in the next 60 years. Thank you.

REMEMBERING WWII VETERANS 
IN UMATILLA COUNTY, OREGON 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to 
commemorate the honorable veterans and civilians of Umatilla County, OR, who worked tirelessly and fought val-iantly for their community and coun-try during the Second World War. These brave men and women served in a variety of capacities on all fronts, working to support the war effort at home, defending our coastlines from attack, and risking their lives in battle overseas. As the country continues to mark the 70th anniversary of World War II this year, I am proud to raise my voice to pay tribute to the men and women of Umatilla County for their part in the Allied victory. 
Umatilla County played a unique and 
important role in helping our country achieve victory in World War II. In 1941, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers created an airport in Pendleton, OR, which became home to the U.S. Army Air Forces 17th Bombardment Group. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the 17th Bombardment Group was called upon to defend the west coast from Japanese submarines. The group’s aircraft and many of its members par-ticipated in the daring Doolittle Raid on Tokyo—the first U.S. bombing of the Japanese homeland. All 80 of Jimmy Doolittle’s raiders trained in Pendleton, and 5 of them were Orego-nians. Umatilla County also played home to 
another facility vital to the war effort: the Umatilla Army Depot, located near Hermiston, OR. The Umatilla Army Depot was a repository for munitions and supplies in hundreds of semisubterranean silos. The depot cre-ated an economic boom for Hermiston—then a town of 800—which ended up harboring 7,000 new workers. The Umatilla County Depot became the largest munitions facility in the world and stayed active in Hermiston until 2001. 
Umatilla County lost 86 people dur-
ing World War II, but their spirit and stories live on through their families and in their communities. One of these men, SGT Modie L. Hubbard, even has a great nephew who now works in my office. Sergeant Hubbard was killed in action, and his is just one of many sto-ries of those fearless men and women who died preserving the freedom of fu-ture generations. 
There is sometimes a temptation to 
focus on the massive scale of events like World War II, on the number of tanks built or brigades in the field. As we reflect on these and other aspects of America’s war effort, I would encour-age people to remember the commu-nities across this country—commu-nities like Umatilla County—that built those tanks or provided those soldiers. It must be our responsibility to honor these communities and their sacrifices to this great country, and it is my hope that their stories will continue to live on and inspire future generations of Americans to service.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO ALEX COLLIE 
∑Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I wish to 
recognize the incredible service of Alex Collie from Mackenzie, MT. Mr. Collie is the recipient of the National Weath-er Service’s General Albert J. Myer award for completing 65 years of serv-ice as a cooperative weather observer. 
The cooperative weather observers 
consists of 11,000 nationwide volunteers who record official weather observa-tions across the country. Mr. Collie joins an elite group of cooperative weather observers and is currently the longest serving observer in Montana’s history. Nationally, only 16 others have served in Mr. Collie’s capacity or 65 years or longer. His services are crit-ical to Montana—from supporting our farmers and ranchers by providing ac-curate forecasts and helping our truck drivers complete their routes safely and on schedule. 
This prestigious award was estab-
lished in honor of General Myer, who was an observer at Eagle Pass, TX, and became the chief of the Signal Service. In 1870, by a joint resolution of Con-gress and signed by President Ulysses S.

RECOGNIZING THE LAS VEGAS 
LATIN CHAMBER OF COM-MERCE’S 40TH ANNIVERSARY 
∑Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I 
wish to recognize the 40th anniversary of an important organization to south-ern Nevada, Las Vegas’ Latin Chamber of Commerce. I am proud to honor this chamber that contributes so much in support of Las Vegas’ Hispanic busi-ness community. As the premier Latin Chamber serving our Great State, it is a key contributor to the success of Ne-vada. I am pleased to see the Latin Chamber of Commerce reach this sig-nificant milestone, continuing to serve as an important ally to Las Vegas’ His-panic community. 
Without a doubt, the many Hispanic 
businesses, both small and large, lo-cated throughout the southern Nevada valley have greatly contributed to our State’s achievements. With the help of the Latin Chamber of Commerce, Las Vegas’ Hispanic business community has continued to grow and thrive, con-tributing to our State’s economy. Even in difficult economic times, the Latin Chamber of Commerce was there to support local Hispanic businesses and keep hard-working southern Nevada businessowners on their feet. The chamber has helped to cultivate a flourishing Hispanic business commu-nity through innovation, creativity, and ingenuity. The strong foundation it has built will be felt for years to come. 
Aside from helping local businesses 
expand, the Latin Chamber of Com-merce also brings southern Nevada’s Hispanic entrepreneurs unique oppor-tunities. The chamber provides numer-ous networking events, including luncheons, leadership programs, and seminars. It also prioritizes Nevada’s Hispanic youth by providing an aca-demic scholarship program for stu-dents, which offers opportunities for those wishing to pursue higher edu-cation. Alongside this program, the Latin Chamber of Commerce sponsors the Latino Youth Leadership Con-ference that brings together students from high schools across Nevada to provide them tools for a prosperous fu-ture. 
I have attended multiple Latin 
Chamber of Commerce events where I have spoken with the men and women who participate in this chamber, and I can attest to the incredible role they play within our community. Sixteen members serve on the Board of Direc-tors, bringing structure and direction to this significant entity. I am thank-ful for their leadership and for the 
great things they are doing for busi-nesses in southern Nevada. 
For the past 40 years, Las Vegas’ 
Latin Chamber of Commerce has prov-en its unwavering dedication to the great State of Nevada. The hard work of those that have served this chamber has greatly contributed to the excel-lent growth that we see in the city of Las Vegas today. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the Latin Cham-ber of Commerce on its 40th anniver-sary and thanking it for all it does to make Nevada’s business community the best it can be. ∑

FOCUSING ON WORKING FAMILIES 
SPEECH OF  
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Wednesday, October 28, 2015 
Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, thank you, Con-
gresswoman B ONNIE WATSON COLEMAN , for 
your tireless advocacy for working families. I’d also like to thank Ranking Member B
OBBY  
SCOTT for leading the way, as ranking member 
of the Education and Workforce Committee, and with this important agenda. 
Let me start by telling Andre’s story. Andre is from California, he’s 31 and a fa-
ther of four boys. He was a trained appren-ticed carpenter. 
When he began to look for work, he learned 
quickly that without a personal connection, it was nearly impossible to get a job in the con-struction industry. Every morning, he hustled to get to work sites by 5 AM to introduce him-self to employers and show them his skills. 
Seldom did he receive the opportunity to ac-
tually apply for a job. 
As a result, he could barely sustain his fam-
ily. Any income he had went to food, transpor-tation and rent. So, he began volunteering with the Los Angeles Black Workers Center, which connected him to a good-paying job building new rail lines that let him provide for his family. 
The unemployment and underemployment 
that Andre and other Black workers experi-ence is not unique. The use of informal net-works in hiring means that Black workers are often excluded and discriminated against be-fore they even get a shot. Andre said: ‘‘Too many people are out there talking about train-ing, like we’re not trained enough. Training is not the issue. I was trained really well. The issue is access.’’ 
Andre is right—all the training in the world 
won’t help if in the end, employers won’t give people like Andre a fair shot. 
And this agenda is designed to give Andre, 
his family and all families, a fair chance. 
Andre’s struggle reflects the divide in our 
economy and our country: while some have recovered fully from the Great Recession, too many working families are still struggling. 
And in communities of color, which were the 
hardest hit by the Great Recession, unemploy-ment and underemployment remains sky- high—and wage discrimination and formal and informal barriers to employment continue to slow economic growth. 
For example, African American women in 
my home state of California still earn just 64 cents for every dollar paid to white men. And Latinas earn a mere 44 cents. This persistent wage gap is a reflection of our economy, which is leaving too many working families be-hind—especially communities of color. 
That’s why the Working Family Agenda is 
so important. 
It takes long overdue steps to level the play-
ing field for all. Specifically, this agenda would: raise the 
wage for millions, strengthen collective bar-gaining and improve working conditions, pro-vide paid sick and family leave, and expand access to childcare. 
Furthermore, it would provide long overdue 
protections for women and LGBT Americans in the workplace. 
And as a former small business owner, I 
know the importance and value of providing your employees with a living wage: it’s better for your company and for retaining good work-ers. 
Mr. Speaker, now is the time to take action 
on this agenda—families need it and our economy needs it. Let’s boost wages, make it easier for families to balance work and family life, and bring an end to workplace discrimina-tion. 
That’s what American families want—and 
it’s what Congress should be working on.

RECOGNIZING JERRY DAVIS AS 
THE NORTHWEST FLORIDA AGRI-CULTURAL INNOVATOR OF THE YEAR 
HON. JEFF MILLER 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Thursday, October 29, 2015 
Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great pleasure that I rise to recognize Mr. Jerry Davis from Florida’s First Congressional District, for being selected as the Northwest Florida Agricultural Innovator of the Year. 
Jerry’s love of farming derives from his 
childhood, when he helped grow soybeans and wheat on his family’s farm. Since the be-ginning, Jerry has been an innovator in the agricultural arena. By the time he was 20, he designed a seed conditioning plant to clean and bag seed for planting. In 1987, he be-came involved in the testing of a crop simula-tion model developed by scientists in USDA’s Agricultural Research Services and Mississippi State and Clemson Universities. The model al-lowed participants to optimize inputs in relation to weather, nitrogen, moisture stress, crop ma-turity, growth resultants, and harvest aid mate-rials. As a result of this innovative project, Jerry and the other participating growers saw net profits on test fields increase by more than $30 per acre. 
In the late 1990s, Jerry began expanding 
his farming operation from Santa Rosa County to Escambia County in Florida and Baldwin and Hale counties in Alabama. At the time, he was the only peanut grower in Hale and one of the first in Baldwin. Similarly, he was one of the first farmers to grow 30-inch twin row pea-nuts and use grid sampling and precision agri-culture to perfect his technique over thou-sands of acres. 
Most recently, Jerry has partnered with the 
University of Florida, Institute of Food and Ag-ricultural Sciences to grow carinata, a plant that has the potential to help meet the renew-able energy demands of the United States. 
Along with Northwest Florida scientists, Jerry is testing the viability of carinata in Northwest Florida and its potential use as a source of re-newable jet fuel. 
The Davis family farming tradition continues 
today as his wife Patty and daughter Caitlynn are also active on the farm, which comprises cotton, peanuts, wheat, corn, soybeans, vege-tables, livestock, and other crops. 
Aside from his agricultural contributions, 
Jerry is known throughout his community for his kind nature and willingness to help others. Jerry has participated in 12 mission trips to Central and South America, spreading his faith and helping those in need, and every Thanks-giving, he and his family donate sweet pota-toes that are included in a box of Thanks-giving food that is provided to members of the Escambia and Santa Rosa counties in need. 
Despite his busy schedule, Jerry is always 
happy to promote Northwest Florida agri-culture and also has a very extensive civic re-sume including serving as District I Florida Farm Bureau Director since 2009, Santa Rosa County Farm Bureau President, Chairman of the Agricultural Research Committee for Cot-ton Incorporated, a member of the Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Peanut Advisory Committee, a member of the Southern Cotton Growers Farm Bill Task Force, and a director of the Florida and Southeastern Boll Weevil Eradication Foundation, Inc. Board. 
Mr. Speaker, Northwest Florida and our Na-
tion share a proud agricultural tradition built by the hard work of farmers and their families. The Northwest Florida Agricultural Innovator of the Year Award is a reflection of Jerry’s tire-less work and dedication to improving farming practices. On behalf of the United States Con-gress, I would like to offer my congratulations to Jerry Davis for being outstanding in his field. My wife Vicki and I extend our best wish-es to him and the Davis family for their contin-ued success.

RECOGNIZING GUITARS FOR 
HEROES 
HON. KENNY MARCHANT 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Thursday, October 29, 2015 
Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize a special veterans program in North Texas known as Guitars For Heroes. As an initiative through the Recreation Therapy Services of the VA North Texas Health Care System, the program was founded in 2012 by Fort Worth VA Outpatient Clinic Supervisor Donna Gerron with the objective of assisting veterans through music therapy. 
Guitars For Heroes provides veterans 12 
sessions of free instruction, acoustic guitars, and accessory kits with the intent of restoring joy and a renewed purpose in life. Veterans from all different backgrounds who are over-coming traumatic experiences, depression, or

isolation have found solidarity and restoration 
through the program. 
For over three years, Guitars For Heroes 
has mentored veterans into becoming fine mu-sicians. I am pleased to announce that they will be performing at the Annual Veterans Fair on November 7, 2015, in Grapevine, Texas. This annual event, made possible by the tire-less work of dedicated personnel, helps intro-duce veterans to important benefits, programs, and services. It will be a privilege to have Gui-tars For Heroes perform in front of the hun-dreds of attending veterans. 
As a special acknowledgment, I am pleased 
to recognize each member of Guitars For He-roes performing at the fair. These honorable veterans are Mike Andersen, James Benson, Steve Brenner, James Bullard, Rondal Burns, Keith Burrowes, Marco Garcia, Dujuan Jack-son, Brian Michel, Frank Precure, Juan Reyes, Alfred Schram, Roy Vaughn, Glen Wilson, and Bill Yohn. 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to acknowl-
edge the success of Guitars For Heroes, and I ask all of my distinguished colleagues to join me in recognizing this special program.

RECOGNIZING OCTOBER 29, 2015 AS 
DIRECT SELLING DAY 
HON. MARC A. VEASEY 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Thursday, October 29, 2015 
Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recog-
nize today, October 29, 2015, as Direct Selling Day. 
For years, the direct selling industry has 
made a significant impact on both families and the economy in Texas and across the nation. 
Today, more than 18 million Americans, 
hailing from every state, Congressional district and community in the United States, are in-volved in direct selling. 
For many individuals, direct selling is one of 
the most flexible businesses there is, and in today’s busy world having an opportunity to work at one’s own pace and earn additional income is beneficial and convenient when indi-viduals are trying to balance work with family and other priorities. 
Out of the more than 18 million Americans 
involved in direct selling, more than two million reside in Texas. Many of the residents I rep-resent in Dallas and Fort Worth chose direct selling to provide economic security for their families. 
Their efforts contribute more than $34 mil-
lion to the U.S. economy, helping individuals build their businesses while supporting their local and national economies. 
As the economy continues to change and 
place more emphasis on flexibility, the direct selling industry will continue to grow and pros-per. 
It is clear that the direct selling companies 
across Texas and around the country are committed to helping the next generation of American entrepreneurs. Since its founding in September 2015, the Direct Sellers Caucus has worked to build greater awareness of di-rect selling and discuss policy issues relevant to the industry, ensuring that these companies can continue to make an impact on the lives of those involved. 
In honor of the Direct Sellers Association’s 
day on the Hill and the impact the industry has on both local communities and the nation as 
a whole, this statement will be submitted.

IN RECOGNITION OF SERGEANT 
MAJOR ALAN M. GIBSON 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Thursday, October 29, 2015 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and commend Sergeant Major Alan M. Gibson, the Division G3 Ser-geant Major for the 4th Infantry and Fort Car-son, Colorado, who will be retiring from the United States Army after 32 years of distin-guished service to the United States of Amer-ica. He will be honored at a retirement cere-mony on Friday, October 30, 2015 at Fort Benning, Georgia. 
A Georgia man through and through, Ser-
geant Major Alan Gibson is originally from Co-lumbus, Georgia and graduated from Morris Brown College in Atlanta, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Therapeutic Recreation/Kinesiology in 1982. He is currently working on a Master’s degree from Central Michigan University. SGM Gibson joined the United States Army in October 1983 and com-pleted basic training at Fort McClelland, Ala-bama and Advanced Individual Training at Fort Benning, Georgia. In his first assignment, he served as an Infantryman in the Berlin Bri-gade from March 1984 to October 1985. 
After departing Berlin, Germany, SGM Gib-
son attended Airborne School and the Ranger Indoctrination Program (RIP) prior to being as-signed to 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regi-ment, at Fort Benning while he served as a Rifleman, Team Leader, and Squad Leader from October 1985 to April 1989. In fact, he would return to Fort Benning several times throughout his career. He also served in nu-merous leadership and staff positions at Fort Myer, Virginia; Yongsan, Korea; Fort Monroe, Virginia; and Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where he was the Sergeant Major for the Cen-ter for Army Leadership for the Combined Arms Center (CAC). 
SGM Gibson served four combat tours, in-
cluding Operation Just Cause in Panama; Op-eration Iraqi Freedom 1 in Iraq; Operation En-during Freedom (OEF 13–14) in Afghanistan; and he deployed in support of Operation En-during Freedom in Kuwait. 
SGM Gibson is a highly decorated non-com-
missioned Army officer. His numerous awards and decorations include the Bronze Star Medal with V devices, Bronze Star w/ 1OLC, Purple Heart, Meritorious Service Medal, Com-bat Infantryman Badge (2nd Award), Expert Infantryman Badge, Master Parachutist Badge with Bronze Star, Pathfinder Badge, Aviation Crewmember Badge, Canadian Parachutist Badge, German Schutzenschnur Badge (Sil-ver), and the coveted Ranger Tab, among many others. SGM Gibson also was awarded the Order of Saint Maurice (Infantry), and Order of The Combat Spurs (Cavalry). 
On a personal note, I am proud to call SGM 
Alan Gibson my friend. I have witnessed first-hand his compassionate leadership and his enduring dedication to our great nation. Throughout his distinguished career, SGM Gibson has consistently exhibited the Seven Core Army Values of Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless Service, Honor, Integrity, and Per-
sonal Courage. 
SGM Gibson has certainly accomplished 
many things in his life but none of this would have been possible without the love and sup-port of his wife, Cheryl, and their three daugh-ters, Asia Rochelle, Alana Shantelle and Ariel Danae `. 
Mr. Speaker, today I ask my colleagues to 
join me and my wife, Vivian, in extending our sincerest gratitude and best wishes to Ser-geant Major Alan Gibson and his family, on the occasion of his retirement from a stellar career of 32 years in the United States Army.

RECOGNIZING THE HENDRICKS 
FAMILY AS THE 2015 SANTA ROSA COUNTY, FLORIDA, OUT-STANDING FARM FAMILY OF THE YEAR 
HON. JEFF MILLER 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Thursday, October 29, 2015 
Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great pleasure that I rise to recognize the Hendricks Family from Jay, Florida, for being selected as the 2015 Santa Rosa County, Florida, Outstanding Farm Family of the Year. 
A fourth generation farmer, Rick Hendricks 
was only six years old when he first began to work on the farm alongside his father, B.D. By the age of 12, he had graduated to using a selective tractor, and as a teenager, he worked on the farm after school and athletic practices before going off to college at Living-ston University. Rick played football at Living-ston before his love of the farm brought him home. 
During Rick’s farming career, several 
changes have taken place in the agricultural industry, and he has witnessed and experi-enced the new picker/balers, as well as changes in cotton and peanut production equipment from two-row to six-row. Over the years, the Hendricks’ family farm has grown and incorporated new technology, and today, in addition to his own farming operation, Rick manages Hendricks and Son Farms, Inc. and B.D. Hendricks Farm, which in total covers 2,250 acres and includes 200 brood cows and row crops of cotton, peanuts, and hay. 
To Rick, his wife Nina of 27 years, and their 
children, Brandt, Rush, and Tessa, farming is an investment in their future. It is Rick’s hope, that the value of hard work instilled in him by his parents, will also create the strong founda-tion for future success for his children. It is also truly a family affair, and today the Hen-dricks family farm is also operated by Rick’s sister, Vicki; nephews, Tanner and Todd; as well as full time employee, Dylan Barnes. 
In addition to the hours spent on the farm, 
Rick has served as a member and advisor of many organizations including terms as Presi-dent of the Board for Santa Rosa County Farm Bureau and the Jay Peanut Farmers Co-operative. 
Mr. Speaker, Northwest Florida and our Na-
tion share a proud agricultural tradition built by the hard work of farmers and their families. The Santa Rosa County Outstanding Farm Family of the Year Award is a reflection of Rick and his family’s tireless work and dedica-tion. On behalf of the United States Congress,

HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Thursday, October 29, 2015 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate Victor Moreno on his retirement from serving as Chief of Police for East Moline Police Department. Victor is rightfully being honored by the East Moline Police Department for his longstanding dedication to the commu-nity. 
Victor has served a total of 26 years with 
the department. He has been Chief of Police since 2004 and has given so much comfort to the community with his dedication to public safety. Victor has held himself to the highest moral standard. 
Victor has enriched the lives of all those 
around him. Fortunately, he will continue to serve his community by teaching law enforce-ment and public safety at United Township High School. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Victor for 
his commitment to the East Moline Commu-nity. I congratulate him again on his well- earned retirement and wish him luck in his fu-ture endeavors.

CONGRATULATING MASTER SER-
GEANT DANIEL LIND WILLIAMS ON HIS RETIREMENT FROM THE MARINE CORPS 
HON. MARK TAKAI 
OF HAWAII  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Thursday, October 29, 2015 
Mr. TAKAI. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of myself 
and Congresswoman T AMMY DUCKWORTH , I 
would like to take the time today to recognize Master Sergeant Daniel Lind Williams, an American patriot who has devoted his career to working in the United States Marine Corps. 
In 1995, Master Sergeant Williams joined 
the Marine Corps and has served honorably as a Marine ever since. Starting as a training instructor, he was responsible for range scheduling and marksmanship. He was award-ed the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal for high standards of professionalism as a junior Marine and has been decorated with numerous commendations since, including the Bronze Star. 
Throughout his career working in counter-
intelligence and in special operations he has worked on a variety of vital projects leading to a more stable Afghanistan and Iraq. From as-sisting with the re-opening of the U.S. Em-bassy in Kabul, Afghanistan, to working as a counterintelligence representative to the in-terim Iraqi Government, he has worked to en-sure that the society that we live in today is a safer one. Master Sergeant Williams, thank you for all 
your years of service to the United States; you have the deepest gratitude of a thankful na-tion. As you are surely aware, the Marine Corps and the United States are proud of all that you have accomplished for our safety and security as well as the safety and security of our international allies abroad. Thank you very much (mahalo nui loa) for your devotion and patriotism to our country.

SPEAKER BOEHNER TRIBUTE 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Thursday, October 29, 2015 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor 
and privilege to pay tribute to my friend, J OHN 
BOEHNER , who has proudly served as Speaker 
of the House of Representatives since Janu-ary 5, 2011. 
As many people know, Speaker B
OEHNER is 
the son of a bartender and one of 12 children. The people of southwest Ohio have elected him to serve as their Representative in the House on thirteen separate occasions. 
During his service in the House, Speaker 
B
OEHNER has distinguished himself by regu-
larly stepping forward to tackle important chal-lenges facing his Ohio constituents and the country. 
J
OHN BOEHNER was elected to serve as 
House GOP Conference Chairman following the election of a historic Republican majority in 1992. As Conference Chairman, B
OEHNER  
played a key role in the adoption of the Bal-anced Budget Act, which limited spending, helped grow the economy, and resulted in the first budget surplus in decades. He played a central role in shaping and fulfilling the Con-tract with America. 
Later while serving as Chairman of the 
House Education and Workforce Committee, B
OEHNER co-wrote the bill establishing the first 
private school choice program in the District of Columbia, and worked to ensure historic pa-rental choice provisions were included in the bipartisan No Child Left Behind Act. 
In 2007, J
OHN was chosen by his Repub-
lican colleagues to serve as the House Re-publican Leader. In that role, he led the charge and a unified Republican Conference in opposition to job-killing bills like ObamaCare and a cap-and-trade energy tax, as well as the opposition to the wasteful Obama-Pelosi eco-nomic stimulus bill of 2009. 
As Speaker of the House, J
OHN BOEHNER  
has continued his legacy of reform. The House has enacted landmark changes that in-crease transparency and give Americans ac-cess to data and information that it never had before. Speaker B
OEHNER also oversaw the 
first meaningful change to entitlement pro-grams in many years as well as significant re-ductions to the reckless spending levels that became the norm under the previous Demo-cratic majority. 
Earlier this year, Speaker B
OEHNER ’s long-
time goal of having a Pope address Congress for the first time was realized when Pope Francis addressed a Joint Meeting of Con-gress. That historic address was a source of inspiration for Congress and the nation, and 
was a clear crowning achievement for Speak-er B
OEHNER . 
It is clearly evident by his record that 
Speaker B OEHNER has been one of the most 
instrumental and effective members to ever serve in this body. However, I must tell you that in my opinion, he is an even better person than he is a Member of Congress. J
OHN 
BOEHNER , and his wife Debbie, have become 
close and dear friends of mine. I will always value their friendship, support, and words of encouragement. 
Thank you, Speaker J
OHN BOEHNER , for 
your service as a happy warrior. Godspeed, old pal.

Thursday, October 29, 2015 
Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate the University of Central Florida’s Collegiate Cyber Defense Club, for winning the National Collegiate Cyber Defense Com-petition this past April. They beat nine other teams to become national champions for the second year in a row. 
The club, also known as Hack@UCF, was 
created in 2012 by students who wanted to compete in regional and national cyber de-fense competitions. The competition, orga-nized by the Center for Infrastructure Assur-ance and Security, is the nation’s most pres-tigious collegiate data defense competition. Ten regional contests around the country in-cluded roughly 200 teams consisting of more than 2,400 students. The winning students are, Alexander Davis, Andres Giron, Austin Brogle, Carlos Beltran, Conner Brooks, Jason Cooper, Jonathan Lundstrom, Kevin Colley, Kevin DiClemente, Nathan Dennis, Shane Welch, and Tyler Dever. 
It is my pleasure to recognize the University 
of Central Florida and the students of the Col-legiate Cyber Defense Club for winning its second national championship. I congratulate the hard-working faculty and outstanding stu-dents that make the University a destination for our nation’s best and brightest minds. Go Knights.

NATIONAL FARM TO SCHOOL 
MONTH 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Thursday, October 29, 2015 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, October is Na-
tional Farm to School Month, an important op-portunity to celebrate the close connection be-tween local schools and local food in commu-nities throughout the country. Farm to School initiatives play an important role in growing that connection, improving child nutrition, sup-porting local jobs and economies, and edu-cating the next generation about the sources of their food. 
Many of our rural communities are strug-
gling. Meanwhile, access to affordable, nutri-tious food continues to be a challenge for many inner city communities. With these trends at work, it will be especially important to grow our Farm to School initiatives. One such initiative in Sandusky, Ohio connects stu-dents and their families with fresh, healthy food and local food producers. These pro-grams are vitally important because they bridge the gap between rural and urban com-munities and help build local food systems that provide food security and independence. 
It is no wonder that Farm to School pro-
grams are cropping up all over the country, today reaching more than 40,000 schools and over 25.5 million students. Here are the out-comes: 
For Farmers: Growing sales opportunities. 
Reliable demand. Expanded community inter-est in local foods. 
For Schools: Reduction in child obesity; 
fresh and local food options that increase par-ticipation rates in school food programs, there-by boosting revenues. 
For the Community: Keeps food dollars in 
the community; ensures healthy local farms that provide jobs, pay taxes, and protect work-ing agricultural land. 
Mr. Speaker, America’s Farm to School pro-
grams are a win-win-win scenario. 
So as we conclude this month long celebra-
tion, I urge my colleagues in the House to support H.R. 1061, The Farm To School Act of 2015 introduced by Congressman F
ORTEN -
BERRY , which reauthorizes Farm to School 
programs through FY 2021 and allows land grant colleges and universities to participate as well. 
Connecting our nation’s schools to locally 
produced nutritious foods is not a partisan issue. It affects both Democratic and Repub-lican districts. The House has an opportunity to act on this pressing matter with dispatch today. I suggest we take it.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF 
FORMER WASHINGTON STATE SENATOR SCOTT BARR 
HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Thursday, October 29, 2015 
Mrs. M CMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor my close mentor and friend, former Washington State Senator Scott Barr, who passed away in his Colville, Wash-ington home last week at the age of ninety- 
nine. It is especially sad that we will not be able to celebrate his 100th birthday at Edwall Park in August. Washington State lost a pas-sionate leader, one who faithfully served his community and the people of Northeastern Washington. 
Before serving in the state legislature, Sen-
ator Barr grew wheat and raised cattle near Edwall, Washington. His experience as a farmer encouraged him to become more in-volved in his local community, culminating in his run for a seat in Washington’s 7th Legisla-tive District. In 1976, Senator Barr was elected to the Washington State House of Represent-atives where he served for seven years before being elected to the Washington State Senate. In the Senate, Senator Barr was a tireless champion for Northeastern Washington, focus-ing on issues closest to his constituents, agri-culture and natural resources. It was often said that if three people were gathered at a meeting in the 7th Legislative District, Senator Barr would be one of them. 
Throughout his career, Senator Barr served 
as the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture and the Western States Legislative Forestry Task Force, co-chaired the Joint Se-lect Committee on Water Resource Policy, and served as the Ranking Republican Mem-ber on the Agriculture and Ecology and the Parks committees. In December 1993, Sen-ator Scott Barr announced his retirement from the Washington State Senate, at the age of seventy-seven. Even after his retirement, Sen-ator Barr continued to be a champion for the 7th Legislative District, working to preserve the way of life that those in his community enjoy. 
Senator Barr served as the president of the 
Washington Association of Wheat Growers, headed up the Expo Food and Soil Associa-tion, and supported youth development through local 4–H programs. Senator Barr was also instrumental in ensuring 4–H programs continued to function and thrive throughout Washington State. Before running for the state legislature, Senator Barr was also a key advo-cate on behalf of the Lincoln County Con-servation District. 
On a personal level, Scott was a friend and 
a role model, not only to me but to everyone serving in Eastern Washington and across our state. Scott desired to better the lives of those around him and to support young people in order that they may reach their full potential. Even in his late nineties, Scott had a con-tagious energy and excitement for life—he was committed to giving back and remained active in his community. 
I rise to thank Senator Scott Barr for his 
years of service to Northeastern Washington. He leaves behind a legacy in leadership and devotion to his community and will be remem-bered for his commitment to issues close to the hearts of the people of Washington State. My thoughts and prayers remain with his wife, Dollie Mae, his children, and other family members and friends. Washington State lost a truly dedicated and passionate leader. He will be missed.

ELKINS COLLEGE 
HON. ALEXANDER X. MOONEY 
OF WEST VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Thursday, October 29, 2015 
Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speak-
er, I would like to congratulate Davis & Elkins College in Elkins, West Virginia for their recent acceptance into the Museum Assessment Pro-gram (MAP). This program will help develop and improve the College’s already outstanding collection, which includes pieces from Native American history, to traditional Appalachian culture, and showcases West Virginia’s rich history. This accomplishment required the hard work and dedication of the students, fac-ulty, and staff of Davis & Elkins College. It makes me proud to see colleges like Davis & Elkins thriving. I wish everyone involved with this great achievement the best in their future studies and careers.

HONORING MR. RONALD S. 
MOULTRIE 
HON. C.A. DUTCH RUPPERSBERGER 
OF MARYLAND  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Thursday, October 29, 2015 
Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
before you today to honor Ronald S. Moultrie, a United States Intelligence Officer for the Na-tional Security Agency (NSA), on the occasion of his retirement. Mr. Moultrie has honorably served our country for over 36 years, including time spent in the United States Air Force and the Central Intelligence Agency. 
Throughout his illustrious career, Mr. 
Moultrie’s most notable position was his ten-ure as Director of the Signals Intelligence Di-rectorate (SIGINT) program at NSA. As Direc-tor, he led a civilian and military workforce, while effectively guiding the integration and transformation of SIGINT reporting, dissemina-tion, and collection capabilities. 
His duties at NSA led him to be a key voice 
in global operational activities of critical impor-tance to the Department of Defense and the Intelligence Community. He is considered to be one of NSA’s foremost active senior execu-tives, with a strong focus on diversity efforts. 
Throughout Mr. Moultrie’s career he has 
been awarded numerous honors including, the USAF Meritorious Service Medal (1983), De-fense Meritorious Service Medal (1986), NSA Meritorious Civilian Service Award (1996, 1998), NSA Exceptional Civilian Service Award (2000, 2001, 2015), NSA Director’s Distinguished Service Medal (2004), National Intelligence Superior Service Medal (2008), Presidential Rank Award: Meritorious Execu-tive (2011), and the National Intelligence Dis-tinguished Service Medal (2014). 
Mr. Moultrie graduated from the University 
of Maryland, College Park Magna Cum Laude with a Bachelor of Arts. He then attended the Defense Intelligence College, where he earned a Master’s of Science. Subsequently, he enrolled at the Federal Executive Institute and later became an Intelligence Fellow at the Harvard University Kennedy School of Busi-ness. 
Mr. Moultrie is married and lives with his 
wife near Annapolis, Maryland where they are

Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join with me 
today to honor Mr. Moultrie and his lifelong dedicated service to the United States govern-ment and the Intelligence Community. It is with great pride that I congratulate Mr. Moultrie on his retirement and wish him the best of luck in all his future endeavors.

RECOGNIZING OCTOBER AS DOWN 
SYNDROME AWARENESS MONTH 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Thursday, October 29, 2015 
Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. 
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased today to rec-ognize October as Down Syndrome Aware-ness Month. Down syndrome is a congenital disorder arising from a chromosome defect, likely a full or partial copy of chromosome 21. This defect causes intellectual impairment and physical abnormalities. 
Approximately 1 in 700 babies in the United 
States are born with Down syndrome. Infants with Down syndrome are more likely to have other medical issues such as hearing loss, heart defects, and various eye diseases. Fur-thermore, African American infants born with Down syndrome have a lower chance of sur-viving past the first year of life than infants with Down syndrome from other racial and ethnic backgrounds. The economic impacts on the families of 
those with Down syndrome are also stag-gering. Medical care costs for children in their first four years are twelve times higher than the costs associated with a child without Down syndrome. Nearly 40 percent of families have suffered a financial setback or have forced a family member to stop working because of the child’s condition. 
Progress has been made in some areas 
that impact individuals with Down syndrome. The life expectancy for individuals with this disability has greatly increased. The 21st Cen-tury Cures Act, a bipartisan bill that passed the House of Representatives earlier this ses-sion, provides additional funding to the Na-tional Institute of Health for medical research that one day may move the needle of innova-tion in research and treatment forward enough to improve the lives of individuals with Down syndrome. 
I am pleased to recognize the 400,000 
Americans with Down syndrome and the fami-lies who have sacrificed so that these individ-uals can live their lives to the fullest. IN RECOGNITION OF THE DEEP 
LOSS BEING EXPERIENCED BY NEW MEXICAN COMMUNITIES DUE TO THE DEATH OF LILLY GARCIA 
HON. BEN RAY LUJA´N 
OF NEW MEXICO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Thursday, October 29, 2015 
Mr. BEN RAY LUJA ´N of New Mexico. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to express the sorrow and profound loss that is being felt in commu-nities across New Mexico following a heinous act of violence that took the life of an innocent young girl. 
Four year-old Lilly Garcia was in the back 
seat of her car with her family, when in a case of road rage, a bullet that was fired at her car, hit her, and killed her. This senseless violence was shocking and heartbreaking. It has shak-en our community to its core. We cannot turn a blind eye to violence like this. Sadly this story of violence is not unique. 
In Rio Rancho we lost Officer Gregg Benner 
who was shot and killed in the line of duty, and in Albuquerque, Officer Daniel Webster died this week after he too was shot in the line of duty. We must have a real discussion about how we address the violence that has taken the lives of too many loved ones, and only by coming together as a community can we make a change. 
My heart goes out to the family of Lilly Gar-
cia and all those who have lost someone they love to violence.
