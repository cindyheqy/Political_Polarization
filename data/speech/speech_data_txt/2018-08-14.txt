PRAYER Reverend Michael Wilker, Lutheran Church of the Reformation, Wash-ington, D.C., offered the following prayer: Gracious God, this week as Chris-tians celebrate the life of Mary, the mother of Jesus, we pray like Martin Luther that government officials learn to govern well by listening to Mary’s song, the Magnificat. Open our hearts to magnify Your glory and grace, O God. Open the eyes of officials to see people who live under poverty and oppression. Lift up people who are lowly and take down officials who are arrogant. Feed both the wealthy and impoverished with Your justice and mercy. As You have saved our ancestors and as You have promised to do for our de-scendants, give today’s leaders the same joy, wisdom, courage, and trust that You gave to Your servant Mary, the bearer of Your holy Word, Jesus Christ. Amen.

REMEMBERING SHIRLEY ANN BYARD 
HON. BONNIE WATSON COLEMAN 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 14, 2018 Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Shirley Ann Byard, who passed away on August 5, 2018. Mrs. Byard was born in Scotland County, North Carolina on November 13, 1940 as one of nine daughters of Clyde and Pauline Ben-nett. She graduated from West Badin High School, Badin, NC in 1958. Mrs. Byard at-tended Barber-Scotia College and Winston Salem State University and received her un-dergraduate degree from Rutgers University in 1972. While attending Winston Salem State, Mrs. Byard participated in the Woolworth Lunch Counter protests during the Civil Rights Movement. Mrs. Byard came to Trenton in 1962 and later worked for the City of Trenton for 30 years. She retired in 2002 as the Program Co-ordinator for the Office on Aging. Prior to that Mrs. Byard held numerous positions in the city, state, and nonprofit sectors. Mr. Speaker, Mrs. Byard was a lifetime member of the N.A.A.C.P., member of the Na-tional Political Congress of Black Women, member of the Urban League Guild of Metro-politan Trenton and Delta Sigma Theta Soror-ity, Inc. She was also a long-time member of the Bronzettes, Inc. in affiliation with the New Jersey Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs. Mrs. Byard was also a devoted and faithful member of Shiloh Baptist Church. While with family in Maryland, she fellowshipped at Com-munity of Hope A.M.E. Church in Temple Hills. I am grateful for Mrs. Byard’s work in the Trenton area. Not only was she a loving wife, and proud mother and grandmother, she was also a faithful and uplifting presence for her entire community—particularly seniors. I per-sonally found her to be remarkably generous in her kindness to everyone she encountered. Mr. Speaker, frankly, we need more Shirley Ann Byards. I am happy that she leaves a shining example for future generations to emu-late. It is an honor to share with the United States House of Representatives the memory of Shirley. The Trenton community, and in fact our nation as a whole, was made better through her selfless work and tireless service. With that, on behalf of my constituents in the greater Trenton area, I ask that my col-leagues join me in commemorating the won-derful life and legacy of Shirley Ann Byard.

TRIBUTE TO MARLENE AND LARRY PEARSON 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 14, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Marlene and Larry Pearson of Glenwood, Iowa on the very special occasion of their 50th wedding anni-versary. They were married on June 15, 1968 in Chicago, Illinois. Marlene and Larry’s lifelong commitment to each other and their family truly embodies Iowa values. As they reflect on their 50th anni-versary, I hope it is filled with happy memo-ries. May their commitment grow even strong-er, as they continue to love, cherish, and honor one another for many years to come. Mr. Speaker, I commend this great couple on their 50th year together and I wish them many more. I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating them on this momentous occasion. f 
RECOGNIZING THERESA ‘‘TERRIE’’ IACINO 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 14, 2018 Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Theresa ‘‘Terrie’’ Iacino on the oc-casion of her retirement from her position as the Executive Director of Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Monterey. Mrs. Iacino leaves behind a legacy of dedicated public service. Mrs. Iacino was born in Denver, Colorado and obtained her bachelor’s degree in 1972 from Loyola Marymount University. Mrs. Iacino worked as an administrator for the Catholic Di-ocese of San Jose for twenty-five years. She also taught elementary school at St. Alphonsus School in East Los Angeles and junior high in Cupertino, California. Mrs. Iacino later served as the first Director of Step of Sil-icon Valley, spearheaded the campaign to cut poverty at Catholic Charities of Santa Clara County, and assumed the position of Execu-tive Director of Catholic Charities of the Dio-cese of Monterey in 2012. During her tenure, Mrs. Iacino was instru-mental in upgrading the Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Monterey’s technology system. These upgrades included the installation of vital programs and a redesign of the organiza-tion’s website. In addition, Mrs. Iacino rede-signed and expanded Catholic Charities Fam-ily Supportive Services, a program that pro-vides council for lower income families on achieving financial stability. Mrs. Iacino also extended aid to immigrant families seeking lawful long-term residence in the United States by expanding the organization’s Immigration and Citizenship programs. In addition to her position with Catholic Charities, Mrs. Iacino has dedicated herself to other community causes. She has served as a member of the National Board of the Emer-gency Food and Shelter Program, where she fought to provide food and shelter assistance to residents in need in Monterey, Santa Cruz, San Luis Obispo, and San Benito counties. The mission of Catholic Charities of the Dio-cese of Monterey is to provide specified human services to the poor and disadvan-taged, promote social justice, peace, human dignity, self-determination, and self-sufficiency in accordance with the Gospel and Catholic social justice teachings. Throughout her long career, Mrs. Iacino has successfully carried out this selfless mission. Mr. Speaker, I stand with Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Mon-terey and the entirety of California’s 20th Dis-trict in expressing our gratitude for Theresa ‘‘Terrie’’ Iacino’s many years of meritorious service. f 
STAND UP FOR U.S. WORKERS 
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO SABLAN 
OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 14, 2018 Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, the recently an-nounced decision to lay off ‘‘temporarily’’ hun-dreds of U.S. workers at the Imperial Pacific International casino construction site in the Northern Mariana Islands raises serious con-cerns about the use of foreign labor at this project. Pacific Rim, the contractor, announced the lay-off in July pending ‘‘contract renegoti-ations.’’ Meanwhile, work will go on, using for-eign workers with H–2B visas to replace the U.S. workers. Even half-finished, the Imperial Pacific Inter-national casino has lifted the economy of the Marianas. So, local news has focused on re-assuring the public that work to complete the casino and its associated resort would con-tinue. But these reassurances mean little to the U.S. workers who have lost their jobs, or to their families. It also raises the question of why the U.S. Department of Labor, as it has reported to me, issued 1,668 foreign labor certifications to Im-perial Pacific International to hire the H–2B visa holders, who are now taking the jobs of U.S. workers in apparent contravention of U.S. labor law. Labor issued these foreign labor certifi-cations to Imperial Pacific International (IPI) despite the history of occupational safety and health and wage and hour violations that the Department previously uncovered at this job site. In May 2017, after a worker fell to his death and multiple other, serious workplace injuries were treated at the local hospital, the Occupa-tional Safety and Health Administration pro-posed $193,750 in penalties for three of IPI’s construction subcontractors. In March 2018, the Department finalized settlements with IPI subcontractors of $13.9 million for unpaid wages and liquidated dam-ages owed to over 2,400 employees. In addition to these violations of the Occu-pational Safety and Health Act and the Fair Labor Standards Act, a raid of the site by the Federal Bureau of Investigation also revealed that the subcontractors had been unlawfully employing persons who were admitted to the United States from China as tourists.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1148 August 14, 2018 
This record in itself should have raised red flags at the U.S. Department of Labor. But the underlying purpose and process for foreign labor certification seems also in this case to have been subverted. In order to obtain foreign labor certifications, which are a prerequisite to applying for an H– 2B visa, an employer must attest that the job in question will be offered to any qualified and available U.S. worker who applies or is re-ferred for the job opportunity. And in order to obtain an H–2B visa, an employer must attest that they have not laid off and will not lay off any similarly employed U.S. worker, unless the layoff is for lawful, job-related reasons and unless all H–2B workers are laid off first. The present lay-offs of U.S. workers, while work continues using H–2B workers, cannot be con-sistent with these employer attestations. Let us look at the history of the Imperial Pa-cific International worksite: In fiscal year 2016 the Marianas experi-enced a labor crisis, when the annual, numer-ical cap was reached for the Commonwealth Only Transitional Worker (CW) program. For the first time the Department of Homeland Se-curity stopped accepting applications for this foreign labor program, unique to the Marianas. As the Government Accountability Office ex-plained in a 2017 report commissioned by Senate Energy and Natural Resources Com-mittee Chairman L
ISAMURKOWSKI , Ranking Member M
ARIA CANTWELL , and I: 
Demand for foreign workers in the CNMI exceeded the available number of CW–1 per-mits in 2016—many approved for workers from China and workers in construction oc-cupations. The construction of a new casino in Saipan is a key factor in this demand. 
In fact, GAO reported, the demand for for-eign workers jumped from 9,188 in 2014 to a number exceeding the 2016 cap of 13,299, al-most entirely because of the demand for con-struction workers. The result was to crowd out established, local businesses, who employed CW workers and to force long-time foreign workers, who had demonstrated value to our economy and established roots in our commu-nity, to return home. Not only was this crush of construction workers at the casino site economically and socially disruptive, it also did not jibe with the rules for the CW program. CW permits are only available to employers of foreign workers who are ineligible for any other U.S. work visa. Although some of the casino construction workers held CW permits (and some were em-ployed illegally, having entered as tourists), we now know that these workers could well have received H–2B visas. Because, as the U.S. Department of Labor has reported, it issued 1,668 H–2B foreign labor certifications to IPI. To end further abuse of the CW program and to protect the interests of local businesses in my district and their long-term workers and their families, I introduced legislation that, among other provisions, prohibited any further use of CW permits for new construction work-ers in the Marianas. Chairman M
URKOWSKI ob- served at her committee’s hearing on my bill, H.R. 339, that this bar on the use of CW per-mits for new construction workers was in her view the most important provision. Not only did it curb the abuse of the CW permit, but it was also meant to force the federal govern-ment to make the determination, through the foreign labor certification process, of whether U.S. workers were available for any construc-tion jobs on offer. President Trump signed my bill into law in August 2017. It became U.S. Public Law 115–53. IPI quickly responded to these new con-straints by hiring Pacific Rim, a U.S.-based firm, to continue construction of the casino. And Pacific Rim president and owner Keith Stewart announced to the Guam Daily Post that he was looking to hire hundreds of skilled U.S. tradesmen for the work. I include in the RECORD comments from Edward Deleon Guer-rero, Executive Director of the Commonwealth Casino Commission, who reacted positively to this news in an interview with KSPN-TV in January 2018: 
Reporter: IPI is currently in contractual conversations with a new construction com-pany, Pacific Rim, to finish the resort. Guerrero: We are more confident when we are dealing with a U.S. construction com-pany. Reporter: IPI’s previous, Chinese-based construction companies brought in illegal construction workers and ultimately caused progress on the building to come to a stand-still, once the FBI realized what was going on. Guerrero hopes to avoid, quote, ‘another fiasco like that from happening again.’ Guerrero: Definitely do not want to see a repeat of that. Reporter: This time around, however, the work will be done with mostly U.S. based workers. Guerrero: It is my understanding that all, I mean, most, if not all of the workers are U.S. construction workers. 
In March, Pacific Rim held a job fair on Guam, which drew enthusiastic response from U.S. workers, who expressed a willingness to move to Saipan for new work opportunities and the chance to earn overtime and per diem, in addition to their regular pay. At the fair Pacific Rim General Superintendent Tony Costa confirmed to the Post that his company wanted to have around 500 U.S. workers on the IPI site. Marianas Governor Ralph Torres even testi-fied with pride before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on February 6 of this year about the turnaround: 
I’m proud to announce that because of learning of an issue that was experienced last year, we have signed U.S. contractors to finish the hotel of the casino that was signed, I believe, less than a month ago that will be hiring more U.S. workers to finish the construction of the hotel site. 
The Governor also said IPI intended to com-plete construction by August 2018 and as-sured the Committee that his administration was closely monitoring labor conditions at the site. It should be noted, too, that the original casino license agreement included the stated objective to have permanent U.S. residents be at least 65 percent of all employees—an ob-jective that has not been met. The Governor’s testimony came at the hear-ing held to consider the Northern Mariana Is-lands U.S. Workforce Act, legislation that Chairman M
URKOWSKI and I had jointly intro-duced to incentivize the hiring of U.S. workers in the Marianas. President Trump signed the Act into law on July 24. Among other new pro-tections for U.S. workers, Public Law 115–218 extends to the CW program the requirement for prior U.S. Department of Labor labor certifi-cations, a stipulation the Governor, the Mari-anas Legislature, and our business community all rightly agreed to. Despite all these efforts and assurances to U.S. workers, however, at the same time IPI had begun the process of applying for foreign labor certifications from the U.S. Department of Labor with the intent to secure H–2B visas and hire foreign construction workers. Nomi-nally, these foreign workers were to buttress, not replace Pacific Rim’s U.S. workforce. In-stead, U.S. workers have now lost their jobs, replaced by foreign workers. Attestations to the U.S. Department of Labor that U.S. work-ers would not be laid off and replaced with for-eign workers have not proven true. Assur-ances by the Governor to keep watch on the Imperial Pacific job site seem hollow in light of recent events. This must stop. The people of the Northern Mariana Islands, whom I represent, are tired of having outside, foreign interests time-after-time give our is-lands a black eye by skirting the law, cutting corners on safety, playing fast and loose with the rules and thinking they can get away with it, beholden only to their bottom line and a handful of high-ranking local officials. The U.S. Department of Labor, after ena-bling IPI by granting 1,668 foreign labor certifi-cations, must take immediate action to step up enforcement and ensure IPI maintains abso-lute compliance with U.S. law. f

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 14, 2018 Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge Ms. Jeny Walker upon her retirement as Cemetery Director at Moun-tain Home National Cemetery.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1149 August 14, 2018 
Prior to this assignment, Ms. Walker served as Assistant Director of Dallas-Fort Worth Na-tional Cemetery from August 2014. She com-pleted the National Cemetery Administration’s comprehensive, year-long Cemetery Director Intern Program in August 2014. Jeny is a pillar of her community and has brought much peace and comfort to Veterans and their families in the entire Northeastern Tennessee region. She has led significant im-provement and expansion efforts at the ceme-tery to include an expansion project that dou-bles the size of the cemetery and will provide an additional 50 years of gravesite availability for veterans and their families. She also led her team to a recent National Cemetery Ad-ministration Organizational Assessment and Improvement award for exemplary perform-ance in key management and operational areas such as customer service, cemetery service, and access to information. Jeny’s en-during legacy includes a book she published about Mountain Home National Cemetery enti-tled, A Book of Heroes: Discover Their Story, Honor Their Sacrifice. In her three years as the Cemetery Director at Mountain Home, Jeny was driven to serve veterans and their families. She was a VA ambassador in the community and was led by the principles of servant leadership. When several headstones and monuments were vandalized at Old Gray Cemetery in Knoxville, Jeny organized a group of employee volunteers to spend a Saturday afternoon to share their expertise and repair the broken monuments and reset the headstones. This is a testament to the special kind of person Jeny is. I include in the R
ECORD a message Jeny wrote her colleagues upon retirement: 
Long ago and far away, working in my first cemetery as an intern, I found this on a headstone. I’ve kept it and read it often be-cause it eloquently states exactly what I feel: Remember me. Think of me. Love me as you do now. Essentially nothing changes by my leaving. If I were to ask anything of you, it’s that you pray I will have more time than I think I do. More time with family. More time having fun. More time to live. Much love for each of you, Jeny. 
I am grateful for Jeny’s service to veterans and wish her peace. She is in my prayers and in the prayers of so many. I’d also like to thank the National Cemetery Administration for sharing Jeny’s background.

HONORING ELMER JOSEPH ‘‘ALMO’’ LORENZI 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 14, 2018 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Elmer Joseph ‘‘EJ’’ Lorenzi, an upstand-ing member of the Merced community, who has been recognized as ‘‘Man of the Year’’ for the 2018 Harvest of Hope by Catholic Char-ities of Merced. EJ was born on May 18, 1931 at Mercy Hospital in Merced to Giuseppe and Rita Bernardi Lorenzi. Within a few, short years, it became clear that EJ was destined for an ex-traordinary life of serving others. His life-long dedication to service began at the age of 10, when EJ played the accordion for the United Service Organization to help raise money for war bonds. From that moment, EJ’s service and dedica-tion to the Merced community never wavered. While he established himself as a mainstay in the business community, EJ’s focus continued to be service. He has been a member of the 3rd degree and 4th degree Knights of Colum-bus Council 2384 for over six decades. He has served Merced with integrity and honor through the Merced City Chamber of Com-merce, Merced Little League, and as Ambas-sador for the City Council of Merced. EJ also served on many advisory boards in Merced County. EJ’s tireless leadership as chairman of the advisory committee for Meas-ure C was instrumental in passing the meas-ure, which is expected to raise millions for the police and fire departments in Merced. EJ has also been instrumental in restoring several historic buildings in Merced that were slated for destruction. Historic sites such as Bob Hart Square and Our Lady of Mercy Catholic Church, still stand today because of EJ’s unwavering leadership. EJ’s service to his community has always been backed by his lovely family. EJ married his high school sweetheart Evelyn Weres in June of 1950. Together, EJ and Evelyn have five children, ten grandchildren, and nine great grandchildren, who will carry on the family’s great legacy. At the spry age of eighty-seven years old, EJ continues to serve his community however he can, guided by the same three principles that have followed him throughout his life: God family, and his Catholic faith. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring the exceptional life of Elmer Joseph Lorenzi. I wish him and Catholic Char-ities of Merced the best as he is recognized for his contributions to our community. f

INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SALARY HOME RULE ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 14, 2018 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today I intro-duced the District of Columbia Chief Financial Officer Salary Home Rule Act. This bill would give the District of Columbia the authority to set the pay of the D.C. Chief Financial Officer (CFO). There is no reason the District should not have the authority to set the wage of a local official who is paid with local funds. In 2013, Congress enacted a law that gave the District more authority to set the CFO’s pay. However, Congress did not give D.C. full and complete authority over this local matter. This bill would give D.C. the authority to set the CFO’s pay as it sees fit. The 2013 law amended the Home Rule Act to change the CFO’s pay from a fixed rate of pay that was tied to a federal pay schedule to a maximum allowable pay, or ceiling, tied to a federal pay schedule. The ceiling was and is substantially higher than the fixed rate, but the CFO’s pay is now $1,000 below the maximum. I introduced the 2013 bill after a D.C. CFO search committee indicated that the fixed rate of pay was not high enough to attract the best talent needed for this complex and demanding job. The responsibilities of the CFO, a position created by Congress, are unique in the United States. The CFO is extraordinarily powerful and independent. The District cannot obligate or expend funds without the CFO’s approval, and the CFO can be terminated only ‘‘for cause.’’ The District needs the authority to be able to pay the rate demanded by the market and necessary to retain and attract the best CFOs, especially since the District must com-pete with the private sector for highly qualified CFOs. This is an important step to increase home rule for the District, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

OF NEW MEXICO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 14, 2018 Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Captain Joseph O. Quintana of the United States Navy, who is retiring this month after a distinguished 25 year career. Captain Quin-tana has spent the last quarter century serving our country in a variety of reserve and active duty leadership roles in the logistics, fuels, and transportation fields. Captain Quintana received his Bachelor of Business Administration degree from the Uni-versity of New Mexico in 1983. He went on to receive a Master of Science degree in Leader-ship from the University of Texas at El Paso. Captain Quintana earned his commission through the Navy’s Direct Commissioning Offi-cer Program in 1993 and completed the Basic Qualification Course at the Navy Supply Corps School in 1995. From 2005 to 2006, Captain Quintana served in Kuwait and Iraq as Charlie Company Commander for Navy Customs Battalion Papa. In 2007, he served as Interim Fuels Of-ficer at FLC Pearl Harbor, responding to a large fuel spill. From 2008 to 2011, Captain Quintana became the only Navy Officer ever assigned as Command Inspector General of Joint Task Force North at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas. He then served with the Inter-national Security Assistance Force in Afghani-stan from 2012 to 2013, where he was Officer- in-Charge of the In-Transit Visibility Cell. In this role, he was tasked with transporting over $2 billion worth of vehicles and ammunition to locations throughout Afghanistan. Captain Quintana’s distinguished career has earned him a multitude of honors including the Joint Meritorious Service Medal, Meritorious Service Medal, Joint Service Commendation Medal, Navy and Marine Corps Commenda-tion Medal, Joint Service Achievement Medal, and Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal. Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Captain Joseph O. Quintana on his well-deserved re-tirement and thank him for his career of distin-guished service to our country.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL HEALTH CENTER WEEK TO CELEBRATE THE LEGACY OF AMERICA’S HEALTH CENTERS AND RECOG-NIZE THEIR VITAL ROLE IN SHAPING THE PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE OF AMERICA’S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM 
HON. NANETTE DIAZ BARRAGA´N 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 14, 2018 Ms. BARRAGA´N. Mr. Speaker, Whereas for over 50 years, community health centers have provided high-quality, affordable, comprehen-sive primary and preventive health care in our Nation’s underserved communities, delivering value to, and having a significant impact on, America’s health care system; Whereas as the country’s largest primary care network, health centers are the health care home for 27,000,000 Americans in over 10,000 communities across the Nation, and 1 in every 12 people in the United States gets his or her care in a health center; Whereas health centers are a critical ele-ment of the health system, serving both rural and urban populations, and often providing the only accessible and dependable source of pri-mary care in their communities; Whereas nationwide, health centers serve 1 in every 6 residents of rural areas; Whereas every day, health centers develop new ap-proaches to integrating a wide range of serv-ices beyond primary care, including oral health, vision, behavioral health, and phar-macy services, to meet the needs and chal-lenges of their communities; Whereas health centers are governed by patient-majority boards, ensuring that the pa-tients of each health center are engaged in their own health care decisions; Whereas health centers are locally owned and operated small businesses that serve as critical economic engines, helping to power local economies by generating $45,600,000,000 in economic impact in some of the country’s most economically deprived communities; Whereas health centers nationally employ more than 200,000 people, including physi-cians, nurse practitioners, physician assist-ants, and certified nurse midwives who work as part of multidisciplinary clinical teams de-signed to treat the whole patient; Whereas the health center model continues to prove an effective means of overcoming barriers to health care access, including geog-raphy, income, and insurance status, and in doing so, improves health care outcomes and reduces health care system costs; Whereas health centers reduce overall costs of care by helping manage patients’ chronic conditions, which keeps them out of costlier health care settings like hospital emergency rooms; Whereas health centers are on the frontlines of emerging health care crises, providing ac-cess to care for our Nation’s veterans, ad-dressing the opioid epidemic, and responding to public health threats in the wake of natural disasters; Whereas National Health Center Week is an annual celebration that will be held from Au-gust 12, 2018, through August 18, 2018; Whereas National Health Center Week of-fers the opportunity to recognize America’s nearly 1,400 health center organizations with over 10,400 service delivery sites, their dedi-cated staff, board members, patients, and all those responsible for their continued success and growth since the first health centers opened their doors more than 50 years ago; and Whereas during National Health Center Week, we celebrate the legacy of America’s health centers, and their vital role in shaping the past, present, and future of America’s health care system. Now Therefore that the House of Rep-resentatives recognizes the week of August l2–l8th as National Health Center Week; and Encourages all Americans to take part in this week by visiting their local health center and celebrating the important partnership be-tween America’s health centers and the com-munities they serve.

HONORING MONSIGNOR ANTHONY JANELLI 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 14, 2018 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the career and achievements of Mon-signor Anthony Janelli, a longtime clergyman of the Catholic church, and a lifelong resident of the Central Valley. With over 50 years of service to the Church, Fr. Janelli has selflessly dedicated his time to the welfare of people in his clergies. Fr. Janelli was born in Visalia, California on May 22, 1936 to Ermalinda and Joe Janelli. The oldest of four children, Father Janelli’s de-votion to duty and faith quickly became appar-ent. After attending George McCann Catholic School and Santa Clara University that sense of duty led Fr. Janelli to enlist in the United States Army. During the Cold War, he served as a Fire Control Officer in a Nike Missile anti- aircraft battery with the rank of 1st Lieutenant. Upon leaving the Army, Fr. Janelli found him-self devoted to another duty: his Catholic faith. In 1960, Fr. Janelli entered St. John’s Semi-nary of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles to be-come a priest and spread the word of God. Four years later, he was ordained a priest for the diocese of Monterey-Fresno at St. John’s Cathedral. Since then, Fr. Janelli’s devotion to his faith and to the people of the communities he so nobly served, has never wavered. He became an Associate to St. Therese Parish in Fresno, followed by assignments to churches in Los Banos and Reedley. In 1971, he was appointed Pastor of St. Elizabeth Parish in McFarland, and in 1973 he joined the Pastoral Team in Merced where he remained until 1980. In 1980, Fr. Janelli sought to further his devotion to the Catholic faith, and to that end, he took a Sabbatical to study Spirituality at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh. However, Fr. Janelli’s heart has always been with the people of his local community. After completing his studies in Spirituality, Fr. Janelli returned to the San Joaquin Valley, where he served as Vicar of Clergy, Rector of the Cathedral and as Pastor of churches in Livingston, Porterville, Dinuba, and Planada. While serving as Vicar of Clergy, Fr. Janelli was honored for his life’s work by Pope John Paul II, who designated Fr. Janelli a Mon-signor for his exceptional devotion to his com-munity. Fr. Janelli officially retired in June of 2008, but his duty to the Church has never faltered. He has assisted numerous parishes in the Dioceses of Fresno and Sacramento and served for some time as Pastor of Yosemite. He currently is the Pastor of Sacred Heart Parish in Planada and LeGrand. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing the career and achieve-ments of Fr. Anthony Janelli. His tireless com-mitment to duty, and his devotion to the Catholic church has enriched the lives of countless people. There is no doubt that Fr. Janelli has left a lasting impact on our Valley for which we are deeply grateful. f 
RECOGNIZING THE PUYALLUP TRIBE AND THE PARTICIPANTS OF THE 2018 CANOE JOURNEY 
HON. DEREK KILMER 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 14, 2018 Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Puyallup Tribe and all partici-pants in the 2018 Canoe Journey. This annual journey began in 1989 with Na-tive Americans providing a vital voice in shap-ing the State of Washington’s centennial. Now, all these years later, tribes from Alaska all the way to Willapa Bay have participated in this powerful cultural event. Over the last few weeks, thousands of peo-ple from dozens of tribes put their canoes in the water and connected with one another. They participated in a celebration of heritage; sharing songs, stories, dances, and gifts. But, beyond that, they celebrated the theme of Honoring Our Medicine. They gathered to honor the medicine of the Salish Sea and the waters that have been the lifeblood of past generations and that will be the lifeblood of our future as long as we rise to their chal-lenge. Mr. Speaker, Congressman H
ECK and I have stood on this floor many times and spo-ken about the importance of Puget Sound, our nation’s largest estuary. The Sound is an icon of our region. It supports treaty rights and recreation. It supports shellfish growing and fisheries. It’s a place where families—including my own—make memories. It is a legacy passed from generation to generation. It is a central part of who we are as Washingtonians. But this body of water—and others like it—are at risk. They are threatened. The tribes that participated in the Paddle— and Native American leaders throughout our region—have shown more commitment, more leadership, more drive, more partnership, and more passion for recovering this vital body of water than any other. They have seen our waters as sacred—as givers of life. They have recognized that these waters are a lifeforce. That they are gifts from the creator. They have recognized that our passion for this medicine cannot simply be based in nostalgia and tradi-tion but, rather, must be grounded in a hope for the future. It is not enough for us to say thank you. We must back up those words with deeds. We must commit ourselves to protecting these waters and to preserving the majesty of our natural resources. We must recognize that our federal government must simply do better—on every day in every way—to value these treas-ures. Mr. Speaker, there is a saying that change is inevitable, but progress is optional. Too often, we have seen change that has not meant progress. Too often we have moved backward and jeopardized our lifeblood. We must do better. Mr. Speaker, today I want to express my gratitude to the Puyallup Tribe for hosting this important event and for all that they have done to strengthen our region for so long. And here in the United States Congress, I want to honor—and in the traditional custom, I want to raise my hands to—every person who partici-pated in the paddle. f

REMEMBERING GENE GREENE 
HON. TONY CA´RDENAS 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 14, 2018 Mr. CA´RDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of one of my constituents, Gene Greene. Gene will be remembered as an icon of our community. As a Landscape Architect and Di-rector of the Japanese Garden in Van Nuys, California, Mr. Greene oversaw the beautiful garden since its dedication in 1984, where he personally set the final 28 stones. Thanks to his work, The Garden has been published in several books, websites, and television pro-grams. The Los Angeles Times once charac-terized the Japanese Garden as ‘‘Gene’s Gar-den’’ because of his strong connection to the land. A humble and generous man, Gene was known for giving credit and not taking it. He al-ways commended the volunteers and docents for their roles in making the Japanese Garden such an iconic landmark of Los Angeles. Ev-erything he did was a true testament of his love for his work, his family, and the commu-nity he served. Gene dedicated his life to public service. He started his career as an intern for the Los An-geles City government before proudly serving in the U.S. Army, where he earned a National Defense Service Medal. Gene was an Eagle Scout, and he credits the training he received there with helping him become an expert rifle-man in the military. Gene attended the California State Poly-technic University at Pomona where he ma-jored in Landscape Architecture. His gift for design and architecture led him to the Bureau of Engineering in the City of Los Angeles. There, he was assigned to work with Dr. Koichi Kawana, lead project architect of the Japanese Garden. Gene is a fixture of the community and his legacy will never be forgotten. With his dedica-tion to his work and family, Gene will continue inspiring generations of Angelenos. My pray-ers go to his wife Lynn, his four daughters, and his five grandchildren. TRIBUTE TO CONNIE AND BOB JORGENSEN HON. DAVID YOUNG

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Connie and Bob Jorgensen of Avoca, Iowa on the very special occasion of their 50th wedding anniversary.

As they reflect on their 50th anni-versary, I hope it is filled with happy memo-ries. May their commitment grow even strong-er, as they continue to love, cherish, and honor one another for many years to come. Mr. Speaker, I commend this great couple on their 50th year together and I wish them many more. I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating them on this momentous occasion.
