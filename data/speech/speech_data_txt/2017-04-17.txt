PRAYER Reverend Dr. Dan C. Cummins, Sky-line Wesleyan Church, San Diego, Cali-fornia, offered the following prayer: Almighty Father, Alpha of life and the Omega to death. This Easter Mon-day we pray in the shadow of that old rugged cross, cast by the radiant glory emanating from His empty tomb, pro-claiming confidently, ‘‘O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy vic-tory?’’ Thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through Jesus Christ our Lord. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your governance is not vain in the Lord. As we walk crooked paths through perilous times, may that light from His empty tomb be a lamp unto our feet. Teach us to number our days, and apply our hearts unto wisdom. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and unless the Lord builds this House, our governance is naught and the King’s speech vanity. Lord Jesus, build this House. Amen. THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to section 2(a) of House Resolution 242, the Journal of the last day’s pro-ceedings is approved. f

REMEMBERING MARY PEARSON 
HON. MARK SANFORD 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 17, 2017 Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of Mary Lee Alcock Pearson, the Dorchester County Treasurer since De-cember 2006. She died March 27 at home in Summerville, South Carolina. Accordingly, I want to take a moment to offer my condo-lences to a host of family and friends she leaves behind. It was Ernest Hemingway who said, ‘‘Every man’s life ends the same way. It’s only the de-tails of how he lived . . . that distinguish one man from another.’’ In that vein, Mary distinguished her life by serving others—her community, in particular. Indeed, she loved Dorchester County, and she was in turn loved back. Mary was loyal almost to a fault and certainly extended me grace in the ups and downs of my life, and for that, I am indebted. She also cared about conservative ideals and good government. It is for that reason that I appointed her Dorchester County Treasurer back during my time as governor. In short, she was a great friend, a real leader, and a com-mitted participant in the Lowcountry who will be sorely missed. In her memory, I would ask that we take a moment today for reflection, and pause in ask-ing how we can live up to the legacy of giving and care that Mary embodied. For those of us who knew her, she will be missed. I look for-ward to our reunion in the heavens above. Until that meeting, Godspeed. f 
CONGRATULATING CAROL STREAM 
HON. PETER J. ROSKAM 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 17, 2017 Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Carol Stream on being named one of the safest cities in the United States. The Village of Carol Stream was named the eighty-ninth safest city on Neighborhood Scout’s list of America’s 100 Safest Cities. Working together, law enforcement, local of-ficials, and the community have made Carol Stream a safer place to live, work, and raise a family. The residents of Carol Stream should never underestimate the impact each citizen’s positive actions can have. Everyday there are members of the community helping to change lives, while also inspiring their peers to do the same. I would be remiss to not also mention the wonderful job of the Carol Stream Police and Fire Departments. Day in and day out the men and women of the Carol Stream Police and Fire Departments risk their lives to protect our community. Their bravery and courage are very deserving of our recognition and admira-tion, and I am pleased to see their service has led to Carol Stream being named one of the safest cities in America. Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing the Village of Carol Stream, Illinois and con-gratulating them on being named one of the safest cities in America. f
