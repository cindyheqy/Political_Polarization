PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. O God, our shield, gird us with Your 
strength, while the heavens declare Your glory and the skies show Your handiwork. Sustain our lawmakers with Your loving kindness so that they shall not be moved by life’s vicissi-tudes. 
Lord, give them clean hands, pure 
hearts, and truthful lips so that their lives glorify You. Deliver them from anxiety about anything as they pray about everything, with thanksgiving, so that Your peace that transcends human reasoning will guard their hearts and minds. 
Do for our Senators more than they 
can ask or imagine, according to Your power working in and through them. 
We pray in Your righteous Name. 
Amen.

MEASURE PLACED ON THE 
CALENDAR—S. 1861 
Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
understand there is a bill at the desk that is due for its second reading. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will read the bill by title for the second time. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 1861) to prohibit Federal funding 
of Planned Parenthood Federation of Amer-ica. 
Mr. M CCONNELL. In order to place 
the bill on the calendar under the pro-visions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objec-
tion is heard. The bill will be placed on the cal-
endar.

OT-
TON). The majority leader.

THE HIGHWAY BILL 
Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, our 
country needs a multiyear highway bill, and we are close to finally passing 
a fiscally responsible and bipartisan one. Time is running short to get a bill through Congress, but as with most legislation, we still intend to consider some amendments from both sides of the aisle as we continue to work to pass it. We will start on that today. 
Most important is a proposal that 
would repeal ObamaCare and allow our country to start over fresh with a real health care reform proposal. There is no question that I will be voting for it. There is no question that every Sen-ator should join me in doing so. This is a law filled with higher costs, fewer choices, and broken promises. 
This is a law that has failed repeat-
edly and continues to hammer hard- working middle-class families. The vote we will take this afternoon rep-resents a stark choice for every Sen-ator: protect a President who likes a law with his name on it or stand with the middle class by finally opening the way to truly affordable care. 
Another proposal relates to the Ex-
port-Import Bank. I will be voting against it. The Export-Import Bank is a New Deal relic that has outlived any usefulness it might have had. If a project is worthy, private banks will step in to finance it. If it is not worthy, we should definitely not be financing it

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5702 July 26, 2015 
by putting American taxpayers on the 
hook. Either way, Ex-Im is not nec-essary. 
At the same time, I understand that 
many Senators on both sides take a different view. A significant percentage of my conference and many Democrats support the Ex-Im’s reauthorization. They are entitled to that view. I don’t see a reason why they shouldn’t be al-lowed a debate and then a vote to sort all of this out. I have said repeatedly and I have said publicly for months that the Ex-Im supporters from both parties should be allowed a vote. I also said publicly that the highway bill would be an obvious place to have that vote. 
When there is overwhelming bipar-
tisan support for an idea, even if I am opposed to it, it doesn’t require some special deal to see a vote occur on that measure. This is the U.S. Senate, after all, where we debate and vote on all kinds of different issues. The sup-porters of Ex-Im can still lose a vote, of course. They are not the only ones with passion on their side. Those on my side of the issue are passionate, too, and this debate might just present the perfect opportunity to make the case against Ex-Im and carry the day in an open and democratic vote, but whatever the outcome, the slots for these amendments will be open once the Senate disposes of them and that will open the possibility of considering other important amendments. 
Let me repeat that. The slots for 
these amendments will open once the Senate disposes of them. 
We know there are many other ideas 
from both sides of the aisle about how to improve the highway bill further be-fore its completion, but we also know time is running short to complete our work on the underlying highway bill. Jobs are on the line. Infrastructure projects important to the people we represent are on the line. We have to get this done. With cooperation, we can ensure that more ideas from both sides of the aisle are still heard and voted upon. 
This is a new Senate. Amendment 
votes are hardly a rarity here anymore. We will have more opportunities soon to address other issues in the weeks and months ahead. I will work with colleagues to help ensure that votes on other priorities occur.

f 
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND EX-
PORT-IMPORT BANK AMEND-MENTS 
Mr. REID. Mr. President, later today 
the Senate will vote on one or more motions to overturn rulings of the Chair brought by disgruntled Repub-lican Senators. At another time, Re-publican Senators would have called this a number of things, not the least of which is the nuclear option. 
Republicans have controlled the Sen-
ate for about 7 months now. It has be-come increasingly clear that what is wrong with the Senate today is the same thing that has troubled the Sen-ate before Republicans took control— dysfunction in the Republican caucus. 
Republicans probably will not suc-
ceed in overturning the rules of the Senate today, but an honest observer of the Senate will recognize that the day is coming when they will, unless the Republicans become the party of Eisenhower, Dodd, Dirksen, and even President Reagan. 
I was amused to hear the Republican 
leader say he looks forward to amend-ments. Many Senators on our side look forward to being able to offer amend-ments; for example, to improve work safety provisions in the bill, but the amendment tree is filled. They are not going to have that opportunity unless something untoward happens. 
Today, the Senate will vote on two 
amendments. How Senators vote on these amendments will demonstrate their priorities—who is for American families and who is doing the bidding of special interests. Consider today’s vote on yet another Republican at-tempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act—ObamaCare. 
By all accounts, it is working and 
working well. Is it perfect? Of course not. That is why we have invited the Republicans for years now to join with us in having a better health care deliv-ery system, but ObamaCare is helping families all across this great Nation. There are many facts. 
Insurance companies can no longer 
discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions. They can’t dis-criminate against anyone as they did when they discriminated, basically, against everyone. Twelve million more people now have coverage through Medicaid programs and CHIP pro-grams. Health care costs are growing but very slowly—the slowest rate of growth in a long time. Perhaps, most importantly, the share of Americans who lack health insurance coverage has dramatically declined. 
After the latest Supreme Court vic-
tory less than a month ago, I urged, at that time, my Republican friends to stop banging their heads against the wall because obviously it doesn’t feel good. Why do they continually try to 
repeal the Affordable Care Act? Appar-ently, two Supreme Court wins and more than 50 votes by congressional Republicans to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act are not enough for the Republican leader and his friends. They are insisting on yet another par-
tisan attempt to strip health insurance coverage from more than 19 million Americans—coverage that a recent Commonwealth Fund survey found that more than 80 percent of Ameri-cans are satisfied with this program. 
Republicans claim this ObamaCare 
repeal is part of their crusade to reduce the deficit, but the nonpartisan Con-gressional Budget Office recently esti-mated that repealing the Affordable Care Act will increase the Federal budget by more than $350 billion. 
So today’s vote isn’t going to be 
about reducing the deficit. This is about caving to special interests. This is about the Republicans and their leader desperately trying to appease their base. 
I am appalled and, more than that, 
disappointed by these continued par-tisan attempts to strip away insurance coverage for almost 20 million Ameri-cans. Congress passed the Affordable Care Act. The President signed it into law, and the Supreme Court has put a stamp of approval on it, not once but twice. 
It is time for Republicans to move on 
and not take another politically moti-vated vote that is going nowhere. 
Finally, on another subject, the Ex-
port-Import Bank. After the ObamaCare vote, we will then consider the reauthorization of the Export-Im-port Bank—in fact, their charter. Once again, how Senators vote on the Ex-port-Import Bank will reveal their loy-alties. 
Companies like Boeing, Caterpillar, 
General Electric, Honeywell, along with dozens of companies in sparsely populated Nevada, along with thou-sands of small businesses across this country, use this Bank to find a mar-ket for billions of dollars of their ex-ports. It is not only for Boeing, Cater-pillar, and these big companies; it is for thousands and thousands of small businesses. 
Most of the jobs in America are cre-
ated not by the great big companies but by small businesses, and they need this. They want this. That is why even the U.S. Chamber of Commerce must have been desperate. 
Finally, siding with us on something, 
they support the Ex-Im Bank. This year alone, the Export-Import Bank supported 165,000 jobs in America. A 
vote for the Export-Import Bank is a vote for jobs, a healthy economy, and the prosperity of American families. Conversely, a vote against reauthoriza-tion is nothing more than a shameless attempt to garner the affection of the Koch brothers. After all, opposition to the Export-Import Bank is a pre-requisite to having their support. All candidates running for President stum-ble over themselves to say: What do

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5703 July 26, 2015 
the brothers want today? What they 
want today is a vote against this Bank, contrary to the needs of the American people. The Koch brothers distributed a survey to the Republican Presidential hopefuls that essentially obligates those candidates to oppose the Ex-Im Bank. 
I ask my colleagues today: Are you 
working for the American people or are you doing the dirty work for a couple of billionaire oil barons? A vote for the Export-Import Bank is a vote for American families. A vote against the repeal of ObamaCare is a vote for American families. Today, the Senate Democrats will vote for American fam-ilies. 
I was hoping to say a word about 
Senator I
NHOFE while he was on the 
floor, and unfortunately he is not here now. The senior Senator from Okla-homa is a very conservative Repub-lican Senator. He and I disagree on a lot of things, but I have great respect for his courage on this legislation. I think this legislation, which we are moving forward on, is far from perfect, but I listened to Senator J
IMINHOFE  
yesterday when he was answering the President. A Republican always follows the President. I think Senator I
NHOFE  
did a fine job of explaining how impor-tant it is that we have a transportation bill. We have said a lot of nice things about Senator B
OXER , but it is time we 
said some nice things about J IMINHOFE  
because this bill would not be where it is without his efforts.

HIRE MORE HEROES ACT OF 2015 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will re-sume consideration of H.R. 22, which the clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 22) to amend the Internal Rev-
enue Code of 1986 to exempt employees with health coverage under TRICARE or the Vet-erans Administration from being taken into account for purposes of determining the em-ployers to which the employer mandate ap-plies under the Patient Protection and Af-fordable Care Act. 
Pending: 
McConnell modified amendment No. 2266,

Chair that Cruz amendment No. 2301 is not in order because it is inconsistent with the Sen-ate’s precedents with respect to the offering of amendments, their number, degree, and kind. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask through the 
Chair if the Democratic leader has a re-quest. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Democratic leader. 
Mr. REID. Mr. President, has the bill 
been reported? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill 
has been reported. 
Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that before the 3 p.m. vote that Senator B
OXER be permitted 
to speak for up to 10 minutes and that Senators W
YDEN and M URPHY be per-
mitted to speak for up to 5 minutes each. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I 
ask if the Democratic leader would modify his request to give me 12 min-utes and Senator H
ATCH 10 minutes fol-
lowing Senators B OXER , W YDEN , and 
MURPHY . 
Mr. REID. Why does the Senator 
from Tennessee get so much time? But I don’t object, Mr. President. Just be-fore the vote. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Just before the 
vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from California. Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, someone 
was speaking with me. What is the order? I get up to 10 minutes; is that correct? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator has up to 10 minutes. 
Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Presiding 
Officer. 
Mr. President, it is Sunday, and it is 
unusual for us to be here, but as I have said many times, this is the reason we are here. Look at this photo. This is the bridge collapse in California, and there is another report coming that says this is going to be far from the last one we have. 
This is a bridge that carries thou-
sands of people a day from California to Arizona. This can happen in any one of our States, and the fact is we need to pass a transportation bill. I am so grateful to my colleague Senator I
NHOFE and to everyone on that com-
mittee who got this started. 
The Environment and Public Works 
Committee had a 20-to-0 vote so we don’t have to face this anymore. After that, we had other committees act, just not in as bipartisan a fashion, so it was difficult. At that point, Leader M
CCONNELL and Senator D URBIN  
stepped in with Senator I NHOFE and 
me, and all we did was try to get to where we are right now, which is a place where we can pass a fair funding bill. I have a list. It is very interesting, 
and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the R
ECORD . 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows:

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, my 
State counts on the Federal Govern-ment for one-half of its transportation funding, highways, and transit. Rhode Island counts on the Federal Govern-ment for 100 percent; Alaska, 93 per-cent; Montana, 87 percent; South Caro-lina, 79 percent; Hawaii, 79 percent; North Dakota, 78 percent; Wyoming, 73 percent; Connecticut, 71 percent; New Mexico, 70 percent, and it goes down from there, but the vast majority of our States count on the Federal Gov-ernment for funding. 
What we have done, as both Senators 
R
EIDand M CCONNELL have pointed out, 
is we just keep patching up the high-way trust fund. 
I could go to a bank and say: I want 
to buy a House. The banker says: You have great credit. That’s the good news. The bad news is you can only get a 5-month mortgage. What would I do in that case? I would sadly walk away. I can’t afford to invest in a home if I have only 5 months of a mortgage. It is the same way with the States. The way the House went about it, and the way some of my colleagues on both sides want to handle it, is another 5-month extension, and our States are stopping. 
On Tuesday, the general contractors 
told us that in 25 States they have

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5704 July 26, 2015 
begun to lay off many, many, many 
construction workers. We all know at the height of the great recession we had millions of unemployed construc-tion workers. It has been tough to get them back to work, and remember the businesses that employ them, it has been tough to get them back to work. 
It has been so hard and now we are 
seeing a reversal of all the hard work we did because we did a 2-year trans-portation bill that was helpful. This would be the first 6-year authorization in decades and the first 3-year funding, I believe, in 10 years. It could be more. We need to do this. 
I want to close by saying this: Work-
ing across the aisle is always difficult, but it is exciting, it is interesting, and the staffs from both sides have shown they can do it. 
Last night, I was on the phone with 
Senator M
CCONNELL ’s staff—I think it 
was 20 minutes until 12—and I kept saying: If we can’t fix this, I have to call the Senator. They said: Please don’t. Well, we worked it out this morning. 
I see the Senator from Rhode Island 
Mr. W
HITEHOUSE is coming in now. I 
told the Senators that Rhode Island counts on this Federal highway trust fund for 100 percent of the funding. I also did not mention that Senator W
HITEHOUSE is on the Environment and 
Public Works Committee. He is a very active and productive member. There is a program in there that is important to all of our States—major programs that will finally have a fund, regardless of whether it is Kentucky, Utah, Rhode Island or California. 
This is a fair bill. It has a good in-
crease for highways and a good in-crease for transportation. States and cities want it. Yesterday, I found out from Senator I
NHOFE —who, by the way, 
did a terrific national radio address on this issue, and I thank him for that— that the mayor from Oklahoma City and the mayor from New York City wrote a letter saying how desperately they need the certainty. We are on the cusp. 
AMENDMENT NO . 2327 
Mr. President, I personally support 
the Ex-Im Bank. I know my colleague Senator M
CCONNELL and I do not agree 
on this. I think the Ex-Im Bank is im-portant. 
We should not forget that we are still 
recovering from the worst recession since the Great Depression. We need to stay focused on putting people back to work, creating jobs, and growing the economy. 
We can do that by passing the trans-
portation bill. I thank my colleagues for working together on this bill, and for their patience with this process. This bill will support millions of jobs and thousands of businesses nation-wide, it will help rebuild our country’s infrastructure, and it will strengthen our economy. 
It will also provide funding certainty 
for State and local governments and the construction industry, which was hard hit in the Great Recession. There 
are approximately 1.4 million fewer construction workers today compared to 2006—which equals roughly 20 per-cent of all construction jobs—and over 522,000 construction workers remain out of work in the U.S. 
The law that authorizes our transpor-
tation programs will expire in just 5 days—on July 31st—and the Highway Trust Fund is going to run out of money shortly after that. Many States, including Utah, Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee, and Wyoming, have delayed or canceled construction projects due to the uncertainty in Federal transpor-tation funding. 
We have the opportunity to pass a 
bill, the DRIVE Act, which is vital for jobs and the economy. Last week, a let-ter was sent from 68 groups calling on the Senate to vote for a six-year reau-thorization of federal surface transpor-tation programs. This letter was signed by labor groups such as the Operating Engineers, the Laborers International, and United Brotherhood of Carpenters, as well as business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Na-tional Association of Manufacturers, and the National Retail Federation. 
This letter was also signed by the 
American Association of State High-way and Transportation Officials, AASHTO, our State DOTs, who know better than anyone the importance of certainty from a long-term bill. 
Today we have the opportunity to do 
even more to help grow our economy by reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank. I ap-plaud my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who worked so hard to reach a bipartisan agreement for a multi- year reauthorization. 
At a time when too many of our 
workers are still looking for jobs, the Ex-Im Bank helps American businesses create jobs. Last year alone, it fi-nanced $27.5 billion in exports for over 3,000 businesses, supporting over 164,000 American jobs. And over the last 6 years, it has supported a total of 1.3 million jobs. 
Not only that, the bank helps the 
United States level the playing field when so many other countries heavily subsidize their exports. The Ex-Im Bank helps American businesses com-pete fairly. 
Even more important, this job cre-
ation comes at no cost to the public. The Ex-Im Bank covers its own costs— sometimes even returning money to the Treasury—and maintains a default rate of under 2 percent. 
Unfortunately, as of July 1, the Ex- 
Im Bank has been unable to process any new transactions—and this poses a real threat to our economy. Business deals that are months or years in the making are now on hold, and may fall through, unless we reauthorize the Ex- Im Bank immediately. 
Let me tell a few stories about the 
Ex-Im Bank’s impact in California. Since 2009, the Ex-Im Bank has helped almost 1,000 California exporters—702 are small businesses—to make deals to export $18 billion in American prod-
ucts. 
Here are just a few examples of what 
the Ex-Im Bank has done for California businesses. 
FirmGreen, based in Newport Beach, 
CA, is a veteran-owned business that converts landfill gas and other renew-able resources into renewable energy and clean fuel. Financing from the Ex- Im Bank enabled FirmGreen to lead a landfill gas project in Brazil, which generated 165 new manufacturing jobs across seven States. Unfortunately, FirmGreen recently lost a $57 million contract because of the uncertainty surrounding the Ex-Im Bank reauthor-ization. The company’s CEO Steve Wilburn put it well recently, ‘‘For Con-gress to create a partisan issue out of a bipartisan entity that is supporting U.S. business and growing jobs simply for the debate is just wrong.’’ 
Los Kitos Produce, a minority, 
woman-owned produce company in Or-ange, CA, wanted to expand its busi-ness to new markets overseas. To re-duce the risks involved in selling to new foreign buyers, the company ap-plied for an insurance policy from the Ex-Im Bank. This insurance facilitated $750,000 in sales and the company’s ex-pansion into Colombia and Korea. This helped to increase exports from 5 per-cent to 25 percent of their total sales. 
Martha Montoya, CEO of Los Kitos 
Produce, said: 
Without the Ex-Im Bank, I’d lose my grow-
ers’ trust to ship overseas. Our growers rein-vest everything back into their business and back into their community. They can’t af-ford to risk not being paid. Congress needs to support American small business by reau-thorizing the Ex-Im Bank. The bottom line is: without Ex-Im Bank, we wouldn’t be able to export. 
ProGauge Technologies of Bakers-
field, CA, manufactures machines that inject steam into reservoirs to thin out oil so it is easier to pump. In recent years, the company received $15.6 mil-lion in Ex-Im loan guarantees. Exports now make up 65 percent of the com-pany’s revenue. ProGauge President Don Nelson said: 
Without Ex-Im bank, [a lender] would 
make us put up 100 percent collateral, and we would have no money available for oper-ations. . . . Revenues would go down by about 75 percent and I’d have to lay off be-tween 50 and 60 people. Ex-Im is critical to our business. 
The Washington Post reported that 
ProGauge will have to withdraw its bid for a $30 million project in the Middle East if the Ex-Im Bank is not reauthor-ized. ‘‘It’s going to be devastating for us’’ said CEO Don Nelson. ‘‘Basically, we just won’t be able to operate any-more.’’ 
Wiggins Lift Company is a small 
business in Oxnard, CA, that employs over 50 workers and has been family owned for three generations. The Ex- Im Bank recently provided financing of $1.4 million for Wiggins to export its forklifts to three Brazilian companies. This deal will help to sustain an esti-mated 30 jobs at Wiggins Lift.

everyone’’ said Wiggins Lift CEO Michelle McDowell. ‘‘These sales are helping us continue to grow, add em-ployees, and contribute to the U.S. economy.’’ 
These are just a few stories of what 
will be lost if the Ex-Im Bank is not re- authorized. Every day that the Ex-Im Bank is unable to make new loans, more and more businesses will lose op-portunities to compete and sell their products worldwide, and that means jobs lost right here in America. 
Let’s do the right thing. Let’s reau-
thorize the Ex-Im Bank. Let’s pass the highway bill. Let’s create jobs and strengthen our economy. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
important reauthorization. 
To sum it up, we have a lot of small 
businesses that count on the Ex-Im Bank to finance them so they can ex-port our products. We have so many in our State. 
I hope it passes on a bipartisan vote, 
and I thank Leader M
CCONNELL . I know 
this is not something he likes at all, but he made a commitment and he is sticking to it. 
Lastly, we are going to have a vote 
to overturn ObamaCare. Senator H
ATCH  
and I were discussing how much we dis-agree on this point, but I told him I wouldn’t hold back. I think it doesn’t make any sense. 
We are looking at millions of people 
nationwide who now have health insur-ance and cannot be told by their in-surer they have a preexisting condition like high blood pressure or diabetes, forget it. We have so many families that now have their 24-year-old, 25- year-old, 26-year-old on their insur-ance. 
I have stories that will make you feel 
good—stories from people in my State. One person had her cancer caught at a very early stage, and as a result of that she has lived to tell the tale. Before ObamaCare, she couldn’t have gotten the tests she needed to discover this deadly cancer. 
I just say rhetorically to my friends 
on the other side—and they are my friends. I will tell you, we have really built up some relationships over this bill, which I am so happy about. Why don’t we work together to fix the prob-lems? We know no bill is perfect. The Transportation bill is far from perfect, and we had to fix that too. 
Maybe there is a new day dawning. 
We keep saying that, but it doesn’t seem to be happening. But maybe something good is going to come from the bipartisanship, tough as it has been. The Transportation bill is far from perfect. I wanted to do so much more on safety, and I have to say that Senator N
ELSON did such a good job. I 
must have talked to Senator W YDEN  
half a dozen times. He kept putting on pay-fors that were good, but they were rejected by the other side. We could have done so much more if we had gone that way. We did what we could do, and just as in the trade battle where our caucus was very split, our caucus is 
very split here. 
I hope we can find enough courage 
and interest, and most important, keep this in mind: This is, to me, the poster child of why we have come together. This America, this doesn’t look like America. It is wrong, and we can come together and hopefully vote for Ex-Im Bank, against the repeal of ObamaCare, and then move forward with a good cloture vote tomorrow night on our very much compromised bill on transportation—because it is a compromise. 
Again, my thanks to people on both 
sides of the aisle—Democrats, Repub-licans, and everybody—for moving this along. 
I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
AMENDMENT NO . 2328 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have 
spent much of my time in public serv-ice working to promote bipartisanship in health care. In fact, the distin-guished chairman of the Finance Com-mittee is here. I think he may speak next. Our colleague from Tennessee Senator A
LEXANDER is a cosponsor of 
my comprehensive health care reform bill. So, for me, bipartisanship and health care policy is enormously im-portant, and there are certainly plenty of ways in which Democrats and Re-publicans could be working together to strengthen the Affordable Care Act. Unfortunately, that does not seem to be on the menu either today or in this Congress. 
Today, instead of looking forward on 
health care in America, the Senate, on a transportation bill, will have a vote on whether to go backward on health care—backward to the days when health care in America was for the healthy and the wealthy. I specifically used those words because the moment you repeal the Affordable Care Act, millions of Americans lose protection against preexisting conditions. The moment that happens, if you are healthy and wealthy, no sweat, but for the millions who are aren’t, they are back in that abyss where they go to bed at night worried that they may get wiped out the very next morning be-cause they have a preexisting health condition. 
Protection for those individuals will 
be gone the moment the Senate votes. I hope the Senate will not vote for end-ing the Affordable Care Act this after-noon, but the moment it does, gone is that protection for preexisting condi-tions. Gone are the tax credits. These are opportunities for Americans to get a little bit of tax relief when hard- working families pay for health insur-ance—gone when we repeal the Afford-able Care Act. Gone would be the pro-tections that bar insurance companies from charging top dollar for rock-bot-tom coverage. Gone would be the pro-tections for young adults. Right now, they can’t be locked out of their par-ents’ insurance plans. Gone would be the protection for individuals to make 
sure their insurance isn’t canceled the moment they get sick. Once again, pregnancy could be considered a pre-existing condition. 
So what I think this shows is that 
this debate is no longer about numbers on a page, bills we write, lots of charts, lots of graphs, lots of small print. But this isn’t an abstraction, when we go back, as I have described, to the days when health care was for the healthy and the wealthy. More than 16 million Americans have gained health insur-ance coverage by virtue of the Afford-able Care Act. Their health is on the line every single time there is a vote to repeal that law. So those are the con-sequences. 
I will wrap up because I see my good 
friend from Tennessee is here, as well as my Senator and my colleague from Utah. Both of them have joined me re-peatedly in trying to promote bipar-tisan approaches on health care policy. I don’t take a backseat to anybody in this body on working on health care policy in a bipartisan fashion. There is nothing that I think would be more valuable than to have Democrats and Republicans come together, not to talk about repealing this law but to find ways to strengthen it. There is not a law that has been passed that we can’t strengthen. And having spoken with my friend from Utah and my friend from Tennessee repeatedly, I think they know I am serious about reaching out for common ground with respect to this issue. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time 
of the Senator has expired. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent for 30 additional seconds. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. WYDEN. The pie-in-the-sky in-
sistence that the Affordable Care Act will be repealed and somehow we will not have the suffering I have just de-scribed—that is not reality. 
What we ought to do is reject this 
amendment to repeal the Affordable Care Act and then get back to work in a bipartisan way to strengthen the law. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Tennessee. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, 
will the Chair please inform me when 10 minutes has expired. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Chair will so notify. 
APPEAL OF THE RULING OF THE CHAIR  
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, 
today there will be at least three votes. The first, as we have heard, is to end debate on Senator M
CCONNELL ’s 
amendment to repeal ObamaCare. The second will be to end debate on the Ex-port-Import Bank. Then there may be a third vote on an appeal by the Senator from Texas, Mr. C
RUZ, to overturn a 
ruling of the Chair that an amendment of his is not in order. This is how that came about. On Friday Senator C
RUZ 
offered an amendment regarding Iran.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5706 July 26, 2015 
The Chair ruled that the amendment 
was not in order because—and this is what the Chair said, in fact—‘‘it is in-consistent with the Senate’s prece-dents with respect to the offering of amendments.’’ The Senator from Texas then appealed the ruling of the Chair. His intention today will be to try to obtain a majority vote to overturn the 
Chair’s ruling. 
I respect the Senator’s strong desire 
to offer his amendment, but I believe he ought to do it within the Senate rules or I believe we should change Senate rules in the way our rules pre-scribe. If, instead, a majority of Sen-ators agree with the Senator from Texas, the Senate will be saying that a majority can routinely change Senate rules and procedures anytime it wants on any subject it wants in order to get the result it wants. The problem with that, as former Senator Carl Levin of Michigan once said, is that a Senate that changes its rules anytime a ma-jority wants is a Senate without any rules. 
Think of it this way. Football season 
is coming up. Let’s say the Tennessee Titans are playing football against the Indianapolis Colts in Nashville and the home team sets the rules of the game. So when the Titans gain 9 yards, they change the rules to say 9 yards is a first down or when the Colts gain 100 yards, the Titans say: Sorry, you need 110 yards to score a touchdown. No one would want to play such a game. No one would want to watch such a game. No one would respect such a game. That is why every Monday in New York City a team of former National Foot-ball League officials reviews every ref-eree’s call and noncall from the pre-vious Sunday’s games played in the NFL. The league wants to make abso-lutely sure its rules are followed. And the NFL has a rules committee that meets between seasons to consider changes in the rules. It has rules about how to change its rules. The NFL, of course, wouldn’t even consider allow-ing the Titans to change the rules in the middle of a game in Nashville in order to defeat the Colts. 
The U.S. Senate has a rules com-
mittee, too, and we have rules on how to change our rules. We should follow those rules. The U.S. Senate is the chief rulemaking body for the United States of America. If we cannot follow our own rules, how can we expect 320 million Americans to follow the rules we write for them? If we render our-selves lawless, how can we expect our fellow Americans to respect and follow the rule of law? 
There is a practical problem with 
what the Senator from Texas seeks to do. If he succeeds, it will destroy a cru-cial part of what we call the rule of regular order in the U.S. Senate. He will create a precedent that destroys the orderly consideration of amend-ments. There will be unlimited amend-ments. There will be chaos. And iron-ically, while destroying regular order, he wouldn’t get the vote on the Iran amendment he seeks. That is because if 
he overrules the Chair and creates an-other branch of the amendment tree, the Senate leaders have a right to offer an amendment to fill that new branch of the tree before he does. 
The U.S. Senate is unique in the 
world. It has been called the one au-thentic piece of genius of the American political system. Its uniqueness is based upon a variety of rules, prece-dents, procedures, and agreements that encourage extended debate. This proc-ess encourages consensus, and con-sensus is the way we govern a complex country, whether it is a civil rights bill or a trade agreement or an education bill. But a body of 100 of us that oper-ates by unanimous consent requires re-straint and good will on the part of Senators to function. We saw a good example of that a couple of weeks ago when the Senate passed 81 to 17 in 1 week a complex elementary and sec-ondary education bill. Any Senator could have made that process much more difficult, but not one did, and the country is impressed with that result. 
There are different ways—several dif-
ferent ways—to establish Senate rules and procedures, but they all fall under the same umbrella. There are standing rules adopted by the first Senate in 1789 with the advice of Thomas Jeffer-son. There are standing orders. Some-times we set rules by passing a law, such as the Budget Act. Sometimes we establish a rule by unanimous consent or by agreeing to a new precedent. Taken together, all of these represent the full body of the Senate’s Rules of Procedure. These Rules of Procedure have several things in common, no matter how they were established. The authority for establishing and chang-ing each of them comes from the same place: article I, section 5 of the United States Constitution. Every one of them can be changed by 67 votes, following rule XXII of the Senate, except that a standing order may be changed with 60 votes. 
One other thing these different forms 
of rules and precedents have in com-mon is that the latest change super-sedes whatever rule or precedent was established earlier. So if the Senator from Texas persuades the majority of us to overrule the Chair today, that de-cision governs the Senate forever until it is changed or unless it is changed. So there is no real difference between changing a rule or changing a prece-dent. What is important is not how the precedent was established or the rule was established but what is being over-turned. 
It is true that occasionally the Sen-
ate majority uses its power to overturn the ruling of the Chair to refine the in-terpretation of rules or precedents. This means that in some limited cir-cumstances, the Senate changes its rules by majority vote. 
The question today is not whether we 
can overturn the ruling of the Chair but whether we should overturn the ruling of the Chair. I believe we should not do so. To do so would destroy reg-
ular order in the Senate. It would cre-ate chaos in the Senate. Most impor-tantly, a Senate in which a majority routinely changes the rules by over-ruling the Chair is a Senate without any rules. 
There is a right way and a wrong way 
to change our rules and procedures. This would be the wrong way. I urge my colleagues to not agree with the Senator from Texas in his effort to overturn the ruling of the Chair. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
TREATING EACH OTHER WITH COURTESY AND  
RESPECT  
Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise 
today to address the Senate in my ca-pacity as President pro tempore. I hope my colleagues will give attention to what I am about to say and will take it to heart because I speak from the heart out of respect for my colleagues and out of love for this great body in which we are all privileged to serve. 
The Senate has a long and justly 
celebrated tradition of comity and re-spect among Members. Although there have been occasional exceptions throughout history, on the whole, Sen-ators have taken great care to treat each other with courtesy and respect, both in private discussions and in pub-lic deliberations. We do this for several reasons—first, because mutual respect is essential for us to be able to work together to forge consensus on difficult issues that stir deep and sometimes di-visive feelings. Passing meaningful leg-islation in this body typically requires the two parties to work together, and that, in turn, requires a trust and a certain level of good will. Courtesy and decorum foster an atmosphere where we can work in good faith to find com-mon ground, where we can appeal to nobler instincts to do what is best for all Americans, not just those of a par-ticular partisan persuasion. 
The second reason we treat each 
other with courtesy and respect is be-cause it is the honorable thing to do. We come to this body as 100 men and women with vastly different back-grounds, life experiences, and views on how government should operate. But we share a common humanity and a common goal to improve this great Na-tion and to secure the blessings of lib-erty for ourselves and our posterity. We divide into parties and join cau-cuses. We fight passionately about matters of tremendous consequence. But we do not become enemies. We re-main colleagues. And colleagues treat each other with respect. We treat each other with honor even when we feel an-other has perhaps not accorded us the same esteem. Squabbling and sanc-timony may be tolerated in other venues or perhaps on the campaign trail, but they have no place among colleagues in the U.S. Senate. 
The third and most important reason 
we treat each other with courtesy and respect is because we are the people’s representatives. We are not here on

some frolic or to pursue personal ambi-
tions; we are here because the people of the United States have entrusted us with the solemn responsibility to act on their behalf in shaping our Nation’s laws. This is a high and holy calling. It is not something to take lightly. It is a sacred trust in which pettiness or grandstanding should have no part. We are here to do serious work. In doing this work, egos will inevitably be bruised. Feelings from time to time may be hurt. This is inherent in the na-ture of politics. But we are here to carry out the people’s business. We serve the people, not our own egos. When we are on the losing side of a par-ticular debate, when we are dis-appointed, we pick ourselves up and move ahead to the next challenge. 
Our Nation’s Founders designed the 
Senate to play a special role in our constitutional system. In contrast to the more raucous, populist House, the Senate was to be a body of deliberation and reasoned judgment. Senators were to seek the common good and consider national, not just parochial, interests in crafting legislation and considering nominees. 
Decorum is essential to executing 
this constitutionally ordained role. De-liberation and reasoned judgment re-quire an atmosphere of restraint, an atmosphere of thoughtful disagree-ment. Deliberation without decorum is 
not deliberation at all; it is bickering. And bickering is beneath this body. 
Regrettably, in recent times, the 
Senate floor has too often become a forum for partisan messaging and ideo-logical grandstanding rather than a setting for serious debate. It has been misused as a tool to advance personal ambitions, a venue to promote polit-ical campaigns, and even a vehicle to enhance fundraising efforts—all at the expense of the proper functioning of this body. Most egregiously, the Senate floor has even become a place where Senators have singled out colleagues by name to attack them in personal terms and to impugn their character— in blatant disregard of Senate rules which plainly prohibit such conduct. 
The Senate floor has hosted many 
passionate debates on crucial issues over the years. Tempers from time to time have flared. Voices have on occa-sion been raised. But we have almost universally confined our criticisms to policies and to ideas, to what we think is wrongheaded about particular bills or proposals. We have not, at least in my memory, called our opponents dis-honest or sought to disparage their mo-tives. 
To bring personal attacks to the Sen-
ate floor would be to import the most toxic elements of our current political discourse into the well of the Senate, into the very heart of this institution. This would serve only to pollute our deliberations, to break the bonds of trust that are essential for achieving some measure of consensus, and to in-vite the dysfunction that so saturates our media and popular culture into this storied Chamber. For those of us who care about the 
Senate as an institution and who want it once again to help solve the vexing challenges that face our Nation, such misuse of the Senate floor must not be tolerated. Each of us—Republicans and Democrats alike—must stand together in support of the Senate’s time-hon-ored traditions of collegiality and re-spect. We must stand resolute in re-quiring that the Senate’s formal rules requiring dignity and decorum be ob-served. And we must ensure that the pernicious trend of turning the Senate floor into a forum for advancing per-sonal ambitions, for promoting polit-ical campaigns, or for enhancing fund-raising activities comes to a stop. There are enough other platforms for those seeking to accomplish those ob-jectives; the Senate floor need not be one. 
Mr. President, I recognize that many 
of my colleagues are quite new to the Senate and may not yet have had many opportunities to experience its proper 
institutional role as a forum for rea-soned deliberation and constructive de-bate. Some are less familiar with its traditions of comity and respect. Oth-ers may know little of the Senate’s his-tory in rising above parochialism and narrow self-interest. And a few, I re-gret to say, seem unconcerned for its historic pivotal role in promoting con-sensus and helping to overcome our Na-tion’s challenges. 
As one who has had the privilege of 
serving here for the past four decades, I can attest from firsthand experience that the Senate can be and has been in times not too far past a distinguished and constructive body that does much good. I recall vividly times when this body was marked by good will rather than rancor and disrepute. In some re-spects, the Senate today is but a mere shadow of its former self, another cas-ualty of the permanent political cam-paign. This is deeply disheartening to those like myself who were here to ex-perience this body’s better days, and it has severely damaged the proper gov-ernance of our Nation. 
Mr. President, I have been frank in 
my remarks today. This candor stems from my genuine concern for this body and its future. I have been frank be-cause I have seen so much of what I love about this body frittered away in recent years for small-minded, short-sighted, partisan gain. By virtue of my long service here in the Senate and my role as President pro tempore, I am a dedicated institutionalist. I care deep-ly about this institution and want it to work. 
Our current majority leader has 
made important strides in putting the Senate back on a path toward mean-ingful deliberation and constructive lawmaking aimed at the common good, but his efforts and those of other Sen-ators on both sides of the aisle who take the long view in seeking to build up this institution will not suffice un-less each one of us is committed to in-stilling comity and respect as a core feature of everything we do. Let’s each move forward with a re-
newed sense of honor and respect, a re-solve not to tolerate misuse of the Sen-ate floor, a commitment to do our part to restore civility and constructive de-bate as defining characteristics of this body, and a renewed willingness to work together for the good of all Amer-icans. 
Thank you, Mr. President. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
APPEAL OF THE RULING OF THE CHAIR . 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I thank the 
senior Senator from Utah for an excel-lent speech. I entirely agree with his call for civility and decorum and re-spect. No Member of this body should engage in ad hominem attacks directed at any other Member of this body, be they a Republican or be they a Demo-crat. At the same time, I would note that it is entirely consistent with deco-rum and with the nature of this body traditionally as the world’s greatest deliberative body to speak the truth. Speaking the truth about action is en-tirely consistent with civility. Indeed, in a quote often falsely attributed to George Orwell, the sentiment has been expressed thusly: ‘‘In a time of uni-versal deceit, telling the truth is a rev-olutionary act.’’ 
I would make four brief points. First of all, on Friday I gave an un-
usual speech—a speech unlike any I have given in this Chamber. It was not a speech I was happy to give. It was a speech to which the senior Senator from Utah has responded. I would note that in the course of that speech I de-scribed an explicit promise the major-ity leader had made to me and to all 53 Republican Senators. Neither the ma-jority leader, nor the Senator from Utah, nor the Senator from Tennessee has disputed that the majority leader, in front of every Republican Senator, made that promise, looking me in the eyes—namely, that there was no deal on the Export-Import Bank, that its proponents could offer it in the regular order and there would be no special preferences whatsoever. We saw on Fri-day that promise was false. 
In particular, on the amendment on 
the Export-Import Bank, first of all, it was not offered by its proponents, it was called up by the majority leader. Very few of us get our amendments called up by the majority leader be-cause he has priority of recognition, he can edge out any other amendment in this Chamber. 
Secondly, the majority leader fol-
lowed that by filling the tree—a proce-dural mechanism that he had often de-cried when the former majority leader employed it to block other amend-ments. 
Third, the majority leader filed clo-
ture on the Export-Import Bank amendment—a tool he has used only once in his entire tenure as majority leader. 
Those were extraordinary steps de-
signed to force a vote to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, and they were

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5708 July 26, 2015 
directly contrary to the promises the 
majority leader made to all 53 Repub-licans and to the press. My saying so may be uncomfortable, but it is a sim-ple fact entirely consistent with deco-rum, and no Member of this body has disputed that promise was made and that promise was broken. 
The senior Senator from Tennessee 
gave a learned speech on changing the rules of this body through appealing the ruling of the Chair, and I very much agree. When the former majority leader used the nuclear option, it was wrong to violate the rules. But the amendment tree does not come from the rules, the amendment tree comes from the precedents, and precedents are set precisely through appealing the rulings of the Chair by a majority vote. 
Indeed, I would note that previously 
many Members of this body have voted in favor of overruling the ruling of the Chair, including my friend, the senior Senator from Tennessee, who has voted 4 times in his career to overrule the ruling of the Chair; my friend the ma-jority whip, who has voted 5 times in his career to overrule the ruling of the Chair; and, indeed, the distinguished majority leader, who has voted 14 times in his career to overrule the rul-ing of the Chair. I would note beyond that, that as recently as April 2, 2014, there was a third-degree appeal pre-cisely like the one I have filed that was filed by Senator V
ITTER . The ruling of 
the Chair was appealed, and a signifi-cant number of Republicans voted in favor of that appeal, including the ma-jority leader and including the major-ity whip. 
Many Republicans railed against the 
filling of the tree when the Democratic leader was the majority leader. If it was an abuse of power then, it remains so today. Indeed, I would note what the current majority leader said at the time: ‘‘The practical effect of [filling the tree] is to disenfranchise the people I and my members represent, and, more significantly, a significant number of the people his members represent whose voices are simply not heard in the Senate.’’ 
Beyond that, let me say on the sub-
stance that if you oppose filling the tree to silence the amendments of Members, be they in the majority party or the minority party, you should vote in favor of allowing my amendment to go forward. 
I would note that the Senator from 
Tennessee was incorrect that it would allow unlimited amendments. It would simply add a third branch to the tree and not unlimited amendments. 
At the same time, if you are resolved 
to stand with our friend and ally the Nation of Israel, if you are resolved to stand with American hostages in Iran, and if you are convinced to not lift sanctions on Iran unless and until Iran recognizes Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish State and that they release four American hostages, then you should vote to allow that amendment to be voted on. Needless to say, if you oppose the Ex-
port-Import Bank, you should vote to allow that amendment to be voted on. 
Finally, if you want other amend-
ments on pressing issues, be they defunding Planned Parenthood, be they stopping sanctuary cities, be they pass-ing Kate’s Law, or be they ending the congressional exemption from Obamacare, you should vote in favor of allowing this amendment to be voted on. 
A great many Members of this body 
have given long, eloquent speeches on how this body operates when each Member has a right to offer amend-ments—and even difficult amendments. We debate and resolve them. That is the heart of this vote, and I would en-courage each Member here to vote his conscience or her conscience on both substance and the ability of the Senate to remain the world’s greatest delib-erative body. 
I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for up to 5 minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I have 
listened to the comments of my col-league, the junior Senator of Texas, both last week and this week, and I would have to say he is mistaken. 
First of all, if, in fact, the majority 
leader had somehow misrepresented to the 54 Senators what the facts are with regard to the Ex-Im Bank, I suspect we would find other voices joining that of the junior Senator, but I hear no one else making such a similar accusation. 
Secondly, I would just say to my col-
league that there is an alternative ex-planation. There is an alternative ex-planation. As the majority leader has said time and time again, anytime 65 Senators want to do something here in the Senate, sooner or later they are going to get their way. Indeed, that represents the vote in support of the Ex-Im Bank—something I will end up voting against but where I realize that majorities will carry the day eventu-ally. 
But if the rule the junior Senator 
from Texas is arguing for is embraced, we will lose all control of the Senate schedule; there will be chaos; and, in-deed, we won’t be able to meet simple deadlines, such as the one that exists on the 31st of this month with regard to the expiration of the transportation fund, because even after we close off debate, any Senator who wants to get a vote on an amendment will be entitled to do so. And that cannot be the rule. It is not the rule. It has never been the rule. And that is why what the junior Senator is attempting to do is so ex-traordinary. 
I will be opposing that, and I hope all 
of our colleagues will join us in oppos-ing that because ultimately what that would mean is that a determined 51 Senators who want to raise taxes, who 
want to pass Obamacare 2.0, who want to pass a cap-and-trade bill or a carbon tax, who want to pass Dodd-Frank 2.0, or any additional government spend-ing—they will be able to do it. They will be guaranteed an opportunity to get an amendment and be able to vote on that amendment, and it will pass in the Senate. I don’t think that is in the best interests of the Senate. I don’t think it is in the best interests of the 27 million people whom the junior Sen-ator and I represent together. I cer-tainly don’t believe that is in the best interests of this institution which we all revere. 
If all 100 Senators have the oppor-
tunity to offer an amendment without restraint, then there will never be any deadline. There will never be any con-clusion, and we would not be able to do the simple work that we have been asked to do on behalf of the American people. 
The final point is this. I know the 
junior Senator feels passionately about this amendment. But the fact of the matter is that we have a process that has been set up to review the Iran deal that President Obama and Secretary Kerry negotiated. We are going to have a chance to examine it, debate it, and review it over the next 2 months, and then we will have a chance to vote on it. There is a time and place for this vote. I will no doubt support the same position that the junior Senator is sup-porting. It is not on this bill. It is not now. It is not at the expense of break-ing the orderly procedures that make sure that everyone gets a chance to participate. I would just say in conclu-sion that there was no misrepresenta-tion made by the majority leader on the Ex-Im Bank. 
The only thing the majority leader 
promised was an opportunity to offer an amendment on a bill, recognizing that if he denied that opportunity, when 65 Senators wanted it—not just one Senator who we know can stop things around here, slow them down— the 65 Senators would be bound and de-termined to use any available leverage until they got that vote. So I agree with what the majority leader has de-cided to do and how he has decided to handle it. I know there are passionate views around here, but that does not justify changing the rules of the Sen-ate through such extraordinary means. So I hope our colleagues join me to rat-ify the ruling of the Chair when that time comes rather than to overrule it. 
To overrule the Chair on something 
this important to the orderly consider-ation of the Senate’s business would be a terrible mistake. 
I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. 
P
ERDUE ). The Senator from Tennessee.

AMENDMENT NO . 2328 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, on Friday,

HONORING MARINE LANCE CORPORAL SKIP  
WELLS  
Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, while 
we have a pause in our business for a moment, I rise to offer a brief but sin-cere eulogy. At this very moment in Woodstock, GA, Skip Wells, U.S. Ma-rine Corps lance corporal, is being bur-ied and worshipped. Thousands of Geor-gians are at the First Baptist Church of Woodstock, GA to attend his fu-neral. 
Skip Wells was murdered in Chat-
tanooga, TN, on the 16th day of July while he was doing his duties as a ma-rine, recruiting people to come into the U.S. military. 
Skip graduated from Sprayberry 
High School just a few years ago. He played the clarinet and musical instru-ments in his church orchestra. He was a great student with thousands of friends. He was a young man we would all be proud of. His life was taken away from us in a snap by an enraged person on a religious tear. 
When a young man of 21 years old 
dies in the prime of life, we ask why. In particular, when he wears the uniform of the U.S. Marine Corps, we ask why. It is inexplicable. We all know the 
Book of Ecclesiastes tells us, ‘‘There is a time for everything’’—a time to be born and a time to die. There is never 
a time when a young marine’s life should be taken. It causes us to truly think about something. As we act in this U.S. Senate and guide our country, hundreds of thousands of young men and women volunteer to wear the uni-form of the United States of America, and when they put it on, they never know when that day to die might come, but they have all made the com-mitment that they are ready, willing, and able to die for the country they love, the United States of America. 
To Skip’s mother Cathy, his extended 
family, and all those who knew Skip, we send our condolences and our best wishes for them to recover over time and heal. 
In Woodstock, GA, an inscription is 
being read right now, which I will read on the floor of the Senate so we will read it at the same time. These words are comforting, they mean something, and in a time of grief for all of us, I think they are important. Skip’s moth-er wanted this as a part of the cere-mony. It is entitled ‘‘To Those I Love.’’ 
When I am gone, release me, let me go. 
You musn’t tie yourself to me with tears. Just be happy that we had so many good 
years. 
I gave you my love, you can only guess, How much you gave to me in happiness. I thank you for the love you each have 
shown, 
But now it’s time I traveled alone. So grieve a while for me, if grieve you 
must, 
Then let your grief be comforted by trust. It’s only for a while that we must part, So bless the memories within your heart. I won’t be far away, for life goes on, So if you need me, call, and I will come. Though you can’t see or touch me, I’ll be 
near. 
And if you listen with your heart, you’ll 
hear, 
All of my love around you, soft and clear. And then, when you must come this way 
alone, I’ll greet you with a smile, and say ‘‘Welcome Home.’’ 
That is the Book of John, Chapter 15, 
the 13th verse. ‘‘Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.’’ 
Skip Wells laid down his life for all of 
the people of the United States of America, for his family, and for his friends. We ask God to bless him and bring mercy to his family. We ask God to bless the great country that Skip wore the uniform to die for—the United States of America. 
I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

BUDGET RECONCILIATION 
REPORTING DEADLINE 
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, section 
2001(a) of S. Con.

SEC. 52109. FAIR PLAYING FIELD ACT. 
(a) S HORT TITLE.—This section may be 
cited as the ‘‘Fair Playing Field Act of 2015’’. 
(b) F INDINGS .—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) In 1978, Congress was concerned that 
lack of clarity as to the proper classification of some workers, increased IRS enforcement activity, and retroactive application by IRS of interpretations that were arguably new had caused hardships for some small busi-nesses and other taxpayers and confusion as to the applicable rules. 
(2) To allow time to develop a comprehen-
sive approach to the problem, Congress en-acted section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978 as an interim measure protecting taxpayers from liability for misclassification if the taxpayer has a reasonable basis for classifying a worker as an independent con-tractor and meets certain other conditions. In addition, the Act prohibited the Secretary of the Treasury from publishing regulations or revenue rulings on workers’ employment tax status pending the expected near-term enactment of clarifying legislation. 
(3) During the ensuing 33 years, Congress 
made section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978 permanent; however, changes in working re-lationships and the continued prohibition on new guidance have increased the uncertainty as to the proper classification of workers. 
(4) Many workers are properly classified as 
independent contractors. In other instances, workers who are employees are being treated as independent contractors. Such misclassification for tax purposes contrib-utes to inequities in the competitive posi-tions of businesses and to the Federal and State tax gap, and may also result in misclassification for other purposes, such as denial of unemployment benefits, workplace health and safety protections, and retire-ment or other benefits or protections avail-able to employees. 
(5) Workers, businesses, and other tax-
payers will benefit from clear guidance re-garding employment tax status. In the inter-est of fairness and in view of many service recipients’ reliance on current section 530, such guidance should apply only prospec-tively. 
(c) P
URPOSES .—The purposes of this section 
are to permit the Secretary of the Treasury to provide guidance allowing workers and businesses to clearly understand the proper Federal tax classification of workers and to provide relief allowing an orderly transition to new rules designed to increase certainty and uniformity of treatment. 
(d) A
