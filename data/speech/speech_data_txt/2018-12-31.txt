HONORING COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTER 20TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 31, 2018 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize a wonderful organization in my dis-trict that this year is celebrating its 20th Anni-versary, the Community Resource Center lo-cated in Mamaroneck, New York. The mission of CRC is today more impor-tant than ever. Formerly the Hispanic Re-source Center, it is a 501(c)(3) community- based organization founded in 1998 to pro-mote the cultural, economic, educational and professional integration of immigrants to the already established larger community. It is also dedicated to advocating for those in need. CRC aims to provide the tools to pre-pare new immigrant families to become self- sufficient and active members of the commu-nity. Over its 20 years in existence, CRC has grown from a community initiative designed and acting as a clearinghouse of information and referral services, to an organization that provides comprehensive direct client services and programs. The Center provides a host of educational programs, case management and referral services and advocate for immigrants and low-income families in need. In the past year, the Center served nearly 4,000 adults, youth, and children in three primary areas: Case management and social services; Edu-cational programs and workshops; and Worker Center-job placement for men and women seeking employment. The Center understands that the Westchester community is strength-ened by cultural and economic diversity, and the work they do in support of that cannot be overstated. Mr. Speaker, the America I know welcomes all immigrants and isn’t afraid to lend a helping hand to those in need. I am proud to rep-resent an organization like Community Re-source Center that provides that loving hand every single day. Congratulations to the entire CRC team on 20 wonderful years serving the community, and here’s to many more.

HONORING JERRY FRIEDMAN’S 90TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 31, 2018 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor for me to recognize a dear friend, Jerry Friedman, who this year is celebrating his remarkable 90th birthday in addition to his 63rd wedding anniversary to his wonderful wife, Lillian. Lillian and Jerry were married in the Bronx on December 10th, 1955. Together they have two children, Lynn and Stuart, who were both born while the couple lived in Brooklyn, and now 2 grandchildren, Sophie and Ben. In 1971, the Friedman family moved to Co-op City, which is where Pat and I met them as members of the Co-op City Democratic Club. We have been close ever since. Jerry was a very active member on the Riverbay Board for many years, and at one point served as Vice President for three terms. He was also instrumental in the rent strike, acting as an advocate for residents. When I first ran for State Assembly, Jerry and Lillian were two of my earliest supporters. I’ll never forget the faith they placed in me. Outside of his activism, Jerry is a wonderful amateur photographer whose pictures have hung in the Riverdale Y and other local spots. He was also very active in the Boy Scouts and over the years rose to their highest office. In addition, Jerry served on the Board of Visitors at Bronx Psychiatric Center, which provides a continuum of inpatient, outpatient and related psychiatric services with inpatient hospitalization at the main campus. Mr. Speaker, I have long cherished my friendship with Jerry Friedman and I count my-self incredibly fortunate to have known him for so many years. He is a terrific individual who has done so much to help strengthen our community here in the Bronx, and I am hon-ored to be able to recognize him on this won-derful occasion. Congratulations to Jerry on an incredible 90 years. f 
RETIREMENT OF MATTHEW PINKUS 
HON. ROBERT A. BRADY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 31, 2018 Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I have the opportunity to inform colleagues that Mr. Matthew Pinkus, our Committee senior policy adviser and parliamentarian to House Administration Committee Democrats, retired recently, concluding a congressional staff ca-reer which began as an intern in 1971 and in-cluded 19 years on our committee, the longest of the more than twenty different congres-sional professional positions he had held dur-ing that period, including time as chief legisla-tive assistant to Rep. Michael Barnes (D) of Maryland for the congressman’s entire tenure in the House. Whether working in House leadership, on five different congressional committees and in Members’ offices, Matt excelled in a huge vari-ety of tasks. A summer college job as a con-gressional intern in the House for Rep. Ben-jamin Rosenthal of New York while attending Brandeis University prompted Matt to leave graduate school at U.C. Berkeley after receiv-ing an M.A. in political science and work in Washington full time, first at Congressional Quarterly, then for a month in the Senate, and then the remaining decades in the House. He said of that path, ‘‘I decided very early on that, as much as possible, I would do things the way I wanted and try to have fun. Usually, that worked.’’ Matt had an eclectic career path since his first full-time job here in 1976, when he left a political reporting job at Congressional Quar-terly. He often chose to seek work in specific subject areas which interested him, rather than follow the common alternate staff career path of attaching himself to one or two mem-bers and remaining in place. He was first ap-pointed to the Committee on House Adminis-tration Democratic staff in 1991 by Rep. Sam Gejdenson of Connecticut to work on cam-paign finance reform, and then moved on to the Brookings Institution as a guest scholar on their ‘‘Renewing Congress’’ project before re-turning to the House in 1995 to work on over-sight of the executive branch at the Committee on Government Reform. Between Hill jobs in the 1990s, Matt had finished writing a book for Congressional Quarterly in 1998, How Con-gress Works, and was ready to once again re-turn to the House. Then-House Administration Ranking Member Gejdenson asked him to work on election contests, and he remained here to work sequentially for Ranking Mem-bers HOYER , L ARSON and Chairwoman Millender-McDonald. Matt was probably best known on the Hill as one of the top experts on rules and process, serving on the Rules Committee staff and twice on the Subcommittee on Rules of the House, including as subcommittee staff direc-tor. His most distinctive job was as parliamen-tarian of the House Democratic Caucus for six years, which recognized and utilized his vast knowledge of the Caucus rules. It was a posi-tion created especially for him and lasted through the service of Chairmen Robert Menendez, J
IMCLYBURN , Rahm Emanuel and J
OHN LARSON —all while he also worked simul-taneously on the House Administration Com-mittee. He was known for always being care-fully prepared, totally candid, and was not in-timidated by Members. Matt was always our committee parliamen-tarian, managed floor operations, and worked on elections legislation, congressional con-tinuity issues, and the Smithsonian Institution. He drafted and edited views on committee re-ports and other publications, and proofed spe-cialized historical books published by the House. He would discuss parliamentary strat-egy in the morning and then make an over-sight visit to the National Zoo to learn about artificial insemination of Giant Pandas in the afternoon, something made possible by CHA’s very eclectic jurisdiction. Matt sat behind me for years on the Com-mittee on House Administration dais when I was a junior member and helped provide ad-vice on hearings and markups for Members but when I suddenly became chairman in 2007 following the death of Chairwoman Millender-McDonald, he was there with an in-tricately drafted manager’s parliamentary script for my very long first markup. This was a to-tally new role for me. When I went off script at some points and noticed Matt’s look of con-cern, after avoiding disaster, I told him that

while I might sometimes deviate from his text, he should just keep right on doing what he does. Matt says he plans to travel, look for oppor-tunities to write, and again take up playing chess, which he learned at the age of four from his father, AI, who was one of America’s leading players in the mid-20th century.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 31, 2018 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct privilege to honor and recognize the accom-plishments of a dear friend, a dedicated public servant, and an overall wonderful human being, my colleague Congressman J
OECROW-
LEY. This year, the Ancient Order of Hiber-nians in the Bronx is honoring J
OEat their An-nual Dinner Dance. They could not have picked a more deserving honoree. J
OEand I go way back, starting with our days together in Albany as Members of the New York State Assembly. A native of Woodside, Queens and lifelong New Yorker, J
OEhas served the people of the Bronx and Queens in Congress since 1998. Before being elected to Congress, J
OEreceived a bach-elor’s degree from Queens College, ran a suc-cessful small business for nearly a decade and represented the 30th Assembly District in the New York State legislature. Throughout his career in public service, J
OEhas been driven by a desire to protect New York’s middle class. J
OEhas always been dedicated to making the Bronx-Queens community more pros-perous and secure. He established the Crime Stoppers program in 2002 to support local or-ganizations that are working to reduce crime and improve the quality of life in our neighbor-hoods, and it has delivered more than $1 mil-lion in federal funding to the Bronx-Queens community for graffiti clean-up, after-school programming, and civic patrol efforts. As Chairman of the Democratic Caucus, the fourth-highest ranking position in House Democratic Leadership, J
OE’s efforts in Con-gress focused on building strong communities, creating jobs, increasing access to health care and housing, protecting seniors’ hard-earned benefits, and opening up educational opportu-nities for working families. When not fighting for his constituents, J
OE can be found spending time with his lovely family—wife Kasey Crowley and their three children—or playing with his band. Both local and national media have recog-nized J
OEfor his effective and impressive record of leadership in Congress. The New York Times has noted that his peers consider him to be a ‘‘hard working representative’’ who is ‘‘an impassioned advocate for his district.’’ I couldn’t have said it better myself. Come Jan-uary I will miss J
OE’s presence in Washington, but I know he will continue to be a powerful force for good in the New York City commu-nity. Congratulations to J
OEon this honor and a remarkable career. HONORING THE LINCOLN PARK JEWISH CENTER 80TH ANNIVER-SARY HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 31, 2018 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to cel-ebrate one of the great religious institutions in my district, the Lincoln Park Jewish Center lo-cated in Yonkers. This year, the Center is celebrating its remarkable 80th Anniversary and I would like to take the opportunity to rec-ognize that feat in Congress. Lincoln Park Jewish Center is an inclusive, modern Orthodox Jewish congregation that strives to create spiritual growth through pray-er, acceptance, community and fellowship. To achieve this goal, the synagogue supports the following: HaMakom Tefilah, a place to in-crease spirituality with heartfelt prayer by en-couraging personal growth through participa-tion, self-reflection, and spontaneity; HaMakom Ahavat Chinam, unconditional love and acceptance, regardless of background or current level of observance; HaMakom Limud Torah, a place to search and study Torah leading to a more fulfilling Jewish life; and HaMakom Simcha, a place to enjoy and cele-brate. The congregation at Lincoln Park Jewish Center is currently led by Rabbi Levi Welton, who was ordained by the prestigious Machon Ariel Institute of Jerusalem in 2005 and has since then served congregations in Australia, San Francisco, and, of course, Yonkers New York. His pastoral experiences include young professional development, inter-faith work, community building and multimedia produc-tion. Additionally, Rabbi Welton is the Founder of the Torah Values Network, a staff writer for New York Jewish Life Magazine, and a Cap-tain in the United States Air Force. The Lincoln Park Jewish Center has pro-vided incredible support to its congregants and the community for 80 years now. Here’s to 80 more. Congratulations to Rabbi Welton and the entire Lincoln Park Jewish Center family on this great occasion.

HONORING DR. ANDREA CODDETT 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 31, 2018 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a dedicated public servant in the Yon-kers community, Dr. Andrea Coddett, who this year has been named ‘‘Woman of the Year 2018’’ by the Luther V. Garrison Sr. Masonic Foundation Inc. Dr. Coddett is the Deputy Superintendent for the Yonkers Public Schools. In her role, she oversees the Division of Teaching and Learning, ensuring that all curriculum is aligned to the New York State Learning Stand-ards and that all instruction is aligned to 21st Century learning skills, so students are pre-pared for college and or careers. As the Chair-person of the Yonkers Basics Advisory Board, Dr. Coddett leads a team of approximately 40 volunteer members from various community sectors charged with saturating the community with five research-based interactive pillars proven effective in redressing cognitive and social-emotional inequities due to poverty. Dr. Coddett began her career in education as a Special Education teacher after which she became a building-level Math Specialist. In her administrative career, Dr. Coddett has worked as a District Math Specialist PreK–12, an Early Childhood Principal, a K–5 principal, a Director of Secondary Special Education and an Assistant Superintendent for Instruc-tion K–12. Dr. Coddett is a graduate of Fordham Uni-versity where she earned a doctorate in Exec-utive Leadership. She holds Masters Degrees in Curriculum and Instruction with a Reading specialization and Educational Administration from Pace University and a Bachelor degree in Psychology from Mercy College. Dr. Coddett also holds administrative certifications in School District Administration and School Building Administration and Supervision, as well as teaching certifications in Special Edu-cation, birth through 21, and General Edu-cation, N–6. Dr. Coddett continues to influence school transformation and policy decisions by serving on Carnegie Foundation’s national Im-provement Leadership Education and Devel-opment (iLEAD) steering committee with uni-versity and school-based educators committed to integrating improvement science principles into leadership development and educational practice. Having lived in and been educated in four different countries on three different con-tinents, Dr. Coddett considers herself a global citizen. It is her contention that as an edu-cational leader, she is one of the gate-keepers of tomorrow and believes that each and every child deserves an excellent education. As a former classroom teacher myself, I happen to agree wholeheartedly. Dr. Coddett has achieved a great deal and is well deserving of this honor. Congratulations to her on receiving this wonderful recognition. f 
HONORING CO-OP CITY 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 31, 2018 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the largest co-operative housing devel-opment in the nation and a place that holds a particularly meaningful place in my heart, Co- op City in the Bronx. This year, Co-op City celebrates its 50th Anniversary and as such stands as one of the great housing successes in our country’s history. Co-op City is a New York State Mitchell- Lama housing cooperative with apartments in high-rise and townhouse buildings. There are three shopping centers on Co-op City prop-erty, 8 parking garages, professional offices and a complete educational park. Construction of Co-op City began in 1966 on a site that was formerly home to an amusement park at which I used to work as a young man called ‘‘Freedomland.’’ Residents began moving into the complex in 1968, and construction was completed in 1973. Co-op City is divided into five sections, with each section denoted by a letter of the alphabet. Co-op City is managed by the Riverbay Cor-poration and is led by a Board of 15 residents, each elected to three-year terms.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1741 December 31, 2018 
Co-op City is a special place, not just to me, but to the thousands of people who have had the privilege of calling it home over the years. I myself am a former Co-op City resident, and my family and I lived there for many years. I have so many fond memories from my time there; from starting a family to beginning my career in public service, I can trace so many wonderful moments and life-events back to my Co-op City days. I can also trace so many wonderful friendships back to Co-op City, many I still cherish to this day. As fortunate as I was to have lived in Co- op City, I am just as fortunate to now rep-resent Co-op City in the halls of Congress. I hope that my service can in some way give back to the community that has given me so much. As a part of the Mitchell-Lama housing pro-gram, Co-op City has provided quality housing at an affordable rate to generations of New Yorkers. As we celebrate its 50th Anniversary, it’s important to reflect on just how fortunate we are to have such a strong and thriving housing development in the Bronx. I’m proud to say I lived in Co-op City, and I’m just as proud to still serve Co-op City today as Con-gressman. Congratulations to the Riverbay Board, the entire Co-op City community, and all the resi-dents who have made the past 50 years in Co-op City a tremendous success

FIXING THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRA-TION’S UN-AMERICAN IMMIGRA-TION POLICIES 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 31, 2018 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as an elected representative, but also as a mother— a mother who is horrified and outraged by the actions taken by the Trump Administration to deliberately separate families. Like any mother, I love my children and cannot imagine being separated from them. But because of the Trump Administration’s policies, some mothers have no choice. Just this week, I have been working to re-unite two mothers in my community who were prevented from reuniting with their families. The first story I want to share is of Maria Mendoza-Sanchez. Maria has lived with her family in the East Bay for more than two dec-ades. She and her husband Eusebio raised four beautiful children, worked hard, and pur-chased a home in Oakland. Maria went to school while raising small children and went on to become a nurse at Highland Hospital. She was beloved by her patients and her colleagues. Maria and Eusebio tried to do the right thing. They paid their taxes and came forward to legalize their immigration status. And for years, they were on a path to citizenship. But like many families, Maria and Eusebio’s efforts did not matter to the Trump Administra-tion. Under President Trump’s misguided en-forcement priorities, Maria and Eusebio were targeted for deportation. And last summer—after more than twenty years building a life in our community—Maria and Eusebio were torn from their children and deported to Mexico. But over the last sixteen months, we didn’t give up. We kept working to reunite Maria with her family—to bring her home. Finally, after more than a year of work, we were able to secure an H1-B visa for Maria. And this past Sunday, I was honored and overjoyed to join Maria as she was reunited with her children. But Maria isn’t the only mother torn from her children by President Trump’s immigration policies. Also in the news this week was the story of Shaima, whose son Abdullah Hassan has been on life support at Children’s Hospital Oakland, in my district. Abdullah is two years old and suffers from a genetic brain condition. His mother Shaima, who was born in Yemen, has been barred from travelling to the United States to be with her son because of the Trump Administration’s un-American Muslim ban. Abdullah doesn’t have much time left—and Shaima feared that she would not be able to say goodbye to her young son. Mr. Speaker—is this really who we are? A country that denies mothers safe passage to be with their dying children? No family should ever have to endure this. And in the face of such unimaginable cru-elty, I am proud to say that our community stepped up. I want to thank everyone who showed up, who protested and organized and petitioned for this outcome. Because of your advocacy, the State De-partment granted a visa waiver to Shaima so she can be with her son. She will be able to be with her son, to hug him and to say good-bye. But we know that there are many other peo-ple like Maria and Shaima who remain sepa-rated from their families. When I went down to the border earlier this year, I saw the prison-like conditions that they were keeping children in. There were kids sleeping on concrete floor—with only thin emergency blankets to keep them warm. And to this very day, there are hundreds of children in HHS custody. And Secretary Niel-son can’t tell us when they will be reunited. Let’s be clear: this isn’t an immigration pol-icy. This is a family separation policy. Children torn from their mothers, parents deported away from their kids. And it’s up to Congress to stop it. It’s past time for us to restore—justice, dig-nity and common sense to this immigration system. We need to ensure kids who have lived here their entire lives—like Maria’s oldest daughter—can make a life in the only country they have ever known. We need to get this disgraceful, discrimina-tory travel ban off the books, so no loved one has to experience what Shaima went through. We need to pass comprehensive immigra-tion reform so that people like Maria and Eusebio can come out of the shadows. Mr. Speaker—for every case like Maria’s or Shaima’s there are dozens more left unre-solved. Countless families have been left in limbo, unsure if or when they will ever see their loved ones again. Not only do we owe it to these families to fix our broken immigration system—we owe it to the country and the constitution to live up to American values. f 
HONORING THE COMMUNITY SYNAGOGUE OF RYE 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 31, 2018 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, our houses of worship are often the ties that bind our com-munities together. In Rye, few institutions have been as successful in strengthening the neigh-borhood and bringing people together as the Community Synagogue of Rye, which this year is celebrating its remarkable 70th Anni-versary. One Sunday in early autumn 1948, 7-year- old Betty Wolder asked her parents if she could go to church with her friend Susan who was Christian. Her parents explained that since they were Jewish and did not belong to Susan’s church, she could not attend. Betty continued to ask questions and her parents wanted to give her better answers. The Wolders contacted the few Jewish people they knew in Rye about forming a Jewish religious school, and a sponsoring group of families. The response was extraordinarily positive, and the rest is history. A beautiful mansion—built in 1903 at 200 Forest Avenue—was purchased in June of 1950, and Rabbi Samuel H. Gordon, an expe-rienced, widely traveled liberal Rabbi, was hired as the first spiritual leader in 1950. From there, Community Synagogue grew and flour-ished. The congregation is now around 500 families and over 300 students from Rye, and several communities between Greenwich and White Plains. The synagogue has an ambi-tious education program for both children and adults, numerous opportunities to become in-volved in social action, beautiful worship serv-ices, and life cycle celebrations. Their enthusi-astic and active committees help make the synagogue a dynamic and caring community, and their work has grown beyond the con-gregation to serve the greater community. Community Synagogue of Rye has had an amazing 70 years. Congratulations to the leadership and congregation on this occasion.

HONORING RAY O’HANLON 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 31, 2018 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, the importance of a free and open press cannot be overstated, especially in our local communities. I am very fortunate to represent a district that is covered by the Irish Echo, an outstanding local news-paper, which is led by my friend and one of this year’s Ancient Order of Hibernians’ hon-orees, Ray O’Hanlon. As Ranking Member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I have had the pleasure of working with Ray for many years on a wide variety of topics, including Irish-American issues which have always been particularly close to my heart. Ray is the editor of the New York-published Irish Echo. A native of Dublin who worked for

the Irish Press newspaper group before mov-ing to the United States in 1987, Ray has re-ported from three continents in a news career spanning 39 years. In addition to his work as a reporter and edi-tor, Ray has been a frequent contributor to U.S., Irish, and British media outlets reporting on Ireland, Irish-American affairs, and Anglo- Irish relations. He has appeared on CBS 60 minutes, ABC World News Tonight, and the Lehrer News Hour on PBS. He has also been interviewed on RTE, BBC and ITV, both tele-vision and radio. A prolific writer, Ray’s book, ‘‘The New Irish Americans’’ (Roberts Rinehart, 1998) was the recipient of a Washington Irving Book Award. ‘‘The South Lawn Plot,’’ his first fiction work, was published in 2011 by Boston-based Gemma Media publishers. Ray is currently working on a new book on Irish immigration that will have a particular focus on the 1965 Immigration Reform and Nationality Act. A graduate of University College Dublin, Ray lives with his wife Lisa, a native of Danville, Il-linois, in Ossining, New York. They have three grown children: Kate, Liz and Jack. Ray O’Hanlon has accomplished a great deal over a long and distinguished career. He is most deserving of this wonderful recognition from AOH. Congratulations to Ray and I thank him for all he continues to do on behalf of our community.

HONORING THE YONKERS CHAM-BER OF COMMERCE 125TH ANNI-VERSARY 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 31, 2018 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I want to honor a civic organization in Yonkers that this year is celebrating a remarkable milestone—the Yon-kers Chamber of Commerce. 2018 will mark 125 years for the Chamber, which for well over a century now has worked to improve economic development in the region while building and promoting the city of Yonkers. The Chamber’s legacy of service began, of-ficially, on May 1, 1893 when William F. Coch-ran, a leading Yonkers businessman, entered the old City Court Room and rapped his gavel to officially sanction what was to become a tradition to the local business community. The Yonkers Board of Trade was born. A number of prominent citizens, fifty-two to be exact, gathered to sanction what would later become Yonkers’ leading business organization. A decade later, the Board of Trade contin-ued to address issues of concern and helped establish a visible and viable business com-munity. In 1903 the decision was made to form a Chamber of Commerce, and the proc-ess to make this a reality was put into place. On December 8, 1913, the Yonkers Chamber of Commerce officially became the 325th cer-tified member of the United States Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber of Commerce has served as the guardian and advocate of business, and works to foster a healthy relationship with gov-ernment to establish programs designed to en-hance business opportunities and attract new commercial establishments to the city. The Chamber of Commerce represents a diversi-fied membership of retail, industry, profes-sionals and service organizations, etc. from major corporations to ‘‘mom and pop’’ stores. Each member is treated with the same respect and concern, regardless of size. Today, the mission of the Yonkers Chamber of Commerce ‘‘to serve, build and promote a progressive city’’ is alive and well. Congratula-tions to the entire Yonkers Chamber of Com-merce Board, leadership, and membership on reaching this remarkable milestone. f 
HONORING THE AFYA FOUNDATION 10TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, December 31, 2018 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an organization that has done tre-mendous work both locally and on the global stage for 10 remarkable years now, The AFYA Foundation. The vision for AFYA began to take shape in a tent in the Serengeti. It was 2008, and AFYA’s founder, Danielle Butin, was in Tan-zania. She saw a woman sitting in a tent cry-ing, who said, ‘‘I am a highly sought-after phy-sician from London, I took a month off from my practice to come here to volunteer and work in medical clinics. But they have nothing . . . absolutely nothing. I cannot save children from malaria because there are no meds or IV bags of fluids. People come in with infected wounds, and I have nothing to treat them with.’’ In that moment, Danielle was compelled to take action. She returned home and imme-diately put her familiarity with and experience in New York City healthcare to use—cold call-ing hospitals and asking about materials that are discarded. In January 2008 she launched AFYA, which means ‘‘health’’ or ‘‘wellness’’ in Swahili. Almost immediately, hospitals started donat-ing supplies. Since they didn’t have a ware-house to store the equipment and supplies, a semi-trailer sat for three weeks outside her home in Westchester County. These humble beginnings are what grew 10 years later into an organization with a staff of 14, 3,000 volun-teers annually, and a 17,000 square foot warehouse in Yonkers. Today, AFYA continues to serve those in need with the same compassion that inspired its vision ten years ago on the African savan-nah. As the Congressman representing Yon-kers and the Ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I couldn’t be prouder of the work they have done and con-tinue to do. I want to congratulate Danielle and the entire AFYA team on ten remarkable years and thank them for all they have done to better our community and world.
