We pray for the gift of wisdom to all with great responsibility in this peo-ple’s House for the leadership of our Nation.

CELEBRATING 50 YEARS OF GIV-ING BACK TO M
CHENRY COUNTY (Mr. HULTGREN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate 50 years of community service rendered by the United Way of Greater McHenry County. Members of the community came to-gether in the fall of 1966, with the pri-mary purpose of raising funds in order to help deserving organizations achieve their goals. In that first year alone, United Way raised more than $21,000. This money went to funding organizations such as the Salvation Army and the American Red Cross, which remain faithful part-ners today. By 1977, the United Way’s importance was rapidly increasing throughout the community, as they created new part-nerships with several agencies. In fact, the United Way of Greater McHenry County became the fastest growing United Way of its size in the country. During their 25th anniversary year, they delivered more than $1.1 million to local organizations and have continued that record over the years. I am grateful to celebrate this 50- year milestone with the people of United Way of Greater McHenry Coun-ty as they continue to help our neigh-bors help each other. f 
TAX PLAN (Mr. D
EFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. D
EFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, well, yes-terday, the Republicans unveiled their tax cuts that they purport to benefit the middle class. Nothing could be fur-ther from the truth. Then again, I

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH8448 November 3, 2017 
guess it depends upon your definition of middle class. Eighty percent of the benefits flow to those who earn over $400,000 a year. Perhaps that is middle class to that side of the aisle. They repealed the alternative min-imum tax. We have only seen one Trump tax return: $31 million. Eighty percent of his taxes were a result of the alternative minimum tax. That is a middle class tax cut? Oh, then slashing permanently the corporate rate to 43 percent, that is going to really benefit the middle class. They pretend somehow that is going to raise salaries. Give me a break. Then, under the guise of family farms and small businesses, small businesses and family farms, between $11 million and $22 million will no longer pay an inheritance tax. That is middle class? All of these things are going to drive up the debt by $2 trillion, which raises interest rates for everybody who has to borrow money to go to college, buy a car, or buy a house. Oh, and if you want to go to college, you can’t deduct your student loan in-terest anymore. Adopt a kid? No, we did away with that deduction, too. This is a ruse by the public. We have to kill this turkey before Thanks-giving. 
f 
HONORING WAYNESVILLE HIGH SCHOOL FRESHMAN MENTOR COUNCIL (Mrs. HARTZLER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize some outstanding high school students from my district in Missouri, who have displayed a deep appreciation and respect for our Armed Forces. Before the last regular season varsity football home game, members of the Waynesville High School Freshman Mentor Council presented pocket flags to the 763rd Ordnance Company, who will soon be deploying. The students also presented the pocket flags to Waynesville High School’s Partners in Education, the 787th Military Police Battalion and 3rd Battalion, 10th In-fantry Regiment, to share with deploy-ing soldiers. The flags are part of the Pocket Flag Project, which provides military per-sonnel on the front lines with personal pocket flags. Waynesville High School freshmen folded the flags and wrote personalized messages to accompany each flag on Patriot Day. I applaud these students for taking the initiative to honor our men and women in uniform. With young people like these walking down the halls of schools, I am certain America has a bright future. PROTECT WIND ENERGY INVESTMENT (Mr. BLUMENAUER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, as time goes on, people are going to have a chance to look at the details of the Republican tax plan. It is clear that the benefits are concentrated to those who need help the least, ignoring those who need help the most, and producing an unaffordable deficit in the future. But one of the most disturbing ele-ments of this is that the Republican plan would gut the agreement that we negotiated in good faith with the wind energy industry to be able to wean them off tax subsidies. It was phased down in exchange for that certainty. The industry has up to $50 billion that is at risk by having the Federal Gov-ernment pull the rug out from under-neath them. We were well on the path towards sustainability with a clean American bill—low carbon energy. It puts at risk 50,000 jobs as a result of the reversal in course, and it raises questions for American business whether or not they can trust the American Congress to keep a deal. This is an element that must be changed. We must respect the agree-ment that we made and protect the massive investment in manufacturing and employment. f 
TAX REFORM ISN’T ABOUT PER-CENTAGES, IT IS ABOUT PEOPLE (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today because, when we talk about the Tax Code, it is easy to get bogged down in numbers. But tax re-form isn’t about percentages, it is about people. It is about small-business owners like Sean Register, in Georgia’s First Con-gressional District, who wants to grow his business that has been his passion for much of his life. Mr. Register is the sole owner of Reg-ister International, a shipping business in Bryan County, Georgia: a type of business very important to the Coastal Empire’s economy. Mr. Register worked hard to guide his business through the 2008 financial crisis, but, in the economic downturn, was forced to lay off employees, leav-ing himself as the only one remaining. Now, he would like to hire employees but needs a little push to be able to af-ford the extra help. With our tax reform plan, Mr. Reg-ister will have the ability to grow his business and provide much-needed jobs to citizens in the First District. Tax reform has many faces, more than 300 million, and every single one of them inspires our work in Congress as progrowth tax reform. We will get this done for them. REPUBLICAN VISION FOR TAX REFORM NOT PRETTY (Ms. ESHOO asked and was given per-mission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, Republicans unveiled their vision for tax reform, and it is not pretty. The proposal raises taxes on the mid-dle class and showers the wealthiest 1 percent of our country with 80 percent of the benefits, at a total cost of $1.5 trillion charged to our Nation’s credit card. The plan should be called ‘‘Hurt the Middle Class Act.’’ It eliminates personal deductions for medical expenses; it eliminates the de-ductibility of interest paid on student loans; it eliminates the deductibility of State and local income taxes, again, raising taxes on the middle class; and to add insult to injury, the proposal eliminates the deduction for personal property losses from one natural dis-aster fire. Now, in California, we just experi-enced the worst fires in California’s history. Over 14,000 people lost their homes, at a cost of at least $3 billion. The heck with them. When policies weaken the middle class, the backbone of our country, they weaken our entire country. The President said tax reform will be the best Christmas present of all, but, for the middle class, this bill will be one lump of coal. 
f 
SUPPORTING HEALTHY KIDS (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act. This important legislation continues much-needed funding for programs like the Children’s Health Insurance Pro-gram, community health centers, and our rural hospitals. Community health centers are a crit-ical access point to care, and I have seen firsthand how they bless each per-son they serve. In addition to community health cen-ters, my district includes many rural hospitals, which are truly a lifeline for my constituents. That is why I join my colleagues in letters urging to delay the cuts for the proposed disproportionate share of hos-pital and community health centers for at least 2 years. And I am happy to see this legislation doing just that. I won’t let Washington forget about the rural communities at the heart of my district. They deserve better. And guess what? This bill is fully paid for. While delaying these cuts is a step in the right direction, I will continue to fight for a permanent solution. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Energy and Commerce Committee for their work,

and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.

CUTTING TAXES FOR THE SUPERRICH AT THE EXPENSE OF EVERYONE ELSE (Mrs. DEMINGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong opposition to the Republican deal to cut taxes for the superrich at the expense of every-one else. Apparently, Republicans believe the American people are just too distracted to recognize a con game when they see one. But make no mistake, the Repub-lican plan is about giving tax breaks to the largest corporations and the superrich. It is not about the middle class or people who have to go to work every day. If working families had an opportunity to read the fine print, they would see that this bill has nothing to do with them. Don’t be fooled. The money needed to make this plan work has to come from somewhere. It will hurt working Amer-icans and will cause our deficit to ex-plode. The strength of our country requires investing in people: so our children can have a better future, so their parents can have better jobs, so small busi-nesses can thrive, and so seniors can retire with dignity. That is the Amer-ica that we want, and that is the Amer-ican promise we must keep. 
f 
ENSURING THE HEALTH OF OUR NATION’S CHILDREN (Mr. BROWN of Maryland asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speak-er, 20 years ago, Congress enacted with strong, bipartisan support the Chil-dren’s Health Insurance Program. It fulfilled one of the highest respon-sibilities we have, which is to ensure the health and well-being of our Na-tion’s children. Children without health insurance are less healthy, they go to the emergency room for chronic conditions like asthma and diabetes, and they do worse in school. The program is extremely successful, increasing insurance coverage for chil-dren to 95 percent nationwide. Because of this, 138,000 Maryland children—and more than 8 million around the coun-try—have received routine checkups, vaccinations, sick visits, prescriptions, dental and vision care, and emergency services. We should not only reauthorize CHIP but work together to ensure every child in America has insurance. Instead, the Republican Party is breaking the history of bipartisanship that CHIP has long enjoyed. Repub-licans are forcing us to choose between insuring kids and taking away cov-erage from 700,000 low-income Ameri-cans, raising premiums on seniors, and cutting the Prevention and Public Health Fund. Mr. Speaker, let’s stop playing poli-tics with the healthcare of our chil-dren. f

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour equally di-vided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Com-mittee on Energy and Commerce. The gentleman from Oregon (Mr. W
ALDEN ) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. P
ALLONE ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, we are here today to consider a very, very important public health bill, H.R. 3922, the CHAM-PIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act. This legislation funds a 5-year extension of the Children’s Health Insurance Pro-gram, known as CHIP, along with a 2- year extension of community health centers and numerous other critically important public health programs. This bill will deliver quality healthcare and peace of mind to mil-lions of Americans. The patients and families helped by this legislation are our neighbors and our friends. More than 8 million children receive CHIP- funded coverage, and more than 25 mil-lion patients are served by our commu-nity health centers and other impor-tant programs. This 5-year funding of CHIP marks one of the longest extensions of the program since it was created 20 years ago. The policy we are considering mir-rors the bipartisan policy that has been introduced and voted out of our sister

committee in the United States Sen-ate. Funding for these important pro-grams expired September 30. The com-mittee worked on a bipartisan basis well before this deadline to try and reach a bipartisan agreement on a range of policies to offset the costs of this very critically important funding extension. Three times, at the request of the Democrats, we delayed committee ac-tion—three times. We tried to find off-sets that were agreeable as we have al-ways been able to do before. Unfortu-nately, that was not the case this time. These delays meant Congress went past the deadline of September 30. While States still have rollover CHIP funds available and the next wave of community health center funds won’t go out until next year, we cannot wait any longer. Patients cannot wait any longer. Patients need care, these crit-ical programs need funding, and we must move forward. In my district alone, there are 12 fed-erally qualified health center organiza-tions, with 63 delivery sites. They le-verage $41 million in Federal money in order to serve more than 240,000 pa-tients in Oregon’s Second District. These health centers—and I have vis-ited many of them—are prevention and public health in action, often serving as the main provider of care for people for hundreds of miles around. We are also extending the National Health Service Corps and the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Edu-cation program. Now, Mr. Speaker, these are really important workforce programs that place qualified providers into some of the most underserved areas of our country. In addition to community health cen-ters and the workforce programs, this bill extends the funding for the Special Diabetes Program and the Family-to- Family Health Information centers, the Personal Responsibility Program, and the Youth Empowerment Program. These locally based, patient-centered organizations provide comprehensive services to those most in need. Moreover, this legislation eliminates 2 years of the across-the-board cuts to Medicaid allotments called for under the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare. We delay those cuts for dispropor-tionate share hospitals for 2 years. Medicaid DSH funding represents an important component of many State Medicaid programs and is particularly relied upon by many States to help provide additional resources to key safety net providers. Now, while this relief is only tem-porary and does not address the larger structural challenges under ObamaCare, it would give Congress time to explore what budget-neutral approaches there might be to allocate existing DSH dollars on a more equi-table and fair basis. In my State alone of Oregon, hospitals have told me this relief in this bill, just for them, rep-resents $6.8 million over the next 2 years that they can use to help low-in-come people get access to hospital care. Now, in paying for this package—and this is the area where we have the most disagreement with the Democrats—we have taken a fiscally responsible ap-proach, like using existing funding streams for prevention and public health efforts, ensuring high-dollar lot-tery winners are removed from the Medicaid program so its limited re-sources can be prioritized for the most vulnerable, and stopping individuals on the Affordable Care Act’s exchanges from gaming the system. The bill also asks Medicare’s wealthi-est 1 percent, people who are retired and making $40,000 a month—not a year, a month—to pay about $135 more for their Medicare just on parts B and D that is already subsidized by 75 per-cent, just a little more so we can fund children’s health insurance for 5 years. While it was not ultimately possible, unfortunately, to reach consensus on some of the policies to offset the new funding in this bill, there is broad bi-partisan agreement on the core policies contained in this legislation, and I be-lieve there is bipartisan support for many of the reasonable and fiscally re-sponsible offsets contained in H.R. 3922. Mr. Speaker, this is good legislation. This is long-overdue legislation. It re-flects the good work done by your House Energy and Commerce Com-mittee, and I urge my colleagues to put politics aside today and ensure these vital programs get the funding exten-sions they need. We are over the dead-line. It is time to act. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in opposition to H.R. 3922, a partisan bill to reauthorize the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, as well as community health centers and other public health programs. It pains me to be here today, because this should not be a partisan bill. I have tried for months to negotiate with Republicans to develop a bipar-tisan compromise, but House Repub-licans chose to spend the first 9 months of this year trying to repeal the Afford-able Care Act. They failed, but now House Republicans are using the reau-thorization of CHIP and community health centers as a way to once again sabotage the ACA. Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker: if Re-publicans can’t repeal the ACA out-right, they will cripple it any time they can. This time, Republicans are risking the healthcare of nearly 9 million chil-dren and the care of families all around the country that use community health centers. They are risking that care because this partisan bill has no chance of ever becoming law. By taking this route, Republicans are guaranteeing that CHIP and commu-nity health centers will not be reau-thorized until the end of the year, and that is extremely unfortunate. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support CHIP, our community health centers, and all of our public health programs that are extended in this bill. These programs have traditionally been bi-partisan, but the bill before us extends these programs by taking billions of dollars away from the Affordable Care Act and undermining Medicare. In short, this Republican bill offers a false choice. On one hand, it strips healthcare away from upwards of 680,000 Americans and guts the Preven-tion Fund, which pays for immuniza-tion and vaccines, lead poisoning pre-vention, opioid treatment, and many other important programs; on other hand, it reauthorizes these important programs. Democrats strongly support reauthorization of these programs, but we reject the way Republicans are pay-ing for them. Mr. Speaker, there are so many other policies that save money, countless al-ternatives that Democrats have offered to Republicans for months. Yesterday I offered an alternative that would have provided a robust reauthorization and extension of these important programs, and it was paid for in a commonsense way. My alternative would have changed the timing of payments to Medicare Advantage Plans. This approach was recommended by both the GAO and the Office of the Inspector General, but Re-publicans rejected it in the Rules Com-mittee. They wouldn’t even allow it to come before the full House for a vote. And why is because they would rather use reauthorization of CHIP and com-munity health centers as another way to sabotage the Affordable Care Act. I simply reject that approach and strongly urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, before I call on my next person to say some-thing here, there are 17,000 children in Mr. P
ALLONE ’s district and 14 health centers that, if he votes ‘‘no,’’ he will be voting against. By the way, the offset he rec-ommended, people who are watching this need to know, would violate stat-ute and it would be a PAYGO violation. That is why it was not acceptable. See, this is the problem we faced. We delayed three times at their request only to be offered up a pay-for that vio-lates statute and violates our PAYGO rules. We could not accept that. We have to operate within the law like ev-eryone else in America. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. B
URGESS ). Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding the time, for the recognition. Let me just say, I want to thank members of the Health Subcommittee, both sides of the dais, who have worked hard on this legislation, and it is unfor-tunate that it was not brought to the floor of the House in the month of Sep-tember.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH8458 November 3, 2017 
From a subcommittee perspective, we were ready. We had our legislative hearings in June. We were delayed one time when the whole House recessed after the shooting of the Members at the baseball practice, but we resched-uled for 2 weeks later, and we had a successful hearing. We had a good hear-ing; a lot of facts were laid out. We came up with commonsense legislation that was offset in a responsible way. The offsets are not draconian. We have before us a bill today that will, in fact, fund some of the Nation’s most important public health pro-grams. It does fund the State Chil-dren’s Health Insurance for 5 years, one of the longest extensions for this pro-gram since its inception in 1996. It will ensure that children and families who rely on this program will continue to receive the access they need. It also in-cludes, in a fiscally responsible way, to delay the harmful ObamaCare-man-dated cuts to safety net hospitals, who also provide care to underserved pa-tients. Now, think about that for a minute. We are accused of undermining ObamaCare, but here is a cut that ObamaCare mandates to your safety net hospitals across the country—not just in Texas, but across the country— and we are replacing that today in a fiscally responsible way. It provides funding for community health centers, an important key part of healthcare in communities across the country. It will help the Americans who rely on these vital health services. Not only does the bill provide assist-ance for underserved populations, but it does so without adding to the na-tional debt. The Committee for a Re-sponsible Federal Budget called this a responsible health package, noting that the $18 billion cost is fully offset, with savings beyond the 10-year budget window. Other groups have also been sup-portive: Texas Hospital Association, Texas Health Resources—for me back home—Children’s Hospital, and a num-ber of healthcare organizations. We have data from MACPAC, whose job it is to advise Congress on Medicaid and CHIP policy; and MACPAC has ad-vised us that, under current law, there are no new Federal funds for State Children’s Health Insurance for fiscal year 2018 and beyond. Unless Congress acts to renew funding, all States will experience a shortfall in CHIP funds for 2018, which means, if someone is con-templating a ‘‘no’’ vote on this bill, if you are contemplating a ‘‘no’’ vote, you do need to be aware that if you live in the States of Arizona and Min-nesota, you ran out of money in Octo-ber of 2017; North Carolina, same situa-tion. Oregon runs out next month. Vermont runs out next month. You need to think about your ‘‘no’’ vote be-fore you apply it. Every single U.S. territory, with the exception of Puerto Rico, ran out of money in the month of October. So those are a few facts that people do need to bear in mind, if they vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill, what the actual im-plications of that are. Yesterday, during debate on the rule, I heard a lot of discussion about taking money out of the Prevention Fund. It doesn’t take money out of the Preven-tion Fund, but it does provide discre-tion for some prevention and public health dollars. It takes it away from the executive branch and redirects these dollars to proven public health programs that enjoy broad bipartisan support in Congress, like community health centers. So we are fulfilling our Article I re-sponsibility. We shouldn’t just be giv-ing everything to the administration to decide how to spend money, whether it be a Democratic or Republican ad-ministration. This is the right thing to do. I am proud of the work done by our subcommittee. I think our sub-committee staff has performed admi-rably on both sides of the dais. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the bill. It is time to act, as our chair-man has said. b0930 Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. E
SHOO ). Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I thank our distinguished ranking member. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose this bill, the so-called CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act. First of all, we are a month late and many dollars short. It was the majority that brought it up late. We didn’t have anything to do with being late. Secondly, we are playing political games with the lives of 14 percent of the children in my congressional dis-trict who receive their health insur-ance through the Children’s Health In-surance Program and the five federally qualified health centers in my congres-sional district. They provide medical, dental, and mental health services to almost 55,000 of my constituents every year. Reauthorizing these historically bi-partisan programs is critical to the health and safety of not only my con-stituents but millions of others across our country. Today, the Republican majority is holding them hostage by insisting to fund these programs by means-testing Medicare beneficiaries, kicking indi-viduals who purchase their health cov-erage on the marketplaces off their in-surance, and gutting the Public Health Prevention Fund established in the Af-fordable Care Act. Remember, the Republicans have set their budget based on eliminating the Affordable Care Act. My State of Cali-fornia will run out of funding for CHIP sometime between now and December. This has never happened before in the history of this program. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentle-woman from California. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, the com-munity health centers in my district have told me about the difficult deci-sions they have to make because Con-gress has not reauthorized their fund-ing, including layoffs of physicians and closing clinics’ doors. We are playing with people’s lives here. If we can’t find the funding for these important bipartisan programs, then we don’t deserve to be Members of Con-gress. I cannot support a bill that hurts people instead of helping them. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to respond. Mr. Speaker, my friend, and she is my friend from California, obviously was not aware of the fact that it was her party, her leader, who asked us on three occasions to delay bringing this to the floor, including you could look at the CQ article from October 23 where Mr. PALLONE says he hopes it doesn’t come to the floor. This was a bipartisan agreement not to bring it until we could try to work these things out. We were all trying to figure out how to get this done. When it comes to Medicare, remem-ber, we are talking about people mak-ing $40,000 a month paying $135 a month more. We can fully fund chil-dren’s health insurance for millions of children. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. M
CMORRIS RODGERS ), the con-ference chairwoman. Mrs. M
CMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his tremendous leadership on the reauthor-ization of CHIP, including many vital public health programs. CHIP provides healthcare coverage for some 9 million children—more than a million in Washington State. We all need to remember how important this program is for the health of some of the most vulnerable. Some States, like mine, are expect-ing to run out of CHIP funding soon. It is crucial that we move forward now. This bill also reauthorizes the Teach-ing Health Center Graduate Medical Education program, providing funding for 2 years, with a robust increase. This not only preserves current programs like the Spokane Teaching Health Cen-ter, but it also provides funding for the creation of new programs in commu-nities that need them. Mr. Speaker, this bill makes a real difference to those who need healthcare, and I encourage my col-leagues to support it. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, it is the ultimate ab-surdity for my colleague, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Com-mittee, to suggest that somehow I con-trol when a bill comes to the floor of the House of Representatives. The only reason that the Republicans ever delayed bringing this vote to the floor is because they know and I know that, if this bill is partisan, it will

never become law. It will go to the Senate, and it will sit there, and the only way that it is going to become law is if it is a bipartisan effort that actu-ally accomplishes something and gets most people to support it. We could keep listening to the other side all day say: Oh, the Democrats de-layed the vote. The Democrats delayed the vote. The vote shouldn’t be held today. The vote should be delayed today be-cause this is going nowhere. This bill is going nowhere. They know it. You want to keep saying it? You can say it all day for the next hour, but it is the ultimate of absurdity. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. G
ENE G
REEN ), who is the ranking member of our Health Subcommittee. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank my ranking member for yielding time to me. I rise to oppose H.R. 3922. I got elect-ed to Congress to expand access for healthcare. I am not a doctor, I am not a nurse, but as Members of Congress, we can do as much damage as someone who isn’t a doctor or nurse by legisla-tion that we see today. And while I strongly support extend-ing funding for the Children’s Healthcare Insurance Program and fed-erally qualified health centers, delay-ing cuts to disproportionate share hos-pital payments, advancing our other bipartisan healthcare programs, this legislation includes offsets that under-mine access to cover these services. Again, my goal in Congress was to expand healthcare, and this bill re-stricts that access. Two-thirds of Med-icaid dollars go to children. If you cut Medicaid, you are cutting those chil-dren’s benefits. This bill cuts children from Medicaid, and it gives money to the children who are less poor on CHIP. We need both programs. We don’t need one or the other. Both CHIP and FQHCs are bedrocks of our healthcare system, providing health insurance to almost 9 million lower-income children serving on the front lines by providing high-quality primary and preventative care to more than 25 million Americans. Congress let funding for these pro-grams expire last month, the first time in our history, since the 1960s, that the FQHCs and the CHIP program were not bipartisan. That is the step this House is making today by doing this. It should be bipartisan because it has always been bipartisan. Unfortunately, instead of bipartisan negotiations look-ing for a compromise, the process was derailed. The bill cuts, again, Medicaid. Two-thirds are children, to help poor children, and limit their access. The Prevention Fund funds the Cen-ters for Disease Control. We have any number of future illnesses that we need the CDC to have the ability to fight that, and here we are, cutting vaccina-tions in our communities. We are cut-ting infectious disease detection and prevention. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no,’’ and let’s expand access and not restrict it. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I would point out there are about 50,000 kids that Mr. GREEN may be voting against today in the Houston area if this goes down and we can’t get this over to the Senate and work it out with them. Twice he has voted to cut the Preven-tion Fund and use it for other purposes. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. L
ANCE ). Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. This pack-age is the product of our work on the Energy and Commerce Committee under the leadership of Chairman W
AL-
DEN. This legislation accomplishes the very important goals of reauthorizing the Children’s Health Insurance Pro-gram, renewing funding for community health centers, and extending critical resources for Medicaid in Puerto Rico. One of the first votes I cast in Con-gress was for CHIP, creating a fiscally responsible health program that now serves 8.5 million children in the United States. I continue to support community health centers and the work they do in areas like Dover and Somerville, New Jersey, in the district I serve. We also cannot forget about the many families and children in Puerto Rico, who also benefit from the Med-icaid program. That is why I have teamed up with Resident Commissioner G
ONZA´LEZ-COLO´N, to make sure low- cost Federal healthcare continues to be made available to our American chil-dren in Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this legislation and for the United States Senate to act as soon as possible. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2to the gentleman from New York (Mr. E
NGEL ). Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I am deep-ly saddened by the situation we are in today. Historically, CHIP and commu-nity health centers have been bipar-tisan priorities. We are talking about programs that provide healthcare for millions of American children and serve some of our country’s most vul-nerable citizens. Yet my Republican colleagues have inexplicably taken these programs hos-tage, tucking into this bill new at-tempts to undermine Medicare, sabo-tage the ACA, and strip hardworking Americans of their health insurance, not to mention they are trying to ex-tort these harmful policy changes a month after they let CHIP and commu-nity health center funding expire. This is absolutely unconscionable because, make no mistake, these cuts will hurt the same Americans who depend on CHIP and community health centers. My Democratic colleagues and I care deeply about these programs. That is why we have sounded the alarm for months, not just yesterday, for months, and urged the majority to stop wasting time on ACA repeal and get to work on renewing these lifelines for American families. Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed that didn’t happen, and I am disappointed by what is happening now. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. O
LSON ), a very important member of our committee. Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding time to me. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to strongly encourage my colleagues to support the HEALTHY KIDS Act. There are many reasons to support this bill, but, most importantly, it extends the Chil-dren’s Health Insurance Program, CHIP, until 2022. CHIP ensures that children with in-comes too low for Medicaid get basic health insurance. Close to 400,000 chil-dren in Texas rely on CHIP for access to quality healthcare services. We must act now. Earlier this year, Hurricane Harvey left a path of destruction across Texas. It put a major strain on our commu-nities and resources that has resulted in moments of uncertainty. The bottom line is, we must act now. This bill responsibly provides children in need with the proper resources to live a healthy life without adding to our country’s deficit. Mr. Speaker, again, I strongly urge my colleagues to act now. Vote for this bill. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. D
EGETTE ), the ranking member of our Oversight Sub-committee. Ms. D
EGETTE. Mr. Speaker, as one of the authors of the original bill 20 years ago, I rise to express deep dis-appointment that the House has not been able to reach a bipartisan agree-ment on how to fund the extension of CHIP. The September 30 deadline has long passed, and now 9 million children and families are waiting anxiously for us to figure this out. My home State of Colo-rado is likely to run out of CHIP fund-ing in January, with termination no-tices going out to worried families in the next few weeks. Yet here we are with a partisan bill that asks us to pay for low-income children’s insurance on the backs of seniors and the most vulnerable. The bill also cuts the Affordable Care Act, which could result in 668,000 peo-ple enrolled in ACA plans losing their health insurance. Nobody should have to lose coverage in order for others to keep it. This is a false choice, and it is out of step with what the American people have been calling on us to do. Only the 115th Congress could find a way to make the CHIP bill partisan. Irrespective of what happens today in this vote, I urge my colleagues to get together across the aisle, across the Capitol, find a way to reauthorize this important bill in a way that doesn’t cut benefits for other people.

truly give kids these benefits that they need, and let’s move on with our busi-ness. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. B
ILIRAKIS ), an incredible advocate for children and healthcare in America. Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I am so proud to serve on this great committee under the chairman’s leadership. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this important bill, which incorporates my bill, the Community CARE Act, which reauthorizes funding for community health centers for the next 2 years. Community health centers have a proven track record of providing high- quality, cost-efficient healthcare to ap-proximately 25 million Americans, in-cluding 7 million children, and 300,000 veterans each year. There are over 100 million coordinated and integrated pa-tient visits through the 1,400 commu-nity health centers across the country. b0945 This bill will reauthorize CHIP for the next 5 years. This program is vital for the roughly 360,000 children on CHIP in Florida alone. Additionally, this bill provides clar-ity for CHIP buy-in programs, such as the one we have in Florida. This sets the rules of the road and will ensure that 12,000 children in Florida’s CHIP buy-in program will continue to have access to CHIP. Mr. Speaker, let’s get this done now for our children. I urge passage of this important piece of legislation. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. S
CHAKOWSKY ). Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, the truth is that Republicans are holding the Children’s Health Insurance Pro-gram, 9 million kids, and the Commu-nity Health Center program, 15 million people, hostage to wreak even more havoc on our healthcare system and make children and seniors sicker and undercut Medicare. Paying for children’s health insur-ance on the backs of seniors is simply a disgrace. This bill would increase Medicare part D and part B income-re-lated premiums, charging higher in-come seniors the entire cost. This is a structural attack on Medicare, and that is why the AARP, which supports the Children’s Health Insurance Pro-gram, opposes this bill. Imposing a 100 percent premium is unfair because these seniors already pay more, and it will drive many out of Medicare alto-gether, undermining its solvency. To make matters worse, the Repub-lican income threshold is not based on current income, but on a 2-year period. So, for example, seniors’ income is volatile, and if you sold your home, you could get a massive premium pen-alty, even if you used the money you got from selling your home to buy in to assisted living and that money wasn’t available. Income-related premiums are simply unnecessary. There are many other ways to pay for the CHIP program without using Medicare as an ATM. Democrats have offered reasonable al-ternatives, but Republicans opposed all of them. I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Before I call on my next colleague, I just want to point out that, in Ms. SCHAKOWSKY ’s district, all we are talk-ing about here is seniors making $41,000 a month—a month—would pay an extra 135 bucks so we can fully fund chil-dren’s health insurance, community health centers. All these programs in here are funded. We use the Prevention Fund, which is not allocated out in the out-years. It is just a pot of money you can use for prevention and wellness. We actually use that to fund this as well. This is why we have been unable to reach agreement with the Democrats. It is sad they have made this partisan. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. C
OSTA ). Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on behalf of the people of the San Joaquin Valley in favor of H.R. 3922. The people of the valley whom I rep-resent in California did not send me here to put the lives of children at risk. I have made a commitment to improve access to healthcare for families that I have the honor to represent here in the House. I will continue to meet that commitment. The question is: Will Congress do the same and extend the Children’s Health Insurance Program? My congressional district has per-haps the largest percentage of children who qualify for the Children’s Health Insurance Program in the entire coun-try. The coverage is vital to families throughout my district, but it is par-ticularly important to communities like Gustine, Planada, Chowchilla, and Biola, where these healthcare clinics provide such important, valuable healthcare to these children and their families. Approximately 71 percent of the chil-dren in my district receive their med-ical coverage through the combination of the Children’s Health Insurance Pro-gram and Medicaid. We cannot let this end. This bill is not perfect, to be sure, but these children cannot be put at risk with further delays in funding for the important programs that this bill extends. I urge my colleagues to sup-port this legislation. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. C
ASTOR ), the vice ranking member of our committee. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, for decades now in America we have worked together to make sure that kids can see a doctor and get the care that they need. Working with pediatri-cians, families, and advocates back home, we have reached a historic point where almost all kids across the coun-try have health insurance coverage. The Children’s Health Insurance Pro-gram, or CHIP, or known in Florida as Florida KidCare, or Healthy Kids, has been an important piece of this historic coverage level. CHIP simply is vital for families, millions of hardworking fami-lies, so that their kids can get the checkups, the immunizations, some-times the critical care that they need so they can be healthy and well. Now, I chair the bipartisan Children’s Healthcare Caucus. We educate and ad-vocate so that kids across America are healthy and well. So it is especially disappointing this year that my Repub-lican colleagues failed to act before CHIP expired. See, they were consumed all year long with ripping health coverage away, decimating the Affordable Care Act, and radically changing health services provided under Medicaid. In doing so, they let our kids down; they let our families down. And then, at the 11th hour, after the program expired, they come up with a very partisan bill rather than the bipartisan bill that has been the historic backbone of Chil-dren’s Health Insurance. Don’t take it from me. A lot of the advocates across the country, like pe-diatricians, obstetricians, gyne-cologists, March of Dimes, say: Please don’t fund CHIP based upon harmful cuts; don’t have cuts negatively impact the health of women, children, and families. Pediatricians say: Don’t jeop-ardize other important child health policies in the process. Let’s go back to the drawing board as soon as possible, over the weekend, next week; bring it back to the floor next week, so that families and kids get the care that they need. This bill today, unfortunately, is simply a delay. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, there they go again: delay, delay, delay; and vote against kids, vote against their hospitals, and vote against their doc-tors. That is why we couldn’t get agreement. I yield 11⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. B
UCSHON ). Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the CHAM-PIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act, which extends the State Children’s Health In-surance Program, SCHIP, for another 5 years. In 1997, Congress created S–CHIP in partnership with the States to meet the healthcare needs of lower income kids. Last year, nearly 100,000 Hoosier kids received health insurance thanks to this critical program. I am proud that this legislation will continue to protect vulnerable children in the Eighth District of Indiana. This bill also extends 2 years of fund-ing for federally qualified health cen-ters, family-to-family health informa-tion centers, and other important pub-lic health programs. This funding pro-vides important healthcare services, resources, and information for families in the Eighth District and across America.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8461 November 3, 2017 
I urge my colleagues to support pas-sage of the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. W
ELCH ). Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, speaking to my chairman, Chairman W
ALDEN , I accept your commitment and your leadership on insuring children, but I am speaking to you because I reject the argument that, in order to fund a health insurance program that all of us support, we have to compromise health programs that benefit many other peo-ple, including in Vermont. Let me just give an example. The prevention program in Vermont is really helping people stay well. We had $922,000 that was spent on immuni-zation programs for our kids. We had $377,000 for lead poisoning prevention. Lead poisoning is brutal. We had $372,000 for heart disease prevention and control, and we had over $209,000 for diabetes and prevention control. So I acknowledge your commitment. I acknowledge the urgency with which your side and our side supports CHIP. But why is it that, if we support it, we don’t pay for it? And instead of paying for it directly, coming up with ways to eliminate waste in the healthcare sys-tem, we take away our ability to im-munize, to prevent lead poisoning, to reduce heart disease? That is my ques-tion. The answer for me would be that we go where the waste is. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. PALLONE. I yield the gentleman from Vermont an additional 30 seconds. Mr. WELCH. The answer to me would be that our committee engages in ad-dressing the waste in healthcare, in-cluding high prescription drug costs, rather than take it out of good pro-grams. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I appreciate the gentleman’s sin-cerity. We work well together on lots of issues. He has also voted to use this Prevention Fund for other purposes in the past, as have I. We don’t touch the Prevention Fund for 2018, and there is $400 million left in 2019, and billions thereafter for the very important programs the gen-tleman has articulated. We don’t use all the money. We leave money behind for these other purposes. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The bottom line is, when you start cutting money from the Prevention Fund, you are cutting prevention pro-grams for kids, adults, the disabled, and, most importantly, the opiates. CDC spends a significant amount of money from the Prevention Fund deal-ing with the opiate crisis, so don’t tell me that somehow this is okay. You are taking money away from opiate pre-vention. You are taking money away from kids programs like lead poisoning and vaccines. It is unbelievable how much is actually going to be lost from the Prevention Fund because of this bill. I am not interested in what happened in the past. I want to know what is going to happen in the future. We have an opiate crisis. Don’t take money away from the Prevention Fund that is used to deal with that crisis. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I do think it is important to note that my friend, and he is my friend from New Jersey, has twice voted to use this Pre-vention Fund for other purposes, in-cluding the 2012 middle class tax cut. I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. B
ARTON ). (Mr. BARTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, we have talked a lot today on the floor about the children’s component of this bill, the S–CHIP. It is a good program. It covers about 45 percent of the low-in-come children in Texas. It is a very worthwhile program and needs to be re-authorized and funded. I also want to talk about the commu-nity health centers. In Ennis, Texas, there is the Nell Barton Hope Clinic Annex. Nell Barton was my mother. The Joe Barton Family Foundation purchased a building for the Hope Clin-ic, which is a federally funded health center that is primarily located in Waxahachie, Texas. Every day, several dozen low-income people go to the Nell Barton Hope Clinic. Over the course of the year, several thousand people go to the Hope Clinic in both Ennis and Waxahachie. This bill reauthorizes those health centers for 2 years. Now, my friends on the Democratic side, I am not sure what they are com-plaining about. This is a program that funds healthcare for children and for low-income people through the commu-nity health centers. It is fully offset, and funding is increasing, Mr. Speaker, not decreasing, but it is doing so in a way that it is offset. What is the big offset? I hope we vote for this bill when it comes up for a vote later today. b1000 Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to talk about this use of the Prevention Fund. Democrats have never supported the type of drastic cuts to the Prevention Fund that is in this proposal today. In fact, when faced with such cuts, we voted ‘‘no’’ nine times. In the two cases where we voted in favor of using some of the Prevention Fund as an offset, neither cut placed the CDC programs and efforts at risk as this legislation does today. The Republican proposal would cut the Prevention Fund nearly in half and leave a $400 million hole in funding for prevention and health programs within the CDC’s budget beginning in 2019. This cut would be devastating to local, State and Federal efforts to protect the Nation’s health. Unlike my Republican counterparts, what they contend, this cut to these programs would not be made up in the annual appropriations process, as evi-denced by the proposed cut of $198 mil-lion to the CDC in the House Repub-lican fiscal year 2018 appropriations bill, and the decrease of $580 million in CDC funding since 2010 when adjusted for inflation. Again, you talk about opiates, you talk about children’s health programs. These would be drastically cut because of what they are doing today to the Prevention Fund. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, before I yield to the gentleman from Michigan, I would just point out that when Demo-crats joined Republicans in voting for the 2012 middle class tax cut, we used $6.3 billion out of the Prevention Fund they now say they never touched, yet they have. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. W
ALBERG ). Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3922. I want to thank Chairman W
ALDEN and Dr. B UR-
GESS for their leadership in bringing this bill to the floor today. The CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act reauthorizes and funds a number of programs important to my constitu-ents, including the State Children’s Health Insurance Program, community health centers, and the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Edu-cation program. H.R. 3922 will continue CHIP for 5 years, allowing this successful Federal- State partnership to provide health coverage for low-income children and pregnant women. It also extends fund-ing to federally qualified health cen-ters for 2 years, a key component of the healthcare safety net; and helps ad-dress our increasing health provider shortages by investing in the education and training of future health profes-sionals. Of importance, this legislation is fully paid for with responsible policies, such as measures to allow States to disenroll lottery winners from Med-icaid and prioritize the most vulner-able. I am proud of the good work that was done by the Energy and Commerce Committee to advance this legislation to the floor, and I encourage my col-leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the bill and to ensure the programs are available for the people who depend upon them. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. M
ATSUI ). Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3922. Mr. Speaker, the uncertainty that we have created for our community health clinics and their patients is unaccept-able. Each day it is a new threat. Most

of the year it has been TrumpCare’s se-vere cuts to Medicaid, which health centers and their patients rely upon. Today it is a lack of extension of the critical grant funding. Tomorrow or the next week, we will be back to rip-ping Medicaid away to pay for the Re-publican’s tax cuts. We have always extended CHIP and community health center funding on a bipartisan basis, but, unfortunately, the bill before us today is not bipar-tisan. The Prevention Fund, which would be slashed in this bill, funds pro-grams that are critical to children and families who rely upon CHIP and com-munity health centers. Many times these programs are even run out of our community health centers and could not exist without the Prevention Fund. These are things like childhood asthma prevention, vaccines, and lead abate-ment. It often takes someone going above and beyond a simple doctor’s visit to provide families with the resources they need to stay healthy. We need to invest in these services. We cannot strip this funding from critical preven-tion programs that children and fami-lies rely on. We cannot allow programs like Medicare and Medicaid to be at-tacked and raided. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on H.R. 3922. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, once again, my dear friend from California has twice voted to use these Preven-tion Funds for other things. By the way, when we use them for community health centers, they are doing this work on the ground, helping people with opioid addictions and other healthcare issues. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. C
AR-
TER). Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-er, I thank the chairman for yielding and for his outstanding leadership on this very important committee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to implore my colleagues to put politics aside for the sake of the 232,000 children in my State of Georgia and the 8.9 million children across our Nation who are counting on us to reauthorize CHIP. Twelve States will run out of CHIP funding before the end of this year. So the idea of waiting around another 2 months before acting on CHIP is sim-ply unacceptable. Let’s be clear why we are here today. Instead of having this discussion 2 months ago, we had to delay the En-ergy and Commerce Committee mark-up of the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act, the CHIP bill, because the other side of the aisle refused to even consider reasonable offsets to pay for the program. I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: How was that objection re-lated to fighting for the middle class? Even President Obama supported the change for high-income Medicare bene-ficiaries in his annual budget. How are we supposed to look parents in the eye back home and tell them that we choose politics instead of choosing to relieve their concerns about coverage? Mr. Speaker, let’s do our job and let’s reauthorize CHIP. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. M
CNERNEY ). Mr. M
CNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3922. Mr. Speaker, it is critical that we au-thorize CHIP and community health centers, but slashing essential public health funding is not the right way to do it. Treatment of chronic diseases ac-counts for 75 percent of our Nation’s healthcare spending, and many of these diseases can be prevented. Unfortu-nately, H.R. 3922 does not do that at all. This bill cuts in half the ACA Pre-vention and Public Health Fund that plays a critical role in preventing and treating chronic diseases, including keeping kids healthy. The massive cuts to this funding will be devastating to my Central Valley of California district. My district has the largest number of tuberculosis cases in California for children under 5 years old. Children in this age group are more likely to develop life-threatening forms of TB since their immune sys-tems are less mature. Public officials in my district are relying on funding from the Prevention Fund to address TB outbreaks. It is troubling that Republicans are using CHIP reauthorization to take core public health services away from kids. It is also frustrating, but not sur-prising, that the Republicans are mak-ing another attempt to sabotage the Affordable Care Act. This legislation is robbing Paul to pay Peter, and I urge my colleagues to vote against it. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, sabotaging the Afford-able Care Act; what we are doing is putting off planned cuts to our hos-pitals that take care of low-income people that those cuts called for under the Affordable Care Act. We are put-ting those off so they can serve these low-income people. That, in their lan-guage, is sabotaging the Affordable Care Act. On the issue of using the Prevention Fund, my friend from California who just spoke, has twice voted to use the Prevention Fund, including for tax cuts in 2012 and for the 21st Century Cures Act last year. Now we are using it for community health centers and children’s health insurance programs. This is an appropriate use of a fund that gets replenished by law every year. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss G
ONZA´LEZ-COLO´N), whose con-stituents and herself have suffered such damage, such destruction as a result of the hurricanes. Miss GONZA´LEZ-COLO´N of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong sup-port of H.R. 3922, the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act. I wanted to begin by first thanking Chairman WALDEN and Dr. B URGESS for their leadership in moving forward this critically needed legislation. I am par-ticularly thankful for those in the leadership and all of my colleagues in the Energy and Commerce Committee for including a $1 billion allocation to temporarily address Puerto Rico’s im-pending ObamaCare-created medical cliff, while also providing another year of the disproportionate share hospital relief. To put things in perspective, when we arrived in this Congress during Jan-uary of this year, more than 1 million Puerto Ricans were facing the immi-nent possibility of losing their healthcare coverage due to a funding shortfall resulting from ObamaCare’s disparate application to the island. We moved quickly during the appro-priations bill, and they allocated $295 million to improve that situation. In this bill, we are allocating $1 billion for Puerto Rico’s Medicaid program. This is an important step, but we still need to secure a permanent and equitable solution to Puerto Rico’s longstanding Medicaid inequalities, and that means changing the FMAP for the island. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. V
ELA´ZQUEZ ). Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member for yielding. Mr. Speaker, as Puerto Rico strug-gles to recover from the historic dam-age of Hurricane Maria, this legislation shortchanges the island’s long-strug-gling healthcare system at exactly the time that Puerto Rico most needs our help. This legislation provides a measly sum of Puerto Rico’s Medicaid system. Even before Hurricane Maria made landfall, Speaker R
YANhad committed to help resolve Puerto Rico’s looming Medicaid crisis, yet this bill provides just $1 billion. We have no assurance or guarantee that the next emergency supplemental will provide appropriate funds to address this problem. The fact is that our fellow citizens have been shortchanged by the dis-parity in Medicaid funding. This forced the government of Puerto Rico to bor-row money to provide healthcare. So if you wonder where Puerto Rico’s finan-cial crisis stems from, you can look right here at the U.S. Congress. Yet the amount included in this bill is far from sufficient to address even this year’s shortfall. For the Puerto Rican people who have already suffered so much, this funding level amounts to an in-sult. If ever there were a time to channel aid to the island’s healthcare system and fix the systemic problems that we sought in the system underfunding, this is it. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. C

LINS of Georgia). The time of the gen-tlewoman has expired. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentle-woman from New York.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8463 November 3, 2017 
Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, there are a litany of reasons to oppose this bill, but let’s make it clear: one of them is that it will not do enough for the people of Puerto Rico. These are U.S. citizens. They have fought, shed blood, and died in every major conflict. Now they need our help, and this bill does not supply it. Reject this bill. Vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. How cynical what we just heard. How cynical. Ms. V
ELA´ZQUEZ has 43,000 children in CHIP, $2 billion in DSH cuts in her dis-trict, 43 health centers, and she is going to vote against $1 billion for the citizens of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands because that is not enough. Yes, we need to do more, so her an-swer is vote ‘‘no’’ today and deny $1 billion. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. N
ORMAN ). Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 3922. Listening to my Democratic friends, it was said right by Chairman W
ALDEN . It is cyn-ical, and it is amazing that they could vote against this bill. Not only does this bill reauthorize public health programs vital to Ameri-cans who need them most, but it does so in a fiscally responsible manner. Re-authorizing CHIP for a 5-year period was an important priority of children’s healthcare providers in my district, but doing so while saving billions is an impressive feat. On top of that, providing funding for community health centers will dras-tically improve rural health in South Carolina’s Fifth District. This bill is proof that the American people can trust their government to provide es-sential services to citizens who cannot provide for themselves, without sad-dling our children and grandchildren with debt. Mr. Speaker, I would like to com-mend my colleague, Chairman W
ALDEN , for his impressive efforts in striving to-ward a greater government. b1015 Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. K
ENNEDY ), who is a member of our committee. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, this moment is a bit hard to stomach. It is hard to stomach yet another attempt to sabotage the Affordable Care Act, in the words of our colleagues, while ex-tolling the virtues of public health pro-grams by cutting grace periods down to 30 days that will result in hundreds of thousands of people losing access to their insurance. It is hard to stomach a $1 trillion tax cut being proposed for wealthy adults at the same time that our Republican colleagues are telling us that we can’t afford to care for sick kids. It is hard to stomach the indifference shown in this Chamber over the course of the past month as CHIP lapses and panic sets in amongst families whose lives depend on this program. It is hard to stomach an idea that the only way to give them care is to some-how take it away from somebody else, by gutting the Public Health Fund in the midst of an opioid epidemic or scapegoating patients who struggle to afford the monthly premiums and sometimes fall behind. Why is it always those patients who are asked to sacrifice? It is always those communities that are asked to do more with less. Why do we somehow create a false choice on this floor today that leads 9 million families to an impossible choice tomorrow? For those families, CHIP is not a privilege or a line item in the budget, it is a lifeline. They deserve the same decency and the same urgency that our Republican colleagues showed the wealthy in their tax plan yesterday. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Wow. We are fully funding CHIP for 5 years. We are fully funding our commu-nity health centers for 2 years. We are taking care of programs for our citi-zens who have diabetes. And the pay- for that they are objecting to most is we are asking the wealthiest seniors in America, those making $40,000 a month, to pay $135 more for their Medi-care so we can do this work that is so important. How ironic. How cynical. This is a pay-for that has been used before for other programs. President Obama him-self suggested in a budget that, instead of the top earners, the $480,000 a year, a couple making over $800,000 a year pay a little more as we do here, take it all the way down to $80,000 a year. We didn’t do that. We just said, if you are making $480,000 a year, roughly $40,000 a month, you will pay $135 more. They will not vote for that cut to fund children’s healthcare. We will. That is what is going on here. This is where we could never get them off dead center to make this bipartisan. It is a tragedy this is not a bipartisan bill as it always has been. I, three times, de-layed moving this forward, including crossing the deadline of September 30, to try to find common ground that would be bipartisan, and we could never get there because they would never yield in a way where we could find common ground. So we must go to the Senate from here and we must get our work done for the American people. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. D
INGELL ). Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this legislation be-cause it presents us with a choice that we should not have to make. I take a backseat to nobody in this institution in terms of fighting for children and families. But we live in the United States of America, the greatest Nation in the world. I reject the notion that we have to rob Peter to pay Paul or, in this in-stance, jeopardize the future of Medi-care and steal $6 billion from critical prevention programs to pay for chil-dren’s healthcare. They are all equal priorities, and we shouldn’t have to sacrifice the health of one population to pay for another. It is that simple. The changes that the bill makes to Medicare may sound innocuous—and I have great respect for the chairman— but the reality is they will threaten the future of Medicare. Means testing Social Security is a good sound bite, but it is a very slip-pery slope. I’m not worried about whether wealthy families can be able to afford to pay for increased Medicare premiums, but I am worried that these changes will result in wealthy people abandoning the program in large num-bers, which would worsen the risk pool and ultimately increase the costs for middle- and lower-income seniors. It would fracture completely the uni-versal nature of Medicare and put the entire program at risk. It is an unwise proposal that should be rejected. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, may I get a time count, please, on how much each side has remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tleman from Oregon has 45 seconds re-maining. The gentleman from New Jer-sey has 41⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. D
OGGETT ). Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, the Children’s Health Insurance Program began as a truly bipartisan initiative, but now it is being overwhelmed by Re-publican indifference. So low is it on their priority list that they let the law expire. Three States have already re-quired emergency funding, and 400,000 Texas children are at risk if this pro-gram is not continued. In the face of this crisis, their re-sponse is: We won’t put another new dollar into this program unless we take it from Medicare beneficiaries. Why should we begin calling on those who rely on Medicare to pay for non- Medicare purposes? It is wrong. The second way they propose to fund this bill is by reducing funding for pub-lic health and prevention, whether it is for Zika and West Nile virus, where I live down in Texas, or it is for the opioid crisis, which is affecting our State like every other one. Sure, we are glad to hear President Trump do a tweet and give a speech. But he did not add any new dollars to fight this opioid crisis. We need bold action, and it is not by reducing the Prevention and Public Health Fund. It is by supporting our children. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I will just point out that the gentleman who just spoke has voted to cut the Preven-tion Fund before to use it for other purposes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH8464 November 3, 2017 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. L
AWRENCE ). Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support fully funding the CHIP Act, but to oppose to the Repub-lican bill. Because of the reduction in the grace period, we are forcing Americans to go into their own pocket. Although this bill will reauthorize CHIP, it fails to show compassion for the low-income families and children who do not have access to critical healthcare, and it is a matter of life and death. CHIP’s impact is overwhelmingly felt in communities of color. Together, CHIP and Medicaid help cover 52 per-cent of Hispanic and 54 percent of all Black children nationwide. As Members of Congress, we have a duty to protect our Nation’s children. We need to support the millions of fam-ilies who rely on this vital program. This is not the right way. We need to work together in a bipartisan manner to pass an important piece of legisla-tion like CHIP and not take away from our children but support them. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, how much time remains on each side? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tleman from New Jersey has 2
1⁄2min-utes remaining. The gentleman from Oregon has 45 seconds remaining. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I want to stress again that one of the pay-fors that the Re-publicans don’t talk about much is the fact that they are reducing the grace period from 90 days to 30 days. So if someone misses a payment on their in-surance, they currently have 90 days to make up for it. Under this bill, they will only have 30 days. Now, the CBO estimates that over 500,000 people will lose their health in-surance and have to reapply for next year because of this reduction in the grace period. I know my colleague from the other side says: Well, that is too bad because they have the responsi-bility to pay it. But the fact of the matter is that a lot of people have a hard time paying their monthly premium, and we should not be passing legislation that ends up with half-a-million people losing their health insurance. Again, this is a way to sabotage the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act is trying to make more people covered, and has succeeded in covering 95 percent of the people in this coun-try. Why in the world would we use a pay- for that cuts back on half-a-million people who would lose their health in-surance? I want to emphasize, Mr. Speaker, we did not have to be here today. We could have done a bipartisan bill without sabotaging the Affordable Care Act. That is what concerns me most, Mr. Speaker. The Republicans tried to re-peal the Affordable Care Act. They failed, and now they are trying to re-peal it piece by piece. The pay-fors that are in this legisla-tion are unfair to the American people. The Prevention Fund is used for opiate prevention and used for kids for var-ious programs. Don’t cut back on that to pay for these other things. The grace period—half-a-million Americans are going to lose their in-surance because of the cutbacks in the grace period—another effort to sabo-tage the Affordable Care Act. Lastly, and probably even most im-portant, again, the Republicans are going against the Medicare program. They are trying to make cuts in the Medicare program and restructure the Medicare program in a way that I be-lieve will hurt the Medicare program, reduce the amount of people in the in-surance pool, and ultimately lead to higher costs for middle class and lower- income seniors and the disabled in the Medicare program. I urge my colleagues: Don’t let the Republicans continue to sabotage the Affordable Care Act. We could have done this on a bipartisan basis. Passing this bill today does nothing for the Children’s Health Initiative or for com-munity health centers because this bill is going nowhere. It will end up in the Senate. The Senate will not take it up, and we will be waiting around until Christmas to actually find a way to fund these programs and put these pro-grams at risk. Vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, let’s get this back where it belongs. We are fully funding the Children’s Health Insur-ance Program for 5 years and commu-nity health centers for 2 years. The only sabotage of the Affordable Care Act going on here today is stopping cuts for hospitals in our districts that serve low-income people that would otherwise occur under the Affordable Care Act. We do that for 2 years. The Democrats don’t think seniors making $40,000 a month—$40,000 a month—should pay an extra $135 for their part B and part D Medicare so we can take care of our community health centers and children who need health insurance. We delayed this bill coming to the floor at a bipartisan request to find a bipartisan solution that was elusive, sadly. We have never had this problem before, but we have it today. We must act. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. M
CCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in op-position to the Community Health and Medical Professionals Improve Our Nation (CHAM-PION) Act of 2017 (H.R. 3922). While I support reauthorizing funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), the Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), and various other important public health programs, I oppose this bill because it cuts funding for public health, puts families at risk of losing their health insurance, and weak-ens Medicare. The health of children and expecting and new mothers is something that we can all agree on. In my home state of Minnesota, CHIP funding is essential for providing healthcare to 125,000 low income children and 1,700 expecting and new mothers. Minnesota also depends on FQHC funding with over 190,000 people receiving care from one of the more than 70 community health centers in my state last year. Unfortunately, House Republicans have turned these bipartisan issues into an oppor-tunity to divide us. The offsets included in this legislation are unacceptable to me and to Min-nesota families. Once again, Republicans are using this leg-islation as yet another opportunity to weaken the Affordable Care Act (ACA) by cutting $6.35 billion from the Prevention and Public Health Fund over the next ten years. This fund, created by the ACA, directly funds our nation’s prevention, preparedness, and re-sponse capabilities. If these Republican cuts become law, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would be forced to provide less funding to cit-ies, states, and tribes to rapidly address public health crises. This money includes funding for vaccines, flu prevention, and addressing the opioid epidemic. When my home state of Min-nesota had to recently deal with a serious out-break of measles, our community health offi-cials utilized these federal resources to rapidly contain the spread of disease. Simply put, this irresponsible offset leaves American commu-nities more vulnerable to, and unprepared for, outbreaks of disease. In addition, this bill takes aim at yet another ACA provision by shortening the 90-day grace period for individuals to pay premiums before their insurer can terminate their coverage. The current grace period allows low and moderate income families experiencing temporary finan-cial difficulties to remain covered by their health insurance. Shortening this grace period from 90 days to 30 days would cause nearly 700,000 Americans to lose their health care and bars them from purchasing health insur-ance until the next season. I am also concerned by the provision that introduces means testing to Medicare. A key strength of Medicare is its universal nature. All Americans pay into Medicare and all Ameri-cans should receive at least some benefit from it. This provision breaks that guarantee and sets a dangerous precedent for the future. I am also concerned that it could weaken the Medicare risk pool and increase costs for the taxpayer. Mr. Speaker, even the Majority concedes that this bill is unlikely to pass the Senate due to the partisan nature of its provisions. Repub-licans need to stop playing games and reau-thorize these programs before Minnesota faces a critical December 1 deadline to con-tinue coverage for children and expecting mothers. I urge my colleagues to vote against this measure and instead to work together to fund CHIP and community health centers. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the bill being considered on the floor today, H.R. 3922, the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act. Unfortunately, this deceitfully named measure to reauthorize the Children’s Health

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8465 November 3, 2017 
Insurance Program (CHIP) and Community Health Centers (CHCs) will reauthorize these programs through FY19—but does so by kick-ing thousands of Americans off private insur-ance. Like many of my colleagues, I strongly sup-port CHIP, CHCs, and other critical public health initiatives. However, the bill in its cur-rent form was drafted as yet another attempt by Republicans to undermine the Affordable Care Act in order to justify its repeal. The bill is misguided in its attempt to cut $6.35 billion over ten years from the Prevention and Public Health Fund in order to fund the extension. H.R. 3922 also reduces grace periods from 90 to 30 days, putting more than 688,000 low- and moderate-income individuals at risk of los-ing their state Marketplace coverage for simply paying their premiums in the second of third month of the existing grace period. This grace period is essential to low-income households that are barely making ends meet. By reduc-ing the current grace period, Republicans are exposing thousands of families to risk due to a lack of health coverage. It is frankly dis-graceful that we would even consider under-mining these important public health programs in such a manner. Mr. Speaker, CHIP, CHCs, the National Health Service Corps, and other programs funded under this measure are vitally impor-tant to our nation and the public health of our citizens. As the first registered nurse elected to Congress, I understand the critical need for proper long-term funding of our public health centers and programs. However, these cuts to the Prevention and Public Health Fund rep-resent a purely political move by the GOP to undermine the ACA. I oppose this controver-sial offset, not my support for health centers across America. I urge my colleagues to op-pose this measure so that we can find offsets driven by policy, not politics, in order to suffi-ciently fund our health centers and promote public health for all. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on House consideration of H.R. 3922, Championing Healthy Kids Act, which would reauthorize the State Children Health Insur-ance Program (S–CHIP). As the founder and chair of the Congres-sional Children’s Caucus, I am well aware of the work that went into creating this important program. I joined with members of the bipartisan Chil-dren’s Caucus to champion the worthy goals of S–CHIP. Congress and President Clinton responded to the needs of 10 million children in the United States who lacked health insurance, S– CHIP was created in 1997 to insure children in families with too much income to qualify for Medicaid and too little to afford private insur-ance. I voted for the S–CHIP program when it came to the floor for a vote as part of the Bal-anced Budget Act of 1997. I worked tirelessly along with other mem-bers of the House to make sure the S–CHIP program was created. I voted to extend the life of the program when Congress reauthorized S–CHIP in 2009 under the Children’s Health Insurance Pro-gram Reauthorization Act and again when it became part of the Patient Protection and Af-fordable Care Act of 2010. The program represented a grand bargain that allowed Democrats and Republicans to agree that healthcare for the nation’s children was a laudable and achievable goal. H.R. 3922, Championing Healthy Kids Act, is not a reauthorization of the S–CHIP pro-gram it is political theater at its worse. The leadership of the House is betraying all that this body has done for 20 years to sustain and improve S–CHIP. The bill before the House is political theater and not real legislating—a partisan attack against Medicare that has no place in a real bill about healthcare for children. I am a strong supporter of S–CHIP and would vote for that program any day it is brought to the House Floor. This imposter S–CHIP bill is not worthy to be considered by this body. The motion to recommit this bill should be supported so that the offensive offsets could be removed so that the bill can be brought back to the full House for consideration. After weeks of negotiations to reauthorize the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), Community Health Centers (CHCs) and other important public health programs, which have always been bipartisan priorities, House Republicans have decided to bring a partisan bill to the Floor. This bill will only further delay the reauthor-ization of these programs, many of which ex-pired on September 30th. The bill passed out of the Energy and Com-merce Committee at the beginning of October with no Democratic support. Democrats in Committee instead offered a package that invests in our children and safety net providers, and does not sacrifice the na-tion’s health. Democrats have made it clear for weeks that the pay-fors in this bill are problematic. Rather than working toward a bipartisan agreement, Republicans revised their bill to in-clude even steeper cuts to public health pro-grams, in addition to undermining the Afford-able Care Act (ACA). The bill includes woefully inadequate fund-ing for Medicaid programs in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which are facing un-precedented demands on their health care systems following the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello last week requested $1.6 billion annually to deal with the state’s underfunded Medicaid pro-gram that is expected to be further strained by the short- and long-term health implications of the natural disaster. The approximately $1 billion over two years in Puerto Rico Medicaid funding included in the Republican bill is not only insufficient, but it would also require Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to match those dollars at a time of increased demand and revenue collapse in both territories, exacerbating delays in recov-ery. This bill also seeks to cut $6.35 billion to the Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF). The Prevention Fund was created by the ACA to make national investments in preven-tion and public health, to improve health out-comes, to enhance health care quality, and re-duce health care costs. It has been used to increase awareness of and access to preventive health services, such as cancer screenings, tobacco cessation and childhood vaccines—as well as concentrating on preventing chronic disease to help more Americans stay healthy. Cutting these funds will have a devastating impact on public health initiatives at the fed-eral, state and local levels. Republicans are also shortening the grace period for missed premium payments from ninety days to thirty, which would result in up to 688,000 people losing health coverage. House Republicans are insisting that in order to provide some of our most vulnerable Americans with coverage, it must be paid for by cancelling the health insurance of other Americans after a single payment is missed. While Republicans are pushing for tax cuts for the wealthy that explode the deficit, when it comes to health coverage for children and low-income Americans, Republicans are insist-ing that it be paid for at the cost of weakening our health care system and pushing other Americans off health insurance. States have begun to use emergency fund-ing, cut benefits, and will soon begin sending disenrollment notices to thousands of families if CHIP is not reauthorized. Republicans’ decision to advance a partisan bill rather than a compromise has very real consequences for families across the country. In 2016, 35,626,329 children in the United States had healthcare coverage under S– CHIP or the Medicaid Child Program. In 2016, although the state of Texas had 38 percent of our children covered under the S– CHIP program, there were still 9.2 percent children without health insurance coverage. Paying for this package by weakening health care in America: Shortening the grace period for missed pre-mium payments will cause up to 688,000 Americans to lose their health coverage. Cutting $6.35 billion from the Prevention Fund will have a devastating impact on public health initiatives at the federal, state and local levels. Requiring Medicare means testing of 100 percent for beneficiaries making over $500,000. This provision will take away a ben-efit American seniors have paid into their en-tire lives. These offsets are even more egregious since they are being considered just one week after House Republicans began the process of passing tax cuts for the wealthy that is not off-set and will add $1.5 trillion to the deficit. Instead of reauthorizing these programs, House Republicans wasted time attempting to repeal the ACA. There are better ways to pay for S–CHIP that do not put the guarantee of Medicare at risk our nation’s seniors. 1. Reduce tax expenditures for the top 1 percent of income-earners—Our current tax code imposes higher tax rates on income earned through hard work while providing pref-erential treatment to unearned financial gains and allowing billions of dollars of stock profits and other capital gains to pass tax-free to heirs of multi-million-dollar fortunes. Reducing the benefit of these tax expenditures would help rebalance the tax code so that it stops fa-voring wealth over work. CBO has determined that 17 percent of the benefits of major ‘‘tax expenditures’’ go to households in the top one percent of income earners at a cost of more than $1.5 trillion over ten years. We could re-duce this benefit to pay for needed national priorities. 2. Cancel the tax break for corporate jets— Repeal tax breaks such as those for corporate jets, which are allowed a faster depreciation

schedule than passenger and freight aircraft. Based on past Joint Committee on Taxation estimates, repealing the tax break on cor-porate jets alone would raise $3 billion over ten years. 3. Restrict deductions for egregious CEO bonuses when employees don’t get a raise— Repeal the exemption to the $1 million limit on compensation for CEOs and other specified corporate employees that a publicly traded corporation can deduct as a business ex-pense, unless their workers are getting pay-check increases that reflect increases in work-er productivity and the cost of living. Based on Joint Committee on Taxation estimates, just limiting the deductibility of excessive CEO compensation would raise $12 billion over ten years. 4. Close loopholes in the U.S. international corporate tax system that encourage compa-nies to invert, and ship jobs and profits over-seas—Prevent U.S. companies from ‘‘invert-ing’’ and pretending that they are based in other countries purely to reduce their taxes. Enact proposals that would limit the ability of corporations to reap substantial tax benefits by shifting operations, capital, intellectual prop-erty, and jobs overseas for tax purposes or to shelter their profits from U.S. taxation in for-eign tax havens. Based on estimates of past proposals, over $500 billion over ten years could be raised under such proposals. 5. Close the ‘‘carried interest’’ loophole tax-ing hedge fund managers’ compensation at lower capital gains rates—End the loophole which allows certain investment managers at hedge funds and private equity firms to pay capital gains tax rates (up to a maximum of just 20 percent) on income received as com-pensation for services they provided, rather than ordinary income tax rates up to 39.6 per-cent that all other working Americans pay on the compensation they receive for their labor. Past estimates show closing this loophole would raise over $19 billion over ten years. States have begun to use emergency fund-ing, cut benefits, and will soon begin sending disenrollment notices to thousands of families if CHIP is not reauthorized. It is time for the House Leadership to stop playing politics with health insurance coverage for our nation’s most vulnerable children and pass a clean S–CHIP bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 601, the previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time.

Mr. CLYBURN (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from South Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve a point of order against the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tleman’s point of order is reserved. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from South Carolina is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion. Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, the Re-publicans have reserved a point of order against this motion. Let me be clear about what this means. The Republican leadership does not want a vote on providing proper CHIP funds to our United States terri-tories, including Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. There may be a point of order against this provision, but it is the same point of order that applies to the Repub-licans’ bill. Do you know what that means? They waive the point of order for their bill, but they will not waive the point of order for this bill. I won’t take up too much time, Mr. Speaker. I just want the body to know that the Republican leadership is, once again, rigging the game in favor of the majority. This isn’t about hurting me and the Democratic Members of this body, no. This hurts the people who are already struggling in Puerto Rico and the Vir-gin Islands. b1030 To my friends on the other side of the aisle, you may hide behind proce-dural tactics, but the fact remains that doing so denies our United States citi-zens living in the territories the proper funding that the Governor has re-quested to recover. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill which will not kill the bill nor send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will im-mediately proceed to final passage as amend-ed. It has been 34 days, Mr. Speaker, since Re-publicans allowed the Children’s Health Insur-ance Program and Community Health Centers to expire. These proven programs insure 9 million children and serve 27 million people. The bill before us is the latest in a long line of cynical attempts by President Trump and Republican Leaders to sabotage and under-mine the Affordable Care Act. We ought not be funding efforts to treat infectious diseases like the flu and measles by taking away the funds needed to prevent those illnesses from occurring in the first place. Mr. Speaker, this bill turns on its head that adage, ‘‘an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.’’ Instead of joining President Trump’s campaign to sabotage the ACA, the Members of this body, Republicans and Democrats, should join to reauthorize CHIP and CHCs for 5 years, fully paid for without robbing Peter to pay Paul. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I with-draw my reservation of a point of order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The res-ervation of a point of order is with-drawn. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, today, Members of this House can deliver peace of mind to parents of over 8 mil-lion low-income children who depend on the Children’s Health Insurance Program. The House can extend fund-ing for important public health pro-grams, including resources for the crit-ical work community health centers do in our communities and in my district and yours. This bill will help deliver much-needed healthcare resources to our friends and fellow citizens in the Virgin Islands and in Puerto Rico. Yet we have heard complaints about how this package is paid for. Well, let us be clear how this bill funds healthcare for kids and important pub-lic health priorities like community health centers. In paying for this package, we have taken a fiscally responsible and reason-able approach. Our bill funds kids’ healthcare by allowing States to dis- enroll lottery winners—these are win-ners making $80,000 or above—from the low-income Medicaid program. We en-sure high-dollar lottery winners are re-moved from the Medicaid program so that those resources can go to Med-icaid-eligible, low-income people in our districts. Our bill directs funding from the Pre-vention and Public Health Fund to fi-nance important prevention and public

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8473 November 3, 2017 
health needs, like funding the National Health Service Corps, Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education, Family-to-Family Health Information Centers, and community health cen-ters. If these are not important pro-grams for prevention, wellness, and public health, I don’t know what are. Our bill before us today, which I pre-dict will have bipartisan support, di-rects funds from the Prevention Fund for important public health priorities that have long had bipartisan support. We are using a bipartisan fund to pay for bipartisan healthcare support for health and wellness, which was its in-tent from the beginning. Most recently, nearly every House Republican and Democrat supported this idea just a year ago. Just a year ago, when we passed the 21st Century Cures Act, we said: Here is a health and wellness fund and a Prevention Fund that makes sense for cures, make sense for, we believe today, our community health centers, and for Children’s Health Insurance. Our bill also asks the wealthiest among us, the 1 percent of bene-ficiaries, those making $40,000 a month, over half-a-million dollars a year—that is an individual—to pay a little more to help fund health insurance for low- income children. I think they are will-ing to do that, and I think we should be as well. On multiple budgets, President Obama said this is a reasonable way to pay for other priorities. That was bi-partisan. It is bipartisan today. These reasonable pay-fors have been opposed by some in the Democratic leadership. Some House Democrats want to use children’s healthcare and funding for community health centers as a bargaining chip for a bigger end- of-the-year goulash, yet kids and our frontline providers can’t wait any longer. In just a few weeks, States like Min-nesota run out of funding for the Chil-dren’s Health Insurance Program. At the request of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, we have agreed to postpone it time and again, but time has run out. The negotiations did not end as we all hoped they would. But we can’t wait any longer. It is time for this House to deliver peace of mind to the families that rely on these critical programs. It is time to vote ‘‘yes.’’ Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the motion to recommit and to approve the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and mentor, the gentleman from South Carolina, for his kind words and for yielding. Mr. Speaker, we deal with important issues every day in this House, but there are few issues as meaningful to so many lives as the Children’s Health Insurance Program. At this time the divisions in this House mimic those in our nation. And on many issues, those divisions can be challenging to bridge. One of my top priorities as a new Member of this body is to help bridge those divides, in-stead of widening them. I hope that my colleagues—both Democrats and Republicans—will tell me if I fall short on that commitment. One of the few things that does not divide us is the importance of children’s healthcare and the CHIP program. When it was signed into law 20 years ago, this landmark legislation meant so much to me. First, as a mother of then 9-year-old, Alyssa, and 11-year-old, Alex I deeply under-stood the fear a parent could feel with a sick child and no insurance. But also because at that time, I was the Deputy Secretary of Health & Social Services for Delaware. And I had the honor of helping implement the law and seeing thousands of children who had never had healthcare get the coverage they deserved. From the 600,000 children across the nation who were the program’s first enrollees in 1998 to the nearly 9,000,000 children in 2016. Kids across this country owe their yearly check-ups, their immunizations, and their doc-tor’s office lollipops to this program. And in Delaware we owe a big debt to the CHIP program, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act. Today, 97 percent of Delaware’s children obtain medical coverage because of these programs. In 1997, the legislation passed in a Repub-lican Congress with a Democratic President, highlighting how this truly was not a partisan issue. That’s why it’s disappointing to me that we aren’t moving forward on renewing the Chil-dren’s Health Insurance Program with that same reasonable, bipartisan approach. The bill before us today forces us to choose between healthcare for children and healthcare for other vulnerable populations. Choosing between prevention and healthcare for kids is unacceptable—particu-larly in a nation as great as ours. I have spoken to many of you over the past 10 months. I know that the people I have met in both political parties know—in their hearts—that we should not play games with the healthcare of our children. I know that it may seem hard to oppose one’s party leadership. But today I ask you to consider whether this is one of those rare times . . . those rare subjects . . . Where we can come together to stand up for the those in need . . . And to stand up for a clean reauthorization of the Children’s Health Insurance Program. That’s what our motion to recommit does. Let’s step back and consider whether we can use our common desire to deliver healthcare to our children, as a moment to surprise the public . . . To set a new tone for how we deal with one another . . . and how we address issues on which both of our parties fundamentally agree. Please join with me on this vote to put our children first—they’re watching. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is or-dered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it.

b1115 LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. M
CCARTHY ), the majority leader, for the purpose of inquiring about the schedule for the week to come. (Mr. M
CCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. M
CCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30. On Tues-day and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and noon for legislative business. On Thurs-day, the House will meet at 9:00 a.m. for legislative business. On Friday, no votes are expected in the House. Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next week, a complete list of which will be an-nounced by close of business today. In addition, the House will consider H.R. 3043, the Hydropower Policy Mod-ernization Act, sponsored by Rep-resentative C
ATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS . This bill will continue our efforts to improve America’s energy infrastruc-ture by streamlining the FERC licens-ing process for hydropower projects. The House will also consider two good jobs bills: first, H.R. 3441, the Save Local Business Act, sponsored by Representative B
RADLEY BYRNE . This bipartisan legislation will ensure small businesses and franchises across Amer-ica receive fair government treatment rather than confusing regulations that harm workers. Second, the House will consider H.R. 2201, the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act, sponsored by Representative T
OM E
MMER . As part of our Innovation Ini-tiative, this bill creates a smarter way for entrepreneurs to start new ventures or grow existing businesses. Now, lastly, Mr. Speaker, additional legislative items are possible in the House. If anything is added to our schedule, I will be sure to inform my friend and all Members. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for that information. First, I want to start by saying that the majority leader and I and four other Members of the House had an op-portunity to visit both Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands last weekend since we had our last colloquy. First, I want to thank the majority leader for organizing that trip and in-cluding me on it. It was an eye-opening trip. The majority leader and I have done an op-ed, which will be appearing sometime in the near term, on our ob-servations. One of the things, Mr. Speaker, that I know the majority leader and I had the opportunity to see, we were in Mar-athon, where you had housing that was built after Andrew and housing that was built before Andrew. Now, the difference was, after An-drew, that extraordinary hurricane, the building code was changed. We saw the stark difference between housing that survived essentially Maria and Irma and housing that did not, and the difference was, of course, that the housing that survived was built to dif-ferent standards after Andrew. The majority leader and I discussed this matter, along with Mr. BISHOP , who chairs the committee that over-sees both Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and I think all of us are con-vinced that it would be penny-wise and pound-foolish not to build back, as Florida did, to standards that can withstand storms of this type. So I wanted to thank the majority leader for his leadership on this issue. The majority leader took the ex-traordinary effort to climb down a river bank, go across the river—the river was very low at that point in time—and then up a very long ladder, because people were stranded on the other side. The majority leader went to see them and assure them that we would not forget them. We were the first codel to go to the interior of Puerto Rico, as opposed to simply go to San Juan or another large city, so I thank the majority leader for his leadership on that issue. Mr. Leader, let me ask you about tax reform. That, of course, has been the big issue for some period of time now, but now we have a bill that is not on the floor yet, but was released yester-day. It is clear this bill will cut taxes, in our view, for the wealthy. I don’t know the statistics yet, what the division is, whether it is 80/20, as the initial pro-posal was, or perhaps a little less than that that goes to those over $900,000 in income. But, in any event, it also eliminates tax preferences that the middle class families rely on, and, ob-viously, we think it is going to face hurdles in Congress. What I wanted to ask was: When does the gentleman expect the bill to be marked up? Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend. Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I am excited about his question, be-cause I am excited about this bill. For more than three decades, we have waited for tax reform. Many peo-ple know the challenge of what they have with the government taking more than they should, and the challenge to see individuals raise their paychecks. Ways and Means has announced that they will start markups next week. I assume that it will take them probably a week to get through the entire bill, going through regular order as we do, and then I would assume that we would bring that to the floor right after. We would like to get this to the American people as soon as possible. I am willing to talk about the bill, I am willing to talk about the bill in any different manner, because we spent a lot of time working on this. The very first thing that is going to happen for the American public, come January 1, they are going to get more in their paycheck, because what we do, we take the standard deduction, be-cause in the current law today, a single individual in America, it is only the first $6,000 they have are tax free. Well, that is going to go to 12. For a couple, it is going to go to 24. We take seven confusing rates and make it four. It is about cutting them. Every rate is lowered except the high-est rate. Then we go and look at: How can we make America competitive? I started my first business when I was 20 years old. Small business is the backbone of this country. Small businesses work harder than almost anybody else. We lower their rate to 25. That is the low-est it has been in 40 years. Then all this money that is being pushed overseas that we tax too high so people won’t bring it back—and there are trillions of dollars there—we are going to have that money come back. And what are they going to do? They are going to invest in America. Now, the name of our bill is Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Just yesterday, I was with a company, Broadcom. We went into the Oval Office. I had worked with this company for quite some time. They started in America. Bell Labs was part of it, and others. Three companies got together. They are technology; they were building; they were growing. Then what they found was, America’s Tax Code was so burdensome on them, that for them to compete around the world, they became a company that domiciled in Singapore. Talking to them just the last month or so, laying out our tax bill, they said: You know what, we are so confident in you passing this, we are going to an-nounce that we are moving back to America.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH8476 November 3, 2017 
They have $20 billion a year in rev-enue. They invest $9 billion every year in R&D and manufacturing, those man-ufacturing jobs we care so much about. So yesterday, we were sitting in the Oval Office, and this is exactly what the CEO said. You know what he talked about? He grew up in Singapore. He said: When I turned 18, the greatest engineering school in America gave me an opportunity, MIT, but my parents did not have wealth, but they gave me a scholarship. He comes to America, gets his edu-cation, becomes an American, builds a company. He said it broke his heart he had to leave. He wants to give back to this country that has been so good to him, and he said this tax bill is actu-ally doing it. So we are creating jobs even before we pass it. So I am very excited, but, if I may, I wanted to do a little research for you. So we have taken all the IRS tax infor-mation, and I broke it down in spread-sheets. So any district that wants to know about it, please come see me, and I will walk you through it. So I take your district, Maryland’s Fifth, currently, 47 percent of your fil-ers in Maryland’s Fifth take the stand-ard deduction. They will be better off, because it doubles right off the bat. Another 11 percent of those who itemize their deductions won’t have to do that anymore. Instead of spending weeks on their taxes, they will put it on a postcard in minutes. So they are going to get a higher deduction; they are going to get more money. That means even before lowering of the rates, 58 percent of your district is bet-ter off from day one. Now, in addition, we repeal the alter-native minimum tax, that AMT. So that costs 13,000 of your constituents in your district an average of $3,750. That is wiped away. As we lower all the brackets, we will create a great deal of savings for every-body else. So I am excited about this. I would love to look forward to work-ing with you on it, because just as we just passed the CHIP bill bipartisan and the IPAB with more than 70 Demo-crats on that, I think this has been a very good week for America. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. He talks about IPAB. Of course, we add the $17.5 billion to the debt. The gentleman did not mention the $1.5 trillion in additional debt that the passage of the tax bill will result in, but he did talk about some people who are going to be really advantaged. So I would like to ask the majority leader: Will those people who will be advantaged or, for that matter, dis-advantaged have the opportunity next week to testify in a hearing on the sub-stance of this bill? Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend. Mr. M
CCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I think this is an excellent question. So, first of all, you are asking about hearings. I caught you yesterday; I caught you on TV yesterday. You were pretty good. You were asked about hearings. This is what you said: A hear-ing is when you ask the public to come in and say: What do you think? What are your suggestions? How will this im-pact you? Since taking the majority—you know what anniversary it is this week? When we rolled this bill out, it was the sev-enth anniversary of the Republicans winning on that election day for the majority. This is what we campaigned on. Now, we have been working quite some time. Dave Camp has retired, but when he was with Ways and Means, he put out a Camp proposal. We have been having numerous hearings in those Congresses and this Congress. It took us to win the White House, it took us to win the Senate, but, you know what, we have kept our promise. Let me walk you through the rest of what we have done. Since taking the majority, we have held at least 59 hear-ings on tax reform with witnesses from all sides on everything from simplifica-tion, to closing those loopholes that we have talked so much about together, to creating jobs, to accelerating economic growth. That is not to mention the countless town halls and the forums of Members who have held them in their districts all across. Now, if we need further witnesses on the burden of our Tax Code, look no further than just me. As I told you, I was 20 when I started that first busi-ness. You know the three lessons I learned in my first business? I was the first one to work, I was the last one to leave, and I was the last one to be paid. I remember investing all that I had. It was just a deli. I had six employees. It was early in the morning, the front was all glass, and here pulled up a lit-tle truck from the city, and they were knocking on the door 2 hours before I started. I thought maybe they wanted to give me a key to the city for start-ing a new business. He wanted to give me a ticket for my sign. I thought that was a little odd, because the sign was bringing more people in that paid more sales tax that paid their salary. I learned the challenges of starting a small business. What is so great about this bill is there are going to be so many more Americans who are going to take that risk, start a small business, and be suc-cessful, with so many more Americans working. So I am excited about this, because that is what we have been hearing in our hearings—all those hearings we had, all those town halls, all those years we fought so hard to get to this point. Mr. Speaker, I think this has been a good week. b1130 Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, he did not answer my question, however. Will peo-ple have an opportunity to testify on this bill? The answer is no. No Amer-ican will have an opportunity to come to a hearing. In 1968, the gentleman from Cali-fornia, the majority leader, was not here. I was here. We had hearings over months, both sides of the aisle. Over 450 witnesses testified not on tax bills that may have been offered at some time in the future, including the Camp bill. When the Camp bill, Mr. Speaker, was reported—actually, it wasn’t re-ported. When it was put on the table by Chairman Camp from Michigan, who is now retired, the Speaker’s response was, when asked by the press, ‘‘What are you going to do with that bill?’’ he said, blah, blah, blah, blah. In other words, what he was saying was all talk. We are not going to do anything with that bill, and that bill never saw the light of day. It was paid for, Mr. Speaker. It was tough love. I didn’t agree with every-thing in the Camp bill, but I congratu-late Congressman Camp for having the courage to put a bill on the floor that was paid for, not creating $1.5 trillion in additional debt that our children will have to pay. They are not here to testify either. I don’t want to really get into a de-bate on the specifics. We are going to have a lot of time to do that next week, and I intend to do it next week, but he talked about small businesses being reduced to 25 percent. They will be if they make over $500,000. That is why the NFIB is not for this bill, Mr. Speaker, talking about small business. They are the spokespersons for small businesses, and they are not for this bill. We will talk about the substance, but the process mirrors the process for the Affordable Care Act: no hearings, no witnesses, very, very little time for the public or the Congress to digest the substance of this bill dropped yester-day. It is going to be marked up on Monday. That is 96 hours to consider a bill well over 500 pages. Mr. Speaker, I asked about process. The reason I asked about process and regular order is because regular order provides for input from the people we serve, the public, about whether the bill is good, bad, or indifferent and how it will impact them. We are going to debate it here. We represent those people. But regular order is hearing from them before we act, not after we act. Yes, we are replicating the Afford-able Care Act: put on the table, quickly passed, jammed through, sent to the Senate. And it didn’t work, Mr. Speak-er. I don’t think this will work either. I was here in 1986, Mr. Speaker, when Tip O’Neill and Ronald Reagan, Bob Packwood, who was the Republican’s chair of the Senate Finance Com-mittee, and Dan Rostenkowski from Il-linois, the Democratic chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, worked together with Jim Baker, the former Secretary of State but then Secretary of the Treasury, worked with us to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8477 November 3, 2017 
come up with a bill that could be passed. And it was passed, Mr. Speaker, with overwhelming votes from both sides of the aisle. It was the last time we passed tax reform. Since then, we have just passed tax cuts. Under Ronald Reagan, we passed a tax cut in 1981. The deficit increased under Ronald Reagan 189 percent. Under George H.W. Bush, the deficit in-creased 55 percent in 4 years, 189 per-cent in 8 years. Under Bill Clinton, the debt increased 36 percent; George Bush, 87 percent after the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, and we were promised that they were going to energize the economy and dynamic scoring would come into effect and the country would be rolling in clover. Seven years later, we had the deepest recession anybody serving in this body has experienced, Mr. Speak-er, and the debt exploded. Barack Obama, just by contrast, in-herited the worst economy any of us has seen—the worst economy—hem-orrhaging 787,000 jobs per month in January of 2009. We had to bring the economy out of that deep recession, and we invested dollars. But even given all that necessity and the $700 billion bill that we passed, that George Bush passed, where two-thirds of Repub-licans were opposed and which kept us out of a depression, Barack Obama in-creased the debt by 1 percentage point more than George Bush. I say to my friend, the reason for having hearings, the reason for having economic experts like Mr. Bartlett, who worked for Ronald Reagan, who said that tax cuts do not pay for them-selves. They say $1.5 trillion. I guar-antee you, Mr. Speaker—I may not be here when we can find this out—this is going to be far above $1.5 trillion in ad-ditional debt, and my children and my grandchildren and my great-grand-children will be exposed to paying that bill. It is a shame, Mr. Speaker, that we do not have extensive hearings on this bill in the House and in the Senate. My judgment is the Senate doesn’t expect to have hearings on this either. They are just going to try to jam it through, Mr. Speaker, and that is not good. That is not good for this institution. Much, much more importantly, it is not good for the present generation or generations to come. We will debate, Mr. Leader. I know you are passionate about the sub-stance. You are very knowledgeable about the substance. We talked about it in private, and I admire the passion that you have and the information that you argue. I may differ with your infor-mation, but we will have the oppor-tunity to debate that, I think, next week and the week after. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. M
CCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, the first lesson, if you ever take debate, if you cannot win the argument on the substance of the bill, argue about process; go to process. But you know what? This is not the beginning of the process. This is the end of the process. For 31 years, we have been working to get here. We had hearings upon hearings. We have gone to the American people. We went to the American people 7 years ago this week, and they made a very big decision: to change the direction. We went back in 2014, and they made another big decision, and they made one just a short time ago. I heard you talk about a lot of Presi-dents, but I think you missed one. Really, this bill is about growth in this country, about job creation, about rais-ing somebody’s paycheck. The history of America, from the be-ginning of time until 2006, we always averaged more than 3 percent growth. If you just take the last 8 years, if you take the very best year under Barack Obama—and I will go apples to apples. Let’s take Bill Clinton. The growth year under Bill Clinton’s worst year is higher than Barack Obama’s best year. That is why the middle class is hurt-ing. That is why this tax cut helps the middle class. What is most interesting, you want to talk about debt? You talked about a lot of Presidents. You can add up all those Presidents, and you know what? Just one President, Barack Obama, added all that money and more to the debt. What is more interesting to me, if my friend is concerned about the def-icit, I want to ask you this: Why did you vote for a budget that increases the deficit by $6.8 trillion over 10 years? Why would you do that this year? Why would you, as a party, bring that forward as your plan. Do you know what we are bringing forward? We are going right through the rules. We have gone all through the hearings. We know, even before this bill passes, just as yesterday, that the companies are coming back to Amer-ica; $20 billion a year in revenue, one company has already announced. They are going to put $3 billion every year into research and development and $6 billion into manufacturing. I think the debate on process is over. This bill is less than 500 pages. You talk about us bringing it up? Yes, so the whole American public can see the bill and read it. It is much dif-ferent than when we talk about your ACA—more than 2,000 pages, and I was here. I watched what was brought right to the floor and jammed through. And you are right; the ACA doesn’t work. We believed in doing something dif-ferent. We made a promise to the American public—3 days for public viewing. It is longer than 3 days. We made a promise to the American public that we would make sure you keep more of what you earn, we would create more jobs. You know what hap-pened after that last election? We just went through the second quarter of 3 percent growth. You and I just talked about the num-ber of hurricanes we just watched, the devastation. People say it probably knocked off 1 percent of growth. You know what the Atlanta Fed just came out with? They are predicting, they think we are going to go to 41⁄2. Do you know what? The best days of America are in front of us because of the work we have done. Let’s not argue about process, because we know we have been through this process for 31 years. We know what the American public has said. We know in the hear-ings what they have told us, and we have listened. Now I think is the time to have the courage to lead. Let’s take what we heard in those committees and put it into a bill, exactly what we just did. To have the returns before the bill is even passed of jobs coming back, to me, like I said earlier, this is a good week, but this is going to be a great month. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, we are going to debate the substance of the bill; we are going to debate it fully. We think it will not hold up well under that debate. Therefore, we will have a significant difference. He is right. The best economy any-body in this House has experienced— the best economy—was the last 4 years of the Clinton administration, period. Guess what we had? We had a little bit of a tax increase. We increased the gas-oline tax, and we tried to pay to for in-frastructure. We haven’t increased it since then. The Republicans said: You do that, oh, the economy is going to go down the drain. The best economy any Re-publican has experienced in their life-time is under Bill Clinton. We balanced the budget 4 years in a row under Bill Clinton, the only President you can mention that balanced. It never balanced under Ronald Reagan. It never balanced under George H.W. Bush. It never balanced under George Bush. As a matter of fact, as soon as they took office, they made sure we wouldn’t have further balances because they cut taxes in 2001 and 2003, but they didn’t cut spending. He talks about President Obama. I know the majority leader will be inter-ested in these statistics. I didn’t count January of 2017 because, after all, that was the Obama economy. Trump had not done anything on the economy, but let’s start with February 2017. Under Donald Trump, 232,000 jobs were created. That is great. That is good. I would say that the Obama econ-omy is still working. Same exact month a year earlier, not 232, but 237,000 jobs were created under Barack Obama. March 2017, 50,000 under Trump. March 2016, 225,000 jobs created under Barack Obama. April 2017, 207,000 jobs. Barack Obama was a little down that month, 153,000 jobs. 145,000 under Trump, 43,000. Then June of 2017, 210,000 under Don-ald Trump, 297,000 jobs under Barack Obama. July of 2017, we are getting more re-cent. Under Trump—now he has been in

office a little longer—138,000. What was it under Barack Obama? 291,000 jobs— double. August of this year, just a few months ago, 169,000 under Donald Trump; 176,000. Last month we had hurricanes. I will give the majority leader that. We lost 33,000 jobs. Under Barack Obama, same month a year ago, 249,000 jobs created. As a matter of fact, under Barack Obama, we created 11,773,000 jobs. b1145 Under George Bush, 2 million—excuse me—lost under George Bush, private sector jobs, a loss, after the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, lost 1,159,000 jobs. The last 12 months of the George Bush ad-ministration, 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, we couldn’t change economic policy. We were in charge for the last 2 years, couldn’t change it, lost 4,568,000 jobs. Now, as a matter of fact, I have done a little thing for 68 years. Over 68 years, we had 36 years of Republican Presidents and 32 years of Democratic Presidents. Under Republican Presi-dents, from Truman to Obama, there were 35,448,000 jobs created, Mr. Leader. Under Democrats, in 32 years, 62,669,000 jobs. Now, I would like to go on to another subject, as we could go on debating this all day, but I will yield to my friend. Mr. M
CCARTHY. I thank the gen-tleman for yielding, because you did ask a question in there. When you talked about Bill Clinton, you asked: What did he have? Well, when he first came in, he had Democrats in the majority, but all that growth happened because he won a Re-publican House and a Republican Sen-ate. That is when we turned it around with John Kasich as the budget chair. That is when we balanced the budget in those 4 years. We had to send him welfare reform how many times? Three times. He vetoed it all the other times and claimed some glory. But also there is another question you asked. I love a good debate. I love to pick just facts when you don’t want to look at the whole picture. The best thing to even just look at if you want to go: Did the election matter? Did the election matter to the American pub-lic? Well, I heard a lot of pundits on the other side say: Oh my God, if President Trump got elected, the market is going to crash. You know what? Most everyone in America that invests for retirement in-vests in the market, and President Donald Trump has given them all a raise because we set new records, more than 60 times; that is because of the be-lief of what they think he could achieve. When you look at what he has been able to do with regulation, unbeliev-able. The few headlines you didn’t an-nounce during Obama, when you were doing those jobs, you didn’t say any-thing about Nabisco leaving the coun-try, or Burger King went and domiciled someplace else. Why? What was the answer that President Obama would have when companies were leaving America because the taxes were too high? We will pass a law to say they can’t. You know the difference that elec-tion has made? We just proposed a tax bill. Compa-nies are now coming to the Oval Office to say: We are coming back. And all that means is more jobs, more money for Americans. I understand that we are going to probably have a philosophical dif-ference of agreement. I believe Ameri-cans should keep more of what they earn. I know what you said a few weeks ago. My friend cast his vote in favor of a budget that calls for ‘‘$3.9 trillion in revenue enhancements.’’ You know who I think needs the rev-enue? The American public. That is why we doubled the standard deduction, and that is for every American. On day 1 they will get more in their check. Small businesses, lowest tax in 40 years. All that money that those com-panies were being pushed out are going to come back. We can argue all you want about this, but for 31 years we have had this argument. I think the American public is waiting for us to lead. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, you no-ticed that he didn’t talk about any of the statistics I mentioned about job creation under Barack Obama. He didn’t talk about the 62 million jobs that were created in 32 years, as op-posed to the 35 million jobs, just half of what we did in less than 4 years than they had as President of the United States. And what he didn’t talk about was— he said: You know, we Republicans were in charge of the Congress the last 6 years of the Clinton administration. That is right. And what Bill Clinton said: Let’s save Social Security first. Let’s not cut out revenues that we need to invest in the education and the growth of our economy. They weren’t for that, but they couldn’t do anything about it. Then, guess what happened. They took the Presidency. They had the House and they had the Senate. Why couldn’t you do what was done under Bill Clinton then, when you con-trolled everything, I ask my Repub-lican friends, Mr. Speaker? Why couldn’t you, when you controlled every organ of government, do what you say was done under the Clinton ad-ministration, because you were in the minority, very frankly, or you were in the majority and controlled things? Why couldn’t you do it when you con-trolled everything? Why did you leave us with 4.8 million hemorrhaging jobs as you came out of office, and your eco-nomic program was still in place that you put in place in 2001 and 2003, and the deepest recession you and I have experienced in our life times? And I am older than you are. You didn’t answer that. You continue to talk about what is going to happen. I tell the story about the guy who comes in and he wants to be the left fielder for the Nats, and he says: You know, I am going to hit 350 next year. I said: But you hit 260 last year. He says: Well, yeah, I know, but this year I am going to hit 350. And the other guy comes in and says: I would like the same job. I hit 325 this year and I hit 324 last year. Who do you think you hire? The whole point is, Mr. Leader—I say to the Speaker—is that performance counts, not just talk, not just prom-ises. Because I will tell you, Mr. Lead-er, I have been here a long time and I heard the same language in 1981 from David Stockman. He now says it was baloney. I heard the same talk in 2001 and 2003. It didn’t work out so well. So, Mr. Speaker, I am going to go on to another subject because we need to go to another subject, but we need to have this debate because it is critical for my children, my grandchildren, and my great-grandchildren, and for gen-erations to come as to whether this country is, like we did it under Clin-ton, on a fiscally sustainable path where we are balancing budgets, or whether we are going to go back to the deep deficits. He didn’t respond, 189 percent in-crease in the debt under Ronald Reagan. One person in America, Mr. Speaker, can stop spending: the Presi-dent. He can veto spending bills. In my 37 years, we have never had a veto overridden of a President who ve-toed a bill because we spent too much money; not once in the 37 years I have been here, Mr. Speaker. But I want to go on to another sub-ject that ought to be less controversial because I think the majority of Repub-licans and I think, unanimously, the Democrats want to see us do what the President, apparently, has asked us to do. And that is, protect the DACA stu-dents, the DACA doctors, the DACA teachers. We have a Dream Act that has been filed. Every Democrat supports it. We want that to come to the floor in this transparent, open process, and I have talked to the majority leader about it. The President, contrary to Speaker R
YAN’s advice, rescinded the protec-tions for the childhood arrivals who ar-rived here through no fault of their own. He said to the Congress, it needs to be done in legislation. He didn’t say it needs to be done in legislation with a lot of other things. And the Speaker has said we are going to take one issue at a time. I won’t bring out that quote, but the majority leader has heard me use it before. So I urge the majority leader because I believe he does not want to send these mostly young people who don’t know any other country but America, who see themselves as Americans, who have

been educated in our schools, serving in our communities, positive partici-pants in growing America like so many immigrants before them, a nation of immigrants. Send me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses. We should have the DACA bill on the floor before we leave for this Thanks-giving. Mr. Leader, I said this with re-spect to the Export-Import Bank, that a majority of your party would vote for that if it came to the floor. We got it to the floor and, as I predicted, a ma-jority of your Members voted for it. I believe that very close to, if not all, a majority of your party will vote for this, and the overwhelming numbers in this House will vote for that bill. I would urge my friend to bring it to the floor before we leave for the Thanksgiving break on the 16th of No-vember. I would urge that because we are going to have some very messy 8 days after Thanksgiving, with great workload on our desks; not the least of which is how to deal with the seques-ter, how to deal with funding govern-ment for the balance of the year, what to do with flood insurance, and so many other issues; not to mention our supplemental that we need to do with respect to Houston and Florida and Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. So I urge my friend to work with us to bring the Dream Act to the floor, or bring your alternative to the floor. But let us not leave these people, who the President says he loves, who are posi-tive Americans in everything but paper, who have been here almost all of their lives. Some came at 2 or 3 years of age and know no other country. Let’s bring a bill to the floor that we can end before we go on the Thanks-giving break, in a united way—we are going to be divided on the tax bill. We understand that—but in a united way on this, where even Rush Limbaugh says we are not going to send these kids home. I would hope that you could do that, Mr. Leader. I believe you have it in your heart to do it, and I would hope that we could do it. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend. Mr. M
CCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I have great respect for the gentleman. It is true, we just recently traveled to look at the hurricanes and we had a lot of discussions. We disagree philo-sophically at times, but I think there is a place that we can find agreement upon. I listen to you when you speak. I did just hear you ask right before: ‘‘Why couldn’t you do it when you controlled everything?’’ I kind of ask my friend the same thing. When you controlled everything, the White House, the House, and the Senate, you had a self-proclaimed mas-ter legislator as Speaker. You had an opportunity. But I know this is the window, and I know President Trump wants to get it done. That is why he put out things that he wants to see done as well. We talked about chain migration. We talked about border security. We have been meeting—the Speaker and I just had a meeting yesterday with a number of Members about this. We would like to solve this problem overall, and I think it is a place every-body can work together, to secure our border, work on the chain migration problem, and solve this problem for others. Now, I know there is a 6-month time period here, and I don’t want to con-fuse issues because I would like to focus on this issue as well, but I don’t want to have the government shutting down over an issue. You and I know we both discussed things like that, and I never think that is productive with whatever we do; but I look forward to continuing working with you to solve this issue. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, let me re-mind the leader that we passed the Dream Act through the House of Rep-resentatives. We brought it to the floor. We had a vote on it. I know you and the Speaker said there was going to be a working task force on this issue, and it has been, I think, going on for nigh on to a month, but we haven’t seen anything on the floor. Mr. Leader, what I am saying is that I think we agree on this issue. Let us not confuse it with things on which we do not agree. Don’t hold hostage these 800,000 young people who are positive— because if they are not positive they couldn’t get into the Dream Act—I mean, they couldn’t get into DACA. They had to have a sterling perform-ance, be in school, be working, be in the Armed Forces. This is not a free pass to people. We agree on this, I think. Maybe I am wrong on that, but it seems to me that we agree. The President seems to agree. Wouldn’t it be—as we have done in the past some bipartisan things, and we thought that was good for the insti-tution and good for the American peo-ple to see us work in a bipartisan fash-ion. I think we agree on this issue. Some of the things you want to at-tach to it, we are going to have dis-agreements on. Why don’t we enact what we agree upon? By the way, this has been pending for a long period of time, as opposed to your tax bill. I know you think we have had hearings on it, but, very frankly, that bill changed from Tues-day to Thursday of last week. b1200 We think your bill is a pretty new bill and we would like to have hearings on it. But nevertheless, on DACA, I think we have an agreement. If you bring it to the floor, I think it will get a majority of the votes, a significant majority. I think it will get close to 300, if not over. So I would just urge my friend to see if he, as the majority lead-er—I was the majority leader—as the gentleman knows, I could bring a bill to the floor or I could keep it off the floor. This is a bill that ought to come to the floor. We ought to give peace of mind to these 800,000 of folks, and we ought to pass this bill and give the House an opportunity to work its will. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman does not want to say anything further, I yield back the balance of my time. f

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Monday, November 6, 2017, when it shall convene at noon for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for leg-islative business.

HONORING FRANK DOOLITTLE, CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL RECIPIENT (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Frank Doolittle of Bainbridge, New York. At 104 years old, Frank will be awarded the Nation’s highest honor for a civilian, the Con-gressional Gold Medal for his service in the Civil Air Patrol. At a pivotal time in our Nation’s his-tory, Frank dedicated himself to serv-ice here at home. In 1944, in the midst of World War II, Frank volunteered to join the Civil Air Patrol squadron in Sidney, New York. His unit was active and often tasked with finding C–47s that went down in the Northeast. In addition to being on call 24 hours a day, Frank taught classes ranging from navigation to meteorology 3 nights a week. During World War II, members patrolled the country’s coast-line from Maine to Mexico, watching for enemy submarines and potential saboteurs while conducting search and rescue missions. On Saturday, November 11, Veterans Day, I will have the distinct honor of presenting Mr. Doolittle with the Con-gressional Gold Medal. Since 1776, only 300 of these medals have been awarded. I ask everyone to join me today in thanking Frank Doolittle and all serv-ing the Civil Air Patrol for their serv-ice and dedication to our country.

Code. That is something we all agree on. We need to encourage growth and support our middle class. But the Re-publican decision to approach taxes in an exclusively partisan and fiscally ir-responsible way is not the way to go. I am deeply concerned about the par-tisan plan rolled out by the Republican leadership, in no small part because it saddles future generations with tril-lions more in debt just to pay for tax cuts for the most fortunate Americans. Furthermore, restricting provisions relied upon by countless middle class families, including the State and local tax—SALT—deductions and property tax deductions hurts working families. This is particularly true in States like Illinois, where one in every three filers depends on the SALT deduction. In the days ahead, I hope my Repub-lican colleagues will open the tax re-form discussion to bipartisan engage-ment. I remain ready and willing to sit down and work across the aisle to achieve responsible tax reform that will grow our economy, protect our seniors, truly help middle class fami-lies, and secure our future.

TAX PLAN GIANT STEP IN RIGHT DIRECTION (Mr. MESSER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. MESSER. Madam Speaker, Hoo-sier families deserve a pay raise, and that is what President Trump’s tax plan is going to give them: more jobs, fairer taxes, and bigger paychecks for working Hoosiers. Importantly, the plan includes a pro-vision that I have been working on that would stop $4 billion to $7 billion in refundable tax credits paid out each year to illegal immigrants. This is a giant step in the right direction to pro-tect American taxpayers and American families. In the Trump tax plan these savings will help increase child tax credits for American citizens by $600 each child. Hoosiers get it. It is past time to ad-dress an immigration system that re-wards people who come here illegally. No one should get a tax incentive to violate the law.

CONGRATULATING CRISTINA JIMENEZ MORETA (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I am proud to recognize and congratu-late an immigrant advocate, and now MacArthur genius, Cristina Jimenez Moreta. Like me, she is a CUNY alum-ni and she grew up undocumented. Since founding United We Dream in 2008, Cristina Jimenez Moreta has be-come a powerhouse champion for im-migrant groups across the country. By elevating the stories of DREAMers and putting faces and names to a discussion that was, at times, dismissive and de-humanizing, she changed the dialogue surrounding undocumented young peo-ple. Her work has impacted the lives of young immigrants nationwide, and in honor of her significant contributions, she was recently selected as one of 24 MacArthur Fellow winners worldwide in 2017. I congratulate Ms. Jimenez on her MacArthur Fellowship, and I applaud her decision to use the grant money to further the development of other un-documented young people. Cristina, your work is paramount now more than ever now that we brace as a nation to give rich people a big tax write-off that will put our country in jeopardy, a big gambling casino effort that has seen a failed attempt in the past with trickle-down economy. ‘‘Because we are not one. We are not 100. We are millions. Count us well.’’ ‘‘Porque no somos uno. No somos cien. Somos millones. Cuentanos bien.’’ f 
MERIT-BASED VISA PROGRAM (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Speaker, Uzbekistan uber terrorist Saipov’s at-tack in New York City is another ex-ample why the United States should end the diversity visa lottery. And I emphasize the word ‘‘lottery.’’ The program should have ended years ago. Under this 1990 program, the State Department gives 50,000 visas each year to immigrants from different parts of the world using a lottery system. Get-ting into the United States is like playing bingo. It is a game of chance. Our immigration system should be changed to accept the best and bright-est throughout the world. It is time to go to a merit-based visa system. Grant visas to people who will benefit Amer-ica. Stop the random system that al-lowed Saipov to come in; a system that rolls the dice where foreigners win and Americans lose. And that is just the way it is.

75TH ANNIVERSARY OF EXECUTIVE ORDER 9066 (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. GABBARD. Madam Speaker, this year marks the 75th anniversary of Ex-ecutive Order 9066, which authorized the internment of over 110,000 Japanese Americans on U.S. soil during World War II. Our country will never be able to undo this grave miscarriage of justice or relieve the pain and suffering that was inflicted upon our fellow Ameri-cans. So we must remember this dark period in our Nation’s history and en-sure that this dark shadow of preju-dice, bigotry, and hate never occurs again. However, sadly, as we look around us, today we see that this divisiveness and bigotry persists far too much. We cannot give into hate and intolerance. We must confront it and defeat it with the light and love of the Aloha Spirit. We must learn from this dark stain on our past and vow to never repeat it again. f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF DORENE ANDERSON (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. KIHUEN. Madam Speaker, Wednesday marked the 1-month anni-versary of the terrible shooting that happened in my hometown of Las Vegas. Today I rise to remember the life of Dorene Anderson from Anchorage, Alaska, a woman who was known for her kindness and her smile. Dorene was a loving wife, mother, sister, aunt, and friend who always went above and beyond for everyone in her life. Not only was she a dedicated mother to her two daughters, she was known as a mother to her community. Dorene loved hockey and was the treasurer of the Cowbell Crew, a non-profit hockey organization that sup-ported hockey at all levels. Her friends describe her as an all- around wonderful Alaskan who had a heart of gold, a person who was friend-ly to everyone. I would like to extend my condo-lences to Dorene’s family and friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas and the State of Nevada and the whole country grieve with you.

AMERICANS DESERVE REAL TAX REFORM (Mr. TONKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, again and again, President Donald Trump has promised tax reform that would help the middle class; and again and again, the President has broken those prom-ises. Instead of helping America’s middle class and the working poor, his pro-posals offer big breaks for millionaires and corporations, and painful cuts for nearly everyone else. The House Republican plan rolled out yesterday, rolls over the middle class and those looking to ascend the middle class. It cuts the estate tax, a tax that only affects a few thousand of the wealthiest American families, all while raising taxes on the lowest income bracket from 10 to 12 percent. This plan slashes commonsense de-ductions for middle class families, in-cluding those for medical bills, student loan interest, and even mortgage inter-est. My Republican colleagues claim their plan would save people money,

but they say nothing about the $1.5 trillion their plan would add to the def-icit over the next 10 years. That is about $12,000 of debt for each American household. The American people deserve real tax reform, not just more tax cuts for the wealthy and powerful and those con-nected.

TOPICS OF THE WEEK The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. C
HE-
NEY). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gen-tleman from Iowa (Mr. K
ING) is recog-nized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. KING of Iowa. Madam Speaker, it is my honor to be recognized to ad-dress you here on the floor of the House of Representatives, and I have a couple of topics that I intend to take up for the folks here watching and lis-tening. Madam Speaker, I want to talk about the Heartbeat bill and I want to talk about the immigration bill and the tax policy all together. But there is an im-portant issue before this Congress that I want to hear about before I take up these issues. And for that purpose, I would be happy to yield to the gen-tleman from Florida (Mr. D
ESANTIS ) to get this off of his heart. Mr. D
ESANTIS. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Iowa for his lead-ership. Madam Speaker, it was really dis-tressing to hear that Christ Church in Alexandria is removing a monument honoring its most famous parishioner, George Washington. It just made me think: What is this world coming to? Now, Christ Church is free to do as it pleases, but I think we are also free to criticize such an absurd course of ac-tion. If we can’t honor the Father of our Country, then we truly are drown-ing in a sea of knee-jerk political cor-rectness. George Washington was one of the few truly great men, an American original without whom we would not be standing here today as free people. I just want to tick off a few things before I yield back to my colleague from Iowa, but this is important. His stewardship during the American Revolution brought America a victory that we really had no right to win against the most powerful army on Earth. He only had one-third of the country behind the revolutionary cause, yet, against all odds, Washington led our country to victory. But then having won that military victory, what does Washington do? Throughout all of human history, when you win a military victory, that commanding general then seizes power for themselves and creates a society which is at that individual’s beck and call. b1215 That is not what George Washington did. He famously surrendered his sword to the Continental Congress and gave up power voluntarily because he want-ed to establish a republic. Then he went home to Mount Vernon. When word of Washington’s relinquishment of power reached King George III in England, he was flummoxed. He said: Well, if that is really true, then Wash-ington is the greatest man in the world. It is unheard of that you would relin-quish power in that way. Napoleon, on his deathbed—obviously, he had a lot of trials and tribulations—said: Look, they wanted me to be another Wash-ington, and I just couldn’t do it. Washington presided over the Federal Convention in 1787, which created our Constitution. Had Washington not been willing to lend his legitimacy to that proceeding and to the Constitution, I think it is pretty clear the Constitu-tion would have never been ratified. He gets elected the first President of the United States unanimously. I think we really needed somebody with Wash-ington’s character and stature to be able to launch this new ship of state. If you had had anybody else—and there were many great Founding Fathers— you may not have been able to launch it successfully. He was that type of man. He was also somebody who has of-fered some of the most eloquent de-fenses of religious liberty in our coun-try’s history. I want to quote from a letter he wrote to the Hebrew con-gregation at Newport in 1790. He said: ‘‘It is now no more that tol-eration is spoken of as if it were the in-dulgence of one class of people that an-other enjoyed the exercise of their in-herent natural rights, for, happily, the Government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, requires only that they who live under its pro-tection should demean themselves as good citizens in giving it on all occa-sions their effectual support.’’ Those are words that I think ring as true today and are as important today as they were in 1790. He established a two-term voluntary limit for President. People thought he could have been President for life, and, of course, he could have been. He didn’t think that that was the right way to go. In fact, his entire career—from sur-rendering his sword at the Continental Congress to the two-term limit—was dedicated to the notion that in a repub-lic—the government of laws and not of men—no one individual is indispen-sable. Yet he really was the exception to that rule. He was truly first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen. Mr. Speaker, I think, when you look back at history, you can obviously point to things that we don’t nec-essarily like, and I think it is fair to air that. But to simply remove some-body’s monument—somebody who truly exhibited greatness—I think is a direction in this country that we do not want to go. So I just thought it was important to stand up here and to say that the Fa-ther of our Country is somebody who all Americans should hold in profound esteem because I don’t think we would be sitting here on the floor of the House of Representatives in the most powerful country on Earth if Wash-ington had not existed. Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for his presentation and certainly support and endorse every word that I have heard here. I think about the leadership that George Washington provided, and a couple of things come to mind. One of them is, in my six trips into Egypt, I have met with President el-Sisi each of those times. He finds himself in a posi-tion in Egypt very similar to where Washington was in his first term, Madam Speaker, and that is now with a constitution that has a limitation of two 4-year terms for the President of Egypt. He was elected under that con-stitution, committed to accepting ci-vilian leadership of the military—and that has been taking place—rebuilding the Christian churches in Egypt, estab-lishing a parliament that reflects women as well as men, and religious di-versity in allowing for a lot more reli-gious freedom in Egypt. He has fol-lowed through on all of that. The real test will be if President el- Sisi is re-elected in Egypt when he is up for that re-election, if that should happen, and I hope it does, then I am also listening very closely to what would be his second inaugural address. In that second inaugural address, I am calling upon him to announce that the second term will be his last term in keeping with the standards that are set by George Washington. That is how you transition into a republican form of government that is a representative form of government, a government of we the people. I would also reflect, as I listened to Mr. D
ESANTIS speak about the great-ness of George Washington—and we un-derstand that there has been, I think, an erroneous reading of history and a misinterpretation of history—that there is an effort to purge from and to revise our American history to con-form with what contemporary values are. So now if we disparage and ex-punge from history the statues, the faces, the words, and the leadership of people—some of whom were slave-owners back in that time: Washington, Jefferson, and a list of others all the way up the line—then we fall prey to this weakness of wanting to judge our Founding Fathers and the people who went before us in each generation by the standards of this generation. Yet we admire people like William Wilberforce and John Adams who stood for years to defend the battle against slavery. They made the moral argu-ments against slavery. We had people who were against slavery who owned slaves. If you were in Virginia, and if you owed taxes, then you couldn’t free

your slaves. That was true for some of our Founding Fathers who found them-selves in that position. They couldn’t legally free their slaves. They opposed slavery anyway, but they just couldn’t pay their taxes. That is a piece of his-tory that isn’t often discussed, Madam Speaker. We need to judge Washington for what he did as the Father of our Coun-try and judge him within the context of the values that they had then. We should remember that they tried to eliminate slavery in the founding docu-ments of this country. They were not able to do so because they had enough representation in the South that pre-vented it. So we were, then, less than a century later swept into a giant Civil War which was still the bloodiest war that we have been involved in in our 200- plus years of our history, and that was a bloody war of brother fighting broth-er, North versus South. 600,000 Ameri-cans—mostly White, male Christians— went to their graves to put an end to slavery. That is how huge that contest was. That argument needed to be won here. It was debated here in the U.S. House of Representatives and in the United States Senate. It went through the Supreme Court. I listened to the testimony of Star Parker who testified this past Wednes-day morning on the Heartbeat Bill, H.R. 490. Star Parker is a magnificent witness. I count her as a real leader in this country and a good friend. She is also an African American who has had several abortions before she came to the conviction that she understood that life begins at the moment of con-ception and that human life is sacred in all of its forms. So now her voice is being heard—heard in this Congress and heard across the land. As an African American, she com-pared slavery to the abortion issue today. I look back in the slavery era, the first half of the 19th century build-ing up to the Civil War, and I ask my-self, in looking back at my heritage and my predecessors and the things that they believed in and passed on down to me: Where would I have been? Where would I have been, Madam Speaker, if I had been, say, born in 1800? Would I have had enough vision to step forward and oppose slavery in the same fashion that I oppose abortion today? I would hope I would have. I pray I would have. I would think that those same principles would apply as Star Parker drew that comparison and that juxtaposition in her testimony last Wednesday before the Constitution and Civil Justice Subcommittee. Yet here we are today with a similar debate and a similar argument before us. Slavery was morally wrong. Today, I have never in my lifetime met some-one who defended slavery, but there were many of them who defended slav-ery right here where I stand, Madam Speaker, and across the rotunda in the United States Senate where they stand. They defended it because it was the legacy of the culture and the civili-zation of their times that was included within every civilization throughout the world. Every nation had to figure out how to throw off that yoke of slav-ery and give all creatures created in God’s image an equal opportunity and equal freedom. It cost a lot of blood to put an end to that—600,000 lives. As a matter of fact, not that long ago, I was standing in the Lincoln Me-morial. They call it the temple area there around where the huge statue of Lincoln is seated in his chair up in the Lincoln Memorial. Every time I have walked up those steps, I have walked over to Lincoln’s left—it is my right as I face him—I read Lincoln’s second in-augural address. I don’t have the text of it precisely in front of me, but I will get the gist of it, Madam Speaker. There in his second inaugural ad-dress—remember, the Civil War is not over yet, so we don’t know how it is going to end. He said: 
Until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said, so it is written that the Word of the Lord is true and righteous alto-gether. 
Now, I stood there some time back and read that. Sometimes you can read things four, five, six, ten, or twenty times before you see the wisdom in it, but it hit me as I stood there, a drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by a drop of blood drawn by the sword; how many Americans died in the Civil War? 600,000. Lincoln could not have known that. I thought I knew how many Black Africans had been brought to what is now the United States to be slaves and to be enslaved here; I thought I knew that number. I looked it up. It is with-out much contention, there is a con-sensus number out there, Madam Speaker—600,000. 600,000 Americans died to put an end to slavery, and 600,000 Africans were brought to what is now America to be slaves. Lincoln could not have known either number. He could not have known those killed in action and those who died in the Civil War. He could not have known that 600,000. He could not have known how many were brought to what is now America to be slaves. A drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, so it is written, the Word of the Lord is true and right and just alto-gether. It turns out to be 600,000 versus 600,000. Those are prophetic words that came from the mouth of Abraham Lin-coln in his second inaugural address, Madam Speaker. It is chilling to think about how prescient they were. It is impossible for Lincoln to have known, but the instinct that the hand of God that guided him, the guidance of provi-dence that put those words in his mouth that day, turned out to be true this day. I think of all that this Nation went through to put an end to slavery and all that we are going through to put an end to abortion. I look at the cases of Roe v. Wade, Doe v. Bolton, and a Su-preme Court that one might say was leaning very strongly to it as an activ-ist court and the string of decisions that brought them to Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton. I would take us back through that, Madam Speaker. In about—I have got to guess at the years here again—about 1964 or 1965, there was a case that came before the Supreme Court called Gris-wold v. Connecticut. There, the State of Connecticut, being a strong Catholic State, had outlawed contraceptives in Connecticut because that was also the position of the Catholic Church. There was a couple that decided to sue to be able to purchase contraceptives. So it made its way all the way to the Su-preme Court. The Supreme Court looked into it and decided, well, there is a right to privacy, and the State of Connecticut has no business interfering with the constitutional right to pri-vacy that a married couple has in Con-necticut to purchase contraceptives. So they created this new right—this right to privacy—that didn’t exist in the Constitution. It still doesn’t exist in the Constitution. Now there are those who will argue that it exists in precedent and exists in case law, and, according to stare decisis—respect for previous decisions—it cannot be changed. We are stuck with this idea that the Constitution includes a right to privacy, a right to privacy that is applied to married couples who wanted to buy contraceptives in the State of Connecticut. That was when the Supreme Court reached well beyond their bounds, and they needed to stay within the guide-lines of the Constitution itself, hence this right to privacy. Then there was the Eisenstadt case where the decision was that unmarried people had the same right to privacy as married people. So they extended that right to privacy to unmarried people as well, and now everybody could buy con-traceptives everywhere at any time, and many other things were included underneath that definition. So Roe v. Wade came together, and they decided that, yes, these rights ex-isted, this right to privacy could be ex-trapolated into a right to abortion be-cause this was all written in the ema-nations and the penumbras that are up there. To explain that, emanations and penumbras are like this: they are in the shadows of. So if you look up at the clouds during, let’s say, a semi-cloudy day, then you will see that little shad-ow along the edge of the cloud. You can’t quite see the other side of the cloud, but you see that fringe along the edge. b1230 Someplace in there, those black- robed jurists could see constitutional rights that they couldn’t actually find in the text of the Constitution, that they couldn’t quite find in Griswold,

that they couldn’t quite find in Eisenstadt, but they wrote it into Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton and decided: Okay, we are going to guarantee this constitutional right to have an abor-tion as long as the baby is not viable. The viability, of course, is a pretty mushy definition. The Court has thrown some of our pro-life legislation back at us because they thought our definitions were a little too mushy, but they write some mushy ones them-selves. Then you have the Doe v. Bolton case settled at the same time, simultaneous with Roe v. Wade. There they write in the exceptions, which would be any-thing that might affect the life or health of the mother. The health of the mother can be determined to be the physical health, the mental health, or even the familial health of the mother. So what it means is any reason whatso-ever. When you couple those two cases to-gether—and if you respect the Supreme Court decisions, which America did—it said abortion on demand for any reason whatsoever, whether it is a physical reason, whether it is a mental health reason, or whether it is a family issue, anything that is an inconvenience. We ended up with abortion as birth control and abortion on demand for everyone. At that time, the Court could not have seen that we would be having par-tial-birth abortions conducted across this country in significant numbers to the 24th week and beyond. That is such a ghastly process. This Congress did deal with that through legislation and wrote legislation to ban partial-birth abortion. It was defined. It was outlawed by this Congress. It was litigated all the way to the Su-preme Court, as we would know. When I arrived here, the Supreme Court had found that it was unconsti-tutional for Congress to ban this ghast-ly process of partial-birth abortion, of bringing a baby to birth through breach, feet first, and one inch before that baby could fill its lungs full of American air and scream for its own mercy. They would kill the baby while it struggled and squirmed, and they would collapse the skull by with-drawing from it the contents. That is the ghastly process. It went on over and over again. The Court found it to be unconstitu-tional for Congress to ban—or any State, for that matter—that ghastly process. So we went back to work here in this Congress in the Judiciary Com-mittee. Under the leadership especially of S
TEVE CHABOT of Ohio, we held hearing after hearing after hearing, and we es-tablished and first wrote a definition for partial-birth abortion that was pre-cise so that the Court couldn’t argue that it was too mushy, too vague, not precise enough. We wrote a precise def-inition. Then we held hearings that deter-mined that a partial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to save the life of the mother. We outlawed par-tial-birth abortion again. Then it went through the litigation process. Our statute that banned partial-birth abortion, that came from we the peo-ple, was shot down in three circuits around the country but appealed to the Supreme Court, and it finally survived on that final analysis of the Supreme Court. Even they couldn’t bear the thought of what was going on in this country. It was too stark. It was too ghastly. It was too gruesome. So here we are today, with this House of Representatives having passed legis-lation that bans abortion if the baby can feel pain at 20 weeks. It was a true and right and just thing for this Con-gress, this House of Representatives to do altogether, Madam Speaker. We have sent that bill over to the United States Senate. The bill has a little bit of vagueness in it because we are saying 20 weeks. We would like to precisely identify the exact time that the baby can feel pain. But it screams at our conscience that a baby who is struggling for its own survival can be killed in the womb. If it could fill its own lungs, it would scream for its own mercy. It fights to get away from the abortionist’s tools. That is the bill that bans that, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which we sent to the United States Senate and now sits on MITCH M
CCONNELL ’s desk and probably doesn’t move unless there is a Demo-crat who also agrees with us over in the House of Representatives. It was bipartisan here in the House of Representatives, and I thank the Democrats who have joined us in the pro-life movement; but it has dimin-ished significantly among Democrats in my time here, Madam Speaker. I won’t use the name of the Member. I will just say that a Democratic Mem-ber who is a pro-life Member whom I have served with for roughly a decade, but I went to him and said: Can you sign onto my Heartbeat bill, H.R. 490? Are you ready to do that? He said: Not yet. That left the door open for: Well, maybe. I said: How many Democrats do you think we can get to sign onto the Heartbeat bill that bans abortion from the time a heartbeat can be detected, the baby is protected? He said, without hesitation: Two. We can get two—which meant, I think, him and one other. I said: How many pro-life votes were there in the House of Representatives among Democrats when you came here roughly 10 years ago, how many pro- life votes among Democrats? His answer, without hesitation, was 60. Sixty Democrats would put up a pro-life vote. Ten years later, today, two, maybe three. I hope and pray it is more than that. I will work for all the votes that we can get. But that, I think, tells us something about how polarized the political arena here is in this House of Representa-tives, in the United States Senate, and explains why Tom Perez, head of the DNC, can say there is no room for pro- life people in the Democratic Party. If you can’t be a Republican, then trans-form the Democratic Party so we can save the lives of these innocent unborn. That is what the Heartbeat bill is, H.R. 490, the Heartbeat Protection Act, which we held a hearing on last Wednesday. The testimony, I think, was stellar that came out of the panel-ists who were there. David Forte delivered the constitu-tional arguments even more so in the Q&A than he did so in his presentation. We heard from Dr. Kathi Aultman, who has been an abortionist and com-mitted an uncounted number of abor-tions, and she has also had an abortion herself. She has delivered a baby girl vaginally herself. So she is a mother and an abortionist. She said in her testimony: I realize that when I meet the young people whom I delivered—an OB/GYN who had a dual purpose of bringing babies forth in the world, protecting their lives with all the medical technology and skill set that can be developed on this hand, but over on this hand, kill them, and the dichotomy of that hit her after she delivered her own daughter. She went back to work and her hands were still doing what they had been doing, but her conscience screamed at her, and she had to put the tools down and stop this ghastly practice of abor-tion. Now she has committed a signifi-cant portion of her life to putting an end to this. But she said she realized, when she met young people, the joy that she had helped bring them into the world if she delivered them; but at the same time, she understood that there were a lot of young people who are not here because she aborted them. So it always tore at her conscience that way. Another thing that I had not heard from anyone in this movement in the past, in all of our discussions, was this. She said: If I was going to abort the baby, I always referred to it, when I spoke with the mother, as a fetus. But if we were going to deliver the baby and give this baby a chance at life, I al-ways referred to it as a baby. I think that explains to us the dif-ference in the disagreements we have here in the House of Representatives. Almost universally, over on this side, people support abortion in every form they can, with those exceptions whom I tip my hat to and those who will be converted, hopefully, by their con-science over time like Cathy Aultman was. They say ‘‘fetus’’; we say ‘‘baby.’’ God knows it is a baby. God knows that it is a unique human being from the moment of conception. What we can’t yet do, medically, is precisely tell the mother the moment of conception. We don’t have a medical way to determine that moment, or I would be focusing our legislation on that moment. But what we do have now, with ultrasound,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH8484 November 3, 2017 
is the ability to identify that heartbeat in that baby. The legislation in H.R. 490, the Heartbeat Protection Act, says this. We require the would-be abortionist to check for a heartbeat before that abor-tionist would continue with an abor-tion. They have to maintain records on this: check for a heartbeat, and then if a heartbeat can be detected, the baby is protected. We know that is life. If an abortionist stops that beating heart, we know that has ended the life of that innocent baby. As we brought this legislation for-ward, we found out that there is some-thing about that heartbeat that speaks to the conscience and the hearts of America, Madam Speaker. We know that billboard after billboard—there must be thousands of them around America, many of them put up by the Knights of Columbus—saying: Abortion stops a beating heart. When we see that billboard, maybe it only registers a little bit, but many of us have seen it hundreds and hundreds of times, and we associate the heart-beat with life. If there is a beating heart, we know there is life. If you stop that beating heart, you know that you ended a human life. On the argument that a baby isn’t viable, in the Roe v. Wade era back in 1973, the Supreme Court said maybe that is at 28 weeks. But now we have babies that survive at 22 weeks. That is a month and a half less than before. I recall a circumstance in 1992 where I had an individual who was part of the administrative oversight on a con-struction project that I was on that fall. He was gone for 2 weeks, and I knew why. His wife had gone into labor and delivered a little baby boy pre-maturely. This little baby boy was in the early part of 20-some weeks. And I am not certain, but I am just guessing earlier than 24 weeks, but certainly not 28. They went to the city and stayed in that hospital with this little boy for 2 weeks and didn’t leave. They stayed at his side and prayed for him and they did all they could. He was hooked up to all kinds of tubes. When he came back to me after 2 weeks, he was relatively assured that this little boy would survive. He walked up to me and handed me a cigar that said, ‘‘It’s a boy.’’ He wasn’t hand-ing out those cigars the first 2 weeks because he wasn’t confident this little boy was going to live. But he handed me that cigar—and I knew where he stood politically—and I said to him: We would do anything to save the life of any little baby. Any lit-tle boy or girl, we would do anything to save their life. There is no amount of expense we wouldn’t go to. There is no amount of medical effort we wouldn’t go to to save the life of a baby, no matter how small their chance was to survive. We will do ev-erything. We will spend $100,000, $200,000, $500,000 to save that innocent little life. We do everything we can do with all the medical technology that we have. We spare no effort from doc-tors or nurses. We will spare no effort on our knees praying to God this little baby can be born and grow into a full human being. He agreed with me 100 percent. He said: I agree with you, and I am so glad that my little boy looks like he is going to be okay. I said: Then are you going to go into the polls of next month—this is Octo-ber of 1992—and vote for the man for President who will appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who are going to continue to enable abortion in Amer-ica? He looked at me and called me a name that we can refer to by the first letter of those three words, but he said it in such a way that it wasn’t insult-ing to me. It said instead: You have drilled a point home. After these 30-some years, I ran into him in the grocery store here several Sundays ago after mass. We are both Catholic. I hadn’t talked to him in a long time. I asked him how that little boy was doing, and he told me. He said: You straightened me out back then, didn’t you? Do you remem-ber that? He asked me if I remembered it. Of course I did. I said: Yes, I remembered it, but I didn’t want to bring it up. I did want to know how he is. So that is a composite of the con-science of the Nation, Madam Speaker. I think it tells us that we all haven’t come to the realization of the immo-rality of abortion yet, but America came to the realization of the immo-rality of slavery. We will get to the re-alization of the immorality of abor-tion. We are making progress. Looking at this legislation, H.R. 490, we have a number of 69 percent of Americans supporting protecting any baby with a heartbeat. b1245 That is, 55 percent of Democrats sup-port protecting a baby with a heart-beat, and this legislation would save the lives of at least 90 percent of the babies that are otherwise being abort-ed. So I want to thank all the people who have done so much work on this that brought us to this point. We are at 170 cosponsors. We have had a hearing. Next step, hopefully, is to get the markup before the Judiciary Com-mittee. My goal is to bring the Heart-beat bill to this floor of the House of Representatives January 19 of 2018. That is the date of the March for Life here in this town, and that is the date we need to bring that legislation to this floor. If we can do so and send it over to the Senate, if the Senate can take it up and pass it, I am confident our President will sign it, and we can begin to put an end to this carnage. To speak of the magnitude of the car-nage of abortion: 60 million babies aborted since 1973 in Roe v. Wade. I had a lady, who is a Democrat, say to me just over here a couple of months ago: Steve, why are you so worried about this? We have abortions down to where they are almost, or maybe even are below, a million a year? Only a million abortions a year? How can anyone quantify that and say that is anything other than a bloody car-nage and a loss of human potential and a denial of the gifts from God? Sixty million babies aborted since Roe v. Wade in 1973. And how many ba-bies would be born to those who were aborted? How many of those little girls that were aborted in the 1970s, the 1980s, the 1990s, and even in the early part of this millennia—for a small part, the earliest part of this millennia—how many of those little girls would be hav-ing babies today? And how many would they have? Just a back-of-the-envelope calcula-tion tells me that there are another 60 million babies that are missing because of the 60 million that have been abort-ed. And here we are, America. I am lis-tening to people argue, and they will say: Well, you know there is work that Americans won’t do, and we have a shortage of labor, so we have to go to some other culture, some other civili-zation and bring in hundreds of thou-sands or millions of people to do work that Americans won’t do. I wonder, if you would ask those in-nocent little voices that are in Heaven today, if they wouldn’t mind laying a few bricks or maybe cutting some grass or doing a little bit of landscaping around or maybe cutting a little bit of meat. These are all things I do, by the way, even today, if I get the chance. Ask them if they wouldn’t have liked to have had a chance at the right to life, if they wouldn’t have liked to have an opportunity to live, to love, to breathe air, to laugh, to have their own children, to enjoy the greatest country the world has ever seen, and it is all de-nied to them. It is denied to 60 million of them, and it is denied to perhaps another 60 mil-lion who didn’t even have the chance to be aborted because their future parents were killed in the womb. So 60 million plus 60 million is 120 million missing in this country today. No wonder we have a labor shortage. Oh, here is another reason why we have a labor shortage, Madam Speaker. If you look at the numbers of—accord-ing to the Department of Labor statis-tics in their website, there are 94
1⁄2mil-lion Americans who are simply not in the workforce. They are old enough to work. They are not in the workforce, 94
1⁄2million. If you add to that the 7-plus million who are on unemployment today, you get up to right at 102 million Ameri-cans who potentially could be in the workforce, they are not looking for work or they are on unemployment, and I am listening to employers scream for more labor, more labor, more labor. By the way, they are screaming for more unskilled labor. I look on that same website, and I see—where are the highest levels of unemployment?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8485 November 3, 2017 
In the lowest skills we have. We don’t have a shortage of low-skilled laborers. We have a shortage of employers who want to pay a competitive wage. So call it 102 million Americans that could be in this workforce. Then we took that number and we started chop-ping it down. How about those that are too old? We can’t ask them to work, so dial that down a little bit. And then how about those that are physically disabled? They can’t work, so dial that down. What would it be if we were going to mobilize our workforce on the levels of, say, World War II, where at the end of World War II, we had the lowest unem-ployment in history? And often this is misquoted and people want to point to some other number. 1.2 percent was our unemployment rating at the end of the Second World War. Women went to work. My mother did. Of course, my father was deployed. But if we mobilized on that level, how many would be available to go into this workforce? We think about 82 million Americans are sitting there today. Some of them on a couch in their front lawn, some of them are riding around in their Mer-cedes, but a lot of them could be going to work. In fact, everybody I mentioned so far should be at work contributing to our GDP instead of just consuming. Eighty-two million or so out there out of the 102 million that are not in the workforce, and they say: Well, we have to bring in hundreds of thousands or millions or tens of millions of people to do this work in America. Around our family, Marilyn and I raised three sons. I started a business in 1975. I started a family in 1975. Those three sons got an allowance. They got paid for the work they did. In addition, the allowance was younger, paid for the work they did came a little later. But of those three sons, they all knew what they had to do. Now, if one of those three sons—by the way, I am talking about one-third of our workforce is not in the work-force. They are simply not in the work-force. But one-third of the people who could be are sitting back on the side-lines. So let’s just say, around our oper-ation, there is work that has to be done. You got to scoop the tracks out of the dozer. Somebody has got to change their oil. Somebody has got to mow the lawn. Somebody has got to take care of the other chores. Some-body has got to trim the trees, all those things that need to be done. They all got their assignments and they did them. But if one of those sons said, ‘‘Well, I am not working. I am going to sit on the couch and watch the ball game or sit on the porch and watch the rest of you work. I want to eat with the rest of the family. I want to put my feet under the table. I want good food. I want my clothes all clean. I want them ironed. I want them ready to go. Somebody else can clean my room, too, but I still want my allowance,’’ you all know, if you grew up in the family, how long that would last. If one of the siblings, a brother or a sister, said, ‘‘I am not doing my work, but give me my allowance, and I still want the keys to the car,’’ it wouldn’t last one day. In our house, it goes completely the other way. It is: ‘‘Oh, you think that? Now you get all the work, and they get your allowance until you change your mind.’’ We fixed that really quick in my household, and I think it would be fixed a number of different ways, but really quickly in every household in America. We don’t tolerate a slacker sitting there taking up a room in the house that is demanding all the bene-fits of the work of the rest of the fam-ily. But we have got 102 million Ameri-cans sitting there. Many of them are being bribed not to work by welfare checks. We have over 70 different means-tested Federal welfare programs in the United States. Over 70. Some say 87 of them. No one has even memorized the list. So that should tell you that no one understands how they interrelate with each other. No one understands whether there are disincentives or in-centives for people to do the right thing and step forward and carry their share of the load. So why wouldn’t we dial the welfare down in America until the labor force magically shows up in the workplace? That is what happened with John Smith. His experiment early on in America worked exactly like that. He said that there were—of all the royalty that was there, they thought, because they had blue blood—and that is, of course, the expression of royalty—that they didn’t have to work and those commoners needed to work for the rest of time. He said: I am not going to burn up the labor of these common people here so that a bunch of royalty can sit around with their feet up. That is a summarization of the state-ment. Everybody had to work, and they had the ‘‘no work, no eat’’ policy. Well, when you get to that policy, a lot of people decide that working is better than going hungry, but it doesn’t mean we don’t take care of the people who are needy. It doesn’t mean we elimi-nate these programs. It just means, as I said, maybe we need 10 million more American workers. We can dial this welfare system down, ratchet it down. It is now a hammock. It used to be a safety net, and this Congress with spe-cial interests has cranked up the level of the safety net to the level of the hammock, and now 102 million Ameri-cans, a good share of them, are in that hammock. We just crank it back down. We could dial it down in proportion to the amount of labor that we need. Every-body that gets off the hammock and goes to work becomes a contributor. They grow our GDP—our gross domes-tic product—and they pay taxes and they take themselves off the welfare rolls. So why wouldn’t you do the twofer, instead of go to some other country and bring people here to do the work who don’t speak our language, who don’t understand our culture, and who don’t embrace the American civiliza-tion in many cases, and who run down people in bike paths in New York, and who attack us at Fort Hood—the list goes on and on—Orlando, Florida; San Bernardino, on and on, the people who hate us? As L
OUIE GOHMERT often says, ‘‘We don’t have to pay people to hate us. They will hate us for free.’’ He was talking about foreign policy. We have got people on welfare who hate us. We don’t have to pay them either. We need more people working. We need more people back in the rolls. So I want to applaud K
EVIN BRADY , the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and I thank him for the very diligent work that he has done in order to bring this tax policy as far as it is today, and to roll it out with the coordination that they have, with the support from the leadership within the House, the Senate, and the White House, and that message has been clear. Also, K
EVIN MCCARTHY , our majority leader, stood here today and defended it and explained it, I think, very well. He is an articulate voice for our entire conference and he does an excellent job, along with our Speaker and our whip. By the way, our whip, S
TEVE SCALISE , maybe he doesn’t have all of his moves back yet, but his heart and his head are back as strong as ever. His voice is as strong as ever. S
TEVE SCALISE has his mojo back, Madam Speaker, and I am awfully glad to see that. We need that. It is a gift to us to have him. So what do we do with this need for labor? I asked the question a little earlier in a tax conference downstairs: Of this tax policy, the bill now that was dropped yesterday, does it allow an em-ployer to deduct as a business expense the wages and benefits that are paid to illegals who are in his employment? The answer that I got was: We didn’t address that in the bill, so whatever it is today is what it is. What it is today, Madam Speaker, is every employer—let me put it this way: I will say virtually every em-ployer who deducts the wages that are paid of them is often—if they have illegals working for them, they go on the schedule C, like any other em-ployer. So let’s just say, if there is an em-ployer there who pays $1 million out to illegals, that shows up in his schedule C as a business expense, wages. And those wages then are deducted as a business expense. Of course, you don’t pay taxes on business expenses.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH8486 November 3, 2017 
I don’t pay taxes on fuel. I don’t pay taxes on parts. I don’t pay taxes on the wages our company pays in 42 years in the construction business or on the benefit packages that we have there. And—but—so employers are deducting wages and benefits paid to illegals, and that is supposed to be against the law. But they don’t address that in this tax bill. And the way the IRS has ad-dressed it is that—it says this—accord-ing to section 162(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, it denies a deduction for ‘‘illegal payments.’’ But even though it denies a deduc-tion, under the statute for illegal pay-ments, the IRS has interpreted this a little bit differently. So it says here in this document: even though it is illegal to employ unauthorized alien workers, the IRS has ruled that section 162(e) does not apply to the wages paid to those aliens—and I would call them aliens—even if the employer knowingly broke the law. Well, there is a problem with IRS in-terpretation, but I also know they are not very likely to change that inter-pretation, unless Congress should crack them over the knuckles with some legislation. I have, for a number of Congresses, introduced legislation known as the New IDEA Act. Today, the New IDEA Act is H.R. 176. It does this: it clarifies. It amends 162(e) of the Code, and it clarifies that wages and benefits paid to illegals are not tax deductible for Federal income tax purposes. It gives the employer safe harbor if he uses E- Verify to verify his employees. In other words, if you hire people, you have got people on your payroll, you run them through E-Verify. We know all about this program. The Judi-ciary Committee passed a mandatory E-Verify bill out of the committee here a couple of weeks ago. But you run them through E-Verify. If you are the employer and they have qualified to be legal to work in the United States through the E-Verify program, then the IRS cannot touch you with regard to hiring illegals. So it is a safe harbor that we build into the bill. So tax, wages, and benefits paid to employers are not tax deductible. The employer gets safe harbor if he uses E- Verify. We also require the IRS to exchange information and build a working com-mittee with the Social Security Ad-ministration and the Department of Homeland Security so that the right hand, the left hand, and the middle hand know what each other is doing. b1300 This is the Federal Government, after all. And how can we have depart-ments within this government working at cross purposes with each other? So the IRS’ job should be to collect taxes. They should not be allowing the deductions of wages and benefits paid to illegals. They are not legal to work in America. If you are buying illegal drugs, do you get to deduct your illegal drugs? If you pay off somebody to commit an illegal activity, do you get to de-duct that? No. In none of those cases, we don’t allow deductions for illegal activity. That is partly what the legislation said. But the IRS has their practice. By the way, before I wrote this bill, I was looking around for what depart-ment within any branch of government do the people respect fear the most. As one who has been audited thoroughly a number of times, I notice that the IRS is the one that we respect the most— probably fear the most—and the last organization that we want to show up at our door that is going to check to see if we are hiring illegals. So what would happen under this bill is the IRS would show up—we don’t ac-celerate any audits. The IRS would show up to do a normal audit under normal terms of identifying businesses that they would normally audit, and, in the course of that audit, they would run the Social Security numbers and the identifying information of the em-ployees off of the I–9 forms that have been required since 1986 and punch them into E-Verify. If they could verify that all of the employees could work legally in Amer-ica, then, fine, no problem, and that employer only has his other tax issues to worry about. But if E-Verify kicks any of those employees out—one or more—then the employer has 72 hours’ notice to cure, like they would under any other circumstance, to correct any records that might need to be cor-rected. Otherwise, the IRS could look at that and say: Okay, this million dol-lars that you wrote off as a business expense is not a business expense. That goes back into the gross receipts and shows up at the bottom as net taxable income. If we do the math on this and break it down, what is the impact? Well, the impact works out to be this: If you have a $10-an-hour illegal and the audit comes in and says you can’t deduct that $10 an hour, then the im-pact of it is that the employer then would be billed for interest and penalty and the tax liability that we cal-culated, I think, at around 35
1⁄2or 36 percent. That turns your $10-an-hour il-legal into about a $16-an-hour illegal. Now, if you are going to have to pay $16 an hour, maybe you could actually hire an American to do that work. You wouldn’t have to hire somebody that is sneaking around and that snuck into America. That is one way to look at this is it raises the cost. There is also a 6-year statute of limi-tations. Nothing goes backwards. There is no ex post facto in this. It would only be from the day of enact-ment. From that point forward, there could be a 6-year cumulative liability. So the first year that the bill would pass—hopefully, in this tax package that we have in front of us that is com-ing to us next week—from the first year the bill would pass, you have 1 year of liability. And say the IRS doesn’t audit you the first year. The second year, now you have 2 years of liability. That risk accumulates then for the period of 6 years, that statute of limitations. So, each year, the employer would see that they had a contingent liability: the IRS. If the IRS shows up and audits, they are going to go back at least 4 years, I am going to guess, maybe longer. That means that they are going to work to clean up their workforce. They can do it incrementally or they can do it all at once. But nobody is going to want to sit there with a 6-year statute of limitations hanging over their head. Madam Speaker, I include in the RECORD an article that is written by the Center for Immigration Studies, dated August 31, 2017, titled: ‘‘Raise More than a Quarter Trillion Dollars of Tax Revenue by Ending Tax Subsidies for Unauthorized Employment of Ille-gal Aliens.’’ 
[From the Center for Immigration Studies, August 31, 2017] R
AISE MORE THAN A QUARTER TRILLION DOL-
LARS OF TAXREVENUE BY ENDING TAXSUB-
SIDIES FOR UNAUTHORIZED EMPLOYMENT OF  I
LLEGAL ALIENS  (By CIS) Aliens enter the United States without au-thorization for many reasons, but for most of them the goal is to secure employment at much higher wages than are available in their native countries. While breaking the law provides very significant economic bene-fits to these illegal workers and to the busi-nesses that hire them, it comes at a cost to American workers. According to Harvard economist George Borjas, recent empirical research indicates that American workers suffer a reduction of $99 billion to $118 billion in annual wages because of illegal immigra-tion. The economic rewards of unauthorized em-ployment of aliens are not limited to the higher wages of the illegal workers and the lower labor costs of their employers. Unau-thorized alien workers and their employers also enjoy multi-billion dollar tax deduc-tions and tax credits that were enacted into law for the benefit of law-abiding workers and businesses. When Congress returns from summer re-cess on September 5, it is expected to focus attention on a major reform of the federal income tax system, including a combination of lower rates and other tax incentives to families and to businesses. The largest chal-lenge facing tax reformers is finding suffi-cient additional revenue to pay for the tax cuts and tax incentives they promised to the people who elected them. In fairness to the American families and businesses to whom these tax cuts have been promised, and in particular to the American families whose household incomes have been diminished by illegal immigration, Congress should con-sider eliminating unwarranted tax breaks to unauthorized alien workers and their em-ployers. Each of the following reforms—one that eliminates a tax subsidy for employers of un-authorized aliens and the other that elimi-nates a tax subsidy for the unauthorized workers—comes with an estimate of the ad-ditional revenues that would be raised by the reform Together they could raise $296 billion over 10 years—more than a quarter-trillion dollars. 1.

payments’’. Even though it is illegal to em-ploy unauthorized alien workers, the IRS has ruled that section 162(e) does not apply to the wages paid to those aliens, even if the employer knowingly broke the law. On Janu-ary 3, 2017, Rep. Steve King and eight other members of Congress introduced H.R. 176, the New Illegal Deduction Elimination Act, Section 2 of which would amend section 162(e) to clarify that no deduction is allowed for wages paid to unauthorized alien work-ers. H.R. 176 provides employers a ‘‘safe har-bor’’, allowing a deduction to employers that used the Department of Homeland Security’s free, online E-Verify system to confirm the employee’s eligibility to work. The amount of wages paid to unauthorized alien workers cannot be known with cer-tainty. One of the most extensive studies of unauthorized immigrants in the United States was conducted by the Pew Hispanic Center in 2009. According to that study, there were approximately 8.3 million un-documented immigrants in the U.S. labor force, a figure that Pew more recently esti-mated had fallen to 8.0 million. Pew esti-mated the median household income of un-authorized worker families to be approxi-mately $36,000 and that there were approxi-mately 1.75 workers per household, implying median per-worker earnings of $20,571. Multi-plying Pew’s estimated number of unauthor-ized alien workers by the earnings-per-work-er estimate yields an estimated total of wages paid to unauthorized alien workers of approximately $165 billion. Many unauthorized workers are employed in the ‘‘underground economy’’, i.e., by households and other employers that are not reporting or paying payroll taxes and pre-sumably are not deducting the wages. A 2013 report by the Social Security Administra-tion estimated that, of approximately seven million alien workers in various irregular work statuses in 2010, approximately 3.1 mil-lion (44 percent) had Social Security num-bers (mostly false or fraudulently secured), while approximately 3.9 million (56 percent) were working in the ‘‘underground econ-omy.’’ On the assumption that employers re-ported payroll taxes and claimed wage ex-pense deductions only for the 44 percent of unauthorized workers who could produce an SSN, and that most employers deducted wages at or near the corporate tax rate of 35 percent, we estimate that disallowing a de-duction for wages paid to unauthorized alien workers would increase federal tax revenues by approximately $25.4 billion per year (35 percent x 44 percent x $165 billion), or $254 billion over 10 years. 2. Deny Refundable Tax Credits to Illegal Aliens. Section 24(a) of the Internal Revenue Code allows a $1,000 per-child tax credit for taxpayer’s whose earnings fall below a speci-fied threshold. The Child Tax Credit is re-fundable to the extent it exceeds the tax-payer’s tax liability, in which case it is re-ferred to as the Additional Chad Tax Credit or ACTC. A 2011 report by the U S. Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration explained that aliens authorized to work in the United States are required to obtain a Social Security number (SSN). For aliens who need to file U.S. federal tax returns for other reasons, such as to claim refunds of withholding tax on dividends, the IRS issues Individual Tax Identification Numbers (ITINs). Unfortunately, according to the in-spector general, the IRS had been permitting aliens to claim ACTCs on returns that re-ported an ITIN rather than a Social Security number. The payment of ACTCs to illegal aliens is arguably a direct violation of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996 (‘‘PRWOA’’), which expressly provides that an illegal alien ‘‘is not eligible for any Federal public benefit.’’ The IRS has applied the PRWOA rule to prohibit payments of Earned Income Tax Credits to ITIN filers, but based on a questionable interpretation of the law has allowed ITIN filers refunds of ACTCs. According to the Inspector General, ‘‘[b]ased on claims made in Processing Year 2010, disallowance of the ACTC to filers with-out a valid SSN would reduce Federal out-lays by approximately $8.4 billion over 2 years,’’ i.e., $4.2 billion per year. Although the inspector general’s figures are based on 2010 fiscal data, Treasury Department tax ex-penditure estimates indicate that the total child tax credit expenditure was virtually unchanged between 2010 and 2017. Accord-ingly, based on the inspector general’s re-port, we estimate that limiting the Child Tax Credit to taxpayers with Social Security numbers would increase federal tax revenues by approximately $4.2 billion per year, or $42 billion over 10 years. 
Mr. KING of Iowa. The bulk of this article addresses my bill, H.R. 176, the New IDEA Act, the New Illegal Deduc-tion Elimination Act. They go through the calculations here, and I will just touch on some of them. This is data from a Harvard econo-mist, George Borjas. It is his empirical research. He shows that the workers in America, because wages have been sup-pressed by an oversupply of unskilled and illegal laborers, that American workers are suffering somewhere be-tween a $99 billion and $118 billion loss in annual wages because they haven’t gotten a raise in a long time. Nobody gets a raise as long as there is cheaper labor there that keeps that down—no effective raise. So between $99 billion and $118 billion. That is the Harvard economist, George Borjas. That is the annual wages loss because of illegal immigration. If we go to the next page on this, it lays out the conditions, and we are see-ing this. This is a number from the Pew Hispanic Center in 2009. It says that there are 8.3 million undocu-mented immigrants in the U.S. labor force. They recently estimated that number is actually ratcheted down to about 8 million. It doesn’t say why. But if they estimated the median household income of unauthorized worker fami-lies to be approximately $36,000 at 1-
3⁄4 average workers per household, that is roughly—let’s see. It says, ‘‘implying median per-worker earnings of $20,571,’’ they estimated that the earnings-per- worker estimate yields $165 billion a year. This is some of the magnitude of the money that is going out of our economy. Also, added to that, roughly $60 billion is being wired out of Amer-ica. So those who say, ‘‘Well, we really need these illegal workers because they stimulate our economy, they grow our economy,’’ they are siphoning this off. They are holding down the wages for the working people in America to the tune of $100 billion or more a year. They are earning something like $165 billion a year, and they are sending at least $60 billion of that south of the border, about half to Mexico and the other half to Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. So all of these are economic impacts. But the CIS, the Center for Immigra-tion Studies, drew this estimate that, should my bill, the New IDEA Act, H.R. 176, become law—and the perfect place for it is in this tax policy—they esti-mate that it would score at, the num-ber would be, $25.4 billion a year. If we do a 10-year estimate, that means a $254 billion score, a quarter of $1 tril-lion poured into our budget at a time that we are cutting taxes and we have a red ink tax policy—which I want to see passed, by the way. We have got some solutions here, and I want to see those solutions become law. H.R. 176 is one of the unique tools that has been here for some time. It is thoroughly vetted. It has had a good number of cosponsors on it over the past years. I knew Barack Obama would never sign it, but Donald Trump will. It was on his website. Early on, when he first launched his Presidency, the support for the New IDEA Act was on his immigration pol-icy that was posted then. I haven’t checked it now in quite some time, but I don’t have any doubt that, if we send a tax bill to Donald Trump’s desk with H.R. 176 in it, it will score better, to the tune of probably a quarter of $1 trillion. It will put an end to the illegal work-force in America, or at least an end to the deductibility of wages and benefits paid to illegals, and it brings together the Social Security Administration, Department of Homeland Security, and the IRS to exchange information so that, if there is a Social Security num-ber that is overused, they need to tell the DHS and they need to tell the IRS. If the IRS comes up with employers that are hiring illegals—and they will—they need to tell the Department of Homeland Security so ICE can come in and enforce the law. So each one of these agencies needs to cooperate with each other. This way, we open up jobs for American workers, and we give the American workers a raise. Now, what could be better than giv-ing the American workers a raise and giving the American workers a tax cut all at the same time, while we nearly guarantee an economic growth cycle for the next decade of an average of over 3 percent per quarter? We can do that. It is all sitting here in front of us. And my hope, my prayer, and my effort is that we can all work together to reach all of those goals. Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-ance of my time.

weekend, be out in God’s nature and just enjoy the best Iowa has to offer, and S
TEVE KINGis one of those best things. Well, we have heard a great deal about the New York terrorist, although I believe Governor Cuomo told us there are no terrorist ties initially, before he had any time to know anything, really. But that seems to be kind of the way most mayors where these terrorist at-tacks occur respond. They immediately declare, ‘‘This is not terrorist. No ter-rorist ties.’’ And then, lo and behold, we find out, eventually, there certainly are. One of the problems that has been created during the last 8 years and a little bit during the last part of the Bush administration is the develop-ment discussion of countering violent extremism. But I do want to touch on something about the diversity visa lot-tery program. My first year in Congress, in 2005, we eliminated the diversity visa lottery program—at least voted in the House to eliminate it—but the Senate would not take it up, wouldn’t take it up. We had a Republican majority in the House and Senate, and the Senate wouldn’t take it up. Then, in November of 2006, we lost the majority in both Houses. And, of course, the Democratic majority in both Houses loved the diversity visa lottery program. In fact, I have a floor speech from Senator C
HUCK SCHUMER  where he extols the virtues of the di-versity visa lottery program. Here are some highlights. Senator S
CHUMER said—this is May 24, 2006: ‘‘As a Member of the House, I helped create this program, which my colleague, Senator Kennedy, created in the Senate in 1990.’’ He said: ‘‘In fact, my city of New York has dramatically benefited from this program, and diverse countries such as Ireland, Poland, and Nigeria have had large numbers of immigrants to be able to come, set roots, and help the diversity of New York and of Amer-ica. ‘‘So this is an excellent program. No-body has said it has done a bad job.’’ Those were his comments in 2006. Well, I am here to say it has done a bad job. So now nobody can say that nobody has said it has done a bad job, because I am saying it has done a bad job. No matter how noble the original idea was, you should never trust the country’s security to a lottery. That is insanity. Of course, in a speech back in 2006, then Congressman S
CHUMER , now Sen-ator S
CHUMER , said—or, actually, he was a Senator in 2006. But Senator S
CHUMER said: ‘‘I think America should admit many more of those people but not at the expense of this small, suc-cessful program that guarantees that other countries, such as the Irelands, the Polands, and the Nigerias that are unable to have immigrants come in for family reasons, can get people to come into this country.’’ Senator SCHUMER also said, about the diversity visa lottery program: ‘‘But one of the things great about America is, again, we allow people from all over the world to come here. ‘‘So I plead with my colleagues, keep the diversity visa program.’’ He said: ‘‘As I ride my bike around New York City on the weekends, I see what immigrants do for America. This program has dramatically helped. Neighborhoods such as Woodlawn and Greenpoint have been revitalized by new Irish and Polish immigrants. Neighborhoods such as East Flatbush and Harlem have been revitalized by West African immigrants. We don’t have to stop this program.’’ b1315 Well, again, it is insanity to trust our national security to a lottery, and that is what the diversity visa lottery program does. We have had terrorists, and we have known it for a number of years, that have been getting their names into the lottery so that hopefully they would win the lottery and come to America to kill Americans. I understand that there was a stepped-up effort in the last couple of years to vet people a little better, but the trouble here is, as then-Director Comey of the FBI testified before our Judiciary Committee, we have got nothing to vet these people against, so many of them, from Syria, from Yemen. He said in Iraq, we had all of the gov-ernment records. It turns out, even with all the government records, they let in two terrorists. We had finger-prints of theirs on IEDs that killed Americans, and they let them in, and eventually realized they had made a mistake. So they said we are going to step up our vetting after they realized they had admitted known terrorists into the United States that created IEDs to kill and maim Americans. They could say we were stepping up the vetting program, but when there is no information—this is what Comey said. With Iraq, we had the government records, we had fingerprints, we took fingerprints off IEDs. Syria, Yemen, we have got nothing. The government there doesn’t give us their records. We have nothing to work from. In Syria, for a while, ISIS had taken over one of the printing facili-ties where they could print the pass-ports. So we had no information to work from. We didn’t know what was true and what wasn’t. So, once again, we were trusting our national security and the lives of Americans to a fatal game of Russian roulette, but it was from the Middle East, it was from Uzbekistan, it was from places where people have been radicalized. I have got the numbers here. In fact, let’s see, diversity visa program statis-tics, as I understand, the New York ter-rorist, the ISIS supporter who killed eight people, wounded so many others, in 2011, we had 5,091 from Uzbekistan. There were none from Poland, and in the top ten, there were certainly none from Ireland. We had, in 2012, 4,800 from Uzbek-istan; and even better news, we had 4,453 from Iran. For those who are not keeping track, the Iranian Government has not given us information that we can count on about people in Iran who want to come to America, and we know Iran is the largest national supporter of terrorism in the world. So we don’t have much of anything to vet these people on, but, you know, Senator S
CHUMER said it is a great program, and nobody said anything against it as he rides his bicycle around. Well, fortunately he wasn’t riding his bicycle around in front of the terrorist that was allowed in on the program he thinks was so grand. And, frankly, I am grateful he was not on his bicycle in front of that terrorist killer that his program let in. In 2013, Uzbekistan, we had 5,101 come in from Uzbekistan. We did have 2,038 come from Poland that year. In 2014, another 6,027 that we could not adequately vet coming from Iran. Some of them we could with relatives, but many of those people simply could not be vetted. We don’t know if they were sent here by the Iranian Govern-ment to kill Americans or not. In 2015, we have another 4,992 from Iran; Uzbekistan, we had another 4,368. So we don’t have the numbers from 2016 yet, unfortunately, but hopefully that gives some idea of what we are dealing with. We also need to understand that gov-ernment officials tell us: You know, we had no indication this guy was a ter-rorist. There were even people from the gov-ernment, the Feds, who were saying: Gee, you know, this was not a known person. This New York terrorist, not a known person to the Federal authori-ties. Well, it turns out, in 2015, they inter-viewed him. He had terrorist ties. The thing people need to understand is—and I have been saying this for years, I have grilled Director Mueller on this issue. I was contacted by one media outlet that says: Why are you just bringing this up now about the purge of training materials? My goodness. I have been talking about this for years, I have been made fun of about this for years, but I have been right about it for years, Michele Bachmann and I. It should not have been classified what they took out of the FBI mate-rials, but they classified it so we couldn’t show America how stupid some of their purging was, how sense-less, how, as some of our agents told me, we are blinding ourselves of the ability to see our enemy. So I grilled Mueller some years ago over the fact that they got a heads-up twice that the older Tsarnaev brother was radicalized, he was a terrorist, he

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8489 November 3, 2017 
was a threat to American lives. They didn’t do anything; the CIA didn’t do anything. The FBI finally sends some agents out. They interviewed the older Tsarnaev, but they didn’t know what to ask. They don’t know what the signs are of someone who is radicalized, be-cause they have had beat down their throats for so long, and this was the Obama administration, they had the FBI’s Guiding Principles document on training. And this was the document that the FBI used to say: Oh, no. We have got to be politically correct. We can’t teach people about how to find and spot a radical Islamist. So there was a purge of FBI training materials. There is a fantastic Judicial Watch special report, it can be found on their website, dated December 5 of 2013, ‘‘U.S. Government Purges of Law En-forcement Training Material Deemed ‘Offensive’ to Muslims.’’ Who was complaining? Well, the Council on American-Islamic Rela-tions, the Islamic Society of North America, and they just happened to have known contacts who were named as coconspirators supporting terrorism in the Holy Land Foundation prosecu-tion. What did Mueller’s FBI do under Mueller’s specific direction? They cre-ated an outreach program. They called them their community outreach part-ner for these people who judges said: No. There is plenty of evidence to show that these people have ties supporting terrorism. No. We are not going to eliminate their names. The Dallas Federal Court said that; the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans said that. It didn’t make it to the Supreme Court, but two courts said: Yeah, there is plenty of evidence to see there are plenty of ties here, evidence of their ties to known terrorists. So it wasn’t until 2008, after years of having this evidence, that Director Mueller sent kind of an apologetic let-ter to CAIR, Council on American-Is-lamic Relations, saying: You know, we better suspend our community partner-ship for a while. It is just unbelievable, but it was the political correctness during the Obama administration that has gotten people killed, because they purged our train-ing material. And God bless Ken Jen-sen, FBI agent. He had prepared the 700-page training materials that Mueller ordered destroyed. Somebody needed to study that ma-terial before they went out and talked to Tsarnaev. If they had, they would have recognized this guy has probably radicalized, and we better be on the alert. They could have saved lives at the Boston Marathon if Mueller had not prevented them from knowing how to do their job. And he is special coun-sel. By the way, Madam Speaker, the former Director of the FBI who blinded the FBI of their ability to see terror-ists, why do we think he came out with the indictments exactly when he did? Well, I can tell you why, because he is as easy to read as anybody in the world. He came out with those indict-ments when he did because he had peo-ple starting to call for his resignation, starting to demand that he be removed, demanding that he recuse himself. Even The Wall Street Journal, that has been very sympathetic, they pointed out it was time for him to go. What did he do? He immediately comes out with indictments to show: No, no, no. You can’t demand that I go. I am too rel-evant. You look at those indictments, and I am for punishing anybody who has committed a crime, but there was no need for a special counsel to come up with what he did. The FBI could have done that. The Department of Justice could have done that. We didn’t need Mueller and 20 lawyers, all of these Hil-lary Clinton sycophants, in there to come up with this. The DOJ could have done this. It was just a ridiculous cou-ple of indictments to be spending all these millions of dollars for. We also know that same kind of con-duct occurred when Comey came to the Hill and testified there is no trace of evidence of collusion between Presi-dent Trump and the Russians. Well, Mueller had to be puckering up, because he knew: Uh-oh. Now there is testimony from the FBI Director that there is no basis for me to be special counsel and to have hired all these peo-ple. Wow. So the President could be in line to fire me, because now we have testimony from the FBI Director there is no basis for this investigation. Shut her down. So that night, they leak out he is in-vestigating President Trump for ob-struction of justice. Excuse me? We all know what that so-called evidence was. They will never, ever get a conviction, because it was not obstruction of jus-tice. Obstruction of justice is when you do what Comey and Loretta Lynch did to prevent a proper investigation, and you make an agreement with potential de-fendants that if they will just give you their laptops and let you look at them, you will destroy all that you find, and you will never use any of that informa-tion to prosecute them, and you give them immunity from prosecution. That is not what you do if you are going to prosecute a case. No. You get them in a bind and then you tell them: Here are the charges you are looking at unless you come clean and identify the person above you with whom you were working and what they did. Then you work up the chain to the big fish, which is how organized crimi-nal organizations have been prosecuted over the years. It would work in this case, but Director Comey was so busy figuring out how to explain how Hil-lary Clinton should not be prosecuted, though the evidence was basically for a slam dunk case of conviction, that he overlooked properly pursuing the case. We don’t need Director Mueller. We need him gone, and we need a special prosecutor to get into this, clearly, since Jeff Sessions recused himself on anything involving Hillary Clinton and Russia. And we can’t have Rod Rosen-stein, for heaven’s sake, now that we know that he and Mueller should not be involved in this special counsel situ-ation, because they both were engaged in the coverup of the initial Russian in-vestigation that revealed Russia was trying to corner the market on ura-nium, and they had to seal that, be-cause if they hadn’t sealed that and covered up that evidence and that in-vestigation, then Hillary Clinton would not have been able to hit the Russian megamillions lottery by authorizing the sale of uranium to Uranium One that ends up in Russian hands. Bill Clinton wouldn’t have gotten $500,000. He didn’t hit the megamillions, except for the 145 or so that went into the Clinton Foundation. Mueller cannot possibly investigate this. He is in it up to his eyeballs, and so is Rosenstein. They both ought to do the decent thing. I know it is not char-acteristic, but they ought to do the de-cent thing and resign and let somebody that is not completely submerged in the original coverup investigate this whole matter. Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-ance of my time.

COMMEMORATING NATIONAL ADOPTION DAY 
HON. K. MICHAEL CONAWAY 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 3, 2017 Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the National Adoption Day cele-bration that is taking place today in Odessa. Throughout the day, local courts in Ector County will open their doors and finalize the adoption process for families in the commu-nity. It is fitting that National Adoption Awareness Month occurs in the month of November, a time of family and Thanksgiving. During this time of the year, we reflect on what we are most thankful for in our lives, such as our fam-ilies. Each of our families provide us with un-conditional love, help shape our character, provide a lifetime of precious memories and motivate us through challenging times. Unfortunately, not everyone is afforded this opportunity in life. Thankfully, God has blessed our world with selfless individuals who open their hearts and homes to these children. Many of these children have various medical, developmental, and emotional needs that re-quires special nurturing from devoted parents and families. These special individuals who elect to take on full responsibility for their care, upbringing, and overall well-being provide an important service not only to these children, but also to our communities and country. I am particularly gratified to recognize these new families because I am adopted myself. My father adopted my little brother, sister, and me, so seeing other children who have the benefit of a loving family warms my heart. I want to thank CASA of the Permian Basin and the other organizations across the nation who help make National Adoption Day pos-sible. I also want to thank the dedicated indi-viduals who make a powerful difference in the lives of children through adoption.

LEGISLATION TO COMPEL THE RE-LEASE OF ALL JFK ASSASSINA-TION DOCUMENTS 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 3, 2017 Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the legislation I introduced today that would require President Trump to immediately meet his obligation to release all documents that can and should be released pertaining to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Despite the 1992 passage of a Congres-sionally-mandated October 26, 2017 deadline requiring the President of the United States make a determination about what documents can and should be released to the public re-garding President John F. Kennedy’s assas-sination, the current President failed to com-ply. The President’s failure to execute this re-quirement before the established deadline raises long-held concerns that the U.S. gov-ernment continues to withhold critical informa-tion about the former President’s assassina-tion. As a result, it is now up to Congress to en-force this deadline and deliver to the American public the certainty it deserves. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to exert the authority of this body’s intent when it passed the 1992 President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act and enact this important measure to enforce the required release of all appropriate docu-ments concerning the assassination of the late, and Honorable, President John F. Ken-nedy. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE 80TH BIRTHDAY OF CAROL JACKMAN 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 3, 2017 Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Carol Jackman, who turns 80 years young on December 4th. Carol’s dedication to our veterans stretches back to her childhood. Growing up on army bases, she developed a keen awareness of the important work our servicemembers do every single day. Not only is she the daughter of a U.S. veteran, but she is the sister, wife, mother, grandmother, sister-in-law, and aunt of U.S. veterans. Volunteerism has been an important theme in Carol’s life. For over 50 years, Carol has been a proud member of the American Legion Auxiliary. She has served as unit president, district director, state president, and the chair of many different programs. During the 1970s Carol worked to ensure no veteran was forgot-ten. She created and delivered homemade Easter baskets for sick and homebound vet-erans. Carol has also spent decades volun-teering at the West Roxbury and Brockton VA hospitals. Honoring veterans is her passion. To this day she plants flowers in the Highland Ceme-tery, a tradition she has kept up longer than she can remember. She also serves on the Memorial Day committee in Dover, working to ensure each year’s celebration properly hon-ors our servicemembers. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor Carol Jackman on this joyous occasion of her 80th birthday. I ask that my colleagues join me in wishing her many more years of health and happiness. COMMEMORATING THE HONOR-ABLE LYNN C. WOOLSEY ON HER 80TH BIRTHDAY HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 3, 2017 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate former United States Representative Lynn C. Woolsey on her 80th Birthday. She represented Califor-nia’s 6th congressional district, including Marin County and most of Sonoma County from 1993 to 2013. Lynn was born in Seattle, Washington on November 3, 1937. A graduate of Lincoln High School, she attended the University of Wash-ington from 1955 to 1957. Lynn received her Bachelor of Science degree in 1980. As a working single mother in Northern Cali-fornia, Lynn spent several years receiving public assistance to help make ends meet. During her 20-year career in the House of Representatives, she focused on issues facing children and families. She describes herself as the ‘‘first former welfare mom to serve in Con-gress.’’ Prior to entering public service, Lynn opened her own human resources consulting and employment agency, Woolsey Personnel Service, and taught at the College of Marin and the Dominican University of California. Lynn won her first election in 1984, when she ran for a city council seat in Petaluma. She served on the Petaluma City Council until 1992, her last year as Vice Mayor. The people of Sonoma and Marin Counties elected Lynn to Congress in 1992 and continued to elect her to eight more terms. In Congress, Lynn served as a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Chair of the Committee on Education and Labor’s Workforce Protections Subcommittee and as a senior member of the House Committee on Science and Technology. Lynn had many proud moments in federal public service. She secured federal funds for her district for a vari-ety of projects, including funds for the Petaluma River flood control project and for the seismic retrofit of the Golden Gate Bridge. She voted against authorizing the invasion of Iraq and consistently voted to suspend funding for the wars. She was one of Congress’ fore-most advocates on education issues, offering legislation to expand school breakfast pro-grams, expand childcare programs and en-courage young girls to study science and math. Her measure to provide job-protected leave for family members of injured soldiers was incorporated into the FY 2008 defense authorization bill. Lynn’s former colleagues, staff and constituents admire her immeas-urably and continue to benefit from her dedi-cated years of service. Mr. Speaker, former United States Rep-resentative Lynn C. Woolsey served her con-stituents diligently for ten consecutive terms. Her career is an excellent model of principled and dedicated leadership for members of this

IN RECOGNITION OF THE REV. DR. THOMAS L. WALKER 
HON. G. K. BUTTERFIELD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 3, 2017 Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise today to congratulate my constituent and friend, Rev. Dr. Thomas L. Walker, for 50 faithful years in ministry, and 47 years as pastor of Ebenezer Missionary Bap-tist Church. Dr. Walker, a native of Edgecombe County, North Carolina, was called to the ministry in 1970. At the age of 22, he and his wife Joyce, and their two children, Timothy and Teresa, began a ministry that would inspire and uplift the faithful for decades. Today, under his lead-ership, the church’s community outreach in-cludes TV and radio ministries, a daycare cen-ter, a tutorial program, and ministerial trainings. The church also has a non-profit corporation called the EBC ‘‘ATOM’’ Project, Inc., whose objective is to improve the quality of life for low and middle-income citizens. Dr. Walker has committed his life to serving both his com-munity and fellow man. One of Pastor Walk-er’s many talents is his success as a gospel recording artist. Through song, his messages and voice have uplifted and inspired countless individuals. His signature, ‘‘One Day at a Time,’’ continues to inspire hearts across the nation. In 1996, Dr. Walker received troubling news when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Yet, he would not sit idly by or be sidelined. His perseverance led him to write, ‘‘Brother to Brother—You Don’t Have to Die of Prostate Cancer.’’ A thoughtful and informative book, Dr. Walker presents an honest account of his challenges and frustrations, with the goal of empowering men and their families. In April of 2014, First Lady Joyce Walker, having battled sickness for many years, was called home to be with the Lord. Dr. Walker remained stead-fast and continues to stand as a pillar of strength, persistence, and a living testament of the Gospel. Mr. Speaker, I celebrate this great North Carolinian and ask that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in expressing sincere appreciation for Dr. Walker’s fortitude, faithfulness, and servant leadership on this historic milestone.

RECOGNIZING BRIG. GEN. WILLIAM ‘‘ROBBIE’’ ROBERTSON ON HIS PROMOTION IN THE ILLINOIS AIR NATIONAL GUARD 
HON. DARIN LaHOOD 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 3, 2017 Mr. L
AHOOD. Mr. Speaker, today, I would like to recognize Brig. Gen. William ‘‘Robbie’’ Robertson on his promotion in rank and to Chief of Staff of the Illinois Air National Guard. In 1983, Brig. Gen. Robertson became an officer in the 182nd Airlift Wing of the Illinois Air National Guard. Over his years of service, Brig. Gen. Robertson defended our nation in Operations Desert Shield, Desert Storm, Southern Watch, Joint Forge, Enduring Free-dom and Iraqi Freedom. As a command pilot, he has flown over 4,800 hours in various air-craft. Brig. Gen. Robertson’s leadership was critical to the conversion of the unit from the OA–37 Dragonfly to F–16 Fighting Falcon and to the C–130 Hercules, which equipped our Armed forces with tools they need to combat our nation’s enemies. In 2004, Brig. Gen. Robertson took over command of the 182nd Airlift Wing. Under his command, the 182nd Airlift Wing maintained the highest mission capability rates for ten of the past eleven years for all C–130 units. As commander, he is responsible for maintaining the combat readiness of eight C–130 aircraft and over 1,200 Illinois Air National Guards-men. The 182nd Airlift Wing received the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award five times dur-ing his tenure. Brig. Gen. Robertson has committed his life to serving our nation. I am grateful for his leadership and sacrifice in the Illinois Air Na-tional Guard. This country is blessed to have servicemen like William Robertson and I ex-tend my sincere congratulations to him on his promotion to Brigadier General. f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF LOUIS PAPIA 
HON. TED LIEU 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 3, 2017 Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the life of Louis Papia, 92, of Agoura Hills, California, a constituent of mine who was laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery on Monday, October 30, 2017. Mr. Papia was a decorated World War II veteran who fought in the D–Day invasion with the 1st Batallion, 314th Regiment, 79th Infantry Divi-sion. He was a recipient of the Bronze Star and eight other citations, including the Good Conduct Medal, the Presidential Unit Emblem, the American Campaign Medal, the European- African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, the World War II Victory Medal, the Army of Occu-pation Medal with German Clasp, the Combat Infantryman Badge and the Honorable Service Lapel Button for WWII. Mr. Papia was also a recipient of the French Jubilee Medal, for his service at Utah Beach during the Invasion. Mr. Papia received his Bronze Star when helping an Army medic save the life of a fellow soldier while under heavy fire. Mr. Papia landed at Utah Beach with the 79th, and took part in the Battle of Cherbourg. His initial mission was to battle his way south-west, across the Cherbourg Peninsula. One of the critical missions was to capture the port city so the Army Corp of Engineers could quickly erect a working port big enough to ac-commodate large U.S. supply ships. The 79th fought in Normandy, Northern France, Rhine-land, Ardennes-Alsace and in Central Europe, including Germany. Mr. Papia was under the command of Colonel Olin E. Teague, who later became the 16-term Congressman from Texas’s 6th Congressional District. After serv-ing his country abroad in Germany, and as the war in Europe was drawing to a close, Mr. Papia was shipped back to the U.S. where he began to prepare to do his part in Operation Downfall, the planned U.S. invasion of Japan. Louis Papia is survived by his wife of 65 years, Kay Papia, of Agoura Hills, California, and four sons: Louie, Russell, Mark, and Todd. Mark and Melissa Papia reside in Calabasas, California, with two of Papia’s five grandchildren. Mr. Papia will be remembered for his self-less service to our country, and we are forever grateful to him. f

HONORING THE 250TH ANNIVER-SARY OF THE CLAVERACK RE-FORMED DUTCH CHURCH 
HON. JOHN J. FASO 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 3, 2017 Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, today I am honored to recognize the 250th anniversary of the Re-formed Dutch Church in Claverack. Reverend John Gabriel Gebhard dedicated this historic sanctuary on November 8, 1767, adorning the church with the text, ‘‘Stand in the gate of the Lord’s House, and proclaim there His Word . . . enter in at these gates to worship the Lord.’’ Reverend Gebhard headed the church for the next fifty years until his death, laying the foundation for what would be two more centuries of continued worship and community in central Columbia County. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, Claverack’s Reformed Dutch Church is a historic treasure. During the Revolutionary War, this building served as a refuge for sol-diers and officers. Surrounding the church is the Claverack Cemetery, where Claverack residents connect to the community’s earliest members. The church continues to serve as a center for religious, educational, and community ac-tivities. On November 5, 2017, Claverack will come together to celebrate this incredible milestone. I thank Pastor Linda Miles, Vice President and Senior Elder Louise Bliss, Sen-ior Deacon Donna Lynk Campion, and all members of the local Reformed Dutch Church for their contributions to this special commu-nity. I am proud to honor the Reformed Dutch Church in Claverack for fostering 250 years of prayer and kinship.

COMMEMORATING LISA STONE FOR RECEIVING THE 2017 STATE JOURNAL REGISTER FIRST CIT-IZEN AWARD 
HON. DARIN LaHOOD 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 3, 2017 Mr. L
AHOOD. Mr. Speaker, today, I would like to honor Lisa Stone of Springfield, Illinois for receiving the 2017 State Journal Register First Citizen Award. Since 1963, the State Journal Register has been awarding the First Citizen award to a resident who goes above and beyond their commitment to making Springfield a better place. For over four decades, Lisa has volun-teered countless hours and raised money for numerous organization in the Springfield com-munity. Lisa’s many contributions to the com-munity include: fundraising for the Sojourn House, a domestic violence shelter; fund-raising for the Jewish Federation; and helping Russian refugees resettle in America. Addi-tionally, Lisa served as an original board member of Habitat for Humanity of Sangamon County. Lisa’s commitment to the Springfield com-munity is unmatched. Her years of volun-teering and fundraising have made a true dif-ference in Springfield. I applaud her for her ef-forts to make our community a better place. I extend my sincere congratulations to Lisa Stone on receiving the State Journal Register First Citizen award, and I wish her much suc-cess as she continues to lead a life of service to the community.

DELAY MEDICAID DSH CUTS 
HON. JOSEPH CROWLEY 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 3, 2017 Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge Congress to delay the cuts to Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) pay-ments that went into effect on October 1, and to protect our nation’s safety net hospitals from financial ruin. Medicaid DSH hospitals serve a high pro-portion of Medicaid recipients as well as underinsured or completely uninsured Ameri-cans. These hospitals bear the risk of caring for the most vulnerable members of our dis-tricts because they recognize the inextricable value of healthy communities: when we are healthy together, we thrive together. It is our duty to return the favor to the hospitals that ensure our communities have a secure health care safety net. If Congress does not act soon to delay Medicaid DSH cuts, safety net hospitals across the country will face a twenty percent cut in federal funding. In my home district in Queens and the Bronx, Medicaid DSH hos-pitals stand to lose over $409 million over the next ten years. I cannot stand by as Congress throws our safety net hospitals into an eco-nomic upheaval. However, I also cannot stand by as Con-gress brings forth a proposal—the CHAM-PIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act (H.R. 3922)—to pay for a delay of Medicaid DSH cuts for two years by imposing steeper cuts on those same hospitals in future years, among other flaws. This legislation is an example of how this Republican-led Congress has championed partisan gridlock that threatens the vitality of our safety net hospitals. Within a package to delay Medicaid DSH cuts and extend federal funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and community health cen-ters, Republicans proposed several problem-atic offsets that would ultimately set our health care system back. For example, certain changes to Medicaid would inhibit access to pediatric providers, and cuts to the ACA’s Pre-vention and Public Health Fund would under-mine the value of preventive services deliv-ered at community health centers. Further-more, the package would lead to higher pre-miums for certain seniors receiving Medicare benefits and shorter grace periods for individ-uals who receive their health coverage through the individual market. In other words, this package would slash benefits and protec-tions for one group of beneficiaries to extend services for another. Democrats will not stand for any packages that would rob Peter to pay Paul. I cannot in good conscience vote for a pack-age that starts a food fight amongst different groups of beneficiaries. And I cannot in good conscience vote for a bill that would be so ir-responsible to the long-term financial viability of the hospitals that are a flagship for the most vulnerable constituents in my district. I urge my Republican colleagues to drop this partisan exercise and work with us on a compromise to extend these long-standing, successful, bipartisan federal health programs. The job of our nation’s safety net hospitals is much too important to bear the brunt of need-less political games. f 
HONORING NORTHEAST GEORGIA EFFORTS TO END DOMESTIC VIO-LENCE 
HON. DOUG COLLINS 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 3, 2017 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my northeast Georgia neighbors for their efforts in raising awareness surrounding domestic violence. Nearly 25 million Americans have been vic-tims of domestic violence at some point in their lives, and more than 65,000 Georgians have reported experiencing domestic violence. Recently, the community of Clarkesville held a vigil to remember local victims of domestic abuse. By rallying around each other, they demonstrated their commitment to helping neighbors who may be suffering in silence. Tricia Hise is one Clarkesville neighbor whose dedication to addressing this scourge head-on stands out. Hise, a local attorney, has invested countless hours in pro-bono litigation to amplify the voices of domestic abuse vic-tims. Through her work, Hise has inspired vic-tims to take a stand on behalf of themselves and their loved ones. My neighbors in Clarkesville serve as an en-couragement to us all. As we continue to op-pose and address domestic abuse, I encour-age everyone here today to find opportunities to work for the well-being of Americans who are impacted by domestic abuse.

He was a proud 50-year member of the Inter-national Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local Union 364, and a former member of the Ancient Free & Accepted Masons, Rockford Lodge No. 102.

HONORING THE MILITARY SERVICE OF LEONARD SWARTZ 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 3, 2017 Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to re-member WWII veteran, Leonard ‘‘Lenny’’ Swartz of Beaumont, TX who died peacefully in his own bed on October 30, 2017. Lenny was born on April 17, 1919 in Phila-delphia, Pennsylvania. In 1930, the Great De-pression forced the Swartz family to move to Atlantic City in hopes of a better living. After High School, Mr. Swartz moved back to Phila-delphia until December of 1941. When WWII began for the United States, Lenny felt the call to serve his country and immediately enlisted in the United States Army. After graduating Officer’s Candidate School in Ft. Jackson, South Carolina Lenny was next stationed at Camp Polk, in Deridder, Louisiana. While he

was stationed at Camp Polk, Lenny took a trip to Beaumont, TX on leave and met a woman named Marie ‘‘Mongie’’ Eisen. In March of 1943, the two entered into a marriage that would last over 74 years. Mongie died just ten weeks ago in August. The couple lived in Deridder until Lenny was sent to Ft. Ord Cali-fornia for training before he boarded a ship headed to fight in the Pacific. Lenny was a captain in the 536th Amphib-ious Tank Battalion that played an important role in the Battle of Leyte Gulf that began the invasion of the Philippine Islands. It was while fighting during the invasion of Okinawa that Lenny was wounded badly and received his battlefield recognition. When the war ended, Lenny left the military as a Major and returned with Mongie to Beaumont. After working for his father-in-law in the produce business, Lenny opened his own produce business. Lenny was very active in the American Le-gion, Jewish War Veterans and the Masons. He always set an example for his sons and community by working hard every day and being active at his synagogue. After retiring, Lenny worked in his flower gardens around his home and watched his favorite football team, the Dallas Cowboys. Mr. Swartz loved his family dearly and truly lived a life worth living. It is always an honor for me to recognize those American heroes who sacrificed so much defending and preserving our freedom in World War II. This truly was the greatest generation. We thank Mr. Swartz—as well as his entire family—for their bravery and sac-rifice to our great nation.

CONGRATULATING HESLER CARDENAS 
HON. DOUG COLLINS 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 3, 2017 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Hesler Cardenas, a visually impaired senior at Gainesville High School who recently placed second in a na-tionwide art competition. Hesler submitted a painting titled ‘‘Blossom Petal’’ to the 2017 American Printing House for Blind Insights Art Competition. Out of near-ly 400 entries, Hesler’s painting surpassed all but one and earned a spot on the walls of the American Printing House in Kentucky. Hesler stands out among his peers by pur-suing his goals despite his visual limitations. Mr. Speaker, Hesler’s success reminds us that with tenacity, hard work and determination often take us closer to our dreams than we could imagine. As Hesler continues to inspire his fellow northeast Georgians, I look forward to seeing where his talent will take him next. CONGRATULATIONS TO THE RESI-DENTS OF THE STATE OF IDAHO WHO HAVE COMPLETED THE IDAHO STEP CHALLENGE TO IM-PROVE THEIR HEALTH AND WELLNESS BY MEASURING THEIR DAILY STEP COUNT HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON 
OF IDAHO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 3, 2017 Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the achievements of several con-stituents in my district who have taken it upon themselves to improve their health and wellness by incorporating exercise and a bal-anced diet into their daily routine. Last year, my staff and I created the Idaho STEP Challenge. The goal of the challenge was to encourage residents from across the state of Idaho to get fit and healthy by walking virtually across the United States, while col-lecting data on a wearable activity tracker and pedometer. Beginning on June 1, 2016, a group of more than 300 residents and several workplace teams set out on the virtual walk across the United States starting at the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington D.C. and arriv-ing at the Idaho Statehouse in Boise, Idaho more than a year later. The nearly 3,000 mile route took partici-pants through 18 iconic American cities, na-tional parks, and spacious heartlands. The event was documented on social media under the #hikewithMike hashtag, and through reg-ular email newsletters sent to participants. Residents also shared their encouraging weight loss and fitness stories online, and uploaded their mileage counts to a special section of my website. The event was devised to be a non-partisan, non-political interactive event open to all Idaho residents. The Idaho STEP Challenge officially con-cluded on October 23, 2017. Those who par-ticipated demonstrated their commitment to healthy living and a spirited stand for fitness within our state. I would like to acknowledge the following participants for joining me on the virtual road to Boise and I thank them for pro-moting healthy lifestyles in our community. Nick Abshire, Jeff Daniels, Kathy Parks, Lisa Lane, Susan Littlefield, Miranda Collins, Jeannette Barnes, Jessica Padour, Suelynn Williams, Pat Mills, Kellie Gough, Carolyn Simpson, Maryl Fisher, Penny Handley, Fred Hughes, Carolee McKenzie, Patrick Kole, Dana Flatter, Miranda Smith Collins, Bart & Julie Harwood, Gerald Simpson, Wendy Jaquet, Celia R. Gould, Sheila Woods, Gina Martin, Ray Simpson, Jan Simpson Rhoades, Dennis & Sheila Conley, Toni Orth, Ron Fish-er, Connie Pond, Angela Degni, Sheila Ames, Elizabeth Criner, Elain M. & James Long, Glen Tait, Cheryl Hardy, Shelby C. Sommer, Judy Slayton. Once again, thanks to all the participants in the Idaho STEP Challenge and I congratulate them on their commitment to a better Idaho. ETHIOPIA RESOLUTION HON. MIKE COFFMAN 
OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, November 3, 2017 Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to the Government of Ethiopia’s continued pattern of repression and violence against its own people, and I urge the House of Representatives to vote on House Resolu-tion 128, the ‘‘Supporting Respect for Human Rights and Encouraging Inclusive Governance in Ethiopia Resolution.’’ This resolution calls on the Government of Ethiopia to take clear, decisive, steps toward becoming more inclu-sive, more democratic, and more respectful of the basic human rights of its own people. This resolution has overwhelming bipartisan support with more than 70 cosponsors, and it passed out of the House Foreign Affairs Com-mittee unanimously on July 27. The ongoing human rights crisis in Ethiopia is extremely troubling to me, to the resolution’s other co-sponsors, the many Americans of Ethiopian heritage, and to numerous human rights groups. I firmly believe that the passage of this resolution will encourage the Ethiopian government to end its practice of violence and repression and provide a strong basis of an in-clusive government. Specifically, this resolution condemns: the excessive use of force by Ethiopian security forces; the killing of peaceful protestors; the arrest and detention of journalists, students, activists, and political leaders, and; the Ethio-pian government’s abuse of the Anti-Terrorism Proclamation to stifle political and civil dissent. The resolution does not simply highlight the Ethiopian government’s increasingly authori-tarian acts, but it also encourages the United States to support efforts to improve democ-racy and governance in Ethiopia. I believe that the United States can take actions that will positively influence the Ethiopian government and use our existing institutions to further de-mocracy and effective governance in Ethiopia. Critically, the resolution calls on the Ethiopian government to admit UN human rights observ-ers so they can conduct an independent and thorough examination of the current state of human rights in Ethiopia. On March 9 of this year, the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Orga-nizations, held a hearing to discuss specific steps the United States can take to bring about positive changes for the Ethiopian gov-ernment and their people. Among those who testified was Deacon Yoseph Tafari, of the St. Mary’s Ethiopian Orthodox Church located in Aurora, Colorado. Deacon Yoseph was raised in Ethiopia and has experienced the daily struggles too many Ethiopians have faced liv-ing in abject poverty under an oppressive gov-ernment. Deacon Yoseph fled from Ethiopia in 1976, and came to the United States as a refugee. He and many of the members of the Ethiopian community in my Congressional district in Col-orado—including the Oromo and Amharas— have worked diligently to organize and assist those still suffering from repression in their home country. Oromo Community President of Colorado, Jamal Said, has also shared his concerns with me, and both of these gentlemen have no mo-tives other than a concern about the safety

and state of democracy in Ethiopia. I appre-ciate their leadership in the community as they continue to fight for democracy in their home-land. Unfortunately, stories like this are not un-common in my district and I am disappointed that the House has not yet scheduled a floor vote on House Resolution 128. I note that on two prior occasions a vote was tentatively scheduled. In both of these instances it is my understanding that the vote was postponed due to pressure from the Ethiopian govern-ment who continues to make promises to curb human rights abuses against their own people but fail to deliver. Additionally, it has been brought to my attention that the Ethiopian Government has threatened to cut off security cooperation with the United States should we proceed with House Resolution 128. I am particularly dismayed that rather than solving their problems and moving towards be-coming a more democratic country, the Ethio-pian government has chosen instead to hire a D.C. lobbying firm, at a cost of $150,000 a month, to ‘‘work with the [Ethiopian Govern-ment] to develop and execute a public affairs plan to enhance the dialogue and relationships with policymakers, media, opinion leaders and business leaders . . .’’ in addition to ‘‘meet-ings with members of Congress, their staffs, and executive branch officials.’’ The issue the Ethiopian government needs to address is the repression of democracy and its citizens in Ethiopia. The solution to what-ever negative perception it has in the halls of the U.S. Congress is not a public affairs one, but rather what concrete steps are being taken against democracy in Ethiopia. That is why I remain committed to working with House lead-ership to have a vote scheduled on House Resolution 128. Mr. Speaker, I encourage leadership to schedule a vote and I call on my colleagues to vote in favor and pass House Resolution 128. I will continue working with local Ethio-pian community leaders in Colorado and across the country to raise awareness of the human rights abuses occurring in Ethiopia and to bring relief from oppression to the Ethiopian people.
