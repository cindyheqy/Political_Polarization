CELEBRATING THE MOREAU COMMUNITY CENTER 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 2, 2018 Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize the Moreau Community Center for its outstanding service to New York’s 21st District. Founded in 1977, the Moreau Community Center in South Glens Falls serves the resi-dents of Saratoga, Warren, and Washington Counties. The Center is one of the largest human service agencies in the area, and seeks to meet the multigenerational needs of the community in a compassionate and inclu-sive environment. To fulfill this mission, the Center offers a wide variety of quality programs, activities, vol-unteer opportunities, and services which sup-port youth, seniors, and the community at large. The Center runs an emergency food pantry that serves more than 80 families each month, and operates a clothing thrift store run by volunteers. I applaud the good work of the Moreau Community Center, particularly in light of the fact that April is National Volunteer Month. On behalf of New York’s 21st District, I want to thank the Moreau Community Center for its dedication to bringing our community together. We commend its incredible service, and look forward to its future endeavors.

HONORING GARY TRACHTEN 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 2, 2018 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor an individual who has selflessly given to the Westchester Jewish Council community for many years, Gary Trachten. Deeply inspired by his late parents ‘‘Moishe’’ and Shirley Trachten, Gary heard the call to community service. He has been on the Board of WJC for nine years—four years as an offi-cer on its Executive Committee, and for the past six years as the ever-enthusiastic Event Chair for the annual Westchester Jewish Music and Arts Festival. A native of New Haven Connecticut, Gary graduated from Boston University and Emory University School of Law. Gary also serves on the Board of Hillels of Westchester, is a past president of the Pelham Jewish Center, and serves on the Advisory Board of Project T.E.N., International Israel & Diaspora ‘‘Jewish peace Corp,’’ under the auspices of the Jew-ish Agency. Gary is also a founding partner of Kudman Trachten Aloe LLP, a mainly com-mercial law film where he focuses on employ-ment law. Outside of work and community service, Gary’s great passion is family. He and his wife, Evelyn, live in New Rochelle where they raise two children, Jseof and Sofie. As Con-gressman who represents New Rochelle, I am proud to call the Trachtens my constituents. This year WJC is honoring Gary at their 42nd Anniversary Gala for all his fine work on behalf of the community. They have made an excellent choice of an honoree. Congratula-tions to Gary on this wonderful occasion. f 
HONORING KATHY AND PETE POTOCKI 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, April 2, 2018 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor pillars of Pelham community, Kathy and Pete Potocki, who this year are celebrating the 25th Anniversary of the organization they founded, The Danny Fund, at the organiza-tion’s annual 2018 Valentines Ball. The Potocki’s were home in Pelham on De-cember 10, 1992 when their 4-1/2 year-old son, Danny, was diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia. A blood and donation drive was organized with the help of the Pelham Civics and other organizations to help Danny in his fight, and over 100 people donated blood and platelets. Danny successfully fought the dis-ease and today lives a full life with a daughter in 2nd Grade in Pelham. The Pelham commu-nity’s response to help Danny was tremen-dous, and laid the groundwork for what was to come. After Danny returned home and began kin-dergarten at Colonial School, it was learned that other Pelham children were ill and their families needed help. So Kathy and Pete, in association with the Knights of Columbus, started to organize The Danny Fund, a 100 percent volunteer organization that provides fi-nancial, emotional, and advocacy support for the families of children suffering from a cata-strophic illness or injury. The Danny Fund adopts a family for the long haul and provides ongoing support as it is needed, for as long as it’s needed. The Danny Fund has done some amazing work, and this year the organization will be honoring Kathy and Pete at the Valentine’s Ball for their incredible dedication and work. I too would like to honor and congratulate them on this well-deserved recognition, and thank them for all of their contributions to our com-munity.
