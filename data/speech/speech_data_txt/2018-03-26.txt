OUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , C
OMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET , Washington, DC, March 26, 2018. Mr. Speaker, I hereby submit for printing in the Congressional Record revisions to the aggregates and allocations set forth in H. Con. Res. 71, the Fiscal Year 2018 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget, and the State-ment of Committee Allocations for Fiscal Year 2018 published in the Congressional Record on November 2, 2017. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–123), enacted on February 9, 2018, amended the statutory discretionary spend-ing limits for fiscal year 2018 base discre-tionary programs in the amount of $629 bil-lion for defense programs and $579 billion for

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH3048 March 26, 2018 
non-defense programs. Section 5301 of H. Con. Res. 71 permits the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget to adjust the ap-plicable levels and committee allocations in the budget resolution and the Statement of Committee Allocations published in the Con-gressional Record on November 2, 2017, for enacted legislation that amends the statu-tory discretionary spending limits under sec-tion 251(c) of the Balanced Budget and Emer-gency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA). For fiscal year 2018, aggregate levels of budg-et authority and outlays, the allocation to the Committee on Appropriations, and the allocation for Overseas Contingency Oper-ations/Global War on Terrorism, included in the Statement of Committee Allocations published in the Congressional Record on No-vember 2, 2017, are revised. These revisions are provided for the House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 1625, the Con-solidated Appropriations Act, 2018. Associ-ated tables are attached. Section 251(b) of BBEDCA allows for ad-justments to the statutory discretionary spending limits for certain purposes includ-ing program integrity initiatives and dis-aster relief. The House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 1625, the Consoli-dated Appropriations Act, 2018, contains $1.896 billion in budget authority for pro-gram integrity initiatives and $7.366 billion in budget authority for disaster relief, both of which are within the allowable limits for their respective purposes as established under section 251(b)(2)(B) and (C) of BBEDCA. Accordingly, I am submitting an adjustment to H. Con. Res. 71 and the State-ment of Committee Allocations published in the Congressional Record on November 2, 2017, pursuant to section 314(a) of the Con-gressional Budget Act of 1974, to accommo-date funding for both program integrity ini-tiatives and disaster relief contained in the House Amendment to the Senate Amend-ment to H.R. 1625, the Consolidated Appro-priations Act, 2018. After making these ad-justments, the House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 1625, the Consoli-dated Appropriations Act, 2018, is within the fiscal year 2018 statutory discretionary spending limits under section 251(c) of BBEDCA. Associated tables are attached. These revisions represent an adjustment for purposes of enforcing sections 302 and 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. For the purposes of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, these revised aggregates and al-locations are to be considered as aggregates and allocations included in the concurrent resolution on the budget and the Statement of Committee Allocations published in the Congressional Record on November 2, 2017, as adjusted. Sincerely, S
TEVE WOMACK , Chairman.

TRIBUTE TO MORTON ‘‘MORT’’ KIMMEL 
HON. LISA BLUNT ROCHESTER 
OF DELAWARE  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 26, 2018 Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Morton Kimmel, or Mort to those who knew him. As a lifelong Delawarean, Mort was a great husband, fa-ther, grandfather, lawyer and philanthropist. He founded several non-profits and charities and devoted his life to serving others through-out Delaware. After graduating from law school, he began practicing in the Wilmington area, eventually becoming a founding partner of Kimmel, Car-ter, Roman, Peltz and O’Neill PA. An attorney by trade, Mort tried more than 100 cases while simultaneously working on the charities that were the center of his life. After Mort’s son, Larry Kimmel, participated in the 1997 Blue-Gold Senior All-Star Games, Mort saw an opportunity to enhance the an-nual event as a fundraiser for local non-profits and charities to rally community support around the games. Today, because of Mort’s work, the Blue-Gold Games are now played at the University of Delaware’s Bob Carpenter Center and have become a statewide affair at-tracting people from all over. Proceeds from the game directly benefit Best Buddies Dela-ware, a non-profit providing aid to those with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Mort’s love of Delaware and philanthropic efforts extended beyond the Blue-Gold Games. He founded the First State Police Foundation, a non-profit organization that funds public safety initiatives with private sec-tor donations. He also led the Kimmel-Spiller Charitable Foundation and served on the board of directors for the Ronald McDonald House and Cancer Care Connection. In rec-ognition of his generous spirit and life of serv-ice to Delaware, Mort was awarded the Order of the First State by then-Governor Jack Markell in 2017. Fittingly, he was inducted into the Delaware Basketball Hall of Fame earlier this Year. It is with heavy hearts that we grieve the loss of our dear friend. Mort’s selflessness touched the lives of Delawareans from all backgrounds, including the most vulnerable citizens, and I want to express my gratitude for the opportunities, services and care he provided to so many. It has been one of the greatest pleasures of my life to call Mort my friend, and there is no doubt in my mind that Mort Kimmel’s impact will be felt in Delaware for decades to come. SEVENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SYRIAN CIVIL WAR HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 26, 2018 Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, we recently marked the passage of seven years since peaceful protests against the ineffective, cruel, and undemocratic regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad were escalated by President Assad into a brutal civil war. It has cost hun-dreds of thousands of lives, displaced 6.1 mil-lion people inside Syria, caused another 5.4 million Syrians to flee to nearby countries, and left nearly 3 million people in besieged areas. Assad has gassed his own people, and dropped barrel bombs on his own cities. Assad’s actions set the conditions for ISIS to metastasize into Syria, prosper, and spread terror and chaos in the region. He and his closest friends on the international stage, President Putin of Russia and the leadership of Iran, demonstrate no regard for the safety or wellbeing of the Syrian people. The continuation of this war into its eighth year is a tragedy. The United States is right to stand in opposition to Assad’s brutality and against the countless non-state groups that have seized on the chaos to pursue their own agendas, many of which are apocalyptic and dangerous to our national security. Consistent with our national interest, we must do everything in our power to bring this conflict to a halt and prevent Syria, its ungoverned spaces, and the refugee camps on the territory of Syria’s neighbors from be-coming a breeding ground for the next genera-tion of radical terrorists. This effort requires continued efforts by the military and our intel-ligence services, but also demands muscular diplomacy to find a lasting political solution and robust foreign aid to provide a generation of Syrians with opportunities other than picking up a rifle. Until a lasting solution is found I believe our country needs to do so much more to relieve the suffering of those injured and displaced. We are an immigrant nation of 330 million, and yet from Fiscal Year 2011 to the end of February this year, we permitted less than 22,000 refugees from Syria to enter the United States. This is a failure to act compas-sionately, and I fear that history will judge America harshly for its tepid response to the torment and suffering of untold souls. I encourage my colleagues and the Admin-istration to not lose sight of the ongoing vio-lence perpetrated by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his allies and to redouble our ef-forts to bring this horrific humanitarian crisis to a close. HONORING CHARLIE RICHARD AND ORA LEE BENSON HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 26, 2018 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to honor Mr. and Mrs. Charlie Richard and Ora Lee Benson for their 73rd year of marriage. Mr. Charlie was the only child born to the late Beatrice Anderson-Benson and the late Pinkney ‘‘Bill’’ Benson, Sr. on February 21, 1925. His mother died after giving birth to him. His father later married the late Martha Ross- Benson and had four children from this union. Pinkney ‘‘Nick’’ Benson II, Robert ‘‘Bob’’ Ben-son, Mayzle Dean Benson who are all de-ceased, and his youngest sister, Gloria Ben-son-Remus, who lives in Lexington, MS. Charlie’s father and grandfather were both farmers and he followed in their footsteps. He was also a self-taught carpenter, worked at a coal factory and retired from Fleetwood Homes both in Lexington, MS. On September 30, 1944 Charlie married his sweetheart, Ora Lee White. She is the third child of Lou Etta Thurmond-White and Cleve-land White. She worked by her husband’s side as a farmer and later worked many years as a cook at Lexington Elementary School until she retired. There were twelve children born from this union: Frank McKinley Benson, Beatrice Ben-son-McKennie, Mayzle Jean Benson-LeSure, Howard Benson, Sylvester P. Benson, Maxcine Benson-Cobbins, William Carl Ben-son (deceased), Billie A. Benson-Ramsey, Jimmie Louis and Mildred Louise Benson are twins (Mildred is deceased), Leon Benson and Laverne Benson. They have two god sons, Calvin Friar and Dennis Moore, also one god daughter, Diana Randle. There are 30 grandchildren, 41 great grandchildren, and 4 great, great grand-children and many nieces, nephews, relatives and friends. Mr. Charlie Richard served as a deacon until his health failed, and Mother Ora Benson served as a Mother on the Motherboard from the Guilding Light C.O.G.I.C. of Lexington MS. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing this beautiful couple that is celebrating their longevity of love and affection for 73 years of marriage.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE370 March 26, 2018 
Sacco, who passed away peacefully on Feb-ruary 25, 2018 at the age of 97. For the past 25 years Mr. Sacco was a resi-dent of Bayport New York and the loving hus-band of Patricia Sacco. Mr. Sacco was also an employee of Hewlett-Packard for over 40 years. During World War II, Mr. Sacco enlisted into the Army and after basic training was de-ployed to Northern Africa where his troop fought numerous battles. After serving his country with honor, Mr. Sacco returned home and joined the Patchogue NY VFW post, where he proudly marched in Memorial and Veterans Day pa-rades. During the Iraq War Mr. Sacco again showed his strong patriotism and commitment to his country by organizing his VFW post’s ef-forts of gathering and shipping supplies to our troops overseas. Those who knew Mr. Sacco have said he was a working man of great strength that never took life for granted. An avid runner who showed great commitment for health and exer-cise, including running marathons. He was a man that honored his country, his family and the company he worked for. A life well lived and a great example to his fellow citizens.

HONORING MR. BARRY SHRAGE 
HON. JOSEPH P. KENNEDY III 
OF MASSACHUSETTS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 26, 2018 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and commend Barry Shrage, the President of Combined Jewish Philanthropies of Greater Boston, who is stepping down after more than three decades of distinguished leadership. Barry has dedicated his life to the service of others. From his time as a social worker in Mid-Westchester, New York, to his current role in Boston, he has worked to improve lives every day. He has taken action and made an impact on thousands of people, both Jewish and non-Jewish, in the Greater Boston area, in this nation, in Israel, and around the globe. With everything he does, Barry dem-onstrates an unwavering commitment to the highest principles of Judaism, particularly tzedek (justice), torah (learning), and tikkun olam (the repair of the world). He has also upheld the deepest American values of liberty and justice for all. In the 1980s, he was instrumental in bringing Jewish people from the Soviet Union, where they were not allowed to practice their religion, to the United States. Just last year, he founded the Combined Jewish Philanthropies Legal Aid Fund for Immigrants, an interfaith effort to as-sist those who are trying to start new lives of hope in this nation. He has stood throughout his tenure as a steadfast partner to all those who strive in common purpose to create a more just and peaceful world. But, Mr. Speaker, it is not only his service that I celebrate today. Barry is a man of integ-rity and kindness whose abiding love for hu-manity is an example to us all. I offer him my sincere gratitude and best wishes for good health and continued success as he goes from strength to strength. HONORING TAYLOR CANDY COMPANY HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 26, 2018 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to honor a remarkable public servant, Walter and Ozie Taylor, who are well respected Jackson entrepreneurs, set the bar high years ago when crafting a business model that’s helped propel Taylor Candy to success in the Washington Addition commu-nity in Jackson. Mr. Taylor came from a family of entre-preneurs. His father operated several stores and Laundromats and several other relatives owned various businesses. Mr. Taylor got his feet wet in business by establishing his own route while operating his first truck as an inde-pendent distributor through his cousin’s whole-sale candy distributorship. This led to the Tay-lors obtaining an SBA loan and establishing Taylor Candy Company at 1519 Cox St., which was later moved to the present location next door at 1523 Cox St. During this time, Mrs. Taylor joined in operating the company full time, after a nine-year teaching career. Mr. Taylor, also a short tenured school teacher, said ‘‘I needed a dependable and trustworthy associate, if the business was to be success-ful and so I beckoned her from the classroom and the rest is history.’’ At the height of the business’ activity in the 1980’s, the company had many employees and a total of nine inde-pendent distributors. The Taylors now operate the business solely, with occasional assist-ance from part-time workers. In 1974, the Taylors received acclaim from a prestigious minority business organization that named them ‘‘The Most Improved Busi-ness of the Year.’’ Also in 1997, the business was featured as an outstanding small busi-ness in a local publication. The Taylors offered these words of wisdom to budding entrepreneurs: ‘‘You should have the right attitude toward your business pursuit. Don’t be afraid of failure. Failure gives you an opportunity to set a goal to understand what you have to do to improve. There are going to be downfalls. Let downfalls or failures be used as motivations for growth rather than reasons for giving up.’’ They said when they first started the com-pany, the School of Business at Jackson State University, the couple’s alma mater, provided counseling. Through the years, the Taylors have sup-ported community activity through giving to and participating in religious, social and edu-cational programs and projects. Fellowship of Christian Athletes has been a benefactor, as well as numerous neighborhood schools and churches. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Taylor Candy Company for their dedication to serving others.

HONORING WILLIAM ‘‘BILLY’’ LEO 
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 26, 2018 Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of William ‘‘Billy’’ Leo, a public servant, small business owner, and proud resident of La Joya, Texas, who passed away Saturday, March 17, 2018. From 1974 to 2011, Billy, known as ‘‘Mr. Democrat,’’ served his community in a number of capacities. He served as County Clerk for Hidalgo County, Mayor of the city of La Joya, School Board Trustee for La Joya lSD, and from 1988 through 1996, Billy served as a del-egate for the Democratic National Committee. During this time, Billy was also the proprietor of beloved local convenient store chain, Leo’s Food Mart. In 1960, Billy graduated from Texas A&I Kingsville with a degree in political science . . Shortly thereafter, he emerged as a political leader, following in his father, Leo J. Leo’s, footsteps. Both men served the people of Hi-dalgo County with great honor. He once said of La Joya and his life, ‘‘I worked hard and cared for my city. That’s all I want to be re-membered for. I was here and I think this is the best city there is.’’ Mr. Speaker, South Texas lost one of our greatest public servants, but his legacy will live on. It is a privilege to continue the fight William ‘‘Billy’’ Leo championed his entire life: making sure every voice in Hidalgo County, and South Texas, is heard. f 
HONORING SCOTT MEMORIAL FUNERAL HOME 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 26, 2018 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to honor Scott Memorial Fu-neral Home, a Yazoo City business striving to offer good services to families. Scott Memorial Funeral Home located at 1401 East Broadway in Yazoo City is locally owned by Benjamin D. Scott and has operated under a standard of excellence for their cus-tomers since 2010. Their mission statement is: ‘‘To provide funeral services that are dignified and caring, highly professional and dedicated to excellence in all details, with prices suited to each family’s circumstances.’’ Scott Memorial Funeral Home offers burial and cremation services, burial insurance, life insurance, limousine services, and also has a notary public. The business also offers a plan that meets any family’s individual needs, no matter the situation. Scott said his favorite part about the job is serving the families who entrust their funeral service needs to him. He makes sure that the families’ needs are carried out as profes-sionally as possible during the most difficult time of their lives. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Scott Memorial Funeral Home and its owners for their desire to make a dif-ference in the community.

unexpectedly on February 25, 2018. Dr. Li was a father and a husband, a lawyer and scholar, and he was a committed Christian who used his legal skills to defend the poor and oppressed in China. He was a true friend of freedom and a kindred spirit in the fight to protect religious freedom and other human rights in China. Though his work made him a frequent target of harassment and violence, until his death he remained passionately com-mitted to the fight for the rights of Chinese citi-zens under the law. Dr. Li was truly one of China’s best and brightest. He will be missed. Li Baiguang was born in Hunan province in 1968 and received his doctoral degree in law from Peking University in 1997. Motivated by his Christian faith, Dr. Li defended farmers, migrant workers, and those persecuted by the Chinese government because of their religious belief. In 2006, Dr. Li met with President George W. Bush in the Oval Office. In 2008, he received the Democracy Award from the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). Dr. Li was in Washington DC, just a few weeks before his death. He expressed con-cern about the Chinese government’s brutal crackdown on human rights lawyers and the possibility that new religious regulations would give the government an excuse to close all Protestant ‘‘house churches.’’ I share these concerns and find China’s deteriorating human rights situation deeply problematic. President Xi has presided over an extraordinary assault on the rule of law and civil society using re-pressive policies and new laws that threaten rights defenders in China and challenge both U.S. interests and U.S.-China cooperation and goodwill. Dr. Li also spoke that day about a savage beating he received in October at the hands of Zhejiang province police. He was taken to a forest and tortured and warned to end his de-fense of a group of farmers dispossessed of their land by the Chinese government. To his credit, he did not back down from this threat. He faced such dangers willingly and with a strong Christian faith. He fought daily for what was good and what was right and dreamed of a day when China would be more democratic and free. For his courage, he should be ad-mired as a true champion of liberty and the rule of law. Dr. Li is survived by his wife, Xu Hanmei, and their eight-year-old son Li Quingxin. I believe that someday China will be free. Someday, the people of China will be able to enjoy all of their God-given rights. And a na-tion of free Chinese men and women will honor Li Baiguang as a hero. He will be hon-ored along with all others like him who have sacrificed so much, and so long, for freedom.

HONORING SARAH KIMBROUGH HALL 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 26, 2018 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to honor a remarkable public servant, Evangelist Sarah Kimbrough Hall. The weekend of September 15, 2017 marked the 30th year ministry celebration for Evangelist Sarah Kimbrough Hall. In 1987, local Pastor Edward Shields be-came gravely ill. At the time, he had a weekly radio broadcast. As he could not perform this duty any longer, he asked Evangelist Hall to take over his radio ministry. She thought that she would just do the pro-gram as he recovered from his illness. How-ever, Pastor Shields did not recover, and Evangelist Hall continued to do the broadcast. Evangelist Hall said that she had no idea that a door was being opened for her to min-ister on a national level. As she assumed her new role of radio broadcaster, Evangelist Hall began to expand her ministry to include: nursing homes, donat-ing to the homeless, visiting and ministering to the sick and elderly, jailhouse ministry, issuing school supplies to children, rendering support and comfort to the bereaved, providing finan-cial support to various charities and non-profits and bringing local gospel musical artists to the area, just to name a few. Evangelist Hall was born in Indianola, Mis-sissippi, to Pastor Sam and Eula Kimbrough. At the age of nine, she began singing with a gospel quartet and in her church’s choir. It was at her father’s church that she began ar-ranging and scheduling church programs. She moved to Chicago in 1966. After com-pleting high school, she earned certifications in Business and Office Administration and Cosmetology. Although Hall lived in Chicago, she booked and arranged gospel artists to come to Indianola to perform. These programs grew, received much acclaim and have contin-ued until this day. Over the years, Evangelist Hall has been in-strumental in various community efforts, which include raising money for a number of non- profit organizations. One of her crowning achievements for the past 20 years has been her work and fundraising for the Mississippi Region One Burn Center. Under Evangelist Hall’s leadership, an ex-cess of $30,000 has been raised and donated to help with the treatment and care of burn victims, many of whom have no health insur-ance. Over the years, Evangelist Hall has received numerous accolades, to include: the Woman of Influence by the American Gospel Quartet Convention; selected as Nation’s Best and Most Blessed by Quartet Jamboree; was the recipient of the Ruby Summerville Dixon Award; was recognized by the Jackson Musi-cal Association Award and the Annual Stellar Gospel Award. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Evangelist Sarah Kimbrough Hall for her dedication to serving others and giving back to her community. f 
PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 26, 2018 Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, last week, I voted against H.R. 1625, the fiscal year (FY) 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act. Most troubling, the bill shortchanges our nation’s young people by failing to adequately address the gun violence epidemic. The bill also dis-misses the urgent need to provide greater clarity for Dreamers and takes a cruel and heartless approach to immigration that does not reflect our country’s values. It does all of this while also failing to make tough decisions about our defense priorities. It maintains a $78 billion increase in defense spending above last year’s levels without dealing with wasteful and unnecessary nuclear expenditures that will make our country less secure. That said, I credit our negotiators for funding key Democratic priorities and eliminating many Republican ‘‘poison pill’’ policy provisions. The omnibus included several key provisions that I support. The legislation includes additional funding to address our nation’s crumbling in-frastructure, including transit grant programs that I have long championed, and maintains critical funding for our public broadcasters. The bill also fully funds the Trade Enforcement Trust Fund, includes a $4.6 billion increase for our nation’s affordable housing programs, and maintains full support for program to ensure the U.S. continues increasing access to water, sanitation, and hygiene for the world’s poorest people. This is a tough job, and I commend the ne-gotiators for their hard work. f 
OPPOSITION TO H.R. 4296 
HON. JARED POLIS 
OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 26, 2018 Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4296, a bill that restricts how federal financial regulators determine the amount of operational risk cap-ital large banks are required to hold. Oper-ational risk standards were put in place after the financial crisis of 2008 and currently apply to the largest financial firms in the country. These capital requirements are designed to ensure that large financial institutions have enough money on-hand to protect consumers and taxpayers, avoiding another taxpayer funded bank bailout. At the time H.R. 4296 was brought to the floor, I voted in favor of passage. However, this was a mistake and I would like to reflect that I do not support this legislation. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was passed to en-sure that the American taxpayers will not have to pay for another Wall Street bailout. I am a proud co-author and supporter of the Dodd- Frank Act and continue to believe that it is crit-ical to protect our nation’s financial stability. Dodd-Frank put in place financial regulations that protect the broader economy by mitigating risk of large financial firms. Further, it enacted much needed consumer protections to make financial products offered to consumers safer and easier to understand. Significant changes to Dodd-Frank could undermine the stability of the economy and our financial services sector and increase the likelihood that predatory lenders will return to prey on vulnerable con-sumers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE372 March 26, 2018 
PFC Milton Lee Olive, III was born on No-vember 7, 1946 in Chicago, IL. His mother died during the childbirth and his dad had no way to work and raise him. But his grand-parents, Mr. and Mrs. Milton Olive, from the Lexington, MS area stepped in. They went to Chicago immediately and brought him home with them and raised him in Lexington. Upon graduation from High school in Holmes County, Lexington in 1965, young Mil-ton went back to Chicago to live with his fa-ther and step-mother and during that summer he volunteered for the Army. He was then shipped out to participate in the hottest part of the Vietnam War. On October 22, 1965 while on patrol near Phu Cuong, Vietnam, PFC Milton Lee Olive, III and other soldiers of the Bravo Company 2nd/ 503rd Infantry Regiment, 173rd Airborne Bri-gade were given the mission of securing a 60–square-mile area known as War Zone D, or the ‘‘Iron Triangle.’’ As the soldiers moved through the thick jungle brush trying to locate Viet Cong enemies, they came under fire but were able to push the enemy back. As PFC Milton Lee Olive and four other sol-diers, two of them black and two of them white, were in pursuit of the Viet Cong en-emies, one of the enemy turned and threw a hand grenade into the middle of the platoon. Immediately, PFC Olive dashed forward yelling ‘‘I’ve got it,’’ smothering a live grenade into his middle and moved away from the oth-ers, sacrificed his life to save others by falling on the grenade and absorbing the full blast. PFC Milton Lee Olive, III’s selfless act of bravery saved the lives of four soldiers but ended his own life. He was just 18 years old. PFC Milton Lee Olive, III was awarded a memorial plaque in his memory of his bravery. He was the first African-American soldier and recipient of the Vietnam War to be honored America’s highest military decoration—the Medal of Honor—from the United States Army as a soldier for his actions of bravery in the Vietnam War. PFC Milton Lee Olive, III’s monument was erected and can be visited in Holmes County at Miles Hill, south of Lexington, MS. There is also a park in Chicago bearing the young hero’s name. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing PFC Milton Lee Olive, III for his bravery and dedication to the United States Military.

HONORING REAR ADMIRAL LAW-RENCE CLEVELAND ‘‘LARRY’’ CHAMBERS 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 26, 2018 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the House of Representatives to join me in recognizing Rear Admiral Lawrence Cleve-land ‘‘Larry’’ Chambers, USNA ’52, USN (Ret.), who the U.S. Naval Academy Alumni Association and Foundation honored at an event for its 2018 Distinguished Graduate Award recipients. RADM Chambers and I share a common alma mater, Dunbar High School, where he graduated as valedictorian of the Class of 1948 and as commander of the JROTC corps of cadets. In 1952, RADM Chambers became the second African American to graduate from the U.S. Naval Academy. In 1954, RADM Chambers became a Naval Aviator and in 1959, Stanford University awarded him a Bachelor’s degree in Aero En-gineering. During his time in the U.S. Navy, RADM Chambers became the first African American to achieve: Officer in Charge of a Fighter Detachment— VA–22 Det R, the ‘‘Fighting Redcocks,’’ USS Princeton (CVS–37); Commanding Officer of an Attack Squadron, VA–15, the ‘‘Valions,’’ USS Roosevelt CV–42; Air Officer, ‘‘Air Boss,’’ USS Oriskany (CV– 34); Commanding Officer of a Combat Stores Ship, USS White Plains (AFS–4), ‘‘The Orient Express;’’ Commanding Officer of an Aircraft Carrier, USS Midway (CV–41), ‘‘Midway Magic;’’ Commander of a Carrier Battle Group (CarGru3); Commander of a second Carrier Battle Group (Interim Commander CarGru4); Vice Commander Naval Air Systems Com-mand (NAVAIR); and Flag rank as a U.S. Naval Academy grad-uate. In 1975, a month into his command of the USS Midway and during ‘‘Operation Frequent Wind,’’ the final helicopter evacuation of Sai-gon, then-Captain Chambers performed a no-table act of valor. During the mission’s 18 hours of ‘‘controlled chaos,’’ the USS Midway received 3,073 of the nearly 7,000 evacuees while helicopters covered her flight deck. Major Buang-Ly of the South Vietnamese Air Force crammed his wife and five children into the two-person cabin of a Cessna O–1 ‘‘Bird Dog.’’ Maj. Buang-Ly took off and followed the helicopters out to sea. He found the USS Mid- way, and after three attempts, dropped this note on the deck, ‘‘Can you move the heli-copters to the other side? I can land on your runway. I can fly one hour more. Please res-cue me.—Maj. Buang-Ly, wife, and children.’’ The admiral commanding the Midway’s Car- rier Battle Group ordered CAPT Chambers to tell the pilot to ditch the airplane. How-ever, CAPT Chambers saw through his bin-oculars that a woman and children were on the aircraft. As a naval aviator, he knew when the Cessna’s fixed landing gear hit the sea, the light land plane would flip and sink with its passengers on board. CAPT Chambers called all personnel not on watch to report to the flight deck. More than 3,000 of the 4,300 compliments came topside to carry out CAPT Chambers’ order, ‘‘clear the deck!’’ The sailors heaved the helicopters blocking the USS Midway’s landing area over-board into the South China Sea. He then or-dered 25 knots and pointed the USS Midway into wind. Maj. Buang-Ly managed to strike a perfect deck landing in the over-loaded Cessna with no arresting hook. CAPT Cham-bers quickly met Maj. Buang-Ly and resumed landing more inbound choppers. In 1984, after 32 years of service, RADM Chambers retired from the Navy with more than 5,000 flight hours and 1,000 carrier land-ings. He then went on to work in private indus-try. In his civilian retirement, he continues to embody the U.S. Naval Academy’s mission and values. Therefore, I ask the House of Representa-tives to join me in recognizing and honoring RADM Chambers for his service to our coun-try and in commending him on being selected as a 2018 Distinguished Graduate Award re-cipient. f 
HONORING EXCLUSIVE KUTZ BARBER SHOP 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 26, 2018 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississipi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Exclusive Kutz Barber Shop, a Yazoo City business making an im-pact not only on hairstyles, but also on the needy of the community. Oliver Sampson, owner of Exclusive Kutz, along with Steve Beckford and Lonnie Conley, create lasting impressions on customers by providing them with popular or custom hair-styles. Exclusive Kutz is proud to service men, women, and children of all cultures, providing the best experiences possible for their cus-tomers. Barber shops are known for their conversa-tions, and Sampson reflected on the variety of talks that have occurred in his shop, ranging from politics and religion, to economics and fiance´s. Exclusive Kutz was recently featured in an issue of The Yazoo Herald giving free haircuts and facials to the needy of Yazoo City at the Manna House. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Exclusive Kutz Barber Shop and its owners for their desire to make a dif-ference in the lives of children and the com-munity.

MARKING THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PATUXENT RIVER NAVAL AIR STATION 
HON. STENY H. HOYER 
OF MARYLAND  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 26, 2018 Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to mark the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Patuxent River Naval Air Station in Maryland’s Fifth District. On April 1, 1943, the Navy formally commis-sioned the installation, marking the start of Pax River’s long and storied contribution to the defense of our nation in times of both war and peace. Over the past three quarters of a century, history has been made at Pax River again and again. The XP59–A, America’s first all-jet air-craft, was first tested at Pax River in 1944. The flight test program launched in the late 1940’s and expanded in the 1950’s trained many of our nation’s top military flight test pi-lots, including the members of NASA’s Mer-cury 7 program. In the 1960’s, several key de-velopments in helicopter technology, surface- to-air missile systems, navigational equipment, and ordinance came out of Pax River and its innovative workforce specialized in develop-ment and testing. In 1983, Lt. Colleen Nevius became the first woman to graduate from the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School, making history at Pax River once again. The Naval Air Sys-tems Command moved to Pax River in 1998,

making the installation the center of naval aviation. Today, Pax River continues to play an out-sized role in our defense and in the develop-ment and testing of new naval air systems. With the advent of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology and the emergence of Southern Maryland as a UAV development hub, Pax River will surely continue to lead the way into the future of naval aviation. I’ve been proud to support these efforts in Congress in recent years. Pax River has been so successful through-out its history not only because of the men and women who have served there but be-cause of the strong support for the installation in the local community. All of Southern Mary-land is proud of the work being done at Pax River, and St. Mary’s County residents tell me all the time how honored they are to host it. The local alliances that have sprung up over the years to bring military, business, and local community leaders together have enriched life both on and off the base. I hope my colleagues in this House will join me in paying tribute to all who have made the Patuxent River Naval Air Station a success for seventy-five years, and I join in celebrating this milestone anniversary.

HONORING TAMETRICE ECKOLS STRICKLAND 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 26, 2018 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to honor a remarkable public servant, Tametrice Eckols Strickland. Among the poets, trailblazers, and edu-cational leaders who have paved the way, one of our local educational leaders is Tametrice LaChelle Eckols Strickland an administrator, mother, daughter, and advisor. Tametrice Strickland was born August 8, 1973, in Marks, Mississippi to L. T. and Lula Eckols. She has lived in the rural town of Lambert, Mississippi, and she has remained there for forty-three years. Living in the Delta, God and family were at the forefront of daily life. She has been a member of Sykes Chapel Missionary Baptist Church most of her life. Having a relationship with God has been instilled in her. She is cur-rently an evangelist, and she teaches Sunday school and Bible class lessons to adults, works with Sykes Chapel’s Youth Ministry, Confinement Ministry, and Nursing Home Min-istry. Her teachers, family, and peers played a vital part in shaping her life. She really en-joyed school and was an honor student from elementary to high school while attending Quitman County public schools. In 1995, she graduated from Quitman County High School as the class president and class Valedictorian. After she graduated from high school, she at-tended University of Mississippi in Oxford, Mississippi. After she married in the spring, her first son, Larry Strickland, Jr., was born in the winter of her senior year. However, she re-fused to allow anything to deter her from her dreams. She became more determined, and she persevered. Later that year, she grad-uated from the University of Mississippi with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in English. In August 1995, she returned to her home-town because she wanted to contribute to her community. She worked at Southside Junior High as a kindergarten instructor. In May of 1996, she transferred to Quitman County Mid-dle School to teach language arts to sixth grade students. After teaching at Quitman County Middle School for two years, she served as an instructional coach. During this time, her second child, Aikeem Strickland, was born with physical and cognitive disabilities. She traveled to Northwest Mississippi Re-gional Hospital in Clarksdale, Mississippi and Lebonheur Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee almost bimonthly for years. Yet, she graduated in 2010 with a Master of Arts Degree in Cur-riculum and Instruction from the University of Mississippi. In the summer of 2010 she enrolled in the Mississippi Alternative Path to Quality Leader-ship Program (MAPQSL) at Coahoma Com-munity College in Clarksdale, Mississippi. After completing her internship, she became an as-sistant principal at Quitman County Middle School. She served as an assistant principal for one year. The following year, she became the principal of Quitman County Middle School, and she served in that capacity for two years. She became the director of the first Alternative Pathway to Excellence Program in Quitman County School District. She worked with students who really needed a second chance and assistance with academic and be-havior and tried to inspire them to achieve their goals. Instead of going from the pipeline of school to prison, her students went through the pipeline of school to school, college or a career. Her life has been impacted by her family, in-structors, colleagues, and people in her com-munity. Her former instructors showed com-passion toward her and positively impacted her life. Tametrice Strickland has been em-ployed with Quitman County School District for twenty-one years and is currently an assistant principal at Madison Shannon Palmer High School. She is an inspiring example of dedica-tion and determination. During her lifetime, she has strived to support and empower in-structors and provide support, opportunities, and pathways for students to excel. Her former students are now innovative, highly qualified instructors, visionary administrators, effective managers, responsible nurses, and productive leaders. In additional to working for Quitman County School District, she has served as a consult-ant for Mississippi Valley State University Reading Institute for two years. Additionally, she has served as a site coordinator for the Foundation of Economic and Education Devel-opment (FEED) and Motivating Parents and Children from August 2003 through May 2006, Lead Teacher for Create of Mississippi in 2005 and presented at the Mississippi Depart-ment of Education Summer Conference in June 2006. Tametrice Strickland has been composing poems and short stories since she was in the sixth grade. Today, she is still working on po-etry books and short stories to publish in the future. Some of her accolades include Who’s Who among America’s Teachers, Teacher of the Month, Appreciation Award from the Foun-dation of Economic and Education Develop-ment (FEED) and Motivating Parents and Chil-dren Program (MPAC), Inspiring Vision Award from Batesville Job Corps Center, and Out-standing Community Service Award from Quitman County Development Organization, Inc. On May 13, 2017, Tametrice Strickland re-ceived her Specialist in Educational Leader-ship from Arkansas State University. As an educator, her goals remain the same. She wants to motivate students to strive for great-ness and discover their full potential. She wants to inspire the next generation to affect a positive change in the Quitman County; this rural location does not determine the students’ destination. She believes that students have the ability to discover, create, and excel, and it is their duty to prepare them with the nec-essary tools. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Tametrice Eckols Strickland as an amazing administrator who is goal oriented and making a difference in her community. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF MR. GEOF-FREY WILSON JOLLEY FOR HIS DEDICATED CAREER OF PUBLIC SERVICE 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 26, 2018 Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize one of our own. On Friday, March 30, 2018, Mr. Geoffrey (Geoff) Jolley will bid farewell as my District Director and General Counsel, having overseen my District oper-ations since my first day, on January 3, 2005, as a Member of Congress in these hallowed halls. For more than 13 years, Geoff has dedi-cated his life to serving our community. He has quietly juggled two careers in public serv-ice, working for the people of Missouri’s Fifth Congressional District and as a Kansas City Firefighter/EMT. Geoff is a Kansas City native and lifelong resident. After graduating high school, he earned a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and Economics with a minor in African-Amer-ican Studies from Emory University in Atlanta. He then earned his Doctorate of Jurispru-dence from the University of Missouri-Colum-bia School of Law in 2002. Prior to serving nearly six months in 2004 as the Campaign Coordinator on my inaugural campaign, Geoff worked for my predecessor, Congresswoman Karen McCarthy. Following the tragic events of September 11, 2001, Geoff joined a volunteer fire department and a FEMA urban search and rescue team while still enrolled in law school. After graduation, he spent six months as a Lieutenant with the Ant-arctic Fire Department at McMurdo Station, Antarctica before returning to Missouri and ul-timately joining the Kansas City Fire Depart-ment. Over the years, Geoff has helped me build my district offices from the ground up, from our beginnings at the Federal Courthouse in Kansas City to the openings of my satellite of-fices in Independence and Higginsville. It was not unusual to see my District Director working on the floor in his suit, wiring and configuring computers in the Kansas City Office, phys-ically laying the hardwood floor in my Inde-pendence Office, or hanging photos he had taken around the District in the Higginsville Of-fice.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE374 March 26, 2018 
From working with me to establish the foun-dation in my office to implementing my vision for district projects, Geoff has served as a sounding board for many of my creative projects, providing legal, practical, and political insight. Once we identified a path forward, he spearheaded many of my major district suc-cesses. He has maintained an expansive port-folio over the years, including speaking on my behalf at Chamber and community meetings, overseeing our monthly finances and assisting with personnel matters, helping coordinate constituent services and town halls, and ad-dressing issues impacting residents of the Fifth District, such as the federal budget and appropriations, transportation and infrastruc-ture, energy and the environment, among oth-ers. Having been Mayor of Kansas City during devastating floods, one of my early priorities included protecting the lives and livelihoods of constituents living in flood-prone areas. Geoff worked quietly with the Army Corps of Engi-neers and stakeholders along Turkey Creek, Brush Creek, and the Blue River by attending stakeholder meetings and advocating for fed-eral resources for these flood control efforts. He also worked with the City of Kansas City, Environmental Protection Agency, and Depart-ment of Justice on the City’s ever-challenging Overflow Control Plan, by successfully push-ing for the inclusion of green infrastructure and an extended implementation period. At the time, Kansas City was granted the longest im-plementation period of any municipality in the country, and more recently, we have been working to extend it even further to bring needed financial relief to our taxpayers. Geoff led the staff in planning, developing and implementing a multi-pronged effort that included both public and private organizations and entities in order to maximize the use of 2008 Economic Stimulus Act and 2009 Amer-ican Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) resources in the District for the good of our entire community. This inclusive effort yielded grants, partnerships and alliances that brought needed resources and opportunities for job creation, economic development, public trans-portation, housing improvements, utility and in-frastructure projects, health and social pro-grams, as well as educational and veterans programs that will have enduring positive im-pacts on the recipients. Perhaps the largest and most ambitious of those efforts included the Green Impact Zone (GIZMO). GIZMO consisted of 150 blocks in Kansas City’s urban core where Geoff super-vised our effort to bring various stakeholders, including neighborhoods, the Mid-America Re-gional Council, the City of Kansas City, State of Missouri, and dozens of corporations, non- profits, developers, and other entities together to concentrate efforts in a targeted fashion to weatherize homes, install a smart electrical grid, demolish vacant properties, rehab aban-doned buildings, and create job opportunities for residents in the area. We accomplished this by helping to bring over $160 Million in ARRA and other federal funds to the area. The Green Impact Zone aimed at transforming an oft-ignored part of our community into one of the environmentally greenest pieces of urban geography in the world. GIZMO was regularly highlighted nationally as a model for regional collaboration in the sustainable com-munity efforts. Among the ARRA grants received for GIZMO included a $50 Million TIGER grant, a $48 Million SmartGrid grant, and a $20 Million EECBG grant. Geoff coordinated dozens of meetings with stakeholders and staff to help craft grants that would be impactful and then ensured strong fiscal management, account-ability, and oversight during the implementa-tion stages. The TIGER grant helped bring much-needed curbs and sidewalks to neigh-borhoods in the urban core, provided funding for a new Troost Bridge and pedestrian cross-ing at Brush Creek, improved streetscaping and corridor installations along transit routes, and more. Geoff’s staff work and collaboration with Kansas City Power & Light aided in the development and federal funding of KCP&L’s SmartGrid Innovation Park. SmartGrid put the Kansas City area in front of the line when it came to the energy efficiency revolution. The park features a 1 MW storage battery, a solar array, and educational kiosks to illustrate how power is delivered to the customers. In 2012, Geoff also played an integral role in helping to bring ShotSpotter, a gunfire de-tection system, to our region. I had initially viewed the success of this program in Wash-ington, DC and was determined to institute a pilot project in Kansas City. Geoff worked with the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority and U.S. Department of Transportation to use existing federal funding to install ShotSpotter technology along the Troost BRT route. In its first couple years, it helped reduce gunfire by 26 percent in the areas where the technology was installed. The Kansas City Police Depart-ment continues to fund this technology today to support their proactive policing strategies and deployments, in their ongoing commitment to improve the safety, security and quality of life for our residents. Over two decades ago, I fought for the revi-talization of Liberty Memorial, an historic and majestic monument built nearly a century ago by Kansas Citians and dedicated to all our na-tion’s veterans of World War I. It stands as a constant reminder of our veterans’ sacrifice, but also as a tribute to peace and liberty. Dur-ing my service in Congress, my respect and commitment for our veterans has remained a priority and Geoff has worked on numerous ef-forts to raise awareness of World War I. In 2006, he joined me at the opening of the WWI Museum, built below Liberty Memorial, and worked closely with me and our Washington staff to help get the entire site officially des-ignated as the National WWI Museum and Memorial. Geoff has served as my representa-tive to the Board of Trustees for the National WWI Museum and Memorial and became an integral part of Board, helping to secure legis-lation and funding from the State and serving on the Host Committee for their annual Night at the Tower. For the past twelve years, Geoff led our staff as we worked with a bi-partisan, bi-cam-eral delegation, including Senators R
OYBLUNT  and C
LAIRE MCCASKILL , along with my col-leagues, Congressmen T
EDPOE, DOUG LAM-
BORN , SAMGRAVES , and K EVIN YODER to cre- ate the U.S. WWI Centennial Commission. Geoff has served as my liaison at dozens of meetings and events alongside the Commis-sion. As April 6, 2017 marked the Centennial of the United States’ entry into World War I, Geoff was asked to serve on the WWI Com-mission’s Management team to help coordi-nate our nation’s official ceremony, a major international gathering in Kansas City to com-memorate this historic moment. On that day, thousands of people came to the National World War I Museum and Memorial to pay re-spect and to give honor to those who fought to keep our world safe. Geoff worked directly with the Centennial Commission to ensure the celebration would go off without a hitch. Over 250 foreign dignitaries were in attendance from nearly 30 countries. In addition to work-ing with WWI Commissioners, Museum and Commission staff, event planners, dozens of representatives of federal, state, and local agencies, including those from the Defense Department, State Department, and National Archives, among others, he volunteered as the staff lead on committees, including the secu-rity and aviation committees. Geoff’s service on the latter committee resulted in him being asked to officially welcome the French Air Force’s premiere demonstration team, Patrouille de France, to Kansas City’s Down-town Airport upon their arrival for the event. Even after such a successful event on April 6th, Geoff has continued to work diligently to promote additional funding, educational out-reach and national programming for this wor-thy cause. These are but a sampling of the many projects, events, and initiatives that Geoff has worked on during his tenure in my office. How-ever, as my colleagues in this Chamber know, we are regularly pulled in many directions as we try to represent the nearly 750,000 con-stituents in our Districts. Oftentimes, it is our staff, serving behind the scenes, helping to ensure those constituents and stakeholders get prompt attention as they maneuver through the bureaucratic hurdles that regret-tably get in the way. There is not a member of this esteemed body who wouldn’t be proud to have Geoff Jolley on their team, and his service has certainly been a blessing for me. On a personal note, nine years ago, I had the pleasure of officiating the wedding of Geoff and his wife, Kimberly, and know him to be a loving husband and a devoted father of two beautiful young girls, Sophia and Maggie. I will miss the girls’ cheerfulness, playfulness, and relentless energy, on display every time they stopped by the office or community events. Mr. Speaker, Geoff is a loyal, caring, and compassionate individual whose selflessness, empathy, and unflappable personality will be sorely missed. As he transitions into other areas of public service, I encourage my col-leagues to join me in recognizing his lifetime of dedication to our community and country and wishing him continued success. The peo-ple of Missouri’s Fifth Congressional District, including me, are better off because of Geof-frey Jolley. f

HONORING MR. JAMES T. BRETT 
HON. JOSEPH P. KENNEDY III 
OF MASSACHUSETTS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 26, 2018 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate James T. Brett, President and CEO of the New England Council, on receiv-ing the E´ire Society of Boston’s 2018 Gold Medal Award. Since 1937, the E´ire Society of Boston has celebrated the rich history of the Irish experi-ence and the many important contributions that Irish-Americans have made to our country and around the world. In keeping with tradition and the long list of distinguished recipients, the E´ire Society has chosen to honor a truly inspiring individual this year. A lifelong resident of Dorchester, Massachu-setts, James ‘‘Jim’’ Brett has dedicated his life to serving others and raising awareness for critical issues such as accessible healthcare, education, economic empowerment, and dis-ability rights. After fifteen years in the Massa-chusetts State Legislature taking on a number of leadership roles such as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Taxation and Joint Com-mittee on Banking, Mr. Brett joined The New England Council where he has continued to promote a strong economic environment and quality of living in the region. Since leaving office in 1996, Mr. Brett re-mains a leading voice in advocacy for individ-uals with disabilities both in New England and nationally, serving as a Chairman of the Presi-dent’s Committee for People with Intellectual Disabilities, a member of the National Council on Disability, and Chair of the Governor’s Commission on Intellectual Disability and Mas-sachusetts Disabled Persons Protection Com-mission. Across Massachusetts, we are proud to call James Brett our neighbor and grateful for his continued service to the disadvantaged among us. As the E´ire Society of Boston gathers on April 7th to celebrate this important achieve-ment, I call on Congress to recognize the many accomplishments of Mr. Brett’s distin-guished career and the impact that his tireless efforts have had on so many in New England and nationwide. f

HONORING MRS. GLORIA RICHMOND JACKSON 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 26, 2018 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to honor Mrs. Gloria Richmond Jackson. Gloria Richmond Jackson came into this world on a windy day in March of 1957. She is the eleventh of thirteen children born to Floyd and Earnestine Richmond. She spent her early years on the Adams Plantation, three miles southwest of Lambert, Mississippi in Quitman County. She left the State of Mississippi in 1972, and spent 33 years living in Louisiana, Texas, California and Illinois. In 2005, the Lord led her back to Lambert to work with the youth; but the true blessing of her return was the lov-ing and nurturing relationship that developed between her and her mother who passed away July 17, 2011. Jackson’s mission quickly led her to become immersed in community work. In June 2005, she began working with the youth at the North Delta Youth Development Center in Lambert. As Director of The Children’s Village Project, she encouraged them by sharing her story of trials and triumphs in an attempt to assist them with healthy development. Jackson is proud of her southern upbringing and credits a lot of her accomplishments as a direct result of having a wonderful mother. She describes her mother as being, ‘‘Mis-sissippi Strong.’’ Her mother wasn’t afraid to get involved with the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960’s. She worked with others to help get African Americans register to vote in Quitman County. She even defied the Superintendent of Education’s warning, that if any of the school bus drivers participated in a Freedom March with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., they would be fired. She marched, but kept her job as a Bus Driver for the elementary school in Lambert. Mrs. Earnestine Richmond’s positive impact wasn’t limited to only a few of her children: Her first-born daughter, Tressie Richmond Woods, in 1965 became the first African American to work as a Loan Officer for the Quitman County Farmers Home Administra-tion, located in Marks, Mississippi. Her daughter, Evon Richmond Ector, partici-pated in the now famous, ‘‘Poor People’s Mule Train March to Washington’’ in 1968. Her daughter Mae Richmond Mosley was the first African American to become Vice President of Human Resources for Briggs and Stratton Engines Corporation in Milwaukee, Wisconsin from 2003 to 2007 when she re-tired. Gloria Richmond Jackson, her youngest daughter, was the first African American to at-tend Lambert Jr. High School in 1969. Five of Mrs. Richmond’s sons have owned busi-nesses: Edgar Richmond (Automotive Repair Shop) Chicago, Illinois. Benjamin and Leo Richmond, co-owners (Bar and Lounge) Chi-cago, Illinois. Charles Richmond (Vending Ma-chine Service Company, St. Louis, Missouri and a Home Health Service Company with lo-cations in St. Louis and Kansas City, Mis-souri). James Richmond currently owns an Automotive Towing Service in Wellston, Mis-souri. Jackson was appointed to the position of Town Clerk for Lambert, June 13, 2016. Prior to her appointment as Town Clerk, she was employed with Youth Opportunities Unlimited, Inc. of Lambert, Mississippi for eight years. There she worked as a Data Research Asso-ciate and Abstinence Educator in the Quitman, South Panola and Coahoma Municipal School Districts. Her career with American Airlines began at O’Hare Airport in Chicago, Illinois in 1989; it spanned for over fifteen years. She started out at American while working evenings in Facili-ties Maintenance, concurrently attending Cath-erine Business College at night. After gradua-tion, she was promoted to Ticket Counter Agent, two years later she was promoted to Sales Support Representative, and later she accepted the position of City Ticket Office Sales Representative until 2001. At that time she returned to Chicago O’Hare Airport to fill a position as Premium Service Representative in the very same office where she once worked as a janitor (Facilities Maintenance). Following a seven-year leave from American

Airlines, she returned to work at AA in 2012, commuting from Lambert to Chicago for seven months. She retired May 13, 2013 after fifteen years of dutiful service. Jackson is a Baptist Minister and Assistant Pastor, Sunday School Teacher and Lecturer at Pleasant Hope Missionary Baptist Church in Lambert, Mississippi under the leadership of Pastor Reginald Griffin. She is a Published Author, ‘‘Leaving Lam-bert’’ (a painful journey to joy in God from a small Mississippi town) Inspirational Speaker, Certified Abstinence Educator, Data Re-searcher and Retired Premium Service Rep-resentative. Jackson also entered into the political arena where she ran for Quitman County Tax Asses-sor and also ran for Chancery Clerk. She re-mains engaged in community activities, writ-ing, her church ministry and mentoring the youth of Quitman County. In December 2010; Jackson married Robert L. Jackson, Mississippi State Senator for Dis-trict 11. They have a blended family of six chil-dren, eight grandchildren and three great grandchildren. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Mrs. Gloria Richardson Jackson for her dedication in serving her community. HONORING LLOYD CLINTON ‘‘SONNY’’ MARTIN 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 26, 2018 Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, I honor the life of Lloyd Clinton ‘‘Sonny’’ Martin of Pennington Gap. Sonny passed away on March 8, 2018 at the age of 82. He was a man who devoted himself to helping people in Lee County, whether his customers or his community at large. Sonny made his living as a community banker, spending over 60 years in the busi-ness, most notably at Powell Valley National Bank (PVNB). He began as a loan officer, subsequently rose to president and chief exec-utive officer, and remained active on the board until the end of his life. In addition, he served two terms as a member of the Virginia Bank-ers Association Board of Directors. Devoted to helping people, and talented at it, Sonny made customer service a hallmark of his career. Ac-cording to PVNB Executive Vice President Leton Harding as quoted in the Kingsport Times-News, Sonny’s philosophy was, ‘‘We are a true community bank serving everyone in the community.’’ Sonny improved Southwest Virginia through his career, but he found other ways to do so as well. As a member of the Commonwealth Transportation Board, first as a representative of the Bristol District and then as an at-large member for rural areas, he advocated for Southwest Virginia’s interests. After Lee Coun-ty’s hospital closed in 2013, he led the search for ways to reopen it. He also served on the Pennington Gap Town Council. Sonny was a veteran of the United States Army and a member of the First Baptist Church in Pen-nington Gap. In 2004, he cast a vote for presi-dent as an elector in the Elector College. In recognition of his contributions to the Com-monwealth of Virginia, he received the Patrick Henry Award. Survivors include Sonny’s wife of 59 years, Joyce, daughters Mary Virginia ‘‘Jennie’’ and husband Scott Joy and Karen and husband Tony LaScola, and granddaughters Lauren and Carolyn Joy. I offer my condolences to his family, as well as my gratitude for all his serv-ices on behalf of Southwest Virginia.
