PRAYER The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-fered the following prayer: Let us pray. Eternal God, our help in ages past and hope for years to come, we honor Your Name. Today, have mercy upon us. Accord-ing to Your loving kindness and tender mercies, have Your way in this Cham-ber and in the hearts of our lawmakers. Lord, our Senators are the clay, and You are the divine potter. Using Your wisdom, mercy, and might, mold and make our legislators to be instruments of Your divine purposes. Give them the courage and wisdom to surrender and yield to the unfolding of Your unstoppable providence as they ac-knowledge that our times are in Your hands. We pray in Your sovereign Name. Amen.

EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. Under the previous order, the Senate will proceed to executive ses-sion to resume consideration of the fol-lowing nomination, which the clerk will report. The bill clerk read the nomination of Brett M. Kavanaugh, of Maryland, to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The Senator from Iowa. Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, would you inform me of the amount of time I have to speak. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. There has been no time agree-ment made. Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Acting President pro tempore. Madam President, 100 days ago, Jus-tice Kennedy announced his retirement from the Supreme Court. Shortly thereafter, on July 9, the President an-nounced the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to serve as the newest Jus-tice. Judge Kavanaugh has spent 25 years of his career in public service. He spent the last 12 years on the DC Circuit— considered the second most important Federal court in the country. His record there has been extremely im-pressive because the Supreme Court adopted a position advanced in Judge Kavanaugh’s opinions no fewer than a dozen times. Judge Kavanaugh is also a pillar of his community and in the legal profes-sion. He serves underprivileged com-munities, coaches girls’ basketball, and is a lector at his church. He has shown a deep commitment to preparing young lawyers for their careers. He has been a law professor at three prestigious law schools and a mentor to dozens of judi-cial law clerks. This should have been a respectable and dignified confirmation process. In a previous era, this highly qualified nominee would have received unani-mous support in the Senate. Before leftwing, outside groups and Demo-cratic leaders had him in their sights, Judge Kavanaugh possessed an impec-cable reputation and was held in high esteem by the bench and the bar alike. Even the American Bar Association, which the Democrats say is their gold standard for judges, gave him its unan-imous ‘‘well-qualified’’ rating. What leftwing groups and their Democratic allies have done to Judge Kavanaugh is nothing short of mon-strous. I saw what they did to Robert Bork. I saw what they did to Clarence Thomas. That was nothing compared to what we have witnessed in the last 3 months. The conduct of leftwing, dark money groups and their allies in this body has shamed us all. The fix was in from the very begin-ning. Before the ink was even dry on the nomination, the minority leader announced he would oppose Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination with every-thing he had. Even before he knew the President’s nominee, the minority leader said he was opposed to all 25

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6560 October 5, 2018 
well-qualified potential nominees list-ed by this President. One member of my committee said those who would vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh would be ‘‘complicit in evil.’’ Another member of the committee revealed the endgame when she suggested that Sen-ate Democrats could hold the vacancy open for 2 years if they defeated Judge Kavanaugh and took control of the Senate in these midterm elections. I oversaw the most transparent con-firmation process in Senate history based on the fact of the more than 500,000 pages of judicial writings, publi-cations, and documents from Judge Kavanaugh’s executive branch service. This is on top of the 307 judicial opin-ions he authored. Despite the Demo-crats’ efforts to bury the committee in even more paperwork, the Senate Judi-ciary Committee held a timely, 4-day hearing on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomina-tion last month. Judge Kavanaugh tes-tified for more than 32 hours over the course of 3 days. Judge Kavanaugh showed the Nation exactly why he de-serves to be on the Supreme Court—be-cause of his qualifications. Judge Kavanaugh’s antagonizers couldn’t land a punch on him during his 3 days of testimony. Even when they made false or misleading argu-ments, they couldn’t touch him. Some of my colleagues accused Judge Kavanaugh of committing perjury. For that false claim, the Washington Post Fact Checker awarded my colleague three Pinocchios. Another colleague claimed Judge Kavanaugh described contraceptives as ‘‘abortion-inducing’’ drugs. The video my colleague shared on the internet was doctored to omit the fact that Judge Kavanaugh was de-scribing the plaintiffs’ claims in a case that he had decided and not his own views. My colleague was awarded four Pinocchios. Those, of course, are the most Pinocchios you can get. Yet they still had one big card to play, which they had kept way up their sleeves for a month—actually, for 45 days, I think. In July, the ranking member received a letter from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, alleging that Judge Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in high school 36 years ago. Instead of referring Dr. Ford to the FBI or sharing these allegations with her col-leagues—either of which would have re-spected and preserved Dr. Ford’s con-fidentiality and is what Dr. Ford re-quested—the ranking member referred Dr. Ford to Democratic-activist attor-neys who were closely tied to the Clin-tons. The ranking member shamefully sat on these allegations for nearly 7 weeks, only to reveal them at the elev-enth hour, when it appeared that Judge Kavanaugh was headed toward con-firmation because he was so qualified. The ranking member had numerous opportunities to raise these allegations with Judge Kavanaugh personally. I will give you six examples. She could have discussed them with Judge Kavanaugh during their private meeting on August 20—a meeting which took place after her staff had sent Dr. Ford to Democratic lawyers— or shared them with 64 of her Senate colleagues who had also met with him individually; the ranking member’s staff could have raised them with Judge Kavanaugh during a background investigation followup call in late Au-gust; Senators could have asked Judge Kavanaugh about the allegations dur-ing his 32 hours of testimony over the course of 3 days; Judiciary Committee members could have asked Judge Kavanaugh about this in the closed ses-sion of the hearing, which the ranking member didn’t attend. The closed ses-sion is the appropriate place to bring up issues about which confidentiality is supposed to be respected, and there were no questions about these allega-tions among the 1,300 written questions that had been sent to Judge Kavanaugh after the hearing. This amounts to more written questions being sub-mitted to this nominee after a hearing than to all Supreme Court nominees combined. Keeping the July 30 letter secret de-prived Senators of having all the facts they needed to have about this nomina-tion. It was not until September 13—July 30 to September 13, nearly 7 weeks after the ranking member received these allegations and on the eve of the confirmation vote—that the ranking member referred them to the FBI. Then, somehow, they were leaked to the press. It was not until those news reports on September 16 that I even learned of Dr. Ford’s identity. This is an outrage. The political motives be-hind the Democrats’ actions should be obvious to everyone. Dr. Ford requested the opportunity to tell her story to the Senate Judici-ary Committee. After a lot of foot- dragging by Dr. Ford’s attorneys, they finally agreed to a public hearing. As promised, I provided a safe, com-fortable, and dignified forum for Dr. Ford as well as for Judge Kavanaugh. Dr. Ford was sincere in her testimony, as was Judge Kavanaugh, who emphati-cally denied the allegations. It is true that confirmation hearings aren’t a trial, but trials have rules based on commonsense notions of fair-ness and due process, not the other way around. It is a fundamental aspect of fairness and a fundamental aspect of due process that the accuser have the burden of proving allegations. Judge Kavanaugh was publicly accused of a crime, and his reputation and liveli-hood were at stake. So it was only fair that his accuser have the burden of proof. The consensus is, the burden was not met. Ultimately, the existing evidence, in-cluding the statements of the three al-leged eyewitnesses named by Dr. Ford, refuted Dr. Ford’s version of the facts. Our investigative nominations counsel, Rachel Mitchell, who has nearly 25 years of experience in advocating for sexual assault victims and in inves-tigating sex crimes, concluded there was a lack of specificity and simply too many inconsistencies in Dr. Ford’s al-legations to establish that Judge Kavanaugh committed sexual assault even under the lowest standard of proof. She concluded: 
A ‘‘he said, she said’’ case is incredibly dif-ficult to prove. But this case is even weaker than that. Dr. Ford identified other wit-nesses to the event, and those witnesses ei-ther refuted her allegations or failed to cor-roborate them. For the reasons discussed below, I do not think that a reasonable pros-ecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the Committee. Nor do I be-lieve this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard. 
We have thoroughly investigated Judge Kavanaugh’s background. In addition to the prior six FBI full- field background investigations with the interviews of nearly 150 people who have known Judge Kavanaugh his en-tire life, the committee also separately and thoroughly investigated every credible allegation we received. Our more than 20 committee staff members have worked night and day over the last many weeks in tracking down vir-tually all leads, and at the request of undecided members, the FBI reopened Judge Kavanaugh’s background inves-tigation for another week. The FBI interviewed 10 more people related to the latest credible sexual as-sault allegations, and the FBI con-firmed what the Senate investigators already concluded, which is this: There is nothing in the supplemental FBI background investigation report that we didn’t already know. These uncorroborated accusations have been unequivocally and repeat-edly rejected by Judge Kavanaugh, and neither the Judiciary Committee nor the FBI could locate any third parties who can attest to any of the allega-tions. There also is no contempora-neous evidence. This investigation found no hint of misconduct, and the same is true of six prior FBI investigations conducted during Judge Kavanaugh’s 25 years of public service. Nothing an investigator, including career FBI special agents, does could ever be good enough to sat-isfy the Democratic leadership in Washington, who staked out opposition to Judge Kavanaugh before he was even nominated. There is simply no reason, then, to deny Judge Kavanaugh a seat on the Supreme Court on the basis of the evi-dence presented to us. The Democratic strategy used against Judge Kavanaugh has made one thing clear: They will never be satisfied, no matter how fair and thorough the process is. Thirty-one years after the Senate Democrats’ treatment of Robert Bork, their playbook remains the same. For the leftwing, advice and consent has become search and destroy, a demoli-tion derby. I am pleased to support Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation. I am sorry for what the whole family has gone through the last several weeks. We

should all admire Kavanaugh’s willing-ness to serve his country, despite the way he has been treated. It would be a travesty if the Senate did not confirm the most qualified nominee in our Na-tion’s history. The multitude of allegations against him have proved to be false. They have also proved that no discussion of his qualifications have shown he wasn’t qualified. We had a campaign of dis-traction from his outstanding quali-fications, a campaign of destruction of this fine individual. What we have learned is the resist-ance that has existed since the day after the November 2016 election is cen-tered right here on Capitol Hill. They have encouraged mob rule. When you hear about things like ‘‘Get in their face; bother people at every restaurant where you can find a Cabinet Member’’—these are coming from public servants who ought to set an example of civility in American so-ciety, and it has been made worse by what has happened to Judge Kavanaugh. I hope we can say no to mob rule by voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh. I yield the floor. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The Senator from California. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I understand that in the order I have 15 minutes; is that correct? The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The Senator is recognized. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much. Madam President, this has been my ninth Supreme Court nomination hear-ing, and I must say, I have never expe-rienced anything like this. Never before have we had a Supreme Court nominee where over 90 percent of his record has been hidden from the public and the Senate. Never before have we had a nominee display such flagrant partisanship and open hos-tility at a hearing, and never before have we had a nominee facing allega-tions of sexual assault. The nominee before us being consid-ered for a pivotal swing seat, if con-firmed, would be the deciding vote on some of the most important and divi-sive issues of our day. I would like to start by speaking about some of the issues in relation to Judge Kavanaugh. President Trump promised to nomi-nate to the Supreme Court only indi-viduals who would be pro-life and pro- gun nominees and who would auto-matically overturn Roe v. Wade. In my judgment, Judge Kavanaugh clearly meets the test. In a speech in 2017, Judge Kavanaugh focused on praising Justice Rehnquist and his dissent in Roe v. Wade, where he challenged the right to women’s pri-vacy as protected in the Constitution. Also, last year, Judge Kavanaugh ar-gued in a dissent in a Texas case that a Jane Doe should not be able to exer-cise her right to choose because she did not have family and friends help her make the decision. If adopted, this ar-gument could rewrite Supreme Court precedent and require courts to deter-mine whether a young woman has a sufficient support network when mak-ing her decision, even in cases—as is in this one—where she had gone before a court. His reasoning demonstrates that Judge Kavanaugh not only is willing to disregard precedent, but his opinions fail to appreciate the challenging reali-ties women face when making these most difficult decisions. When I asked him about whether Roe and Casey were settled law and wheth-er they were correctly decided, he re-fused to answer. He would say only that these cases are ‘‘entitled to re-spect.’’ As we all know, Roe v. Wade is one of a series of cases that upheld an individ-ual’s right to decide who to marry, where to send your children to school, what kind of medical care you can re-ceive at the end of life, as well as whether and when to have a family. According to these cases, the govern-ment cannot interfere with these deci-sions. Another issue that gives me great pause is Judge Kavanaugh’s extreme view on guns. In reviewing his record and judicial opinions, it is clear his views go well beyond simply being pro- gun. During a lecture at Notre Dame Law School, Judge Kavanaugh himself said he would be ‘‘the first to acknowledge that most lower-court judges have dis-agreed’’ with his views on the Second Amendment. Specifically, in District of Columbia v. Heller, Judge Kavanaugh wrote in a dissenting opinion that ‘‘unless guns were regulated either at the time the Constitution was written or tradition-ally throughout history, they cannot be regulated now.’’ In his own words, he said gun laws are unconstitutional unless they are ‘‘traditional or common in the United States.’’ Judge Kavanaugh would have struck down DC’s assault weapons ban because they have not historically been banned. This logic means that as weapons be-come more advanced and more dan-gerous, they cannot be regulated at all. When I asked Judge Kavanaugh about his views that if a gun is in ‘‘common use,’’ it cannot it be regu-lated, he replied this way: 
There are millions and millions and mil-lions of semi-automatic rifles that are pos-sessed. So that seemed to fit ‘‘common use’’ and not be a dangerous and unusual weapon. 
Think about that. Judge Kavanaugh made up a new standard that had noth-ing to do with ‘‘common use’’ but in-stead relied on whether a gun is widely possessed and owned as determinative of whether it is subject to any regula-tion. The United States makes up 4 per-cent of the worldwide population, but we own 42 percent of the world’s guns. By Judge Kavanaugh’s standard, no State or locality will be able to place any limitation on guns because of widespread ownership in this country. I am also concerned about his views on Presidential power. Specifically, he has said that sitting Presidents cannot be indicted, cannot be prosecuted, should not be investigated, and should have the authority to fire a special counsel at will. In other words, the President of the United States is above and outside the law. These views raise serious concerns that should concern us all, especially at a time when the President contin-ually threatens to fire the leadership of the Department of Justice for failing to be loyal and reigning in the Mueller investigation. These views alone are sufficient for me to vote against Judge Kavanaugh, but what we have seen and experienced in the past several weeks has raised se-rious new concerns—concerns I believe should worry us all. Judges are expected to be ‘‘even-handed, unbiased, impartial, [and] courteous’’; however, at the hearing last week, we saw a man filled with anger and aggression. Judge Kavanaugh raised his voice. He inter-rupted Senators. He accused Democrats of ‘‘lying in wait,’’ and replacing ‘‘ad-vice and consent with search and de-stroy.’’ He even went so far as to say that Dr. Ford’s allegations were nothing more than ‘‘a calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election,’’ and ‘‘revenge on behalf of the Clintons.’’ How could he? This behavior revealed a hostility and belligerence that is unbecoming of someone seeking to be elevated to the U.S. Supreme Court. His display was so shocking that more than 2,400 law pro-fessors from around the country have expressed their opposition. They wrote: ‘‘Instead of trying to sort out with reason and care the alle-gations that were raised, Judge Kavanaugh responded in an intem-perate, inflammatory and partial man-ner, as he interrupted and, at times, was discourteous to senators.’’ The professors concluded: ‘‘We have differing views about other qualifica-tions of Judge Kavanaugh. But we are united as professors of law and scholars of judicial institutions, in believing he did not display the impartiality and ju-dicial temperament requisite to sit on the highest court of our land.’’ Madam President, finally, I want to mention the serious and credible alle-gations raised by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez, the two women who came forward to tell their experiences facing sexual assault. When Dr. Ford decided to make her story public, she faced all her worst fears. She was harassed. She received death threats. She had to relocate her home, her husband, and two children. Yet, in less than a week, she came be-fore the Senate and told 21 Senators she had never met, along with millions

of Americans, about the most tragic, traumatic, and difficult experience of her life. She did so with poise, grace, and, most importantly, bravery. Unfortunately, she was met with par-tisanship and hostility. My Republican colleagues have largely chosen to ig-nore her powerful testimony. Senators weren’t allowed to hear from any witnesses who could corrobo-rate or refute her account. They re-fused to gather evidence or do an im-partial investigation into her allega-tions. Deborah Ramirez also reluctantly came forward to tell her story. Like Dr. Ford, Ms. Ramirez offered to speak to the FBI. Both Ford and Ramirez submitted evidence to support their al-legations, including naming over two dozen witnesses each. Unfortunately, the limited investiga-tion that was conducted by the FBI failed to interview any one of the wit-nesses these who women identified who could support her account. Let me say that again. They refused to investigate—to talk with—any of the 24 witnesses that could have sup-ported their accounts. I think it is important to remember why we are here today. We are here to determine whether Judge Kavanaugh has demonstrated the impartiality, the temperament, and the even-handedness that is needed to serve on this great High Court of our land. If confirmed, he will join eight other individuals who are charged with decid-ing how the laws of the land are inter-preted and applied. He would be a de-ciding vote on the most important issues affecting our country and every American for generations to come. Based on all of the factors we have before us, I do not believe Judge Kavanaugh has earned this seat. Thank you. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER  
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The Democratic leader is recog-nized. Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, from start to finish, President Trump’s nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court will go down as one of the saddest, most sordid in the long history of the Federal judi-ciary. The well was poisoned from the out-set when President Trump selected Judge Kavanaugh from a list of names preapproved by hard-right special in-terest groups for whom the national in-terest is a trifling concern compared to repealing Roe v. Wade, cutting people’s healthcare, and achieving a partisan majority on the Supreme Court. The rot worsened when the Republican ma-jority on the Judiciary Committee shielded the bulk of Judge Kavanaugh’s records from the public, discarding dec-ades of bipartisan precedent and thwarting norms of transparency and fairness. Finally, the dam broke under the weight of credible allegations that Judge Kavanaugh committed a sexual assault in high school. In 2018, the Republican majority con-ducted a hearing that made the Anita Hill hearings in 1991 look fair by com-parison. At this hearing, there were no corroborating witnesses on either side and no independent investigation of the facts to inform the questioning. They even hired an outside counsel to put a witness, Dr. Ford, on trial. Only at the eleventh-hour urging of break-away Members of their caucus, Repub-licans submitted, reluctantly, to a 1- week investigation of the allegations— an investigation which was then se-verely circumscribed by the White House. Our Republican friends blame us for this process. They are always finding a straw man. But nothing could be fur-ther from the truth. First, they blame us for delay, knowing full well that Majority Leader MCCONNELL has com-plete control of when nominees are brought to the floor. Leader M
CCON-
NELL could have moved this nominee 2 weeks ago or 1 week ago. Democrats had no say—and don’t—when it comes to what is scheduled for floor debate. But in each case, Leader M
CCONNELL  couldn’t move the nominee forward be-cause he was blocked by fellow Repub-licans—not Democrats—from moving forward. When it comes to complaining about delay, two words never come from our Republican friends’ lips: ‘‘Merrick Garland.’’ Republicans are also saying that we engaged in ‘‘a smear campaign’’ or the ‘‘politics of personal destruction’’ with this nomination. In reality, again, they are using Democrats as a straw man, because what they are really talking about is what Dr. Ford said. Democrats did not induce her to come forward; her conscience did. Are our Republican friends accusing Dr. Ford and her deep-ly held memories of what happened to her of a smear campaign? Are they ac-cusing Dr. Ford of a smear campaign, of engaging in the politics of personal destruction? Because that is who they are actually blaming. They are decry-ing her testimony and then trying to blame Democrats. I don’t blame them— they have a flawed nominee. They don’t want the focus on the nominee. When future Americans look back at these proceedings, let them draw no lessons from the Senate’s conduct here. Let them look back on this chapter as the shameful culmination of the scorched-earth politics practiced by the hard right in America—people who will stop at nothing to entrench an ad-vantage on our Nation’s courts. Let the confirmation process for Judge Kavanaugh be recorded as a sorry epi-logue to the brazen theft of Justice Scalia’s seat, the ignominious end of bipartisan cooperation and consulta-tion on the confirmation of Supreme Court Justices. And for what? For whom were Senate Republican leaders willing to discard all semblance of fair-ness to confirm? Judge Brett Kavanaugh—certainly a product of an elite education but also someone with a hard-right, conservative jurispru-dence, far, far away from what average Americans believe. Why most Democrats opposed his nomination at the outset feels like an-cient history now, but let’s not forget that, most importantly, we strongly disagree with a number of Judge Kavanaugh’s views. He is deeply skep-tical of unenumerated rights, including a woman’s right to make fundamen-tally private decisions about her med-ical care. He is deeply skeptical of the government’s role in protecting Ameri-cans with preexisting conditions. He is deeply skeptical of nearly all rules and regulations that protect consumers, workers, and the environment. The flashing red warning sign at the center of Judge Kavanaugh’s jurispru-dence is his views on Executive power and accountability. Somehow, this con-servative judge and scholar of the Con-stitution sees at the heart of American democracy a President-cum-King; an Executive who is unaccountable to the laws he is sworn to uphold; a head-of- state who, while in office, should be be-yond the reach of subpoenas, criminal investigations, or civil investigations. This moment in American history de-mands deep skepticism about Judge Kavanaugh’s views on Executive power, nominated as he was by an Executive who disdains the constraints of his of-fice and who is, at this very moment, the apparent subject of investigations his Supreme Court nominee believes should be invalid. I met with Judge Kavanaugh for al-most 2 hours, and I asked him about all of those issues. His answers were con-stantly evasive and utterly unsatisfac-tory. It was deja vu all over again in the first round of hearings, when Judge Kavanaugh deliberately avoided talk-ing about his views on Roe, healthcare, Presidential accountability, and more. There was no legal reason, rule, or logic that prevented him from being clear and saying what he thought. He was evasive because he knows that his views are deeply at odds with the progress America has made over the last half century of jurisprudence and at odds with what most Americans be-lieve. His performance was not only un-fair and frustrating to the Senate, it was unfair to the American people. When a nominee refuses to disclose their views, chances are you have a nominee whose views are far outside the mainstream of America, whether they be far right or far left. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle may not have as grave a con-cern about these views as we do, but let no American be surprised if Judge Kavanaugh becomes a decisive vote to restrict the rights and privileges of the American people, while stretching the bounds of privilege for the current oc-cupant of the White House. Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination ulti-mately does not only encompass ques-tions of ideology or credentials but questions of character. Here again, Judge Kavanaugh falls woefully short of what Americans expect and deserve

in a Supreme Court Justice. He has re-peatedly misled the Senate about his involvement in some of the most seri-ous controversies of the Bush adminis-tration, including warrantless wire-tapping of American citizens, our pol-icy against torture, the theft of elec-tronic records from Democratic Sen-ators, and his involvement in the nomi-nation of very controversial judges. Faced with credible allegations of var-ious types of misconduct, Judge Kavanaugh’s credibility was again test-ed, and he continued to dissemble and even prevaricate about easily refuted facts. Beyond the issue of credibility, Judge Kavanaugh presented to the Senate the bitterest partisan testimony I have ever heard coming from a candidate seeking the Senate’s approval, whether they be for the bench or the executive branch. There are many who think that what happened when Judge Kavanaugh was 17 years old should not be dispositive. Even if you believe that, his actions at age 53 in terms of demeanor, partisan-ship, and, above all, credibility, should be dispositive. Judges at every level of the Federal bench should be held to the highest standard of ethics and moral character. Judges at every level should be judicious and credible and inde-pendent but especially—especially—on the Supreme Court. I do not see how it is possible for my colleagues to say with perfect con-fidence that Judge Kavanaugh has the temperament, independence, and credi-bility to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. So I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: Why Judge Kavanaugh? There is no dictate that you have to march blindly forward with a nominee when there are others available to you. There are many judges whom I am sure conservatives would be happy to have on the Court. I would remind my colleagues, the seat that Brett Kavanaugh aspires to fill was held by a Justice who assumed the Bench after one nominee was voted down by the Senate and a second nomi-nee withdrew his nomination. But the Republican majority has pressed for-ward blindly on Judge Kavanaugh, even when brave women came forward to speak truth to power. Why? For what cause? For the sake of winning? That is not reason enough. My colleagues on the other side, if you have doubts about Judge Kavanaugh’s credibility, about his abil-ity to tell the truth, about his ability to be impartial and nonpartisan—no matter what you think of his jurispru-dence or what he may or may not have done in high school and college—you should not vote to confirm him to the Supreme Court. So my friends, Democratic and Re-publican, for all the controversy, all the heavyhandedness of the process, all the hyperbole and vilification of both sides, there is always hope that the Senate can save itself. We can salvage some decency here at the end. If Judge Kavanaugh is rejected, President Trump will select another nominee—likely right-of-center, prob-ably not to my liking but without the cloud that hangs over this nominee— and we can proceed to consider that nominee in a much less bitter, much better, less partisan way. A bipartisan majority of Senators, considering fully the weight of Judge Kavanaugh’s testi-mony, record, credibility, trust-worthiness, and temperament, consid-ering fully the heartbreaking testi-mony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, can vote to reject Judge Kavanaugh’s nom-ination and ask the President to send the Senate another name. For the sake of the Senate, of the Su-preme Court, and of America, I hope, I pray, my colleagues will do so. I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER  
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The majority leader is recog-nized. Mr. M
CCONNELL. Madam President, it was 88 days ago that President Trump announced his nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to fill the cur-rent vacancy on the Supreme Court. Judge Kavanaugh is a nominee of the very highest caliber, a brilliant legal mind and an accomplished jurist with a proven devotion to the rule of law. Today, the Senate has the opportunity to advance his nomination. Every one of us will go on record with one of the most consequential votes you ever cast in the Senate. The stakes are always high for a Su-preme Court nomination, but, col-leagues, the extraordinary events of re-cent weeks have raised them even high-er this time. When we vote later this morning, we will not only be deciding whether to elevate a stunningly well- qualified judge to our highest Court. Not anymore. Not after all this. The Senate will also be making a state-ment. We will either state that partisan politics can override the presumption of innocence, or we will reaffirm that in the United States of America, every-one is innocent until proven guilty. We will either state that facts and evidence can simply be brushed aside when politically inconvenient and sig-nal that media bullying and mob in-timidation are valid tactics for shaping the Senate and that the mob can at-tack and the Senate will cave, or we will stand up and say that serious, thoughtful, fact-based deliberation will still define this body. We will either give notice that to-tally uncorroborated allegations are now officially enough to destroy an American’s life, or we will declare that our society cannot, must not, will not set the bar so low. Today is a pivotal day in the nomina-tion process of this excellent judge, but it is a pivotal day for us here in the Senate as well. The ideals of justice that have served our Nation so well for so long are on full display. So let’s step back and sample a few of the choice moments that the Senate and the American people have been treated to during the disgraceful—ab-solutely disgraceful—spectacle of the last 2 weeks. The very night Judge Kavanaugh was announced as the President’s choice, we heard the junior Senator from Or-egon declare that this nominee would ‘‘pave the path to tyranny.’’ His audi-ence? Crowds of far-left protesters, still filling in the blanks on their picket signs. They weren’t quite sure who the nominee was going to be yet. We heard the junior Senator from New Jersey describe Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination as a great moral struggle in which there are just two camps: ‘‘You’re either complicit in the evil . . . or you are fighting against it.’’ More recently, we heard the junior Senator from Hawaii argue that her personal disagreement with Judge Kavanaugh’s judicial philosophy meant—now, listen to this—he de-served less of a presumption of inno-cence when it came to allegations of misconduct. If you agree with her, you are not entitled to the presumption of innocence when it comes to allegations of misconduct. That is from a member of the Judiciary Committee? That is the definition of ‘‘due process’’? Appar-ently, you get due process only if you agree with her. Even more recently, we saw the jun-ior Senator from Rhode Island hold forth with great confidence—great con-fidence—offering his expert interpreta-tions of goofy jokes in a high school yearbook from the early 1980s. That was incredibly enlightening. Innocent jokes? Beer-drinking references? Oh, no. Our colleague was quite positive there must be some other hidden or sinister meanings at play—until, of course, a number of Judge Kavanaugh’s classmates set him straight earlier this week. So stop and consider these snapshots. The absurdity. The absurdity. The in-dignity. This is our approach to con-firming a Supreme Court Justice? This is the Senate’s contribution to public discourse? Before the ink had dried on Justice Kennedy’s retirement, our Democratic colleagues made it perfectly clear what this process would be about: delay, ob-struct, and resist. Before the ink had dried on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination, colleagues across the aisle—including Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee— were racing to announce they had made up their minds and were totally opposed to his confirmation. Mere hours after Judge Kavanaugh was nominated, my friend the Demo-cratic leader promised—‘‘I will oppose him with everything I’ve got,’’ he said hours after he was nominated. It was thus abundantly clear that his No. 1 political goal was to defeat the nomi-nation by any means necessary. It was right there from the begin-ning, a clear declaration, plain as day: Nothing—nothing—could get most

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6564 October 5, 2018 
Democrats to consider this nominee with an open mind. It would be delay-ing tactics, obstruction, and the so- called resistance until the final vote was called. For a few weeks, their efforts played out along the lines that have sadly be-come somewhat ordinary around here. There were excuses for delay. Those fell flat. There were gross distortions of Judge Kavanaugh’s record that were batted down by outside fact-checkers. There were all the usual phony, apoca-lyptic pronouncements that are shout-ed whenever a Republican President dares to nominate a Supreme Court Justice. It happens every time. Hostile to women. Hostile to vulnerable people. Hostile to workers. The same old tricks. The same old playbook. But here was the problem: The old plays weren’t working. The distortions were being literally drowned out by the facts. Senators received and reviewed more pages of background materials on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination than for every previous Supreme Court nom-ination combined. We read Judge Kavanaugh’s 12-year record of judicial rulings from our Nation’s second high-est court—300-plus opinions. We heard sworn testimony and written accounts from hundreds of character witnesses from all stages of Judge Kavanaugh’s life and career. The picture painted by these facts was nothing like the carica-ture—nothing like the caricature. So it was clear that the old tactics weren’t working and weren’t going to get the job done. The resistance de-manded more. Try something new, they said. Well, we all know what hap-pened next. Uncorroborated allegations of the most sensitive, most serious sort were quickly sharpened into political weapons. One such allegation, shared by Dr. Ford in confidence with the Democrat side of the Judiciary Committee, some-how mysteriously found its way into the press. Chairman G
RASSLEY imme-diately set out on a sober, focused search for the truth. The committee collected testimony, organized a new hearing, and most recently asked for a supplemental FBI background inves-tigation, Judge Kavanaugh’s seventh— seventh—FBI investigation. By any fair standard, the facts—the actual facts—proved to be straight-forward: no corroborating evidence. None—none—was produced to support any of the allegations leveled against Judge Kavanaugh. There was no cor-roborating evidence from the FBI in-quiry or from anywhere else. Nothing. Well, that wasn’t enough for our Democratic colleagues, of course. The facts were not exactly the point. After all, we sort of get it by now. When the very FBI investigation for which they had been clamoring turned up no new evidence, the Democrats moved the goalposts yet again. I believe the latest story is that the whole investigation is invalid—listen to this—because individuals who had only recently been told secondhand or thirdhand about nearly 40-year-old al-legations weren’t treated as essential witnesses. Let me say that again. The latest story is that the whole investigation is invalid because individuals who had only recently been told secondhand or thirdhand about nearly 40-year-old al-legations weren’t treated as essential witnesses—never mind that they didn’t actually witness anything. They didn’t witness anything. So let’s be clear. These are not wit-nesses. These are people supposedly in possession of hearsay that they first heard 35 years after the supposed fact. What nonsense. The people whom Dr. Ford claimed were witnesses have spoken with the FBI. We know that because they, through their attorneys, put out public statements saying so. What we know now is what we knew at this time a week ago: There is absolutely no cor-roborating evidence for these allega-tions—the same thing we heard a week ago. If there were, you bet we would have heard about it, but there isn’t. Notwithstanding that, the leak of Dr. Ford’s letter—in violation of her pri-vacy and against her wishes—opened the floodgates. The feeding frenzy was full-on. The weaponization of her letter by the left led to a torrent of other, equally uncorroborated allegations. They were dumped on Judge Kavanaugh and his family, and, breath-lessly, the media seized on them—the more outlandish, the better. Americans were informed that Judge Kavanaugh masterminded violent drug gangs as a young teenager, until that accuser walked her story back. We were informed that Judge Kavanaugh beat someone up on a boat in a Rhode Island harbor, until that accuser to-tally recanted. We heard another tall tale of physical assault, until that ac-count was thoroughly debunked by a sitting Federal judge. Oh, and, yes, we were informed that juvenile jokes in his high school yearbook were actually sinister secret references. Oh, the Keystone Kops were on the case, and Senate Democrats cheered them on. They read parts of this uncorroborated, unbelievable mudslide into the Senate R
ECORD . They cited them in an unofficial letter, demanding that Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination be withdrawn. Were they true? That was quite be-side the point, so long as they were convenient. Every effort was made to ensure the fact-free verdict of the mob and the media would win out over the actual evidence; make sure the mob prevails. The uncorroborated mud and the partisan noise and the physical in-timidation of Members in the Senate will not have the final say around here. The Senate will have the final say. We are almost at the end of the run-way. The crosswinds of anger and fear and partisanship have blown strong these past weeks. They have harmed a good man and his family. They have tarnished the dignity of this institu-tion, but all of it can end today. The time has come to vote. The Senate stands on the threshold of a golden op-portunity. We have the opportunity to advance the nomination of an incredibly well- qualified and well-respected jurist to a post that demands such excellence. We have the opportunity to put Judge Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, where his distinguished service will make us and our Nation proud for years to come. We have the oppor-tunity to do even more. Today, we can send a message to the American people that some core prin-ciples remain unfettered by the par-tisan passions of this moment. Facts matter. Fairness matters. The pre-sumption of innocence is sacrosanct. The Senate has turned its back on these things before but never for long and never without deep regret. This institution does not look back proudly on the era of Joseph McCarthy nor on any of the other times when the politics of personal destruction poisoned its judgment. No, the Senate looks back on those things with shame and with the conviction that we cannot go down that road again. We know the Senate is better than this. We know the Nation deserves better than this. By confirming Judge Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, this brilliant jurist will be charged with up-holding the rule of law and honoring American justice. We must hold our-selves to that very same standard. We must seize the golden opportunity be-fore us today, to confirm a Supreme Court Justice who will make us proud, and to reaffirm our own commitment to the justice that every single Amer-ican deserves.

(Disturbance in the Visitors’ Gal-leries.) The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. As a reminder to our guests in the Galleries, expressions of approval or disapproval are not permitted in the Senate Galleries. On this vote, the yeas are 51, the nays are 49. The motion is agreed to. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The Senator from Texas. Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, as the world knows now, we just held a successful cloture vote on the nomina-tion of Brett Kavanaugh to become the next Associate Justice on the U.S. Su-preme Court. I am glad we were successful in clos-ing off debate. We now know that under the Senate rules, 30 hours are available for Senators to debate, and I am sure there will be many Senators who will be coming to the floor and of-fering their thoughts. To my mind, what the Senate just voted for was to end the games, the character assassination, and the in-timidation tactics that unfortunately have characterized so much of this con-firmation process. Our vote today was important, not only because it will allow us to move forward and conclude this confirmation process, but it was important because it showed the Sen-ate will not be intimidated. We will not be bullied by the streams of paid pro-testers and name-calling by the mob. We will not be complicit in the at-tempts to tarnish a good man’s char-acter, destroy his career, and further delay this confirmation process—a con-stitutional process of advice and con-sent. What has been particularly galling on the part of some of our colleagues over the last 24 hours is the fact that the FBI investigation they called for, they are virtually ignoring or, in some cases, disparaging. They called for that supplemental background investiga-tion just last Friday. Let’s all remem-ber what our friend the senior Senator from Minnesota said last weekend. He said: Let’s give this 1 week. Well, that is what we gave them. The junior Sen-ator from Delaware asked for the same period of time at the hearing—a 1- week-long FBI investigation. Our colleagues got what they asked for, and unfortunately, since they had already decided to vote against the nomination, they must have been somewhat disappointed that the sup-plemental background investigation came up with no new information, no corroboration at all. I actually think, in some ways, our colleagues who called for a 1-week delay have done us a favor because every lead that could be followed has been followed and exhausted. As the majority leader was saying earlier, in America, under our constitutional sys-tem, where we don’t presume you are guilty and require you to prove your innocence and where we believe in due process of law, I think the FBI inves-tigation was a useful way to dem-onstrate to the American people that none of these allegations that had been made against Judge Kavanaugh of sex-ual misconduct has been proven. It also, I think, gives us a chance to pivot from what has been a shameful and disgraceful confirmation process. If this is the new norm for the Senate— that somebody could be denied a con-firmation based on an unproven allega-tion—I can’t imagine people would be willing to subject themselves to that in the future. It would be a dark day for the Senate, for the United States, and for our system of justice that believes in a fair process and a constitutional presumption of innocence. When an al-legation is made, the person making that allegation actually has to come forward with some evidence. A number of Senators—actually, it was a bipartisan consensus—wanted the FBI to conduct a limited investiga-tion into current, credible allegations that were pending. They wanted the FBI to interview individuals like Mark Judge, who had already offered a sworn statement under penalty of felony, and others who may have had information who were identified by Dr. Ford as being present on the day this alleged activity took place. There was no con-firmation. There was no corroboration. In fact, there was a refutation. The people she said were there and could be witnesses to what happened said: I have no knowledge of that. Dr. Ford’s best friend, Leland Kaiser, said: I don’t even know Brett Kavanaugh. I never met him. Well, we have all had an opportunity to read the confidential report. We have seen who was interviewed, what they were asked. Any doubts people may have had should now have been put to rest by what the contents re-veal. These fantasies about Judge Kavanaugh being some sort of serial high school or college predator have been exposed as only that—myths not based on fact. There is no reliable evi-dence, whatsoever, to support any of these baseless allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. As we know, this wasn’t exactly de-signed to be a truth-finding process. This wasn’t a search for the truth. Our colleagues across the aisle already made up their mind a long time ago, some even before Judge Kavanaugh had been nominated. This was more of, as the majority leader said earlier today, not a search for the truth but a search- and-destroy mission. Obviously, as they continue to move the goalposts, calling for more delays, more investigations, there have been seven background investigations by the FBI of Judge Kavanaugh during his public service. The FBI talked to more than 150 witnesses. Don’t you think, if there were anything to these out-rageous allegations, some of that would have come up at some point in the seven FBI background investiga-tions that have been conducted? But our colleagues across the aisle continue to resist, putting a definitive end to this process and unfortunately caring little, if any, about the reputa-tion of somebody who has dem-onstrated his outstanding qualifica-tions and his commitment to public service. I think some of these attacks have become exhausting, politically ex-hausting, quite frankly. Our colleagues don’t realize what they have unleashed when Senators get coat hangers mailed to their home, paid protesters show up on their door-step or at their office or they are ac-costed in the Halls of the U.S. Con-gress. These paid protesters reportedly, once they get arrested, actually make more money from their funders than they do if they don’t get arrested. That is what has been unleashed. Chairman G
RASSLEY called it mob rule, and that is exactly right—where the Judiciary Committee, during the first confirmation hearing for Judge Kavanaugh, Senators said: I am break-ing the rules. I am releasing committee confidential information. I know the rules prohibit me from doing that—and they don’t care.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6566 October 5, 2018 
If there are no rules and there are no norms and if we don’t have enough re-spect for this institution and the peo-ple whose lives we touch, this is what gets unleashed. I feel bad for Dr. Ford, in particular. She wanted none of this three-ring cir-cus. She sent a letter to the ranking member and asked that her identity re-main confidential, only to find, after the first confirmation hearing, that it was leaked to the press. Then the press came to talk to her, and I guess she fig-ured she had no other recourse but to actually tell her story to the press once her wishes were violated. She didn’t consent to that. She didn’t au-thorize the release of that confidential letter to the press, but that is what happened. When we gave her an opportunity to have a bipartisan, professional inves-tigation, to have staff go out to Cali-fornia and interview her confidentially, she said: Nobody explained to me that was an option. Well, the lawyers that the ranking member referred her to ap-parently didn’t even tell their own cli-ent she had the opportunity to avoid this three-ring circus and the embar-rassment associated with it by doing something confidentially. That is how the Judiciary Committee ordinarily operates when allegations are made. They are investigated by committee staff or by the FBI—actu-ally by both—but that didn’t happen here until after this mob rule un-leashed what we have seen here in the last few weeks. We know, when Dr. Ford sent her let-ter to the ranking member, it wasn’t shared with the FBI initially. It wasn’t shared with Judiciary Committee in-vestigators. It wasn’t shared with the committee itself in a closed-door ses-sion, which followed the open session, where Judge Kavanaugh was asked about other personal matters that came up during the course of the back-ground investigation. The ranking member didn’t even attend that closed- door session, nor did anybody mention it to the judge when he went to talk to some 60-plus Members of the Senate one-on-one. The ranking member, when she had that one-on-one meeting with Judge Kavanaugh, said nothing to him about the allegations. She could have asked him about the allegations, generally, without revealing the identity of Dr. Ford. We know at that point, she had already talked to Dr. Ford and rec-ommended partisan lawyers. We know those lawyers arranged for a polygraph examination to be administered. Other preparations were being made, plans were being hatched. Our colleague from California said nothing. I really think that Dr. Ford has been treated terribly by this ambush, by this hiding of evidence and allegations that could have been investigated and should have been investigated in a more dignified and appropriate sort of way. Once Dr. Ford was identified, in con-sultation with colleagues—both Repub-licans and Democrats—we decided Dr. Ford should be given an opportunity to tell her side of the story. Unfortu-nately, we were not able to mitigate or reverse a lot of the awful cir-cumstances under which she had found herself because of what had already been unleashed, but we did our best. We tried to do whatever we could to ac-commodate her. As I said, investiga-tors offered to go to California. We brought in an experienced sexual crimes investigating attorney to ask questions in a respectful sort of way in order to illicit as much information as we possibly could get about her claim even though it was 35 years old. Throughout the hearing, we listened to Dr. Ford, and we tried to understand what she was telling us. We took her allegations seriously and treated her in the same way we would have wanted our wives or our daughters to have been treated if they had found them-selves in similar circumstances. Yet we knew, at the end of the day, there was no other witness to corroborate or to confirm what she had said, even by the ones she had identified as having been present. This is not about believing women or believing men. It is not a zero-sum game. As the junior Senator from Ne-braska said the other day, it is not about being for the #MeToo movement or against it. Who could be against it? I hope there is some good that comes out of this disgraceful display. One of the things that might be good would be that more women would feel confident in coming forward and telling their stories to the appropriate authorities and producing the sort of information that would be necessary to make a criminal case—to investigate the case, to charge the case, to try the case, and to convict the people who commit sex-ual offenses. I hope there is some good that comes out of this. There is also, maybe, some legislation that we could work on together to try to heal the wounds that have been caused by this abominable process. I have worked a lot with colleagues here to pass anti-human trafficking legislation, to end the rape kit back-log, and on other things to try to help victims. I think, maybe—just maybe— in putting our heads together, in talk-ing with each other, and in working in good faith, we could come up with some legislative response that might find some good from this terrible situa-tion. The other thing about these allega-tions that have been made against Judge Kavanaugh is that they are com-pletely out of character. We know he has been a circuit court judge for 12 years, authored more than 300 opin-ions, clerked for Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court, worked at the White House as a lawyer and as Staff Secretary for the President, taught at Harvard, and had been hired by now Justice Elena Kagan to teach at Har-vard, as well as having taught at Georgetown and Yale. By all accounts—every account of anyone with personal knowledge of Judge Kavanaugh’s character and treatment of women—he has treated women with respect. And it is not just conservatives who sing his praises. A liberal law school professor at Yale called Judge Kavanaugh’s selection the President’s finest hour, his classiest move. The same professor com-plimented Judge Kavanaugh’s stu-diousness and said he has already shown flashes of greatness. Lisa Blatt, a self-described liberal feminist lawyer who has argued numerous cases before the U.S. Supreme Court, has said Judge Kavanaugh is supremely qualified. That echoes what the American Bar Association has said—the gold stand-ard for some of our colleagues when it comes to judicial nominees. The Amer-ican Bar Association has said that Judge Kavanaugh is unanimously well qualified. That goes for his tempera-ment as well. So I believe this nominee is about as good as it gets. On July 10, the day after Judge Kavanaugh was nominated, I said that my Republican colleagues and I would not back down from this all-out assault on this nominee, but never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined that this fight would devolve into the mob rule that we have seen—of Sen-ators and staffs taunted, threatened, and of millions of dollars spent in ad-vertising and in paying protesters to show up on Senators’ front lawns, to harass them at restaurants, and to at-tack them in the halls of Congress. I never imagined that this would get this bad, when Senators would say ‘‘I am breaking the rules’’ and would dare anybody to do anything about it. This has turned into the kind of nasty and venomous politics that I had hoped never to experience. This also has demonstrated the dark underbelly of Washington, DC, where power is so important to some people that they will do anything to get it. They will destroy you. They will tar-nish your good name. They will con-done threats on family members, in-cluding on children. They will harass you. This has really been disgusting. I am an optimist, so I don’t believe this is our fate. I don’t believe we are condemned to work in a Senate and live in a country where this kind of ac-tivity is condoned or ignored. Actually, I think, by defeating Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination, we would be signaling that this is somehow the new normal. We would be setting the prece-dent of, yes, that kind of thing works, so let’s try it again. I am not saying it is just one party or the other. The day after Judge Kavanaugh was nominated, I also said we would defend the record of Judge Kavanaugh, who is a thoughtful public servant, against de-liberate attempts to denigrate him. I stand by that statement, and we have defended him. Yet we have not just de-fended him but have defended the Con-stitution, fundamental notions of fair-ness and fair play that are reflected in

our commitment to the due process of law, and the rights of somebody who has been accused of a crime, which Judge Kavanaugh has been accused of on multiple occasions. Even as the mud has been slung on all of us, even as insults have been hurled against this nominee and as his family has faced ridicule over atro-cious exploits that never even hap-pened, at least, I think, we can be proud of the fact we have tried to de-fend the Constitution, this institution of the Senate, and have pushed back with everything we have had against mob rule. Unfortunately, those who wanted to take down this nominee viewed Judge Kavanaugh as a sacrificial lamb in some sort of vengeance campaign. Thankfully, they have now failed to stop his nomination from going for-ward. This nomination is no longer simply about Judge Kavanaugh and the cur-rent vacancy on the Supreme Court; it is also about the principles we must stand up for and defend. It is about validating public service and decades of honorable conduct. It is not about for-getting all that a man has done, all that he is, and all that he has worked for at the drop of a hat based on unsub-stantiated, uncorroborated allegations. It is about standing firm in the turbu-lent political winds. If I think about any institution in this country, I think about the Senate and how it ought to be the place in which standing firm against the turbulent political winds occurs. We all had a chance to read the FBI report, which failed to corroborate Dr. Ford’s allegations. Then we did exactly what we needed to do today, which was to vote—to stop the circus, to stop the high jinks, to stop the character assas-sination, and vote. I am glad our col-leagues decided to close off debate now as this 30-hour postcloture period en-sues. I look forward to concluding the confirmation process and confirming Judge Kavanaugh to be the next Asso-ciate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The Senator from Illinois. Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I would like to respond to my colleague from Texas with regard to at least one or two aspects of what he said. He has characterized the opposition to Judge Kavanaugh as ‘‘mob rule.’’ I don’t think that is a fair characteriza-tion. The opposition to Judge Kavanaugh is on many different levels. My colleagues on both sides of the aisle have looked at this nomination seri-ously, and they have come to opposite positions. I don’t believe we are influ-enced, frightened, or in any way moved by mob rule. I just don’t get it. Have I seen conduct that I think is untoward and really should not be con-doned by people who feel strongly about this issue? Of course. Do I be-lieve that people should have their freedom of speech limited or stifled? No, I don’t. Even if it is something I don’t want to hear, people have a right to speak. Of course, I will never con-done violence or any physical activi-ties against anyone, including Mem-bers of Congress. Some people have ei-ther come close to that line or have stepped over it, but I don’t condone that in any way, shape or form. If we are truly committed to the Con-stitution that we have sworn to uphold and defend, the First Amendment cre-ates opportunities for American citi-zens that others around the world long for and never see once in their lives. Part of that is freedom of speech. Part of that is the right to petition your government. So if some have stepped over the line, I will not defend them when it comes to violent conduct, but in expressing their points of view with a sign or a march or even a chant, I have to say that it is part of our con-stitutional birthright, thank goodness, in the United States of America. Last week, I saw Dr. Christine Blasey Ford for the first time. I had heard her name for a week or more. I had seen one photo of her in sunglasses, but I had never seen her or heard her speak. She came forward at great risk to her-self and to her family after having been dislocated, with her kids, from two dif-ferent homes. She came here to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Nation and to speak under oath. She had absolutely nothing to gain by coming forward. She did it, as she said, out of a sense of civic duty. She wanted to, in her own words, be helpful so that the Senate and leaders of this Nation would know what had happened to her before there would be any vote on the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Her testimony was credible and powerful. She answered every question and tried to be helpful whenever she could. I was struck by the statement from the Senator from Texas. He said that in some way, we want to make sure that our wives and daughters are treat-ed fairly if they come forward with this kind of information. I couldn’t agree with him more, but we all know what happened after her testimony. Even President Trump, before a Mississippi rally, ridiculed and belittled Dr. Ford. After once calling her a credible wit-ness, she became the butt of his joke at a rally in Mississippi. That is unfortu-nate. When Dr. Ford came before us, she had nothing to hide. The Republicans on the committee were so concerned about her testimony and their relation-ship in the questioning of her that they were unwilling to risk direct ques-tioning as she sat in front of them. They pointedly enlisted a woman pros-ecutor to do their job. The prosecutor’s examination was meandering and with-out any clear focus other than as an at-tempt to try to discredit Dr. Ford. That Republican prosecutor failed as Dr. Ford calmly replied to all of her questions. It was clear, however, that despite this testimony, even despite this hear-ing, many Republicans had made up their minds, as the majority leader had characterized it, to plow right through regardless of Dr. Ford’s testimony. We hear so many tributes to Dr. Ford from the Republican side out of one side of their mouth, and then they turn around and say that it is a smear. A smear is a lie. I don’t believe she was lying. They can’t praise her on one hand and call her testimony a smear on the other. The majority leader did that for 3 suc-cessive days on the floor of the U.S. Senate. They even went so far as to schedule a committee vote before that hearing with Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh had started. Then, last Friday, two of our col-leagues, Republican Senator J
EFF F
LAKE and Democratic Senator C HRIS C
OONS , came together and joined Dr. Ford’s call for a nonpartisan and thor-ough FBI investigation into the pend-ing allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. That should have happened long before. Make no mistake. There would not have been a hearing with Dr. Ford were it not for Senator F
LAKE , a Republican Senator, demanding it, and there would not have been an FBI in-vestigation if he hadn’t demanded it as well. I thank him for his leadership in doing that. Those were two reasonable requests, and I am glad that he was in a position to make it happen when Democrats could not. It was the right request. Of course it would have been helpful for Senators exercising the advice and consent role if neutral investigators at the FBI were allowed to question all of the relevant witnesses, follow the facts wherever they may have led, and get to the bottom of the allegations brought by Dr. Ford, Deborah Ramirez, and Julie Swetnick. Unfortunately, the White House and Senate Republicans were determined not to let such an FBI investigation go forward. A Whitehouse spokesman, Raj Shah, has now publicly acknowledged that Senate Republicans were allowed to se-verely constrain the scope of the FBI investigation. He said it. He said it publicly. He said it before the cameras. Senate Republicans allowed only a handful of witnesses to be interviewed by the FBI. Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah said: ‘‘There was an initial list of four’’—four—‘‘provided to us by the Senate.’’ There were reportedly al-most 40 corroborating or character wit-nesses who have been trying to share information with the FBI. The FBI has refused to contact them, even though their names had been provided. Dr. Ford’s and Deborah Ramirez’s at-torneys both sent letters yesterday with lists of corroborating witnesses who were not interviewed by the FBI. There is no good explanation as to why these witnesses weren’t interviewed by the FBI, nor can I explain why Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh themselves weren’t interviewed. Those are basic steps for a legitimate and credible in-vestigation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6568 October 5, 2018 
Some of my Republican colleagues have claimed that the FBI’s supple-mental investigation provides no cor-roboration of Dr. Ford’s or Ms. Rami-rez’s complaints, but, of course, you will not find corroboration if the inves-tigation systematically excludes cor-roborating witnesses. Unfortunately, the effort by the White House and Senate Republicans to tie the FBI’s hands in the Kavanaugh investigation is part of a pattern of concealment when it comes to the background of Brett Kavanaugh. The Senator from Texas says: I hope this isn’t a new standard for hearings on Supreme Court nominations. I hope it isn’t either. There are some things we have done in this particular nomi-nation hearing that were unheard of. Millions of pages of Judge Kavanaugh’s public service record have been blocked from release to the public and even to the Senate. There was a time when Senator Jeff Sessions—now Attorney General—demanded docu-mentation on Democratic nominees, and at that time the Democratic chair-man agreed with him. We provided all of the information requested, as we should have. In this case, with Repub-licans controlling the committee, we were limited. We have been denied access to an en-tire 35-month period in Judge Kavanaugh’s White House career when he worked as one of the President’s closest advisers as the White House Staff Secretary. During that time, he worked on controversial issues, such as same-sex marriage, abortion, torture, and Executive power. It is likely that there are documents in Kavanaugh’s Staff Secretary record that would impact how Senators would vote on his nomination, and that is why they were hidden. There was also an unprecedented par-tisan effort to screen and limit the doc-uments that the committee itself could see. I listened as the Senator from Texas said: Dr. Ford had a partisan lawyer. Well, guess who screened the documents that were going to go from the official archives to our Judiciary Committee to review for the nomina-tion of Brett Kavanaugh. The man’s name is Bill Burck. He is Kavanaugh’s former deputy. By every measure, Bill Burck is a partisan lawyer. I guess it is no surprise. What I was surprised was to find that an individual lawyer would have such power over a constitutional provision of advice and consent. Overall, when all is said and done, after the denials from the White House of certain records, after the claims of Executive privilege, after Bill Burck went through and screened what he considered to be appropriate and inap-propriate documents for the American people to see, less than 10 percent of Judge Kavanaugh’s White House record has been disclosed. Those documents are going to come out some day, and those who are quick-ly voting for him now without reading them run the risk that they are mak-ing a mistake, which they are going to have to explain at a later time. Just yesterday we learned from a FOIA lawsuit that the National Ar-chives has hundreds of documents con-cerning Brett Kavanaugh’s work in the White House on warrantless surveil-lance programs. We will not see those documents before tomorrow’s vote. The White House apparently fears their contents and prefers to plow through. Why has so much of Judge Kavanaugh’s record been concealed? Most likely because these documents contradict what he said. We have seen a pattern with Judge Kavanaugh from his Senate testimony in 2004, 2006, and again last month. When he is asked about controversial issues that he has been involved with in the past, he tries to deny or downplay them. He has done this repeatedly when testifying about matters he worked on at the White House, including the rules governing detention of combatants; warrantless surveillance; controversial judicial nominations, such as Pryor, Pickering, and Haynes; communicating with the press during the Starr investigation; and his work with Manny Miranda, a Republican Senate staffer who stole documents from Democratic Senators’ computers, including my own, and shared them with Brett Kavanaugh when he was working at the White House. On each issue, we have seen docu-ments and reports showing that Judge Kavanaugh had far more involvement than his testimony let on. On issue after issue, Judge Kavanaugh’s sworn testimony was either misleading or false. This is a judge who claims that words matter. He says that he is a strict textualist who holds other people ac-countable for their words, but when it comes to his own words, he is happy to take liberties and refuses to take re-sponsibility. We have been forewarned of what we can expect if he is given a lifetime appointment on the Court. We saw this pattern again last week when he was asked about his high school yearbook and excessive drink-ing. They were legitimate questions that were relevant to the sexual as-sault allegations at hand. Many of Kavanaugh’s answers to these ques-tions simply weren’t credible. His ex-planation of things he wrote in the yearbook didn’t pass the laugh test. Multiple people who knew him and so-cialized with him quickly and publicly rebutted his denial that he ever drank, in their words, ‘‘to the point that it would be impossible for him to state with any degree of certainty that he remembered everything that he did.’’ I was particularly struck when Sen-ator A
MYKLOBUCHAR of Minnesota ex-plained that she understands alcohol abuse because her father was an alco-holic and then asked Judge Kavanaugh if he had ever blacked out. Instead of responding, Kavanaugh said: ‘‘Have you?’’ Conservative columnist Jennifer Rubin has written: ‘‘It was a moment of singular cruelty and disrespect.’’ It has been hard to take Judge Kavanaugh’s testimony at his word on matters both large and small. That matters a lot when we are talking about a nominee’s judgment, tempera-ment, and integrity. Judge Kavanaugh’s judicial record and his academic writings raise even more concerns. Not only did he check the box on President Trump’s litmus test of opposition to the Affordable Care Act and Roe v. Wade, his judicial opinions consistently find ways to favor big business and undermine pro-tection for workers, consumers, women, and the environment. He claims to be a textualist, but he has a habit of creatively defining words. In the Agriprocessors case, which I asked him about directly in the hearing, his dissent abandoned the text of the controlling statute. Instead, he borrowed a definition from another statute in order to argue against the right of slaughterhouse workers to vote to form a union. When I asked Judge Kavanaugh whether he ever worked in a job himself that was dirty and dangerous, as dangerous as a slaughterhouse, he told me he used to cut grass and worked one summer in construction. Look at his dissents in the White Stallion and Mingo Logan cases, where the judge gave his own definitions to key terms in the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts—so much for stare decisis. Judge Kavanaugh claims he follows precedent, but as we have seen in case after case, he goes his own way. Look at his interpretation in the Su-preme Court’s 2008 Heller decision. Judge Kavanaugh believes the Supreme Court created a history and tradition test for considering challenges to gun safety laws. This test would have courts ignore the public safety impact of gun laws. Judge Kavanaugh admit-ted that he is ‘‘a lonely voice in read-ing Heller that way.’’ His approach would put at risk many commonsense laws, such as keeping guns out of the hands of domestic abus-ers. Judge Kavanaugh is not a lonely voice on gun safety; he is an extreme and frightening voice on gun safety. After he wrote a dissent laying out his interpretation of the Heller prece-dent, a majority panel of DC Circuit judges—all of them Republican ap-pointees—said this of his interpreta-tion: ‘‘Unlike our dissenting colleague, we read Heller straightforwardly.’’ Judge Kavanaugh’s reading of Heller may be music to the ears of the gun lobby, but it is manipulating prece-dent, nothing else. Judge Kavanaugh’s claim that he fol-lows precedent is also contradicted by his view of the Supreme Court decision Morrison v. Olson. Rather than admit the majority’s decision in the case still holds, Judge Kavanaugh clings to Jus-tice Scalia’s dissent, which lays out the so-called ‘‘unitary executive the-ory’’ of Presidential power. Judge Kavanaugh has been explicit that he would overturn Morrison. Let’s

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6569 October 5, 2018 
be clear. While Judge Kavanaugh may claim that he will scrupulously follow precedent, he has shown he is willing to overturn it when it suits him. I have cited just a few examples. Also particularly troubling is this judge’s view of Presidential power. Judge Kavanaugh wrote a striking pas-sage in the Seven-Sky decision, dis-senting from the majority’s upholding of the Affordable Care Act. He wrote: ‘‘Under the Constitution, the President may decline to enforce a statute that regulates private individuals when the President deems the statute unconsti-tutional, even if a court has held or would hold the statute constitutional.’’ This is a truly breathtaking claim of Presidential power, a claim particu-larly problematic at this moment in history. Then there is Judge Kavanaugh’s evolving view on investigations of sit-ting Presidents. When he was working for Ken Starr and investigating Presi-dent Clinton, he was pretty ferocious. But in 2008, he gave a speech and wrote a law review article arguing that sit-ting Presidents should be immunized from criminal investigations and civil suit. This was after Judge Kavanaugh spent a period of time working in the Bush White House. He claims that he has an open mind on the constitutionality of criminal in-vestigations of sitting Presidents, but consider what he wrote in that law re-view article in the Minnesota Law Re-view: 
If the President does something dastardly, the impeachment process is available. No single prosecutor, judge, or jury should be able to accomplish what the Constitution as-signs to Congress. 
These are not the words of a judge with an open mind. It was a telling moment when Judge Kavanaugh at his hearing would not answer whether he believed a President should comply with a grand jury sub-poena. Here is the reality: We have to con-sider why this President chose this Su-preme Court nominee at this moment in history when the Mueller investiga-tion is closing in. Just a few weeks ago, Judge Kavanaugh himself said: ‘‘The Supreme Court must never be viewed as a par-tisan institution.’’ But the testimony and demeanor of Judge Kavanaugh last Thursday belies any claim he makes of nonpartisanship. I can understand emotion and indig-nation from Judge Kavanaugh when one considers the gravity of the charges against him and the pain he and his family must feel, but there was fire in his eyes when he read the words he assured us he had personally writ-ten. Benjamin Wittes has been a col-league of Brett Kavanaugh. He has pub-lished his writings, and he even lent his name as a character reference for the judge. He called Judge Kavanaugh’s performance before the Senate Judici-ary Committee ‘‘a howl of rage.’’ Wittes went on to describe Kavanaugh’s partisanship as ‘‘raw, undisguised, naked and conspira-torial.’’ Charlie Sykes, a conservative com-mentator, said of Kavanaugh’s state-ment before the committee last Thurs-day: ‘‘Even if you support Brett Kavanaugh . . . that was breathtaking as an abandonment of any pretense of having a judicial temperament.’’ Judge Kavanaugh abandoned any ve-neer of neutrality last week before our committee. Out of one side of his mouth, he claimed that he bore ‘‘no ill will’’ to-ward Dr. Ford. Then he called her alle-gations ‘‘a calculated and orchestrated political hit,’’ citing ‘‘apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election and revenge on behalf of the Clintons.’’ He even threatened Democrats when he said: ‘‘What goes around comes around.’’ In my 20 years on the Judiciary Com-mittee, I have never heard anything like that—or even close to that—from a judicial nominee. It is hard to imag-ine how a nominee who has displayed such raw partisanship could then claim to serve as a neutral umpire on the Su-preme Court. Judge Kavanaugh, through his testimony, has called his own impartiality into serious doubt. Retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, a man who is respected for his integrity and service to this Na-tion, said this week that the perform-ance by Judge Kavanaugh shows he should not serve on the Supreme Court. I agree. At a time when our President plumbs the depths of bad behavior on a daily basis, we should not allow the highest Court in our land to now sink to that same standard in their ranks. From a broader perspective, let’s be clear what is at stake in this decision. We are at a moment in American his-tory where our system of checks and balances is being profoundly tested. We have a President who has shown dis-respect for the rule of law and the role of an independent judiciary. It is likely the Supreme Court will soon consider fundamental questions about Presi-dential authority and accountability. With so much at stake, we should not confirm a nominee to the Court unless we are sure of that nominee’s credi-bility, integrity, independence, and judgment. Serious questions have been raised about Brett Kavanaugh. Dr. Ford’s tes-timony was serious and credible. When I asked her directly what degree of cer-tainty do you have that Brett Kavanaugh was your attacker, Dr. Ford answered, without hesitation: ‘‘100 percent.’’ I believe her. Judge Kavanaugh’s testimony was simply not credible. From his con-trived explanations of his embarrassing yearbook entries, to his ‘‘I love beer’’ declarations, he was a sharp contrast to Dr. Ford’s measured accounting of a horrible day in her life she cannot for-get. I had hoped the FBI would be able to provide us with information to resolve unanswered questions, but they can’t do their job if their hands are tied. When the Republicans in the com-mittee and the White House decided to limit the number of witnesses, unfortu-nately, the investigation could not be completed to meet professional stand-ards. I will say this to my colleagues. We have to think about what it would mean if Judge Kavanaugh were to be confirmed to the Supreme Court with credible sexual assault allegations against him. Specifically, what it would mean to the millions of women across America who are survivors of sexual assault—women who have been scared to come forward with their sto-ries for fear of being mocked, ridiculed, and shunned. What would it mean for them to see Brett Kavanaugh sitting on that bench in that Court across the street, day after day, for decades, cast-ing what may be the deciding vote on cases that profoundly affect their rights. It would shake the confidence of millions of Americans in the integrity of our Supreme Court. We should not take that risk. There are other qualified lawyers be-sides Brett Kavanaugh who could be nominated for this vacant seat—nomi-nees whose legal views I may not agree with but who do not have serious ques-tions about their fitness for office. If there are serious questions about a nominee’s temperament, credibility, or judgment—as there clearly are for Judge Brett Kavanaugh—we owe a duty of caution. We should give the benefit of the doubt to protect the integrity of the Supreme Court. With so much at stake, we should not confirm a nominee to the Court unless we are sure the nominee’s qualifica-tions are beyond question. I do not have that confidence in Brett Kavanaugh. I will vote no on his nomi-nation. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. K
EN-
NEDY ). The Senator from North Caro-lina. Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I would like to summarize. The Presiding Offi-cer and I have had a front row seat in this process. We both serve on the Ju-diciary Committee. I think oftentimes people come to the floor, and they want to just give the American public a little slice of what is going on that benefits their narrative rather than stepping back and thinking about what has happened since early July when Judge Kavanaugh was nominated to be on the Supreme Court. That happened on July 9. Before July 9, there were many peo-ple on the other side of the aisle who had already announced their opposition not to Judge Kavanaugh but to anyone whom President Trump would nomi-nate. We know who they are. They are very well publicized. I understand that. As a Member of the Democratic con-ference, I wouldn’t deny them their

right to do that. They oppose the President and anything he stands for. Then, on July 10, there was a press conference, now that we knew who the nominee was, and a majority of the Democratic Members also said they op-posed him. As a matter of fact, the mi-nority leader said he would fight the nomination with everything he has, and he has, but there are some pieces to the mechanics that I think are im-portant for people to understand. Briefly, after Judge Kavanaugh was nominated, the chair and the ranking member got together, and they tried to come up with a framework for releas-ing as many documents as possible. In fact, that went on for 2 or 3 weeks. In fact, the documents some of my col-leagues on the other side of the aisle said the Republicans refused to produce were going to be made available on a very focused basis but with what they call search terms—the way to get into those 100,000 secret documents they are talking about. We estimate that if our colleagues on the other side of the aisle would have done what they have tradi-tionally done—that is, come up with an agreement on document production— they would have gained a lot of in-sights into the documents we consid-ered relevant but not necessarily the documents they would like to use to create another political narrative, but they refused to cooperate, and we moved forward. As a matter of fact, we moved forward and provided more doc-uments for this Supreme Court nomi-nee than the total number of docu-ments provided for all, in total, of the last three or four Supreme Court nomi-nees. We also went on to question—they call it questions for the record. What that means is that any member on the committee is entitled to compel the nominee to answer questions after the hearing. Judge Kavanaugh was sub-jected to over 1,200 questions for the record, under oath, that he had to sub-mit back to the committee members. Those questions for the record are a multiple of any one nominee in the past; and, in fact, I understand it is probably the sum total of questions for the record that all the nominees on the bench were subjected to. So the questions were asked. The documents were presented. All of that document production was going on in the latter part of July and August; the first tranche of documents came in about the second week of August. What else was going on in the latter part of July and August? A letter, which was first submitted to a Con-gresswoman from California, was then routed to the ranking member, the sen-ior Senator from California, at the end of July—a document that was expected to be held in confidence. It is a docu-ment we now know was authored by Dr. Ford, provided to the Judiciary Committee, with the understanding that her name would not become pub-lic. In the past, the chair and the ranking member have a great relationship. They have a trusting relationship. In the past, when you had something you thought was material to the consider-ation of a nominee, a ranking member and a chair would try to figure out how to actually assess that information to treat the person in question—in this case, Dr. Ford—fairly and to hold her information in confidence. That didn’t happen here. Actually, there was no communication with the chair by the ranking member. A few weeks into it, we do know there was some consultation from what Dr. Ford says was a committee staffer to retain an attorney who has a very well-publicized reputation for being partisan. I don’t have any problem with that because we have partisan at-torneys on both sides of the aisle, but at the recommendation of the com-mittee staff, which is what Dr. Ford said under oath, they retained an at-torney who is working pro bono. Now, I am really wondering whether some—not all but some—of the people on the other side of the aisle genuinely cared about what I believe is a trau-matic experience in Dr. Ford’s life, genuinely care about trying to go through a process that would provide Dr. Ford with some closure because if they had, maybe they would have got-ten someone who could interview her in the way that people experienced with sex crimes interview persons who have experienced a traumatic event. These attorneys who were retained didn’t do that. Maybe, when the attor-neys she retained, who are pro bono at-torneys—that means they are not being paid, they are doing it at no cost or at least no cost to Dr. Ford—if the attorneys really cared about Dr. Ford versus the outcome, maybe they should have recommended to Dr. Ford to have the hearing, but that didn’t happen ei-ther. Now we move further through, and at the hearing—we had 32 hours of hear-ings. The letter was known to the ranking member. I don’t believe it was known to any other member on the committee—32 hours of hearings. Each one of us had two rounds, virtually an hour to ask questions of Judge Kavanaugh, not even an abstracted se-ries of questions protecting the iden-tity of Dr. Ford but questions that could have potentially raised the issues we now saw after the hearing. Thirty- two hours of hearings, nothing men-tioned. An hour and a half private hearing that, unfortunately, Senator F
EINSTEIN , for whatever reason, wasn’t able to attend, never brought up. After the hearing, then we heard about these allegations. Now, I have had some people on the other side of the aisle say we rushed the committee process. The fact is, it was delayed for 2 weeks after we found out about the allegation; 1 week was to get to a point to where we could ac-commodate Dr. Ford and have her come and testify before the committee. Chairman G
RASSLEY was criticized by some of the folks on my side of the aisle because they said he shouldn’t be accommodating, delaying; set a dead-line and moving forward. He didn’t. He spent the weekend trying to figure out a setting, a method, that Dr. Ford would be comfortable with. Let me back up a week earlier. A week earlier, the chairman and the committee offered to Dr. Ford to go to California to interview her outside of the lights, outside of the circus that sometimes occurs here, and have the attorneys present during the interview. In the hearing we had with Dr. Ford, the question was asked: Were you aware that the committee offered to come to California in a confidential setting and allow you to give your tes-timony? Her response to that question was: I did not understand that. So that really raises a lot of doubts in my mind about either the competence or the agenda of her counsel. So now, at this point, I believe there are two sets of people who are opposed to Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination. There are some who just genuinely dis-agree with his judicial philosophy. I ac-tually vote for some judges when I dis-agree with their judicial philosophy. There are some on the agenda that I will again, but I am going to vote for them—and I am going to get criticized by people on the right side of the aisle—because they are considered unanimously ‘‘well qualified’’ and just because I don’t like the way they rule in certain cases, that is not enough reason to vote against them, but maybe for people on the other side of the aisle there is. Then there is another group of people over there who I genuinely believe have used witnesses, have used this process, to just advance a political message and a political agenda. Another reason I believe that is how the narrative changes depending on what sticks. We have received the addi-tional background investigation. I should mention Judge Kavanaugh has had seven background investigations over the last 25 years. I saw a stack of documents in a secure facility that is about that thick; I would estimate 600 to 1,000 pages of prior Federal FBI background investigations to clear him for other roles he has had, as well as in this case. Over 25 years talking to 150 people, some as recently as about 10 years, or less than 10 years after he was in college, and not a whiff of any of the allegations we have seen put forward— not a single note. So as more information comes up, we see the narrative going from the weight of the allegations—because, honestly, in every instance where an accuser has made an allegation and said these people were present, those people have been interviewed if they were willing to, and none of them have corroborated the allegations that were made—none. In the followup investiga-tion, it even further undermined the sort of inference you draw when some-body says: Yes, these people were there. Check with them. We went back

and checked with them, and it further undermined the veracity of the allega-tions that were made. Now it looks like the narrative on the allegations is beginning to wane, so now the new narrative—and this is the last I will be talking about—is that, well, even if the allegations are untrue, the way Judge Kavanaugh behaved in the hearing—he was angry—raises a question about his judicial tempera-ment. Ladies and gentlemen, first, the American Bar Association has voted Judge Kavanaugh unanimously ‘‘well qualified’’ twice. In at least the most recent rating, they even spoke specifi-cally to his temperament on the bench. I saw his temperament during the hear-ing for 32 hours. He sat in that chair in some cases for 2 or 3 hours without get-ting up and was patient when some un-fair questions were being asked. He was cut off repeatedly, and he maintained his composure. He did well in about 31, 32 hours’ worth of testimony. Last week, I didn’t see Judge Kavanaugh in the hearing; I saw Brett Kavanaugh. I saw a father, I saw a hus-band, I saw a son who was defending his honor. I saw somebody dragged through the mud without a single alle-gation with any corroborating testi-mony defending himself as a human being, and he did well for about 2 hours. One final note. I firmly believe that Judge Kavanaugh is going to go to the Bench, and I firmly believe that be-cause of his independence, he is going to make some rulings that I am not going to like, but he is going to do it for the right reasons. What he is going to say is ‘‘Instead of treating us like a nine-member legisla-ture, go do your job, Congress. Change the law if you want me to have a dif-ferent opinion’’ when it comes to the Court. We should now be in that light, thinking about how we work together on a bipartisan basis to change things that we don’t like, not expecting a nine-member legislature to do our job. This has been a very difficult process. I know it has been extraordinarily dif-ficult for the Kavanaugh family and for Dr. Ford. I pray for Dr. Ford’s peace. I hope she finds closure. I hope there is some way she will be able to reexamine the facts of that summer in 1982 or 1983 and identify precisely what happened, precisely who can corroborate it, and have someone held accountable for that act. But I don’t believe by any stretch of the imagination, based on the information presented to us, that that is Judge Brett Kavanaugh. For that reason, I will be voting no tomor-row—I will not be voting no tomorrow; I will be voting yes tomorrow. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Oregon. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the deep-ly misguided vote to move forward on Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination has taken the Senate a step closer to a mo-ment that will cause enormous pain for millions of Americans, particularly women and survivors of assault. Some may say that the Senate is rolling back the clock on women in America by confirming Brett Kavanaugh. After seeing what has hap-pened to the women who have spoken out and talking to women in Oregon, I question how much the clock ever ticked forward. Indeed, this process has shone a spotlight on the double stand-ard women across this country face just so they will be believed. On the other hand, Dr. Ford never wanted any of this. The way she has been treated by Republicans in the Senate and the President of the United States is inexcusable. In one of the most un-Presidential speeches I have ever seen or heard, the President belit-tled a survivor in front of a crowd of thousands. Dr. Ford came to us as a citizen who was doing her civic duty to provide the Senate with crucial information about a nominee before us. She called the front desk of her Congressperson; she didn’t run to the news media or the cable shows or try to sell a book. She volunteered to tell her story under oath. She recounted the details of her assault in 18 minutes of testimony that will not soon be forgotten. It was heartbreaking to watch. At times, it was just excruciating. What did Dr. Ford get for her cour-age? She was put on trial by the Repub-licans on the Judiciary Committee, who actually hired an experienced prosecutor to grill her. The questioning was clearly designed to tar Dr. Ford as a political pawn. It attempted to delegitimize the trauma caused by her assault. It attempted to paint her as a liar. It was stunning how little of the questioning Republicans subjected her to was focused on what Brett Kavanaugh did on the night in ques-tion. It is clear now that the focus was on undermining Dr. Ford’s story and destroying her credibility. But Dr. Ford’s credibility held up. I have said that I can’t imagine a more credible witness, nor can I imagine how dif-ficult it must have been for her to re-live that experience and maintain such extraordinary composure. What she did took unknowable strength. Her testi-mony, delivered under what amounted to prosecution, was unforgettable. She is trained in psychology. She was even forced to act as the expert witness in her own trial, diagnosing the lifelong effects of her own trauma. She ex-plained to the committee how memo-ries of traumatic events implant them-selves on the brain. At one point, she described what she remembered most about the assault by Mr. Kavanaugh and Mark Judge. She answered, delivering on her training, that ‘‘indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter.’’ I believe Dr. Ford when she says she was assaulted in that room in 1982. I believe Dr. Ford when she says that her attackers locked the door, a hand was pressed over her mouth, and she feared for her life. I believe her when she says she remembers them laughing. For all the grueling prosecution the Republicans put Dr. Ford through, it is important to compare that to the treatment of Brett Kavanaugh. When it was Kavanaugh’s turn to deliver testi-mony, he was seething. He was raging in a manner completely unbecoming a Federal judge. He behaved in a manner that directly contradicted what Brett Kavanaugh said in a widely publicized speech a judge should be all about. In his own words, Mr. Kavanaugh said judges need to keep their emotions in check, to be calm amidst the storm. Mr. Kavanaugh failed his own test—his own test—last week. He offered the most partisan testimony I can recall when he talked about the Clintons and said ‘‘what goes around comes around.’’ Imagine if a female nominee had snapped at a male Senator about his drinking habits. The President of the Senate is an experienced judge and prosecutor. I am telling you, if a fe-male nominee had done that, game over right there—right there. There again, you have the double standard. When a few questions posed by the Republican prosecutor actually got to relevant questions, the majority side of the committee told her to just take off. For that to be the only hearing on these allegations I think is just plain disgraceful. The committee should not have moved on to the vote. The allega-tions brought forward demanded a ro-bust investigation. Yet the Senate has ended up light-years away from that. What kind of investigation looks to settle matters and doesn’t interview the accuser and the accused? That just doesn’t pass the smell test. This is not about tarnishing Brett Kavanaugh’s reputation or digging up salacious details from his high school days. The accusations against Mr. Kavanaugh and the possibility of per-jury—both of which he denies—relate directly to his binge drinking and sex-ual behavior. That is why the FBI background check should have been a robust inquiry into those matters. It is clear now that didn’t happen. You ask yourself, why not? It is hard to find an explanation other than the investiga-tion was handcuffed to predetermine the outcome. Dr. Ford has said publicly that the FBI didn’t talk to her, and they didn’t look at the therapy notes she offered to turn over. They didn’t talk to Mr. Kavanaugh. They didn’t talk to the dozens of individuals who Deborah Ra-mirez said could potentially corrobo-rate her story. They closed the inves-tigation a full day ahead of the arbi-trary deadline, and it is not clear why. Based on that, in my view, this inves-tigation was a whitewash. It was not legitimate. It was the product of in-tense political meddling, in my view, by the Trump administration. That means, if Brett Kavanaugh’s nomina-tion is confirmed, there are going to be questions about his legitimacy looming large for years to come.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6572 October 5, 2018 
I believe Dr. Ford. I have heard the Presiding Officer discussing this this morning on television. I respectfully would say I know the Presiding Officer doesn’t share my view. But I felt that Brett Kavanaugh’s behavior before the Senate last week ought to be disquali-fying on its own. If you compare what he said last week to what he wrote ought to be the requirements for how a judge behaves, there is a very large gap between what Brett Kavanaugh said ought to be expected of a judge’s be-havior and what we saw last week when he testified. From the time his nomination was announced, Kavanaugh portrayed him-self as a trustworthy individual who had the kind of levelheaded tempera-ment Americans expect and deserve from members of the judiciary. My view was that appearance last week be-fore the committee my colleague serves on was a textbook case of raw partisanship. In his afternoon testimony last week, Brett Kavanaugh was disdainful and sarcastic toward the Democratic Sen-ators who questioned him. Brett Kavanaugh responded to what he con-sidered to be unsubstantiated allega-tions by making truly unsubstantiated allegations of his own. Without any evidence, he declared the credible accu-sations that had been brought forward a ‘‘calculated and orchestrated polit-ical hit’’ by the Democrats. He pushed these baseless, conspiratorial com-ments about how this was all just re-venge for the Clintons. And in a tone that just struck me as dripping with menace, he just said: ‘‘What goes around comes around.’’ If you look last week at how he pre-sented himself to the chairman of the Senate’s committee, I think you have to ask yourself: How can anybody ex-pect that Brett Kavanaugh would offer a fair hearing in a politically charged case? My conclusion, based on what I have described, is pretty simple. You just do not get to behave the way Brett Kavanaugh behaved last week and get to serve on the United States Supreme Court. Finally, my concerns go further than the temper tantrum we saw last week. There is hard evidence that shows that Brett Kavanaugh lied repeatedly and on a variety of subjects. For example, just yesterday, there was new evidence in scores of emails that the nominee lied about his involvement in govern-ment wiretapping programs. The Presiding Officer of the Senate has been very gracious over the years in talking to me about these issues. He knows I care deeply, as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, about government wiretapping pro-grams. I am here this afternoon to say I am not alone. Millions of Americans care about this issue. As I have said in my conversations with the Presiding Officer of the Senate, security and lib-erty are not mutually exclusive. You can have both. What these emails—scores of them yesterday—prove is there is new evi-dence that Brett Kavanaugh did not tell the truth about his involvement in government wiretapping programs. There is hard evidence that shows he lied about using stolen documents, hard evidence that shows he lied about his involvement in the confirmation process of certain Bush nominees, hard evidence about the statements made by the other individuals who were present at the party where Dr. Ford was as-saulted, hard evidence the nominee lied about when he learned of the second set of allegations made against him. The nominee even lied about small stuff. When you can’t trust somebody to tell the truth, they don’t belong on the Supreme Court. It is important, before I wrap this up, to take a hard look at what has hap-pened to the Court over the last few years. In 2016, Senate Republicans blocked a mainstream nominee to the Court—an individual who many Repub-licans had praised extensively—exten-sively—in the past. They held a Su-preme Court seat open for nearly a year until a Republican President picked someone to their liking. In 2018, the Trump White House interfered with the vetting of a second nominee, hiding key information from the Senate and the American people. The floor debate on this nomination is going to be cut off before all the questions about sexual misconduct can be answered and before the statements I have outlined here today—ones where there is hard evidence—can be exam-ined for perjury. These actions by the Republicans and the Trump White House, in my view, are taking a sledge-hammer to the public’s trust in the Court as an institution. The Court used to have a healthy separation from the partisan battles that take place here in the Congress. I heard my colleague talking about that this morning on television. That healthy separation doesn’t exist today. I just say, we have a lot of heavy lift-ing to do in the U.S. Senate to revive the vision of the Supreme Court held by the Founding Fathers after what has happened. I am going to close by going back to the question of whether anything has changed since 1991 and the tragedy of Professor Hill. When Professor Hill tes-tified in 1991, she was dragged through the mud. She was called a scorned woman. Perhaps you can say it rep-resents some measure of progress that Dr. Ford wasn’t slandered and insulted in quite the same way. But I don’t know how much that matters if this nominee is confirmed. The language used during the debate might sound different, but the outcome is the same. The failure by my col-leagues on the other side to step back, suspend the partisan warfare, and rec-ognize the seriousness and legitimacy of this information, in my view, will go down over time as a historic dis-appointment. This was never a smear campaign. It wasn’t a political hit job. Dr. Ford came forward out of a sense of civic duty. She knew the sacrifice she faced, and she wondered to herself if it would really make a difference. Why suffer through annihilation if it will not mat-ter, she asked. Over and over again, she told us she only wanted to be helpful. I have never seen a witness—like my col-league presiding today, I have seen a lot of witnesses. She was a textbook case of being courteous, always saying: What can I do to be helpful? Senators ought to consider the dan-gerous signal being sent to survivors of assault and to young people across the country from this debate. Dr. Ford wasn’t on trial; nonetheless, she was prosecuted by the majority party. She got smeared as a political pawn, a liar, belittled, with her accusations dis-missed by many almost immediately. I made notion of how, a few days ago, the President mocked Dr. Ford, mocked her in front of thousands. What a cruel and un-Presidential mo-ment. If the mockery and dismissiveness are not bad enough—if they weren’t bad enough, there is the return of the sickening old notion that boys will be boys, what happened in the bedroom was ‘‘roughhousing,’’ and what happened was just too long ago. Today, survivors from sea to shining sea are asking: How are we going to be heard? How will we find justice? I fear many survivors are going to conclude that coming forward with their story is going to be pointless, and there is very little likelihood of jus-tice—very little likelihood of justice. Even if you are strong, composed, and constantly courteous, it will not help. On the other hand, the signal to boys is this: Even if you engage in violence against women and lie about your con-duct, the power structure is going to step up and protect you. The Senate has to be better than this. I hope Senators are going to recog-nize that it is time to take these hor-ribly outdated attitudes towards women and sweep them out like the cobwebs from an abandoned theater stage and start over. It can begin by re-jecting this nomination today. I will be voting no. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Florida. Mr. RUBIO.

the Supreme Court, which, in my opin-ion, is to interpret and to apply the Constitution, not to change or manipu-late it to reach a certain policy goal. There is broad bipartisan support for the first two parts of my criteria. We can all agree that people who serve on the Court should have the character to do so. We can all agree our nominees and those who serve on the Court have to have the intellect and the experi-ence and the academic credentials to be on the Court. Much of our fights around here cen-ter around the third part of my cri-teria. In fact, it goes to the heart of most of the nomination fights we have. There are some who would like the Su-preme Court to become a policymaking branch, a place that makes policy and makes laws, but I believe the job of an appellate court is to decide whether a policy decision of the political branches is constitutional. Appellate courts and trial courts are different. Trial courts are triers of fact. Appel-late courts are triers of law. The debate about the proper role of the Court plays out most vividly on some of the most divisive cultural issues, and it always has. For example, on the difficult issue of abortion, the question before the Court in Roe v. Wade was not whether it was good or bad for abortion to be criminalized or constricted, the question was whether the Constitution gave the State or Fed-eral Government the authority to pass laws that banned or restricted abor-tions. The question before the Court in Obergefell v. Hodges was not whether same-sex marriages were good or bad for America. The question was whether the Constitution allowed States to de-fine marriage as being between one man and one woman. In deciding these kinds of questions, I believe Justices, both on the Supreme Court and appellate-level judges, should apply the strictest interpreta-tion of the Constitution according to its original intent, irrespective of whether the policy result of their deci-sion is something they personally agree with. The reason for that is be-cause if the Constitution can mean whatever people at a given moment want it to mean, then the Constitution doesn’t really mean anything at all. We can change our laws. That is why Con-gress has to respond to the electorate, why we debate laws, and then are held accountable for it, but the Constitu-tion has to be something that is con-stant, irrespective of the political tides of the moment. Now, you can change the Constitu-tion. The Founders gave us a process to do that through Article V, the con-stitutional amendment process, and that has been used in this country. They would not have given us that process if it were their intent that the Supreme Court be the one that could change the Constitution. The reason I outline that criteria is because that is the criteria I used to evaluate Judge Kavanaugh’s nomina-tion when it was first presented. I found myself with no doubts about his intellectual ability or his academic credentials, and I don’t think anyone has raised those. I have seen seven FBI background checks that turned up no issues with his character, and I had 12 years of his service as a Federal appellate judge as proof that he shared my criteria for the proper role of the Court and the proper standard for constitutional review. So it was based on that and on those facts that in August I announced I sup-ported Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination. Then, several weeks ago, the allega-tions, first by Dr. Ford and then by others, emerged. Sexual harassment and assault is something I feel very strongly about. It is, for example, one of the reasons I have been involved for a number of years now in a bipartisan effort to reform and improve how we handle claims of sexual assault on our college campuses. Our Nation is now facing a reckoning for decades of not addressing sexual violence appro-priately. While I obviously will not betray anyone’s confidence or privacy, I have personally seen how victims of sexual assault often find their claims dis-missed and ignored. I have seen how sometimes they are told things like: You are partially to blame for putting yourself in that position. I have seen how so many never came forward and don’t want to come forward because they don’t think anyone will believe them or they don’t believe anything will ever happen. That is why I believe anytime anyone comes forward with allegations of sex-ual assault or harassment, abuse, these allegations cannot be swept aside, and they cannot be ignored. When these al-legations emerged in this case, my im-mediate reaction was to say these claims should be taken seriously and his accusers should be fully heard. I said I would have no further comment on his nomination until we knew more about these allegations. What that meant was, my support of Judge Kavanaugh was now contingent on the information that emerged from the hearings and the investigation and the work that needed to be done. I will say today what I said at this time last week. I believe neither Dr. Ford nor Judge Kavanaugh have been treated fairly in many instances. Some—I saw you—immediately basi-cally dismissed these claims as a polit-ical ploy. Others went on television al-most immediately and said they be-lieved Judge Kavanaugh was guilty without any information before them. Despite the shameful behavior of so many, a process did ensue. Through all the noise, that did produce additional information. The Senate’s Judiciary Committee and then the Federal Bu-reau of Investigation gathered and made available to every single Member of the Senate additional relevant infor-mation. The committee took sworn testi-mony from several named witnesses. I know for a fact they chased down and investigated a seemingly endless stream of incoming information every single day, and it provided both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh the oppor-tunity to give written statements and then participate in hours of public tes-timony, not just before the committee but before the entire Nation. When that hearing ended last Thurs-day, the information before us was as follows: The sworn and unequivocal al-legations by Dr. Ford, the sworn and equally unequivocal denial from Judge Kavanaugh, no witnesses with knowl-edge of these allegations, and no inde-pendent evidence to corroborate them. After the hearing, a week ago today, some of the Senators on the committee wanted a short delay. I watched that hearing. It was agreed to by everyone there, a short delay, 7 days, so the Fed-eral Bureau of Investigation could gather even more information, and I had no objection to that. Over the last week, the FBI inter-viewed 10 additional witnesses and gathered additional relevant informa-tion for every single Senator to review. First, I was briefed on these inter-views and information; then I had occa-sion to review them for myself. Here is what I know now about the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. I have the sworn and unequivocal testimony of Dr. Ford and Ms. Ramirez making these allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. I have the sworn and un-equivocal denial of these allegations from Judge Kavanaugh. I now have be-fore me the testimony of 10 additional witnesses, including those identified by Dr. Ford and Ms. Ramirez as having been present when Judge Kavanaugh allegedly assaulted them, and not a single one of them had any recollection of the alleged gatherings, much less any knowledge of these allegations, and I still have no independent evi-dence which corroborates these allega-tions as well. That is the information before me as I stand here at 1 p.m. eastern time on the 5th of October with regard to the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court of the United States. That is the same information that is before every other Member of the Sen-ate who has access to the exact same information that I saw, that I read, and that I was briefed on. I have listened to the arguments made by some of my colleagues and others urging me to still vote against the nomination. The most direct argu-ment made to vote no is that the FBI did not interview enough people. First, my view is that the only peo-ple who could corroborate those claims are those who were there when it hap-pened because anything other than that is hearsay. If you didn’t see it happen, all you can testify to is what someone else told you. The only people who could corroborate that something happened are either people who re-ceived physical evidence or people who

witnessed it. From what I read yester-day, every single person the accuser said was present when it happened tes-tified that they do not know anything about it. By the way, the other point I would make is that these interviews that we saw yesterday, the 10 additional ones— it would be unfair to view them in a vacuum, as if they were the only infor-mation we have to go off of. Here is a fact: Over nearly the last two decades, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has interviewed over 150 people, asking questions about Judge Kavanaugh’s background and past. Over 150 people have been interviewed about Judge Kavanaugh over the last two decades and across seven background checks, and not a single one of them has ever testified as to any sexual assault against anyone at any time. It struck me that there isn’t a single Member of the U.S. Senate, I think— maybe I am wrong, but I doubt seri-ously that there is any Member in the U.S. Senate who has had the FBI ques-tion over 150 people about what they have done throughout their life. In fact, I would venture to guess that there are probably few, if any, Ameri-cans who have had the FBI interview over 150 people about what they have done throughout the course of their lives. I believe it is reasonable to as-sume that if Judge Kavanaugh was someone who had engaged in a pattern of abusive behavior toward women—on a pattern—at least one of these 150- some-odd people would have noticed and would have said something about it. Yet not a single one of them did. I would be remiss if I didn’t mention that there is clearly another factor that is driving much of the anger and passion around this nomination, and it has nothing to do with partisan poli-tics or politics at all, for that matter. It is the fact, as I mentioned earlier, that, sadly, far too often, particularly women who come forward with allega-tions of harassment, abuse, or assault are ignored, dismissed, and even blamed. The fact is, because of this, there are potentially millions of vic-tims who have never come forward and who suffer in silence. I understand that for the victims and for those who love them and for those who are survivors, to hear about these allegations brings back powerful and painful memories of what happened to them, of how they were ignored, how they were not believed, how they were blamed, and how their abuser got away with it. What has happened to these survivors is an injustice. It is wrong. It is something that we as a nation must reckon with and we as a people must fix. But the solution to injustice is never injustice, and it would be unjust to turn this nomination into a proxy fight over the broader, important issue of how we have treated victims of sex-ual assault in America. As important as that topic is, this debate is about a specific case involving specific people and specific allegations. Fairness and justice require us to make our decision on this matter based on the facts be-fore us on this matter. It was wrong for some to imme-diately dismiss these allegations al-most as a reflex, but it is also wrong to claim that a vote for Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination means that you do not care about and do not as a matter of course believe victims of sex-ual violence. My colleagues and my fellow Ameri-cans, this case is about this case, and although the ways in which both the accuser and the accused have been treated are shameful, we must still make our decision based on what we know. I want to make one thing abundantly clear: I do want people on the Supreme Court who believe that the proper role of that Court is to interpret the Con-stitution according to its original in-tent, but if I had any evidence—or if any evidence emerges that corrobo-rates these or any allegations of this kind—I would have voted against this nomination in a heartbeat because someone who has committed sexual as-sault shouldn’t be on the Bench, they should be in jail. If you lie about it to Congress, you should also be charged with perjury. But after 7 background checks and over 150 people having been interviewed, we don’t have any inde-pendent evidence to corroborate these allegations against him—none. So with regard to this specific case, on the basis of the facts that I have be-fore me, that we have before us—on the basis of what facts am I supposed to not just vote down this nomination but in the process of doing so, render what will forever be perceived as a verdict of guilt? On the basis of what facts can anyone say or do that? It is legitimate to vote against him because you don’t agree with his judi-cial philosophy, but it isn’t fair to say you are voting against him, as some imply, because we are on the verge of putting someone who is a confirmed and verified sexual abuser on the Bench. That isn’t justice, and no mat-ter how just the cause is, a just cause never, never justifies an unjust means. Based on the specific facts before us regarding this specific nomination and this specific case, I already voted to end debate on the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh, and tomorrow I will vote to confirm him as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Delaware. Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, good afternoon. I rise today to address the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. As we all know, the stakes are al-ways high when this Chamber vets and debates and votes to confirm any of the President’s Supreme Court nominees, as they should be. This is, as we know, the highest Court in our land. The job comes with a lifetime appointment— not 2 years, like they have in the House of Representatives; not 4 years, like the President; not 6 years, as we have—a lifetime. As we know, looking at one of the Justices on the Supreme Court who is, I think, now 85 years old, that could be a long, long time. Those who serve on the Supreme Court make decisions that will affect the lives of millions of Americans al-most every day. That is precisely why we expect Presidents to look for the best and brightest candidates possible. That is why the vetting process in the Senate should be serious and thought-ful. That is why nominees should strive to be above reproach. Indeed, we all should strive to be above reproach. This absolutely should be one of the toughest job interviews around because the stakes surrounding any Supreme Court seat are just that high. The stakes surrounding the seat va-cated by Justice Kennedy may be even higher. The next Justice may shift the balance of our Nation’s highest Court for a generation, maybe even longer. The next Justice may very well be asked to rule on questions of Executive power that test our democracy. We are fooling ourselves if we refuse to acknowledge that the stakes are so high in large part because this Cham-ber has yet to reckon with the grave injustice that was done to Merrick Garland and to our Constitution in 2016. As many will recall, Judge Garland, who serves as the chief judge of the DC Circuit Court—the highest Federal ap-peals court in our land—was nominated by President Obama over 2 years ago to fill the seat held by the late Justice Scalia on the Supreme Court. Shame-fully, he was denied any kind of consid-eration by this body. He waited 293 days for a hearing and a vote that never came. Most Republican Senators refused to even meet with him. A good man was treated badly, and so was our Constitution. The unprecedented obstruction our Republican colleagues mounted against Judge Garland was a shameful chapter of the U.S. Senate. I am still deeply troubled by those 293 days. I know some of my colleagues are as well. It is likely that I will continue to be trou-bled by them for the rest of my life. We may never agree which side pulled the pin out of the grenade, but we must all recognize that this institu-tion will never be the same if stealing Supreme Court seats and creating one set of rules for Democratic Presidents and another set for Republican Presi-dents is the new norm. Despite the injustice done to Merrick Garland, Judge Gorsuch was ulti-mately confirmed last year—on a bi-partisan basis, I might add. When Justice Kennedy retired earlier this year, President Trump nominated, as we know, Judge Brett Kavanaugh to fill that seat. More than 12 years ago, I met with Judge Kavanaugh in my of-fice here in the Capitol when the Sen-ate considered his nomination to the

DC Circuit Court of Appeals. Back in 2006, I voted my hopes over my fears. Unfortunately, over the last decade, many of my worst fears have come true. I believe that Judge Kavanaugh’s ex-treme record on the bench that has un-folded over the past dozen years stands in stark contrast to the views of most Americans on too many important issues. For example, Americans over-whelmingly support protection for those living with preexisting condi-tions. Brett Kavanaugh ruled against upholding the Affordable Care Act in 2011. That is why we expected he would side with conservative Justices if and when cases like Texas v. United States come before the Court. If he does, the ACA’s protection for people with pre-existing conditions will be invalidated for tens of millions of Americans. Speaking of healthcare, Americans overwhelmingly support women having the freedom to make their own healthcare decisions. Brett Kavanaugh, while working in the Bush White House in 2003, wrote an internal memo stating that Roe v. Wade may not be consid-ered ‘‘settled law of the land’’ because the Supreme Court ‘‘can always over-rule its precedent.’’ Americans also overwhelmingly sup-port independent checks on Executive power. We believe no one in America is above the law. Yet Brett Kavanaugh, in a July 2009 Minnesota Law Review arti-cle, wrote that Congress should pass a law to exempt a sitting President from criminal prosecution or investigation. When I learned of this, my reaction was: You have got to be kidding. Ap-parently, he was not kidding. Iron-ically, that declaration came 11 years after Brett Kavanaugh played a key role in drafting the Starr Report, which laid out grounds for impeach-ment of then-President Bill Clinton. The greatest threat Brett Kavanaugh may pose to this country and its people is with respect to our environment. In all my years, I have yet to meet any-one who doesn’t want to make sure we have clean air to breathe and clean water to drink. A review of Judge Kavanaugh’s nearly 300 opinions over the last 12 years, both concurrencies and dissents, shows Judge Kavanaugh has voted to weaken or block environ-mental protections a staggering 89 per-cent of the time. In fact, Judge Kavanaugh has never dissented in a case that would weaken environmental protections and admitted as much in his response to questions for the record from Senators F
EINSTEIN and H ARRIS . In other words, almost 9 out of 10 times, he has sided with those who weaken environmental protections over those who would strengthen it. I fear that if confirmed, Judge Kavanaugh could well turn out to be the next Scott Pruitt. We remember him. However, unlike former EPA Ad-ministrator Pruitt, whose tenure ended finally after 18 tortuous months, Brett Kavanaugh could damage our environ-ment for a quarter century or more if he serves on the Supreme Court. For example, just last year, Scott Pruitt’s attempt to delay rules lim-iting methane emissions from oil and gas drilling was challenged in the DC Circuit Court, where Judge Kavanaugh now serves. In that case, Judge Kavanaugh sided with Scott Pruitt and the fossil fuel industry, voting against his colleagues who found Pruitt’s delay illegal. Judge Kavanaugh also attempted to severely limit EPA’s authority to regu-late toxic emissions and greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. In 2012, he blocked the air pollution restric-tions that covered nearly half of our country, endangering thousands of lives. This is especially concerning to those of us who live in downward States like Delaware, where over 90 percent of our air pollution comes from dirty emissions in States to our west that drift across our borders. When I was Governor, I could have shut down my State, taken every car, truck, van off the road, shut down every business, and we would have still been out of compliance for clean air re-quirements because of the upwind States putting their pollution up in the air, and it is simply blowing to Dela-ware or Maryland or New Jersey or any other State that happens to live along America’s tailpipe on the east coast. Strictly based on Judge Kavanaugh’s environmental record on the bench over the past 12 years, I was prepared to vote no on his nomination many weeks ago. Then last week the Senate and much of our country was riveted by compelling and, I believe, powerful testimony from a private citizen and a victim, Dr. Christine Ford. She came forward to share the most dramatic ex-perience of her life. She stepped forward despite the seri-ous threats it posed for both her and her family—death threats, having to move out of her house. She testified de-spite being terrified. She did so despite being unsure that her story would make any difference at all. She did so because she said it was her civic duty to share the truth. She showed a whole lot of courage. Like many of my colleagues, I have been contacted by sexual assault sur-vivors since Dr. Ford’s testimony who have been inspired to come forward and share their stories. It serves as further proof that this problem is not only underreported but that men and women who are victims of sexual as-sault can and do bury this trauma, not for weeks, not for months, not for years but for decades. Some of our Republican colleagues have acknowledged that Dr. Ford’s tes-timony was credible, but despite her credibility, they say they don’t see her testimony as reason enough to deny Judge Kavanaugh a lifetime appoint-ment to the Supreme Court. They say they don’t have enough evidence to be-lieve her. Instead, they painted this as something of a he said, she said situa-tion involving young people. Well, let’s look at what he said then. Last week, Judge Kavanaugh, who cur-rently sits on our Nation’s second high-est court, came before the Senate and unleashed a torrent of unbelievably partisan attacks. I have never seen anything like it in testimony before any committee I have served on or known of. He claimed that the allegations against him were fueled by ‘‘pent-up anger about Trump and the 2016 elec-tion.’’ He went so far as to say the claims were merely ‘‘revenge on behalf of the Clintons.’’ He threatened Demo-cratic Members saying: ‘‘What goes around comes around.’’ There is an old saying, adversity does not build character, it reveals it. Well, that day, Judge Kavanaugh revealed himself to be a partisan during that hearing. After witnessing the vitriol Judge Kavanaugh spewed, how could any left-leaning cause think they would ever possibly get a fair shake from him should their case come before the Supreme Court? His temperament was clearly unbecoming of a judge, let alone a Supreme Court Justice. What is perhaps even more disturbing is, it seems clear Judge Kavanaugh was willing to be so brazenly partisan in order to appeal to an audience of one watching the proceedings from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Judge Kavanaugh’s testimony last week also raised additional questions regarding his truthfulness. For weeks, my colleagues on the Judiciary Com-mittee, including Senators DURBIN and Senator L
EAHY , raised serious concerns that Judge Kavanaugh may have mis-led the Judiciary Committee about the extent of his role in the Bush adminis-tration helping several controversial judicial nominees navigate the Senate confirmation process. Judge Kavanaugh may have also mis-led the Judiciary Committee about the extent of his role in the Bush adminis-tration helping shape several con-troversial decisions in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks, includ-ing warrantless wiretapping and the rights of enemy combatants. During his most recent hearing about the allegations brought forward by Dr. Ford, Judge Kavanaugh answered sev-eral questions about his younger days in ways that were, at best, misleading and, at worst, lies under oath. Judge Kavanaugh’s less-than-truthful an-swers on matters large and small point to a troubling pattern and raise serious questions about his credibility. Even if my Republican colleagues don’t want to believe Dr. Ford, and even if they agree with Judge Kavanaugh’s judicial record, the fact that he came before this body and so brazenly misled our fellow Senators should, I believe, by itself be disquali-fying. Before coming to the Senate, I was privileged to serve, as you may recall, as Governor of Delaware for 8 years. In that role, I nominated dozens of men and women to serve as judges in sev-eral courts of national prominence—in-cluding the Delaware Supreme Court,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6576 October 5, 2018 
the Delaware Superior Court, and the Delaware Court of Chancery, to name a few. While the roles of those courts dif-fered, the qualities I looked for in my judicial nominees were similar. I looked for men and women who were bright. I looked for men and women who knew the law. I looked for men and women who had good judgment, who are able and willing to make a de-cision, including a difficult decision. I looked for men and women with a strong work ethic. I didn’t want to nominate somebody for tribunal chair-man so I could watch them retire on the job. I looked for nominees who were colle-gial and able to build consensus in courts that had a larger panel, but there were three qualities that were most important to me: judicial tem-perament, impartiality—treating ev-eryone before them fairly and not showing partiality—and, finally, truth-fulness. In fact, in my first term as Governor, I denied a sitting Justice of the Dela-ware Supreme Court the opportunity to serve an additional 12-year term be-cause he lacked appropriate judicial temperament. I am told that was un-precedented, but his judicial tempera-ment and what I thought was appro-priate were not one and the same. It gives me no joy to say what I am about to say, but the temperament Judge Kavanaugh exhibited at the Ju-diciary Committee last week was not just unacceptable for a Supreme Court Justice, it would be unacceptable for a judge in Delaware serving on the Dela-ware Court of Common Pleas. Last week, in an effort to actually get to the truth and ensure that body could have all the facts before taking such an important and consequential vote, my Delaware colleagues and I called for the FBI to conduct a non-partisan investigation. Unfortunately, what we ended up with falls far short of what the Senate deserves and certainly what the American people deserve. What we got was a process that was certainly not designed to inform. If this process was designed to inform, the White House and Republicans would have actually allowed the FBI to speak to the more than 40 individuals whose names Dr. Ford and Ms. Ramirez submitted as people who could poten-tially corroborate their accounts. The FBI never talked to any of those peo-ple. If this were a process designed to in-form, the dozens of individuals who contacted the FBI to share potentially helpful accounts and information would have received calls in response to those concerns; they did not. If this process were designed to in-form, the White House and Senate Re-publicans would have allowed the FBI to expand the scope of this investiga-tion; they did not. If this process were designed to in-form the majority leader, he would have at least waited to schedule a vote on Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination until after we received and read the FBI re-port; he did not. Sadly, this process has been a sham from the start. I know our Presiding Officer is proud to hail from the State of Louisiana. I am equally proud to hail from the First State. As you may know, we are called the First State be-cause we were the first State to ratify the U.S. Constitution—the longest liv-ing, most emulated Constitution in the history of the world. One of the fundamental reasons our Constitution and our democracy has endured is because of the intricate sys-tem of checks and balances our Found-ing Fathers crafted just up the road in Philadelphia some 231 years ago. The process we have been through in the last several weeks, unfortunately, makes a mockery of that system of checks and balances. I believe we all must recognize that, to use the major-ity leader’s words, ‘‘plowing through’’ with Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination will diminish the credibility of the Su-preme Court as an institution that stays above the political fray. In fact, confirming Judge Kavanaugh will en-shrine doubt in every controversial 5- to-4 decision in our moving forward from this time. It also calls into ques-tion the legitimacy of us, of this very Chamber. Let me say to my colleagues who are still wavering on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination—and I will leave you with this—that we will not only be judged by voters this November; we will be judged by history. We say that a lot. Sometimes it is trite and overstated. In this case, it is not. We are going to be judged by history in this regard. I would implore each of you who is still thinking this through, who is try-ing to figure out what is the right thing to do, to show that we are still worthy of being called the world’s greatest deliberative body. Let’s show that we have made progress since 1991 in a previous Supreme Court nomina-tion-confirmation episode. Let’s show that we are willing to take a stand and do the right thing because if we are not, any short-term political wins will be forever eclipsed by the permanent stain left on our legacy in this body from which there may be no recovery. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Missouri. Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield? Mr. BLUNT. I yield to the Senator. Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, at the conclusion of the remarks of the Sen-ator from Missouri, I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized for such time as I may consume. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I want to talk a little bit about what my good friend from Delaware talked about with regard to our being judged by his-tory. Some of what I want to talk about today is of the history of this system and of others who have served. I have read several times in the last 30 days, particularly, that the Demo-crats feel they can do anything because of the way Merrick Garland was treat-ed. I don’t think there is any compari-son between the way Merrick Garland was treated and the way Judge Kavanaugh has been treated. The only comparison I can think of is that they are both on the DC Court of Appeals and that they have both said very kind things about each other, but there is no comparison. Merrick Garland was nominated in the last year of a Presidency. The last time someone was put on the Supreme Court who was nominated in the last year of a Presidency was in 1932. The last time that happened was in 1932. The last time someone went on the Su-preme Court when the President was of one party and the Senate was of the other and when it was a Presidential election year was in 1888. There is no comparison. In fact, Vice President Biden—then- Senator Biden—said on June 25 of 1992, in what turned out to be the last year of the Bush Presidency: If there is a va-cancy, there will be no hearing until after the election. There was not a vacancy, by the way. They were just putting that historical marker down that if there were a va-cancy, there would not be a hearing until after the election. Of course, that meant there would not be a hearing that mattered. Unless the President were to be reelected and the majority in the Senate were to stay the same, there would be no reason to assume there would be a judge appointed by this President this year. Senator S
CHUMER said in July of 2007, in his not wanting to wait until elec-tion year but just wanting to put his position on the table even earlier in the last year of another Bush Presi-dency, that we should not confirm any Bush nominee—I think he meant—from that moment on. As a matter of fact, he did say we shouldn’t confirm any Bush nominee from that moment on except in extraordinary circumstances. I am sure he didn’t mean one vacancy on the Supreme Court would be an ex-traordinary circumstance but a cir-cumstance that would be dealt with just like Judge Garland’s was dealt with, and people were heard. Yet that is not what this is about, and it sets no precedent any more than Senator Biden or Senator S
CHUMER set a prece-dent that should have been a surprise for anybody. So what do we have with Judge Kavanaugh as we decide in the next few hours or in the next day or so whether he becomes Justice Kavanaugh? This was the seventh background check of this judge by the FBI. There had never been a more extensive review of a Supreme Court nominee—seven times in slightly more than a dozen years—in going through this back-ground check. More than 150 people had been inter-viewed. He had 36 hours of testimony before the Senate, during which you and oth-ers on the Judiciary Committee could

have asked him anything you had wanted to ask. He had 65 private meetings with Sen-ators, during which they could have asked him everything they wanted to ask—including, by the way, the rank-ing member on the Judiciary Com-mittee, who had had this information available to talk about. More than 500,000 pages of executive branch documents had been provided— more than for the last 4 nominees. Of all of his opinions as a judge and of all the cases he was part of, there were about 300 of those. By the way, that is the best way to look at what kind of judge he would be. He was asked over 1,200 questions for the record. That is like, after you have asked all of the questions you could publicly think of, then one has about a week to answer any questions that have been submitted for the record. He had 1,200 questions submitted for the record that he had to answer in that short period of time. There were three confidential calls with the committee. Then, last Friday, our colleagues de-cided—and I think, as it turned out, maybe wisely so—to do one more final FBI review of whatever they might not have asked about in the other seven FBI interviews that had occurred over the years. The outside number was 1 week. A week ago, 1 week was what was going to be plenty of time. I think some Members in the minority at that time said: Well, maybe even 3 or 4 days. That is what it took with the Clarence Thomas hearing. By the way, that was before these issues became public, be-cause it was turned over to the FBI like it should have been, and in 3 or 4 days, they had talked to everybody they could talk to. So, last week, 3 or 4 days might have been enough, but certainly a week would have been enough, according to the other side. Of course, that was never going to be the case. A week was never going to be enough. By the way, in background checks, when you are asked to be part of that— if it is your background check—one of the questions you are asked is, are there any drinking problems? Are there any drug problems? He had been asked that over and over again. I think any-body who is interviewed is always asked, do you know of any problems like that? Usually, a question is, Have you ever heard of anything that we would be in-terested in if we had heard about it? Another question often is, Would you tell us three people whom we might not have talked to who might know some-thing about Judge Kavanaugh that we should know? Over a decade and a half, there have been 7 FBI interviews and 150 people interviewed, the behavioral question, the drinking question, the drug ques-tion, which hasn’t come up as far as I know, but it is always asked. It has been asked over and over again. Then you and I and Senator I
NHOFE  went the other morning to hear a re-view of this last set of interviews, wherein people who possibly would have been able to corroborate some-thing were interviewed and couldn’t corroborate it. In many ways, the case got weaker as that moved forward, but we heard that. Then I heard that afternoon that Senator SCHUMER said that this is full of hints of misconduct. So I went back this morning and looked through the six prior background checks, and I looked through this background check. As it turns out, I agree with Senator G
RASSLEY , who said there was no hint of misconduct. If there had been a hint of mis-conduct in the previous five, he would have never been nominated. If there had been a hint of misconduct in the sixth one, he wouldn’t have been nomi-nated. It wouldn’t have sustained itself. If you look at the pages that are new, there is none there now. So you can say anything you want to say. You can say it is not time enough. You can say, even though no witness ever saw any of these events, you just haven’t talked to enough people yet, even though you have talked to everybody who has been mentioned, as far as I know, with any credible charges. So here we are. Now it is tempera-ment. I don’t think there are many Senators who would not have had his same indignation in being accused of something that he, without equivo-cation, swore did not happen, not only in those instances but in any other in-stance. It took 43 days for Ruth Bader Gins-burg to be confirmed. We are at about 83 days, or something like that, now. I looked up a couple of articles just to refresh my memory. When she shows some fire—and she has plenty of it, and I admire that—the description of her is her ‘‘well-known candor.’’ That is how you describe it when Justice Ginsburg has her own opinion, like what she said about the Republican nominee last year: He is a faker. He has no consist-ency about him. He should withdraw. She said: I can’t imagine what this place would be and can’t imagine what the country would be with Donald Trump as our President. Now, is that a temperament issue, or is that too political? By the way, I am not offended by po-litical. The Court never was either. John Marshall, one of the great Jus-tices of the Court, was the Secretary of State for the person who appointed him. Earl Warren, who certainly set a standard for the Court, had never been in any public office except politically elected office before he became the Chief Justice. When he joined the Court in 1953, there were three former Senators sitting on the Court. There were two former Attorneys General sit-ting on the Court. Both had been ap-pointed by the Presidents for whom they had been Attorneys General. Elena Kagan was the principal lawyer for President Obama. Yet, suddenly, political becomes a problem or tem-perament becomes a problem. Thurgood Marshall said while he was on the Court—by the way, I admire him in so many ways. I admire Thurgood Marshall’s work and what he did as a lawyer, and the decision that President Johnson made was clearly historic. As a Justice, Thurgood Marshall said: I wouldn’t do the job of dog-catcher for Ronald Reagan. About President Bush, while he was still a Justice, Thurgood Marshall said: It is said, if you can’t say something good about a dead person, don’t say it. Well, I consider him dead. Obviously, he considers him dead and takes the first injunction that he doesn’t have anything to say, but there is nothing wrong with people on the Court having opinions. In this case, we have a judge for whom you could look at 12 years of judging, and you could look at 300 opin-ions, and you could look at his law school classes he taught. There is plen-ty to look at. It all, I believe, leads to a couple of conclusions: One, the way this nomination has been treated has been outrageous. I think my good friend who spoke before said he had never seen anything like it. Well, there has never been anything like this: Hold on to information that can’t be corroborated. Only release it after it is clear that the judge has the votes to be confirmed and when you want to do, as the majority leader said, anything you can possibly do as the minority leader to slow down and stop this nomination. We have plenty to look at here. We cannot set a standard of guilty until proven innocent because then anybody can make any charge at any time, par-ticularly when there are many reasons to believe that there is nothing in 7 background checks, that there is noth-ing in 150 interviews, that there is nothing in a very visible public career to ever suggest that Judge Kavanaugh is anything different from what he said he was and those of us who will vote for him believe him to be. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Oklahoma. Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, before the Senator from Missouri leaves, con-fession is good for the soul, and I want to share something that will shock him, which is that there are a number of things that I did when I was in high school and in college that are not very prominently displayed in my campaign material. So, there, I have said it. We had a vote this morning, but a lot of people who have been on the phone today have not really been sure what we did with that vote this morning. We had the vote this morning because we had to move forward in order to have the final consideration of this great nominee tomorrow. It was filibustered by the Democrats, and, of course, we had to do a cloture vote. I know this is somewhat in the weeds here, but that is what we have to do. That vote took place.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6578 October 5, 2018 
At some time tomorrow we will actu-ally have this vote. I start by saying that I am enthusiastically a ‘‘yes’’ vote tomorrow. I think that goes without saying. I met with Judge Kavanaugh in my office back when he was first nomi-nated. In fact, I have studied him be-fore. I remembered him when he was nominated the first time, about 6 years ago, and I talked to him at that time. I thought: Well, has he really changed that much? Is it necessary? I even said: It is really not necessary; I have fol-lowed his career and all of that. But he came by anyway. The things that I like—and I am not a lawyer—are the things that he did that show him as a human being, more than just a nominee to be a Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court—the human things that he did. I know for a fact be-cause I talked to her—one of his good friends who died had a wife and two girls, like his two girls. When back-to- school night comes, he takes those two girls with his to back-to-school night. This is the type of thing he does. We have heard all of the warm things about what he has done as a coach and other things. That is the human being I know. Meeting with him wasn’t nec-essary because I was sold on him any-way after looking at his record. On the eve of Kavanaugh’s nomina-tion, heading toward certain nomina-tion, we were hit by a bomb. It was an uncorroborated attack that the Demo-crats sat on for 2 months. That is crit-ical. You have to stop and think about that. Why would they take something they thought was so important to de-stroy this fine man and wait for 2 months and sit on it? I am surprised they didn’t let it slip. It is just because they wanted to make sure people were talking about it. The details of the allegation were of the worst kind—an aggressive, ugly sexual attack. Sexual assault and violence is wrong, period. It is wrong, and so many women who experience sexual assault and harassment do not feel empowered to come forward even years later— maybe never. It is also unjust for someone to be ac-cused of a crime that he or she did not commit and be convicted in the court of public opinion without any evidence or corroborated accounts. It is hard to wrap your head around the fact that someone who has been in the public eye for decades, respected by his colleagues, his law clerks, his stu-dents, his friends, his family—every-one—and never had a whisper of wrong-doing in all of those years, and all of a sudden he is accused of such a heinous crime. Like many Americans, I watched the hearing last Thursday in the hope that it would provide more clarity and some answers, and I think it did. It would be easy to get wrapped up in the con-flicting media coverage and all the spin and so on; instead, I looked at what we know to be true—what we know to be true. The people Dr. Ford places at the scene that night have either denied the events or do not recall any party or gathering that matches her descrip-tion, so that is an idle accusation. Her lifelong friend—in fact, some people characterize her as her best friend—is a person Dr. Ford named in her allegations as the only other girl at that small gathering. So here is a small gathering; she is accusing him of this behavior. There was one other girl there, and the other girl says that she does not know Brett Kavanaugh and has never attended a party where he was there. It can’t be more definite than that, and that is from her best friend. When Dr. Ford’s testimony is com-pared to other statements that she made to her therapist, to the Wash-ington Post, to the ranking member, and her statement for the polygraph exam, there are various inconsistencies that should not be ignored. Dr. Ford’s inability to remember key details of the alleged attack—things like the date, the place, and other cir-cumstances surrounding the event— places Judge Kavanaugh in a difficult position to defend himself as Demo-crats and the media unjustly shift the burden of proof from the accuser to the accused. I don’t remember that hap-pening before. This is still America. From the beginning, Judge Kavanaugh has categorically denied the accusations and has not wavered or equivocated on this point. He has cooperated with the Judiciary Committee’s investigation—that is Senator G
RASSLEY ’s committee—every step of the way, including speaking with committee staff under oath sev-eral times over the course of the last couple of weeks and providing docu-mentation to help clear his name. He has done it all. Everything we have asked of him, he has done. On the other hand, Dr. Ford’s attor-neys have refused to turn over key evi-dence that her testimony relied on to corroborate her claims: her therapist’s notes that were shown to the Wash-ington Post but not to the committee, messages she exchanged with the re-porter, the documentation, and the re-cordings related to the polygraph test she took in early August. They were refusing to turn over key evidence. They didn’t have any evidence they could turn over, so no wonder there are no witnesses who can corroborate the accusations that have been made against this fine man. I am not going to go into the other allegations. There are two others that came along. The timing of this is kind of inter-esting. First of all, they withheld this document that Dr. Ford had for 2 months. It is hard to keep a secret around this place, and I am surprised that didn’t come out. They did it for a purpose. What do you think that pur-pose was? What other purpose could it have been, other than they were wait-ing for the last minute to come out with something that was never dis-cussed before? No other accusation had been made. That is what happened. Based on the totality of what we know, to condemn anyone for an of-fense that has been denied and not proven—I would caution anyone against doing the same thing. John Adams, our second President of the United States, wrote—now listen to this—‘‘But if innocence itself is brought to the bar and condemned, per-haps to die, then the citizen will say ‘whether I do good or whether I do evil is immaterial, for innocence itself is no protection,’ and if such an idea as that were to take hold in the mind of the citizen that would be the end of secu-rity whatsoever.’’ That is what he said. Let’s look at what Scripture says. Numbers 35:30 says: If anyone kills a person, the murderer shall be put to death on the evidence of witnesses. But no person— 
No person— 
shall be put to death on the testimony of one witness. 
Think about that. That is a direct violation of what they are trying to do. So you have Adams, you have the Bible, and then there is our judicial system. It is reflected in our judicial system as well: innocent until proven guilty. It is more than just a phrase; it is a cornerstone of the rule of law since before our founding, and its wisdom has been borne out time and again throughout history: Innocent until proven guilty. That is really what is on trial here: innocent until proven guilty. I have never seen this happen before, and I have been around for a long time. It cuts through the drama and focuses on the facts. That is why I continue to support Judge Kavanaugh’s confirma-tion. Judge Kavanaugh’s name has been unjustly run through the mud by these subsequent allegations that even the New York Times did not deem fit to print and that were brought forth by a known publicity seeker with an ax to grind against the President, looking for nothing but attention and more fame for himself. I am dismayed that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have taken these uncorroborated and fantastical allegations at face value and run with them. I feel the Democrats showed their hand in the days since last week’s hearing when the agreement on the supplemental FBI background inves-tigation was made. The narrative has shifted from allegations of sexual mis-conduct to ones of judicial tempera-ment, as my friend from Missouri pointed out. I am not a lawyer, but everyone knows the saying that if the law is on your side, argue the law. If the facts are on your side, argue the facts. If nei-ther the facts nor the law are on your side, pound the table. That is what we are hearing right now. The difference here is that the Democrats are trying to outdo each other in pounding the table.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6579 October 5, 2018 
They know the allegations are not proven. They know that Judge Kavanaugh remains committed to his innocence and the process, and they know that Republicans will remain committed to the facts, so they must change tactics, move the goalpost one more time, and attack him on other grounds. The first of these is to question his temperament. Because he defended himself, his family, career, and his name so forcefully and passionately, he did not demonstrate the calm, meas-ured, and detached demeanor that one should expect of a judge. Well, the problem with this characterization is that it ignores the fact that Judge Kavanaugh was not a disinterested party while hearing the arguments of opposing counsel. He was the subject of the accusations, and it was he who was being attacked and condemned. There is a big difference there. I dare anyone to be calm and dis-passionate if they had to sit by for 10 days and watch and listen to every-thing they have worked for and have built over a long career of public serv-ice be torn down in an instant without any proof—without any proof at all—to see your high school yearbook picked apart by conspiracy theorists who seek nefarious meanings behind juvenile jokes and 30-year-old slang, to see your friends and family be threatened and harassed, and you can do nothing to stop the angry mob. This idea completely ignores the fact that Judge Kavanaugh has proved, over the 12 years that he has been on the bench of the second most powerful court in the country, that he does have the temperament we look for in our judges. This fact is supported by an ABA ranking of unanimously ‘‘well qualified’’—which is considered to be the gold standard for Democrats—and the countless testimonies by people across the political spectrum who have worked with him, who have argued a case in front of him, and who know him well. In the last few days, the discourse has further devolved into perjury claims based on the judge’s drinking habits in high school and college. I will leave the legal arguments to those more knowledgeable than I in that de-partment who have thoroughly de-bunked that particular myth. Suffice it to say, he testified that he liked beer. He drank beer, and sometimes he drank too much. He did some things in high school and college that maybe he now thinks he shouldn’t have done, but that is what he did. He wasn’t hiding any-thing when it came to drinking in his youth. He said that right up front in one of the earlier hearings. There were six background investiga-tions by the FBI over the course of lengthy public service, decades in the public eye, and never has anyone brought any allegations or concerns to the attention of the investigators or the press in all of that time. I was here when he was up for the ap-pellate judgeship, and none of this came up at that time. There is a dif-ference here. I think the other side is— let’s face it. The Democrats said at the very beginning: It doesn’t matter who our President nominates to be on the Federal bench, we are going to oppose him. So here we have them opposing him. Well, with each new breathlessly re-ported account of a party, alleged ice- throwing incident, or juvenile jokes about passing gas or cussing from the early to the mid-1980s, it becomes clearer and clearer that Democrats are not serious in their concern about the more serious allegations as the focus of their attacks become more and more absurd and desperate. The fact that they have to focus on Judge Kavanaugh’s school days further reinforces the idea that Brett has led an exemplary life as a husband, a fa-ther, and a public servant. I would like to take just a moment to commend my good friend from Iowa, the chairman of the Judiciary Com-mittee. My wife called this morning, and she said: Be sure you single him out and sit him down and tell him how proud I am of him. My wife and I have been married for 59 years, and when my wife is proud, I am proud. Once he was made aware of the alle-gations that the Democrats kept from him for weeks, he and his staff went right to work to investigate. They postponed the committee—this is the chairman we are talking about. They postponed the committee vote, gath-ered statements and other evidence, and offered Dr. Ford the opportunity to provide her testimony in any way that would be comfortable for her, eventu-ally scheduling a follow-up hearing. All along the way, Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh were treated by our chair-man of the Judiciary Committee with the respect they deserve and should have received, starting when the alle-gations were first brought to our atten-tion. He and his staff have kept us in-formed in the Senate of the various in-vestigations at almost every step in the process. The chairman has built a well-deserved reputation for protecting whistleblowers. This is one of the things he has been outspoken about for a long time, and he has protected them over the course of his career. He has proven himself once again during this process. I look forward to voting for Judge Kavanaugh. I would hope that we could put an end to the search-and-destroy campaign that is being waged by the Democrats and their enablers and this media, but I won’t hold my breath. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor and suggest the ab-sence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. B
OOZMAN ). The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Hawaii. Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court of the United States. Based on an in-depth examination of his legal career, academic writings, and judicial record, I conclude that he has a long pattern of misstating facts and misapplying the law in order to further his partisan political agenda. His partisan, ideologically driven agenda is particularly troubling in cases involving women’s intimate per-sonal decisions. Roe v. Wade and its progeny rep-resent an acknowledgment in Amer-ican law and life that women ought to have control over whether and when to bear children, but it is more than that. As Justice O’Connor explained in Casey v. Planned Parenthood, ‘‘It is a prom-ise of the Constitution that there is a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter.’’ The Supreme Court’s jurisprudence on reproductive rights is based on case law going back decades that has as-sured Americans the right to educate their children as they see fit; to marry anyone, no matter their race; and to decide whether to use contraception in-side or outside of marriage. It is part of a jurisprudence of privacy and auton-omy that became a bedrock of Amer-ican society that we have all relied on to create families, choose professions, and raise children. But Brett Kavanaugh, through his political choices and affiliations, as well as his legal and judicial writing, has told us loud and clear that he does not respect a woman’s right to make her own inti-mate, personal decisions and will do whatever he can, once confirmed, if confirmed, to narrow and overturn Roe v. Wade. A recent speech Kavanaugh delivered gives us further insight into his own legal views on the topic. In 2017, at the American Enterprise Institute, Kavanaugh gave a speech in tribute to the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist. In his remarks, Kavanaugh praised Rehnquist’s dissent—dissent— in Roe v. Wade where the late Chief Justice found no constitutional right to abortion because the right was not ‘‘rooted in the traditions and con-science of our people.’’ Thank goodness the rest of the Supreme Court did not follow Chief Justice Rehnquist. To learn about Brett Kavanaugh’s own legal views on reproductive rights, we need only look at his dissent in last year’s DC Circuit case Garza v. Hargan. Here, a 17-year-old undocumented im-migrant sought release from govern-ment custody to obtain an abortion. Kavanaugh’s first fundamental misstatement in this case was mischaracterizing it as a ‘‘parental consent’’ case. It was not. The young woman had already received a proper judicial bypass from a Texas judge and therefore did not need parental con-sent.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6580 October 5, 2018 
For a judge applying for a promotion to the Supreme Court to completely misstate the issue in the case was as-tounding to me. In my view, a first- year law student would not have deemed the Garza case to be a parental consent case, but that is what he said. Then, when applying the legal test under Roe and Casey to determine whether the young woman’s rights were being subject to an ‘‘undue bur-den,’’ Judge Kavanaugh would have ruled against her. He thought nothing of keeping a 17-year-old as a prisoner of the government Office of Refugee Re-settlement instead of releasing her to get an abortion that was entirely with-in her rights to seek. Compare that to the ease with which Judge Kavanaugh found that religious employers, in the case of Priests for Life v. Department of Health and Human Services, were burdened by fill-ing out a two-page form. The employ-ers there were seeking to avoid paying for any employee’s health insurance that covered contraception, saying it burdened their free exercise of religion. The majority of the DC Circuit held that asking the employers to fill out a brief form to let the government know of their objection was not a substantial burden, but Judge Kavanaugh dis-agreed and would have ruled to deny the female employees their proper health coverage, siding with the Priests for Life. Judge Kavanaugh’s colleague on the DC Circuit went out of her way to write a concurring opinion to directly rebut Judge Kavanaugh’s dissent and correct his misstatements of the case. To Judge Kavanaugh, holding a woman in government custody unnec-essarily and against her will does not represent an undue burden on the exer-cise of her constitutional right to an abortion, but when it comes to a reli-gious employer opting out of providing contraceptive coverage to an employee, a two-page form is too great a burden. The pattern of Judge Kavanaugh’s views on the right to abortion is clear. Anyone who feels assured he will up-hold Roe v. Wade is living in a fantasy world. Laws that narrow women’s reproduc-tive rights in States like Texas, Iowa, and Louisiana are currently making their way to the Supreme Court, and all evidence shows that Judge Kavanaugh will side with them. Advo-cates for women’s reproductive rights are against Judge Kavanaugh’s ascent to the Supreme Court with good rea-son. Another aspect of his judicial record that argues against confirmation is Judge Kavanaugh’s pattern of dissents. Dissents are revealing. It is where judges go out of their way to voice their disagreement with the majority on the court to show what their views are. Judge Kavanaugh has the highest dissent rate among active DC Circuit judges at 5.1 dissents per year. One study I introduced at his hearing showed that he consistently sided against workers and immigrants and only once favored consumers in his dis-sents. Another study showed he consist-ently sided against protecting the air we breathe and the water we drink. So environmental and consumer rights groups are against Judge Kavanaugh’s ascent to the Supreme Court with good reason. Yet another study analyzed his dis-sents and found that Judge Kavanaugh tended to dissent more often along par-tisan lines than his colleagues and his ‘‘divisiveness . . . ramped up during po-litical campaigns’’ before Presidential elections. This is more than mere coin-cidence. It also found that he had the highest rate of what the study called ‘‘partisan dissents’’—where the other judges in the majority were appointed by the opposing party; in other words, by Democratic Presidents. Again, this is not the sort of fairminded consider-ation of the facts and the law nec-essary for a Supreme Court Justice. His partisanship was clearly on dis-play for all to see at his Thursday hearing. For me, as a Senator from Hawaii, Judge Kavanaugh’s pattern of mis-stating the facts and misapplying the law is evident in his work on the case of Rice v. Cayetano and the rights of Native peoples. President Trump has demonstrate through signing statements, budget proposals, and proposed regulations that he views programs for our indige-nous communities as unconstitutional racial classifications, and he found a like-minded Supreme Court nominee in Brett Kavanaugh. Brett Kavanaugh has a long history of misstating facts and misapplying the law in order to curtail the rights of indigenous peoples—Native Hawaiians, Alaska Natives, and American Indians. As an attorney in private practice in 1999, Brett Kavanaugh coauthored a friend-of-the-court brief in support Harold ‘‘Freddy’’ Rice’s challenge to the voting structure of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs—a State office estab-lished in Hawaii to work for the better-ment of Native Hawaiians. Mr. R
ICE sued then-Governor of Hawaii Ben-jamin Cayetano, and the case made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Judge Kavanaugh coauthored his amicus brief with other highly conserv-ative legal advocates, including Robert Bork—a harsh critic of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when it was proposed. Judge Kavanaugh separately, in addition to working on this amicus brief, wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal titled ‘‘Are Hawaiians Indians?’’ that made false and offensive arguments. In his op-ed and amicus brief, Judge Kavanaugh relied on incorrect facts and misstatements, ignoring obvious truths that contradict his position. He relied on these incorrect facts in order to reach his political conclusion that Native Hawaiians and arguably other indigenous communities who do not fit his limited view of Tribal structure are not afforded any special protections by the Constitution. He called OHA’s voting structure into question under the 14th Amend-ment, calling it a ‘‘naked racial spoils system.’’ In describing the Native Ha-waiian community, he went out of his way to ignore their history, cobble to-gether blatant falsehoods, and call into question their status as an indigenous people. His op-ed argues that Native Hawai-ians are not entitled to constitutional protections given to indigenous Ameri-cans because, as he put it, ‘‘They don’t have their own government. They don’t have their own system of laws. They don’t have their own elected leaders. They don’t live on reservations or on territorial enclaves. They don’t even live together in Hawaii.’’ Judge Kavanaugh is saying that Na-tive groups in the United States derive their rights from having been herded onto reservations and cheated out of their land and that they surrender their rights when they move outside of these artificial boundaries. It is not only factually wrong but deeply offen-sive. Kavanaugh argues that an indige-nous community must have its own government, system of laws, its own elected leaders, and live together on a reservation to be considered indige-nous. By that, he means that only fed-erally recognized Tribes in the lower 48 States are afforded any protections. After Judge Kavanaugh made his troubling and misleading arguments in the amicus brief and op-ed, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Rice v. Cayetano. They ruled that Hawaii’s voting structure for the Office of Ha-waiian Affairs violated the 15th Amendment’s voting rights guarantees. The Supreme Court, in Rice, relied only on the 15th Amendment. It did not address the 14th Amendment argument Judge Kavanaugh made in his amicus brief, which claimed that the Office of Hawaiian Affairs’ voting structure was an unconstitutional ‘‘racial voting set- aside.’’ But Judge Kavanaugh and his conservative allies continued to mis-state and misconstrue the holding in Rice for their own political purposes. In the Bush White House, Judge Kavanaugh continued to misapply the law in Rice to argue that Native Ha-waiians could not be the beneficiaries of targeted programs, when clearly the case stands for a much narrower propo-sition having nothing to do with gov-ernment benefits. In fact, the Supreme Court declined to address Judge Kavanaugh’s question of whether the Office of Hawaiian Af-fairs’ voting structure could be an un-constitutional, race-based classifica-tion under the 14th Amendment. In one email, when he was in the Bush White House, Kavanaugh wrote: ‘‘I think the testimony needs to make clear that any program targeting Na-tive Hawaiians as a group is subject to strict scrutiny and of questionable va-lidity under the Constitution.’’ In another, he wrote: ‘‘White House Counsel objects and raises questions

about the constitutionality of this bill, including but not limited to the por-tions that refer to Native Hawaiians. See Rice v. Cayetano.’’ At his hearing in front of the Judici-ary Committee, when I asked him about his misapplication of the law, Judge Kavanaugh again misstated the holding of Rice and refused to correct his misstatement when I asked him to clarify. He testified before the Judici-ary Committee that Rice ‘‘was a straightforward violation of the 14th and 15th amendments of the U.S. Con-stitution.’’ He was wrong, but when I pressed him on this point and asked him to show me where the majority de-cision in Rice cited the 14th amend-ment, he refused to answer. Why? Be-cause he was clearly wrong. It is deeply troubling to have a Su-preme Court nominee for a lifetime po-sition who doesn’t adhere to facts or correctly present the law. Judge Kavanaugh’s answers on this topic fit his pattern of evading and skirting the truth. His reliance on these stereotypes and bigoted tropes about Native Hawaiians, as well as his misapplication of the law, represent a clear and present dan-ger to Native people all over this coun-try, including in Hawaii. Notably, in his writings against Na-tive Hawaiians, Judge Kavanaugh com-pletely avoided any reference to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, ANSCA. Under ANSCA, Alaska Natives organized themselves not as a tribe in Judge Kavanaugh’s understanding of the word but as village and regional corporations with shares that indi-vidual Alaska Natives hold. This is a novel and unique system for facili-tating the U.S. trust responsibilities and arguably not at all in keeping with what Judge Kavanaugh believes de-serves constitutional protection. That is why Native communities across the country, including the Office of Hawai-ian Affairs, Council for Native Hawai-ian Advancement, Alaska Federation of Natives, and the National Congress of American Indians have come to-gether to express deep concern over Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination. In the context of his views on Native peoples, I no longer find it curious that Judge Kavanaugh devoted so much time back then to writing an amicus brief and an op-ed on a case that in-volved Native Hawaiians. I will have more to say tomorrow about other aspects of this nomina-tion—in particular, what Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s account of her attack by Brett Kavanaugh reveals about the nominee, the Senate, and the American culture. For now, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from California. Ms. HARRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a col-loquy with my colleagues, the Senators from Washington and Connecticut. I also ask to be notified when we have used 45 minutes of the Democrats’ time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Ms. HARRIS. Mr. President, given the serious and troubling allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, I am deeply disturbed that the Senate is moving forward with this nomination. When it was announced that the FBI could investigate these serious and credible allegations, I had hoped there would be a legitimate investigation. As the former Attorney General of Cali-fornia, I have tremendous, tremendous respect for the sworn law enforcement officers at the FBI. This should have been a search for the truth. They should have been allowed to do their full job, but instead, the White House did not allow it. This was not a search for the truth. Instead, this was about politics and raw power to push through an unfit nominee. I am a former prosecutor. I have led investigations, and I have prosecuted all types of crime—particularly violent crimes, including a specialization in sexual assault cases—as a prosecutor. I have tried these cases in a courtroom. I have spent hours—hours—with as-sault victims, and I can tell you that when we look at what happened during the course of these days—these few days—in reviewing and giving regard and respect to Dr. Ford, we have fallen short. We have fallen short. Sixty-three percent of sexual as-saults are not reported to the police in our country. Delayed reporting is nor-mal. I will tell you that when I was personally prosecuting sexual assault cases, we would be in a courtroom. I would be there as the prosecutor, with the accused, the accused’s attorney, a judge, and a courtroom full of prospec-tive jurors, and we would engage in a process called voir dire, where we would talk with prospective jurors to determine if they would be able to sit as a juror and, without bias, listen to the case and then make a determina-tion about the facts and the law. I cannot tell you the number of times, colleagues, that a prospective juror would raise their hand and ask could they quietly speak with me and the defense attorney and the judge in the judge’s chambers outside of the courtroom and outside of the sight and the ability for anyone else in the court-room to hear. We would go into the judge’s chambers, and I cannot tell you the number of people who would sit in a chair, and, with tears in their eyes, tell us that they had been a victim of sexual assault and had never told any-one, not even their spouse, but because of what they had experienced, they knew they could not possibly sit in a courtroom and hear the testimony they knew would come related to the charges they knew the case was about. This is an issue that impacts so many Americans, most of whom don’t report it and don’t tell anyone, and usually when they do, it is because something precipitated the telling of their story that was beyond the time during which they endured the assault itself. Dr. Ford’s experience in this regard is no different from the majority of sexual assault victims, and she should be believed. I know what it means to engage in an investigation and a search for the truth, having been a part of in-vestigations to determine what has happened and, in particular, if a crime has occurred. Now, let’s be clear about one thing. There has been a lot of conflation around here about the subject and the need for an investigation into Dr. Ford’s allegations. Ours was not a search to determine whether a crime occurred. Ours was not a search to de-termine whether we had enough facts to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime had occurred. No. Ours was an investigation to figure out enough about what happened to deter-mine if Brett Kavanaugh is fit to serve on the highest Court in our land. Is he fit to be a jurist in the place where we have said justice in our country occurs, in the house where we listen to evi-dence and truth and make determina-tions based on the veracity and truth-fulness of what has occurred? That is our role when it comes to Dr. Ford’s al-legations, and we fell short. We fell short. We did not do her justice, and we did not do the American people justice. We were given 1 week to investigate. The Republicans said: You will get 1 week. They threw out 1 week—an arbi-trary amount of time—and in less than 1 week we were presented with paltry documents. Clearly, when the White House directed the FBI to do its work, it appears from everything I have seen, the FBI was not permitted to look at all of the allegations. That is clear to me. It is clear the White House did not permit the FBI to request Mark Judge’s Safeway employment records. It is clear, from everything I have seen, the White House did not permit the FBI to investigate the dishonest testi-mony of Brett Kavanaugh or to exam-ine and listen to the evidence that would have been provided by a list of over two dozen witnesses who would have been, at the very least, able to corroborate or deny the allegations that were made. This was not a mean-ingful investigation into the allega-tions that are before us, and this, most importantly, was not a search for the truth. Media outlets have reported that there are more than 40 people with po-tential relevant information who are willing to share their information but only 9 people were interviewed. This is a travesty. They did not interview the Georgetown Prep alumni or others from that era who contradict Kavanaugh’s testimony. They did not interview Dr. Ford’s husband or a num-ber of her friends who she told of the assault before—before—Kavanaugh’s nomination. They did not interview the former FBI special agent who con-ducted Dr. Ford’s polygraph. They did not interview Kavanaugh’s roommate at Yale who has contradicted Kavanaugh’s testimony. They did not

interview another one of Kavanaugh’s neighbors in the dorm at Yale. They did not interview three of Kavanaugh’s friends from Yale who wrote in the Washington Post just last night: 
Brett also belonged to a Yale senior secret society called Truth and Courage. We believe that Brett neither tells the former nor em-bodies the latter. 
They did not interview Dr. Ford at all—they did not interview Dr. Ford at all. They did not give her the ability to speak her truth during the so-called in-vestigation, and they did not interview Judge Kavanaugh about these allega-tions. This was not a search for the truth. This was not an investigation. This was an abdication of responsibility and duty. This is on the heels of a process that began with hiding more than 90 percent of Judge Kavanaugh’s record. We only received approximately 400,000 pages out of an estimated 6.9 million pages of documents. The Republicans have been saying: You should be happy you received thousands of pages of doc-uments because they want us to treat crumbs on the table like it is a feast. These were crumbs on the table com-pared to the vast amount of informa-tion that is available to some about his background. This process has left the American people with more questions than an-swers. This has not been a search for the truth. The minimum standard for a Su-preme Court nominee should be some-one who we are confident will dem-onstrate impartiality, integrity, and truthfulness, but the nominee we are voting on has not demonstrated those qualities. Every American is entitled to the benefit of the doubt, but nobody is en-titled to a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court. I yield to my colleague Senator M
UR-
RAY. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for very clearly outlining, for all of us to hear, why this was not a search for truth on an issue that affects so many people in this country, the victims of sexual assault who often, as she just described, do not talk about it, do not speak about it, do not ever tell anyone until there is a reason to, which is what Dr. Ford did. While the Senator from California is here, you said this was not a search for truth. When it comes to victims of sex-ual assault—and you have dealt with them time and again as a district at-torney and attorney general in the State of California—what message does this send when they see the U.S. Sen-ate? Ms. HARRIS. Senator M
URRAY , you and I have talked about it. We all talked about it. Part of the pain of this process is a real concern that sexual assault victims and survivors may take away from this process that their sto-ries will not be heard or believed. Part of the pain I am taking away from this process is those who have a story to tell or might have been prepared to have the courage to report may decide: Look what happened to Dr. Ford. It doesn’t matter. No one will believe me, and why should I go through that? I have to say this. You and I have dis-cussed it, and Senator BLUMENTHAL  and I have discussed it together. Part of what we must message—even if our Republican colleagues will not—is to all of the women and men out there who have experienced this: We will hear you. We will see you. We will re-spect you. We will give you dignity. Speak your truth. Do not be afraid. Do not let this system or any aspect of it bully you into silence. It is critical we talk about this issue. I believe this is an issue right now that is where the issue of domestic violence was about 30 years ago. There was a perception about domestic violence I hope we have gotten beyond. There was a perception about domestic violence: Oh, you know, what happens in the King’s castle is the King’s business. That is private business. That is not our business. Then we evolved as a society and re-alized, no, she is walking around with a black eye or a busted lip; that is everybody’s business. She deserves to be safe, and we must stand up for her. I believe this is an inflection moment on the issue of sexual assault, and I hope and pray this is a moment where everyone will agree, no one should si-lently suffer. Let’s talk about this. Let’s talk about the fact that every 98 seconds in the United States of Amer-ica, someone is sexually assaulted. Let’s talk about the fact that 63 per-cent of sexual assaults are not reported to the police. Let’s talk about the fact, since Dr. Ford had the courage to speak out, one of the biggest national organizations that addresses sexual as-sault saw a 738-percent increase in the calls they received from survivors of these cases. Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator from California, and I so agree. This is one of my biggest fears about this mo-ment. Let me talk about why that is true. I was a mom at home in 1991. I was a State senator but not interested in what was happening here at all. My interest came because I watched the Clarence Thomas-Hill hearings, and I watched how a woman shared a very difficult story with an all-male panel of the Judiciary Committee at the time. She was disbelieved. She was swept aside. She was treated as if her voice wasn’t important, and she was not believed. I was so angry as a woman because like so many women in this country, I knew of so many people with experi-ences much like hers who, too, at work at that time had been dismissed, not believed, and were afraid to speak up. I was angry, and I went to a gathering that night and told some of my friends in 1991, the night of the hearing, I am going to have to run for the U.S. Sen-ate because I need to be inside that to speak up for these women. That is what motivated me to run. I was not given one chance of winning that Senate race. Here I am today, 27 years later. Why? Because so many women and men who understood shared that experience and knew that voice needed to be here. That is what brought me to the U.S. Senate. Let me talk about Dr. Ford because I listened to her, like everyone else did, and I heard her voice and it rang so true to me. I watched her with tears in my eyes because she was honest, she was sincere, she was persuasive, she was credible. She had no reason to lie— none. In fact, I think we should remem-ber, she did not want to come forward initially. She was worried about the at-tacks that would come. She knew the history, as every one of us do, what happens to those courageous voices when they speak up, the invasion of privacy they have. She knew what it would mean for her family. She only came forward when Judge Kavanaugh was on the very short list for the Supreme Court, before he was ever sent to us. She came forward and spoke out, but no one called her. She didn’t want to do it publicly. She didn’t want to have this become what she was known for in her life, but she did. If it weren’t for her, we would not be at this point. Judge Kavanaugh was selected, and only then was Dr. Ford able to get her information to the people who would pay attention. She insisted it be kept confidential, to none of our surprise. She didn’t want a spectacle. She didn’t want a show. Why did she do that? She felt it was her civic duty that we as U.S. Senators—who were giving, essen-tially, a job interview to a man who wanted a position on the highest Court of the land and would be judging people in front of him—should know what his character was. Her story was compelling. She took a polygraph test. She did everything right. She had told people before. She presented her case credibly. It is ex-tremely disconcerting to me, as some-one who watched the Clarence Thomas- Hill hearings and is sitting here, that I have heard people dismiss her, put her down, all the way up to the President of the United States. What message does that send across the country today and to other women who are so bravely now telling their stories so it will not happen to anyone else? What does this say to them? What does it say to young girls in high school and col-lege today? They are going to get away with it, so be quiet because it will only ruin your life, not theirs. I have heard my colleagues say: Well, it was high school, it was college. Really? Is that what we want young boys in high school today to think; that it is OK, don’t worry, whatever you do in high school does not count— whatever you do in college doesn’t count? I do not want my grandson to hear that message. I do not want my grand-daughters to hear that message. I want

my country to be better than that. Dr. Ford is a real person. She is not alone. If any Senator in the U.S. Senate is listening, they will hear voices in their own States, from places they know, from their own relatives, from friends they have not ever known about, bravely come forward because Dr. Ford did. This Senate, with the action we are pursuing, could crush those voices forever. To my friends out there and to every-one who has a story, do not be silent. That is not how we win this for the fu-ture, but know we do believe you. The Senate has changed since then. I was proud of the Judiciary Committee members on our side, because unlike when I watched the Senate in 1991, there were women and men there who were listening, and they are today. We have to, in this Senate, think about the consequence of this vote to so many people who are listening today and asking: Do I say anything or do I let it happen? I urge my colleagues to remember the lesson of 1991, where too many peo-ple felt ‘‘I can’t speak out.’’ We are changing. We are growing. We are speaking out. It is so imperative this Senate stand behind those women. We hear you. We believe you. We know that happened to you. You need to tell your story. You need to have the cour-age, and we will be behind you. I say to the Senators who are joining me today, both who have been involved in these cases, I am concerned this message could be the wrong one for young men and women who are coming behind us. We have to stand up for them. I yield to the Senator from Con-necticut. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am honored to join these two eloquent colleagues who have each been cham-pions for this cause as women speaking about the problem of sexual assault in our country—the epidemic of sexual as-sault that continues to be a scourge across our country. Most of my career in law enforcement, like my distin-guished colleague from California, has been involved in making laws work for people and deterring exactly this kind of heinous lawbreaking. It is criminal. It is a crime, but it is one of the least reported crimes because of the public shaming and character assassination and mocking and ridiculing we have seen from men in power over just the last few days and weeks. I want to say, as a man speaking on the Senate floor—and greatly honored to do so—to other men in this country, those men in power who have mocked and ridiculed Dr. Blasey Ford cannot be our role model. Those men in power—they may be colleagues and they may be the President of the United States who have belittled and demeaned and dismissed Dr. Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez and sur-vivors across the country—do not speak for us. I believe Dr. Blasey Ford. I believe Dr. Blasey Ford because she was credible and powerful as a witness before us in what she remembered and what she so candidly said she couldn’t remember. I believe Deborah Ramirez. I believe all of you who have written my office or called us, as many of you have done in other States to my col-leagues, who have recounted the hor-rors of your personal experience with sexual assault, who have come to me as I have been in airports or rallies or other public meetings and shared with me your horrific story. I believe you. America believes you. Let me say to Dr. Blasey Ford’s sons, you should be proud of your mom. You should be proud of your mom because she is a profile in courage. To Mr. Ford, you should be proud of your wife. To all the men in America, we need to believe survivors of sexual assault. We need to protect and respect them, not just in word but in deed so they will come forward and tell us their sto-ries so we can conquer scourge. We should be proud of the brave women who have brought us truth that cannot be denied no matter how much character assassination and public shaming they have endured. We know their truth. This issue of how America moves forward on sexual assault is big-ger than this nomination. It will last beyond the vote tomorrow. It will be a defining question for each of us as men, as human beings. Judge Kavanaugh, in facing these al-legations, has also revealed something profoundly significant about himself. When he came to the committee after Dr. Blasey Ford, he revealed his true character. He pulled back the mask on the judge and revealed the man. What we saw was someone filled with rage and spite, self-pitying and arrogant, deeply partisan, and threatening. We can disagree on Judge Kavanaugh’s views on jurisprudential issues and pol-icy and law. We can disagree on issues relating to his out-of-the-mainstream, far-right ideological position, but what cannot be denied is that picture of Judge Kavanaugh before our com-mittee that indicated profoundly a lack of temperament and trust-worthiness. That picture led former Justice John Paul Stevens to revoke his endorsement and to say his per-formance was disqualifying. What we saw—as they say, a picture is worth a thousand words—was a man who refused to answer questions; he snapped at my colleagues; he spouted partisan conspiracy theories. That is the real Brett Kavanaugh—the Brett Kavanaugh who characterized Dr. Ford’s serious and credible allegations as nothing more than ‘‘a calculated and orchestrated political hit.’’ He, in effect, depicted her as a puppet or a pawn of Senators or political figures, not people who came forward volun-tarily in their own right and on their own initiative, as truly they did. He was the Brett Kavanaugh who al-leged that it was all ‘‘revenge on behalf of the Clintons.’’ He is the Brett Kavanaugh who, as the Portland Press Herald characterized it, ‘‘ripped off the nonpartisan mask’’ and never looked back. He is the Brett Kavanaugh who threatened us, saying, ‘‘What goes around, comes around.’’ In Brett Kavanaugh’s own words, a judge must be someone who is ‘‘even- handed, unbiased, impartial, courteous yet firm, and dedicated to a process, not a result.’’ Those are his own words. That is not Brett Kavanaugh the man. It will not be Brett Kavanaugh the Jus-tice if he is confirmed. Brett Kavanaugh revealed himself to be a partisan—an angry and bitter par-tisan—not an impartial jurist, and he did so in prepared remarks, planned and premeditated, well calculated, written word for word, and delivered word for word as he angrily turned the pages, and that is the message that, for me, resonates because I have argued cases in the Supreme Court. I have spent a career standing before judges. Some of their rulings I liked; some of them I disliked. Some of their conclu-sions I thought were maybe incorrect. But I knew that those men and women wanted to be impartial. When they put those robes on, as Brett Kavanaugh has done, they left party and partisan in-terests at the door. Now, when I go to the U.S. Supreme Court, if Brett Kavanaugh is con-firmed, there can be no trust or con-fidence that he will be that impartial jurist. It is and will be a stain, a cloud, on the U.S. Supreme Court. All the Su-preme Court has in the way of power is the trust and credibility and con-fidence of the American people, which will be diminished forever. So let me pose a question to my col-league from California because she has so well described the voir dire process. It is jury selection, where we make an effort to pick jurors who are impartial and nonpartisan. I say to Senator H
ARRIS , if Brett Kavanaugh came to a courtroom where the Senator was trying a case as an at-torney general, and he were in the jury pool to be picked for a jury, would the Senator pick him as a juror? After that appearance before our committee, would the Senator allow him to sit on a case where the Senator was liti-gating? Ms. HARRIS. I say to Senator B
LUMENTHAL , my response would be no. My response is no, and I will tell you why—because one of the most impor-tant qualities of a juror in our system of justice is that they have the ability to receive information without bias, without any interest in the outcome, and Judge Kavanaugh has made it very clear to the American public that he is biased, that he is perceiving informa-tion and perceives it through the lens of a partisan and through the lens of the person he has been his entire ca-reer, which is a partisan operative. There were moments, perhaps during his initial testimony, where he may have distracted us from that part of his

history, where he talked in a calm voice about certain things. He cer-tainly knows case law and talked about it. But when the issues got hot, when it became about fundamental issues, the veneer was stripped away, and Brett Kavanaugh showed us who he really is. On the point of temperament, I think it is important for a number of reasons that the American people really review his testimony during those hearings these last days of this process because what he showed us also are two things in the way that he responded to our colleagues and approached the issue. One, he showed us that he lacks credibility, and I will tell you why I say that. When I was trying cases, I re-call an instruction the jury would re-ceive at the close of a case; the judge would give the jury instructions about how they could evaluate—it was a tool to help them evaluate the credibility of a witness, and one of the instructions was that it is relevant and significant for you to analyze the demeanor of this witness toward the proceedings. On this point, let’s recall Dr. Ford’s de-meanor and Judge Kavanaugh’s de-meanor. Dr. Ford went out of her way to be helpful and truthful. She corrected her-self when she thought there was more to offer. She yielded: Would the com-mittee like a break? If so, I will take one. If not, I can keep going. By contrast, Judge Kavanaugh was arrogant, he was aggressive, he was ac-cusatory, and, clearly, he was not in control of himself. But I have to be-lieve he was in control of his words be-cause, as the Senator has pointed out, he told us he wrote his speech the night before. He said: I didn’t show my staff. I just wrote these. Well, you know, we often advise peo-ple when you are feeling hot about something, write it all out and then sleep on it. Then look at those words the next day, and see if you really want to stand by them. This is a judge who is meticulous, he says, in everything he does. I believe that he wrote those words the night be-fore. I am sure he slept on it. I am sure he looked at those notes again, and he decided that is what he was going with because it wasn’t just about the heat of that moment. These are the things he really believes. That is why he said it, so let’s believe him at his word. He is a partisan. For that reason, I answer the Sen-ator’s question by saying, no, I would not select him to be on a jury. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I think this issue of temperament—and I am going to pose a question to my colleague from Washington—is fundamental to our system of justice in this country. Courtrooms are sometimes really emo-tional places, and sometimes they are angry places. The function of the judge is to remove the emotion and the anger, to be impartial and balanced and even keeled. So for a judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals to engage in the kind of angry outburst—it was not sponta-neous; it was not the result of some ac-cusation in the moment. It was cal-culated. It was premeditated. It was written the day before. It was inexcus-able and unacceptable. I will ask my colleague from the State of Washington, since she is not a lawyer, perhaps to her credit: If the Senator were appearing in a courtroom with Judge Kavanaugh, wouldn’t the Senator ask that he step away from the case, that he recuse himself in light of what he has said about all Democrats, about vast classes of peo-ple—this anger that he has expressed? Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator from Connecticut. No, I am not a law-yer. I was a preschool teacher, and one of the things I do know is that I wanted my students to know it is not OK to bully. You have to take a pause and do what is right. But let me tell you, what I would want for every one of the kids I have ever taught in preschool is to know that if anything they deeply care about—an issue or they themselves— ever appears in a court, then they should feel, in the United States of America, that they would be given a fair shot, and win or lose, the judge presiding over them would leave them with that feeling at the end of the day. That, to me, is why temperament is so important. If Americans lose the sense that no matter who they are or what their issue is or where they come from or how much money they make in our court of law, they stand a chance to be heard, even if they lose or if they win— that is why temperament is so impor-tant to me as a nonlawyer and someone who cares deeply about this country. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I will yield back to my colleague from California, but let me just close my part of this col-loquy by saying that we saw the real Brett Kavanaugh before us on that day at that moment, and I think my col-leagues, if they review that picture, a picture is worth a thousand words. If they apply common sense—we should not leave common sense at the door. If they put themselves in the shoes of someone appearing, seeking justice, they will vote against Brett Kavanaugh and the disrespect that he showed that brave survivor, Dr. Blasey Ford. I yield back to my colleague from California. Ms. HARRIS. I thank my colleagues from Washington and from Con-necticut. I agree, we can find a better nominee, and I yield to the Senator from the great State of Virginia. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Virginia. Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I also rise to speak on the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. When he was nominated to fill the vacancy occasioned by the retirement of Justice Kennedy, I immediately began to read all I could about his record. I reviewed his judicial opinions, law review articles, speeches, and I re-viewed, such as they were made avail-able, documents produced from his time working with the Bush adminis-tration and his work with the special prosecutor, Ken Starr. Following the review, I met with him to ask him serious questions about his record. I then watched his Judiciary Committee hearing with interest. After that hearing, based on all I had seen and read, I announced my opposition to his nomination for two reasons. First, the Nation needs a Justice with the backbone to stand up as an independent check against both the President and Congress. That is why our Nation gives judges life tenure, so they can render independent rulings without fear of losing their jobs. In a whole series of writings, speech-es, and rulings over the course of many years, both as a lawyer and as a judge, Judge Kavanaugh has embraced an un-usual deference to Executive power. I think this is one of the reasons the President nominated him, and I don’t have confidence that Judge Kavanaugh will hold the President accountable to the law. Second, Judge Kavanaugh’s writings as a Bush administration lawyer—at least those that the majority has al-lowed us to see—demonstrate his per-sonal view that settled law is settled only until five Justices decide to do something different. This is true, as a matter of real-politik, but I am left with serious ques-tions about what other areas of settled law might be unsettled, should he as-cend to the Court. I can understand how my colleagues might reach different conclusions on the two issues that led me to oppose this nominee, but since I announced my position, two additional issues of great importance have arisen. The first is how the Senate, as an in-stitution charged with leadership, will respond to the real and pervasive prob-lem of sexual assault. The second issue is how blatantly partisan we would want the Supreme Court to be. Christine Blasey Ford has come for-ward alleging that Judge Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in high school. Deborah Ramirez has come forward to allege that he sexually humiliated her during a party during his time at Yale. The two allegations by two people who do not know each other, about in-stances that happened in different times at different places, have striking similarities. Both Ford and Ramirez al-lege that Kavanaugh was under the in-fluence of alcohol and, in the presence of other people, assaulted or sexually humiliated them while others stood by laughing—laughing. In both allega-tions, the sexual abuse of a woman was treated as some form of entertainment for other persons. People who have suffered from sexual assault or harassment are watching to see how the Senate responds to these serious charges. And what do they see?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6585 October 5, 2018 
A hearing where Dr. Ford described her experience calmly, credibly, and can-didly, while Judge Kavanaugh attacked her claims, as well as those of Ms. Ra-mirez, as nothing more than a partisan political conspiracy; a narrowly lim-ited, 5-day investigation by the FBI, which, under orders from the White House, contacted a handful of wit-nesses, while dozens of witnesses prof-fered by Dr. Ford and Ms. Ramirez were ignored; and a single copy of the FBI investigation notes made available for Senators to read, provided that its meager contents not be shared with the press or public. Even that minimal investigation raises serious concerns about these claims and Judge Kavanaugh’s general truthfulness, but by moving forward to a vote anyway, the unmistakable mes-sage to survivors is that the Senate does not take allegations of sexual as-sault seriously. More than 150 survivors of sexual abuse from Virginia have reached out to me to share their personal stories and ask that the Senate show we care about survivors. Some of these people are women I have known for decades who had never shared their stories with me. A woman from Alexandria wrote: 
As a citizen, veteran, assistant professor, mother, grandmother, wife and sexual as-sault victim at age 17 in 1968, I want to thank Dr. Blasey Ford for her testimony. I have never told anyone of the sexual attack, and I am 68 years old. 
A woman from Sterling wrote: 
I want my future daughters to grow up in a country where sexual assault and abuse is taken seriously by every official and legal professional in the United States. 
A man from Chesapeake wrote: 
As a male sexual assault victim, I under-stand how difficult it is to come forward. I strongly and respectfully urge you to at-tempt to empathize with those of us who have been abused. 
A survivor from Radford wrote ex-pressing dissatisfaction with the mini-mal investigation, saying, ‘‘It makes me feel like if my attacker were nomi-nated for the Supreme Court, that I wouldn’t be taken seriously either.’’ A woman from Williamsburg wrote: 
Dr. Ford has agreed to full investigations into her experiences, but our leaders are fail-ing her and every American citizen. I watch this unfold with anticipation, hoping that my representatives will listen to us. 
An immigrant from Henrico: 
When my family immigrated, an American couple who had helped sponsor our family be-came my temporary legal guardians. My sponsor mother was wonderful but did not know that her husband repeatedly molested and raped me. It started at age five until I returned to my family at age nine—my older daughter’s current age. 
What are these survivors asking? First, that a real investigation into the charges be conducted; that the dozens of witnesses proffered by Ms. Ramirez and Dr. Ford not be ignored; and fi-nally, that the Senate not confirm to the Supreme Court a person with a question mark by his name. To confirm Judge Kavanaugh under these circumstances would send a pow-erful message that the Senate—and now possibly the Supreme Court—is a hostile environment for survivors of sexual assault. The second issue raised by these alle-gations is how partisan we want the Court to be. A person accused of any offense—especially sexual assault—is entitled to defend themselves. It is nat-ural to be emotional and even angry of such an offense if one felt falsely ac-cused. But Judge Kavanaugh went far beyond that. He claimed that the alle-gations of Dr. Ford and Ms. Ramirez were part of a political conspiracy con-nected to the Democratic Party, out-side activists, and the Clintons. The performance was insulting, and the conspiracy charge was a complete fabrication. There is no evidence to suggest that politics created Dr. Ford’s account of being attacked at a party, her history of seeking counseling years before the nomination, the notes from her therapist, her willingness to take a polygraph, the results of that poly-graph, the extensive corroboration of her story of alcohol-fueled house par-ties in the DC suburbs in 1982, or the admitted exploits of the alleged co-as-sailant, Mark Judge. There is no evidence to suggest that politics created Ms. Ramirez’s account of being sexually humiliated at Yale. Indeed, if the FBI were willing to inter-view witnesses who are now speaking publicly, there is ample evidence cor-roborating the account. So when a nominee who in the past advocated slash-and-burn partisan tac-tics as part of the Starr investigation reveals that he still harbors partisan resentment and attempts to shrug off serious claims of sexual assault as a political conspiracy connected to ‘‘out-side leftwing . . . groups’’ or the Clin-tons, he reveals a temperament that would be very dangerous if added to the Supreme Court. That is why retired Justice John Paul Stevens has come out urging a ‘‘no’’ vote on this nomina-tion. The good news is that there is a solu-tion to this. There is a solution. We need not settle for a nominee burdened by questions regarding sexual assault allegations or excessive partisanship. There are numerous jurists who could meet the standards of a Republican President and a Republican Senate ma-jority who do not have these issues. Why approve a nominee whose approval would send a hostile message to sexual assault survivors? Why approve a nominee whose nomination and ap-proval would send a message of concern for those who don’t share his political views? We can find a nominee who will not cause sexual assault survivors, liti-gants, or lawyers to fear how they will be treated by the Nation’s highest Court. For the good of the Senate and for the good of the Court, I urge my col-leagues to vote no on the Kavanaugh nomination, and I ask the President to send up a nominee who will not hurt the reputation of either institution. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. YOUNG ). The Senator from Maine. (Disturbance in the Visitors’ Gal-leries.) The PRESIDING OFFICER. As a re-minder to our guests in the Galleries, expressions of approval or disapproval are not permitted in the Senate Gal-lery. The Senator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. Presi-dent. Mr. President, the five previous times that I have come to the floor to explain my vote on the nomination of a Justice to the U.S. Supreme Court, I have begun my floor remarks explain-ing my decision with a recognition of the solemn nature and the importance of the occasion. But today we have come to the conclusion of a confirma-tion process that has become so dys-functional, it looks more like a carica-ture of a gutter-level political cam-paign than a solemn occasion. The President nominated Brett Kavanaugh on July 9. Within moments of that announcement, special interest groups raced to be the first to oppose him, including one organization that didn’t even bother to fill in the judge’s name on its prewritten press release— they simply wrote that they opposed ‘‘Donald Trump’s nomination of XX to the Supreme Court of the United States.’’ A number of Senators joined the race to announce their opposition, but they were beaten to the punch by one of our colleagues who actually an-nounced opposition before the nomi-nee’s identity was even known. Since that time, we have seen special interest groups whip their followers into a frenzy by spreading misrepresen-tations and outright falsehoods about Judge Kavanaugh’s judicial record. Over-the-top rhetoric and distortions of his record and testimony at his first hearing produced short-lived headlines which, although debunked hours later, continued to live on and be spread through social media. Interest groups have also spent an unprecedented amount of dark money opposing this nomination. Our Supreme Court confirmation process has been in steady decline for more than 30 years. One can only hope that the Kavanaugh nomination is where the process has finally hit rock bottom. Against this backdrop, it is up to each individual Senator to decide what the Constitution’s advice-and-consent duty means. Informed by Alexander Hamilton’s Federalist 76, I have inter-preted this to mean that the President has broad discretion to consider a nominee’s philosophy, whereas my duty as a Senator is to focus on the nominee’s qualifications as long as that nominee’s philosophy is within the mainstream of judicial thought. I have always opposed litmus tests for judicial nominees with respect to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6586 October 5, 2018 
their personal views or politics, but I fully expect them to be able to put aside any and all personal preferences in deciding the cases that come before them. I have never considered the President’s identity or party when evaluating Supreme Court nomina-tions. As a result, I voted in favor of Justices Roberts and Alito, who were nominated by President Bush; Justices Sotomayor and Kagan, who were nomi-nated by President Obama; and Justice Gorsuch, who was nominated by Presi-dent Trump. I began my evaluation of Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination by reviewing his 12-year record on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, including his more than 300 opinions and his many speech-es and law review articles. Nineteen at-torneys, including lawyers from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, briefed me many times each week and assisted me in evaluating the judge’s extensive record. I met with Judge Kavanaugh for more than 2 hours in my office. I listened carefully to the testimony at the committee hearings. I spoke with people who knew him personally, such as Condoleezza Rice and many others. I talked with Judge Kavanaugh a second time by phone for another hour to ask him very specific additional questions. I also have met with thousands of my constituents, both advocates and many opponents, regarding Judge Kavanaugh. One concern that I fre-quently heard was that the judge would be likely to eliminate the Affordable Care Act’s vital protections for people with preexisting conditions. I disagree with this contention. In a dissent in Seven-Sky v. Holder, Judge Kavanaugh rejected a challenge to the ACA on nar-row procedural grounds, preserving the law in full. Many experts have said that his dissent informed Justice Rob-erts’ opinion upholding the ACA at the Supreme Court. Furthermore, Judge Kavanaugh’s ap-proach toward the doctrine of sever-ability is narrow. When a part of a statute is challenged on constitutional grounds, he has argued for severing the invalid clause as surgically as possible while allowing the overall law to re-main intact. This was his approach in his dissent in a case that involved a challenge to the structure of the Consumer Finan-cial Protection Bureau. In his dissent, Judge Kavanaugh argued for ‘‘severing any problematic portions while leaving the remainder intact.’’ Given the cur-rent challenges to the ACA, pro-ponents, including myself, of protec-tions for people with preexisting condi-tions should want a Justice who would take just this kind of approach. Another assertion I have heard often is that Judge Kavanaugh cannot be trusted if a case involving alleged wrongdoing by the President were to come before the Court. The basis for this argument seems to be twofold. First, Judge Kavanaugh has written he believes Congress should enact leg-islation to protect Presidents from criminal prosecution or civil liability while in office. I believe opponents miss the mark on this issue. The fact that Judge Kavanaugh offered this leg-islative proposal suggests he believes the President does not have such pro-tection currently. Second, there are some who argue that given the current special counsel investigation, President Trump should not even be allowed to nominate a Jus-tice. That argument ignores our recent history. President Clinton, in 1993, nominated Justice Ginsburg after the Whitewater investigation was already underway, and she was confirmed 96 to 3. The next year, just 3 months after Independent Counsel Robert Fiske was named to lead the Watergate investiga-tion, President Clinton nominated Jus-tice Breyer. He was confirmed 87 to 9. Supreme Court Justices have not hesitated to rule against the Presi-dents who have nominated them. Per-haps most notably in United States v. Nixon, the three Nixon appointees who heard the case joined the unanimous opinion against him. Judge Kavanaugh has been unequivo-cal in his belief that no President is above the law. He has stated that Marbury v. Madison, Youngstown Steel v. Sawyer, and United States v. Nixon are three of the four greatest Supreme Court cases in history. What do they have in common? Each of them is a case where Congress served as a check on Presidential power. I would note, the fourth case Judge Kavanaugh has pointed to as the greatest in history was Brown v. Board of Education. One Kavanaugh decision illustrates the point about the check on Presi-dential power directly. He wrote the opinion in Hamdan v. United States, a case that challenged the Bush adminis-tration’s military commission prosecu-tion of an associate of Osama Bin Laden. This conviction was very impor-tant to the Bush administration, but Judge Kavanaugh, who had been ap-pointed to the DC Circuit by President Bush and had worked in President Bush’s White House, ruled that the conviction was unlawful. As he ex-plained during the hearing: ‘‘We don’t make decisions based on who people are, or their policy preferences, or the moment. We base decisions on the law. ...  ’ ’  Others I have met with have ex-pressed concerns that Justice Ken-nedy’s retirement threatens the right of same-sex couples to marry. Yet Judge Kavanaugh described the Obergefell decision, which legalized same-gender marriages, as an impor-tant landmark precedent. He also cited Justice Kennedy’s recent Masterpiece Cakeshop opinion for the Court’s ma-jority stating that ‘‘the days of treat-ing gay and lesbian Americans or gay and lesbian couples as second class citizens who are inferior in dignity and worth are over in the Supreme Court.’’ Others have suggested that the judge holds extreme views on birth control. In one case, Judge Kavanaugh incurred the disfavor of both sides of the polit-ical spectrum for seeking to ensure the availability of contraceptive services for women while minimizing the in-volvement of employers with religious objections. Although his critics fre-quently overlook this point, Judge Kavanaugh’s dissent rejected argu-ments that the government did not have a compelling interest in facili-tating access to contraception. In fact, he wrote that the Supreme Court precedent ‘‘strongly suggested’’ that there was a ‘‘compelling interest’’ in facilitating access to birth control. There has also been considerable focus on the future of abortion rights based on the concern that Judge Kavanaugh would seek to overturn Roe v. Wade. Protecting this right is impor-tant to me. To my knowledge, Judge Kavanaugh is the first Supreme Court nominee to express the view that precedent is not merely a practice and tradition but rooted in article III of our Constitution itself. He believes precedent ‘‘is not just a judicial policy . . . it is constitu-tionally dictated to pay attention and pay heed to rules of precedent.’’ In other words, precedent isn’t a goal or an aspiration; it is a constitutional tenet that has to be followed except in the most extraordinary circumstances. The judge further explained that precedent provides stability, predict-ability, reliance, and fairness. There are, of course, rare and extraordinary times where the Supreme Court would rightly overturn a precedent. The most famous example was when the Supreme Court, in Brown v. Board of Education, overruled Plessy v. Ferguson, cor-recting a ‘‘grievously wrong’’ decision, to use the judge’s term, allowing racial inequality. But someone who believes the impor-tance of precedent has been rooted in the Constitution would follow long-es-tablished precedent except in those rare circumstances in which a decision is ‘‘grievously wrong’’ or ‘‘deeply in-consistent with the law.’’ Those are Judge Kavanaugh’s phrases. As the judge asserted to me, a long- established precedent is not something to be trimmed, narrowed, discarded, or overlooked. Its roots in the Constitu-tion give the concept of stare decisis greater weight such that the precedent can’t be trimmed or narrowed simply because a judge might want to on a whim. In short, his views on honoring precedent would preclude attempts to do by stealth that which one has com-mitted not to do overtly. Noting that Roe v. Wade was decided 45 years ago and reaffirmed 19 years later in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, I asked Judge Kavanaugh whether the passage of time is relevant to following precedent. He said decisions become part of our legal framework with the passage of time and that honoring precedent is essential to maintaining public confidence. Our discussion then turned to the right of privacy, on which the Supreme

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6587 October 5, 2018 
Court relied in Griswold v. Con-necticut, a case that struck down a law banning the use and sale of contracep-tives. Griswold established the legal foundation that led to Roe 8 years later. In describing Griswold as ‘‘set-tled law,’’ Judge Kavanaugh observed that it was the correct application of two famous cases from the 1920s, Meyer and Pierce, that are not seriously chal-lenged by anyone today. Finally, in his testimony, he noted repeatedly that Roe had been upheld by Planned Parenthood v. Casey, describ-ing it as precedent on precedent. When I asked him whether it would be suffi-cient to overturn a long-established precedent if five current Justices be-lieved it was wrongly decided, he em-phatically said no. Opponents frequently cite then-can-didate Donald Trump’s campaign pledge to nominate only judges who would overturn Roe. The Republican platform for all Presidential campaigns has included this pledge since at least 1980. During this time, Republican Presidents have appointed Justices O’Connor, Souter, and Kennedy to the Supreme Court. These are the very three Republican President-appointed Justices who authored the Casey deci-sion which reaffirmed Roe. Furthermore, pro-choice groups vig-orously opposed each of these Justices’ nominations. Incredibly, they even cir-culated buttons with the slogan: ‘‘Stop Souter or Women Will Die!’’ Just 2 years later, Justice Souter coauthored that Casey opinion, reaffirming a wom-an’s right to choose. Suffice it to say, prominent advocacy organizations have been wrong. These same interest groups have speculated that Judge Kavanaugh was selected to do the bidding of conserv-ative ideologues, despite his record of judicial independence. I asked the judge point-blank whether he had made any commitments or pledges to anyone at the White House, to the Federalist Society, or to any outside group on how he would decide cases. He un-equivocally assured me he had not. Judge Kavanaugh has received rave reviews for his 12-year track record as a judge, including for his judicial tem-perament. The American Bar Associa-tion gave him its highest possible rat-ing. Its Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary conducted an ex-traordinarily thorough assessment, so-liciting input from almost 500 people, including his judicial colleagues. The ABA concluded that ‘‘his integrity, ju-dicial temperament, and professional confidence met the highest standard.’’ Lisa Blatt, who has argued more cases before the Supreme Court than any other woman in history, testified: 
By any objective measure, Judge Kavanaugh is clearly qualified to serve on the Supreme Court. His opinions are invariably thoughtful and fair. 
Ms. Blatt, who clerked for and is an ardent admirer of Justice Ginsburg, and who is, in her own words, ‘‘an unapologetic defender of a woman’s right to choose,’’ said Judge Kavanaugh ‘‘fit[s] within the main-stream of legal thought.’’ She also ob-served ‘‘Judge Kavanaugh is remark-ably committed to promoting women in the legal profession.’’ That Judge Kavanaugh is more of a centrist than some of his critics main-tain is reflected in the fact that he and Chief Judge Merrick Garland voted the same way in 93 percent of the cases they heard together. Indeed, Chief Judge Garland joined in more than 96 percent of the majority opinions au-thored by Judge Kavanaugh, dissenting only once. Despite all of this, after weeks of re-viewing Judge Kavanaugh’s record and in listening to 32 hours of his testi-mony, the Senate’s advice and consent role was thrown into a tailspin fol-lowing the allegation of sexual assault by Professor Christine Blasey Ford. The confirmation process now involves evaluating whether Judge Kavanaugh committed sexual assault and lied about it to the Judiciary Committee. Some argue that because this is a lifetime appointment to our highest Court, the public interest requires that doubts be resolved against the nomi-nee. Others see the public interest as embodied in our long-established tradi-tion of affording to those accused of misconduct a presumption of inno-cence. In cases in which the facts are unclear, they would argue the question should be resolved in favor of the nomi-nee. I understand both viewpoints. This debate is complicated further by the fact that the Senate confirmation proc-ess is not a trial. But certain funda-mental legal principles about due proc-ess, the presumption of innocence, and fairness do bear on my thinking, and I cannot abandon them. In evaluating any given claim of mis-conduct, we will be ill-served in the long run if we abandon the presump-tion of innocence and fairness, tempt-ing though it may be. We must always remember it is when passions are most inflamed that fairness is most in jeop-ardy. The presumption of innocence is rel-evant to the advice and consent func-tion when an accusation departs from a nominee’s otherwise exemplary record. I worry that departing from this pre-sumption could lead to a lack of public faith in the judiciary and would be hugely damaging to the confirmation process moving forward. Some of the allegations levied against Judge Kavanaugh illustrate why the presumption of innocence is so important. I am thinking, in par-ticular, not of the allegations raised by Professor Ford but of the allegation that when he was a teenager, Judge Kavanaugh drugged multiple girls and used their weakened states to facilitate gang rape. This outlandish allegation was put forth without any credible sup-porting evidence and simply parroted the public statements of others. That such an allegation can find its way into the Supreme Court confirmation proc-ess is a stark reminder of why the pre-sumption of innocence is so ingrained in our American consciousness. Mr. President, I listened carefully to Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony be-fore the Judiciary Committee. I found her testimony to be sincere, painful, and compelling. I believe she is a sur-vivor of a sexual assault and that this trauma has upended her life. Neverthe-less, the four witnesses she named could not corroborate any of the events of the evening gathering where she said the assault occurred. None of the indi-viduals Professor Ford said were at the party has any recollection at all of that night. Judge Kavanaugh forcefully denied the allegations under penalty of per-jury. Mark Judge denied, under penalty of felony, that he had witnessed an as-sault. PJ Smyth, another person alleg-edly at the party, denied, under pen-alty of felony, that he was there. Pro-fessor Ford’s lifelong friend, Leland Keyser, indicated that under penalty of felony, she does not remember that party. Ms. Keyser went further. She in-dicated that not only does she not re-member a night like that but also that she does not even know Brett Kavanaugh. In addition to the lack of corrobo-rating evidence, we also learned some facts that raised more questions. For instance, since these allegations have become public, Professor Ford testified that not a single person has contacted her to say: ‘‘I was at the party that night.’’ Furthermore, the professor testified that although she does not remember how she got home that evening, she knew, because of the distance, she would have needed a ride. Yet not a single person has come forward to say that he or she was the one who drove her home or was in the car with her that night. Professor Ford also indi-cated that even though she left that small gathering of six or so people abruptly and without saying goodbye and was distraught, none of them called her the next day—or ever—to ask why she left or was she OK, not even her closest friend, Ms. Keyser. The Constitution does not provide guidance on how we are supposed to evaluate these competing claims. It leaves that decision up to each Sen-ator. This is not a criminal trial, and I do not believe claims such as these need to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Nevertheless, fairness would dic-tate that the claims should at least meet a threshold of ‘‘more likely than not’’ as our standard. The facts presented do not mean Pro-fessor Ford was not sexually assaulted that night or at some other time, but they do lead me to conclude that the allegations fail to meet the ‘‘more like-ly than not’’ standard. Therefore, I do not believe these charges can fairly prevent Judge Kavanaugh from serving on the Court.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6588 October 5, 2018 
Let me emphasize that my approach to this question should not be mis-construed as suggesting that unwanted sexual contact of any nature is not a serious problem in this country. To the contrary, if any good at all has come from this ugly confirmation process, it has been to create an awareness that we have underestimated the pervasive-ness of this terrible problem. I have been alarmed and disturbed, however, by some who have suggested that unless Judge Kavanaugh’s nomi-nation is rejected, the Senate is some-how condoning sexual assault. Nothing could be further from the truth. Every person—man or woman—who makes a charge of sexual assault de-serves to be heard and treated with re-spect. The #MeToo movement is real; it matters; it is needed; and it is long overdue. We know rape and sexual as-sault are less likely to be reported to the police than other forms of assault. On average, an estimated 211,000 rapes and sexual assaults go unreported every year. We must listen to sur-vivors, and every day we must seek to stop the criminal behavior that has hurt so many. We owe this to our-selves, our children, and generations to come. Since the hearing, I have listened to many survivors of sexual assault. Many were total strangers who told me their heart-wrenching stories for the first times in their lives. Some were friends whom I have known for decades. Yet, with the exception of one woman who had confided in me years ago, I had no idea they had been the victims of sex-ual attacks. I am grateful for their courage and their willingness to come forward, and I hope that in heightening public awareness, they have also light-ened the burden they have been quietly bearing for so many years. To them, I pledge to do all I can to ensure that their daughters and granddaughters never share their experiences. Over the past few weeks, I have been emphatic that the Senate has an obli-gation to investigate and evaluate the serious allegations of sexual assault. I called for and supported the additional hearing to hear from both Professor Ford and Judge Kavanaugh. I also pushed for and supported the FBI’s sup-plemental background investigation. This was the right thing to do. Christine Ford never sought the spot-light. She indicated she was terrified to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and she has shunned atten-tion since then. She seemed completely unaware of Chairman G
RASSLEY ’s offer to allow her to testify confidentially in California. In watching her, I could not help but feel that some people who wanted to engineer the defeat of this nomination cared little, if at all, for her well-being. Professor Ford testified that a very limited number of people had access to her letter. Yet that letter found its way into the public domain. She testi-fied she never gave permission for that very private letter to be released. Yet here we are. We are in the middle of a fight she never sought, arguing about claims she wanted to raise confiden-tially. One theory I have heard espoused re-peatedly is that our colleague Senator FEINSTEIN leaked Professor Ford’s let-ter at the eleventh hour to derail this process. I want to state this very clear-ly: I know Senator D
IANNE FEINSTEIN  extremely well, and I believe she would never do that. I knew that to be the case before she even stated it at the hearing. She is a person of integrity, and I stand by her. I have also heard some argue that the chairman of the committee somehow treated Professor Ford unfairly. Noth-ing could be further from the truth. Chairman G
RASSLEY , along with his ex-cellent staff, treated Professor Ford with compassion and respect through-out the entire process. That is the way the Senator from Iowa has conducted himself throughout a lifetime dedi-cated to public service. The fact remains that someone leaked this letter against Professor Ford’s express wishes. I suspect, regret-tably, that we will never know for cer-tain who did it. To that leaker, who I hope is listen-ing now, let me say that what you did was unconscionable. You have taken a survivor who was not only entitled to your respect but who also trusted you to protect her, and you have sacrificed her well-being in a misguided attempt to win whatever political crusade you think you are fighting. My only hope is that your callous act has turned this process into such a dysfunctional cir-cus that it will cause the Senate—and, indeed, all Americans—to reconsider how we evaluate Supreme Court nomi-nees. If that happens, then the appall-ing lack of compassion you afforded Professor Ford will at least have some unintended positive consequences. The politically charged atmosphere surrounding this nomination had reached a fever pitch even before these allegations were known, and it was challenging even then to separate fact from fiction. We live in a time of such great dis-unity, as the bitter fight over this nomination both in the Senate and among the public clearly demonstrates. It is not merely a case of differing groups having different opinions; it is a case of people bearing extreme ill will toward those who disagree with them. In our intense focus on our dif-ferences, we have forgotten the com-mon values that bind us together as Americans. With some of our best minds seeking to develop ever more so-phisticated algorithms designed to link us to websites that only reinforce and cater to our views, we can only expect our differences to intensify. This would have alarmed the drafters of our Constitution, who were acutely aware that different values and inter-ests could prevent Americans from be-coming and remaining a single people. Indeed, of the six objectives they in-voked in the preamble to the Constitu-tion, the one that they put first was the formation of ‘‘a more perfect Union.’’ Their vision of ‘‘a more perfect Union’’ does not exist today. If any-thing, we appear to be moving far away from it. It is particularly worrisome that the Supreme Court—the institu-tion that most Americans see as the principal guardian of our shared con-stitutional heritage—is viewed as part of the problem through a political lens. Mr. President, we have heard a lot of charges and countercharges about Judge Kavanaugh, but, as those who have known him best have attested, he has been an exemplary public servant, judge, teacher, coach, husband, and fa-ther. Despite the turbulent and bitter fights surrounding his nomination, my fervent hope is that Brett Kavanaugh will work to lessen the divisions in the Supreme Court so that we have far fewer 5–4 decisions and that public con-fidence in our judiciary and our highest Court is restored. Mr. President, I will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh. Thank you. (Applause, Senators rising.) The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, it is sometimes said that today’s Senate does not measure up to the Senate’s previous years because we have no elo-quent Senators who make compelling speeches. I think Senator C
OLLINS has just disproved that today. Whether or not one agrees with her, she was elo-quent. Her speech was compelling, and she has presented her case in the tradi-tion of another Senator from Maine who was serving here when I first came many years ago as a young Senate aide, Senator Margaret Chase Smith. It is that tradition of independence and diligence which is so valuable and so important, especially in times of stress like this. I had thought of following Senator C
OLLINS with some remarks of my own about what I found when I read the background checks today. I went to the section where we read classified docu-ments. I saw that over 25 years, 150 people had been interviewed about Judge Kavanaugh. They had specifi-cally been asked a question about whether they saw any evidence of alco-hol abuse, and every single one said no and that there was no evidence of sex-ual impropriety. I want to thank Senator C
OLLINS for her insistence on an extra week so that we could have a seventh FBI investiga-tion. I took the time to review that as well. I saw that no matter how credible Dr. Ford seemed—and she did seem credible to me—no one except Dr. Ford remembers that alleged incident. And the other four, as Senator C
OLLINS  said, who Dr. Ford said were there ei-ther don’t remember it or said that it didn’t happen. I think the takeaway from what the Senator from Maine has said is that we

have reached what she said she hopes is the rock bottom in the Senate con-firmation process. This is not the way things should be. Whether you are a Democrat or a Republican, we know that the most awful allegations—sex-ual assault certainly is as awful as any—deserve a modicum—there is a standard of fairness. She used the words ‘‘more likely than not’’ in her case. But in the U.S. Senate, we should be able to deal with such issues in a much better way than we have dealt with this. We—all of us; the confirmation proc-ess—have victimized Dr. Ford, and we have victimized Judge Kavanaugh. Until 2 weeks ago, Judge Kavanaugh had a reputation among most people who had ever heard of him as one of the leading scholars, judges, and teachers in America. I believe he is that, which is why I am voting for him. I am glad we are voting for him. I hope we all pause for a moment and listen to what Senator C
OLLINS said. I will conclude where I started. There may have been a time when there were more eloquent Senators who made more compelling speeches down the hall in the Old Senate Chamber—we know their great names—but her speech today stacks up with the best of them. I have heard speeches in this body for nearly half a century, both as a young aide and as a Member of the U.S. Sen-ate, and I will remember this one. It is not just because I happen to agree with her, but because she showed char-acteristic diligence, independence, fair-ness, and a suggestion of the lessons that we should have for the future of this unique institution and this unique country that we prize so much. I am going to think about what she has said. I hope other Members of the body do, and I hope many other Ameri-cans do as well. Thank you. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-jority leader. Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, in listening to the Senator from Ten-nessee, I am reminded that he and I were here in those days as young staff-ers. I was working for the Senator from Kentucky when Margaret Chase Smith was still here. She had already made her reputation by being the first Mem-ber of the U.S. Senate to take on Jo-seph McCarthy and his tactics. It took the Senate a couple of years to finally develop the courage to stand up to this demagogue and the tactics he em-ployed. Those of us who are in the Chamber today have had a unique opportunity to listen to a great statesman from Maine once again talk about this insti-tution and how it ought to treat mat-ters like this and to think about how we can rise above the depths to which we have sunk during this process. I want to thank the Senator from Maine. I have not heard a better speech in my time here, and I have been here a while. It was absolutely inspira-tional. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from South Carolina. Mr. GRAHAM. This is as close to McCarthyism as I hope we get in my lifetime. You are guilty until you are proven innocent. Whatever it takes to take you down, we will do. If one alle-gation is not enough, how about five? To the people who have come forward, we will do whatever we have to do to you to get the outcome we want. There are two ways of doing this: Senator COLLINS ’s way or what we have seen in the committee. If you want to go down the road of the committee, God help those who will follow. The biggest winners today are those who still want to be judges. You may have saved those who want to come after Judge Kavanaugh from humilia-tion to the nth degree because you re-jected it today. For every woman who comes forward about a sexual assault, only God knows how many never say a word. But to right one wrong, seldom does it help to create another. Senator C
OLLINS explained the di-lemma we face as a society and re-jected the idea that sacrificing Judge Kavanaugh’s good name would make anything better. To the extent that individuals mat-ter in America, you rose to the occa-sion. To the extent that you rejected the mob rule and accepted the rule of law, we will all be better. You have to have some way of judg-ing. Yes, we want people to come for-ward. They deserve to be heard. But there needs to be a process, for the good of us all, to make sure it is dis-posed of right. If this is enough, to be accused of something that happened 36 years ago and nobody can corroborate it, God help us all in any line of public service. All I can say is that it is not about you. I have never admired you more, and we often agree, and sometimes we don’t. It is about the system that you stood by today that has stood the test of time. I don’t know what kind of pressure there has been for you. I can only imagine because you are in a pur-ple State. I remember what Sotomayor and Kagan were for me—not very com-fortable, but I tried to embrace a sys-tem that has stood the test of time. But whatever happened to me, it has been 100 times worse for you. Senator F
LAKE , thank you. Without S
USAN COLLINS and J EFF FLAKE , we would not have heard from Dr. Ford, maybe, but you stood up and said that she needs to be heard. Without their in-sistence that the FBI check the com-mittee’s homework, we wouldn’t be where we are today. So you did a good thing. The one thing you wouldn’t do is be intimidated. The one thing you wouldn’t do is destroy Judge Kavanaugh’s life for no good reason. The one thing you wouldn’t do is play politics with the law. God bless you. I doubt if I will ever hear anybody more courageous in my political life. So when they write the history of our times, you will be in it. If John McCain were here, he would be your greatest cheerleader. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Oregon. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I wish my colleagues were here to share in this dialogue because there is such an absence of other Members sharing with each other their perspectives. We have a world that is enhanced by a media world that lives in a different universe that accentuates the differences be-tween the parties. I think we are on a course that does deepen the differences across America. I hope there is some way we can find in this Senate to be able to communicate across that growing chasm in a more effective manner. I have heard many of my colleagues speak to the issue of fairness on this floor. I offer just a brief, couple of sen-tences of points for you to consider as to why not all of America shares the perspective that this has been fair. When Dr. Ford was invited to come to speak to the committee, she said that she would like to come, but she wanted some time, and she would like to have corroborating individuals be able to appear before the committee. That was denied by the committee, and that bothered many people in this Chamber a great deal. Even in 1991, Anita Hill was given that opportunity. What is also very bothersome to indi-viduals is that Dr. Ford had put for-ward a list of eight individuals whom she had asked the FBI to talk to, to be corroborating witnesses, and the FBI could talk only to those within the scoping document that comes from the White House because, at that moment, they are not doing a criminal inves-tigation, they are doing a background investigation, and they have to follow the President’s instructions. Those in-structions, we are told, were not to talk to any of the corroborating wit-nesses, not the 8 she put forward and not the 20 who were put forward by Debbie Ramirez. So 28 individuals were not brought before the committee and not talked to by the FBI. I hope we have lots of opportunities to share our perspectives across the aisle to understand as we struggle with the issue of fairness because for many of us, fairness has not been achieved. The bigger message to these two women who came forward to share their journeys, to share their experi-ences, is that the U.S. Senate was un-willing to hear them out, unfortu-nately. Thank you. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. S
ASSE). The Senator from Michigan. Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I am rising today at a very important time for our country because who sits on the Supreme Court matters. It really mat-ters.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6590 October 5, 2018 
American dream, to the very health of our democracy, decisions made by the Supreme Court affect us every single day. As my colleagues know, I was born in Michigan. I have lived in Michigan my whole life. My whole family is still in Michigan. I am so grateful for that. Every decision I make in the U.S. Sen-ate puts the people of Michigan first. My decision to oppose Judge Brett Kavanaugh is no exception. The allegations that have been made against Judge Kavanaugh deserve to be taken extremely seriously. Even before the allegations came to light, Judge Kavanaugh’s record and his writings too often have gone against what is best for Michigan families. When confronted with cases that have special interests on one side and people on the other side, he has con-sistently sided with the special inter-ests. That is certainly true when it comes to healthcare. Healthcare isn’t political; it is personal for every single one of us. Michigan families know what they need: quality, affordable healthcare, including prescription drugs, and Michigan women deserve to make their own reproductive health de-cisions. Right now, a court case is pending in which the Trump administration is re-fusing to defend the law that protects people with preexisting conditions— people like Amy, a small business owner with chronic leukemia, and Lou-isa, a beautiful little girl born with half a heart. Half of Michigan families include someone with a preexisting condition, like high blood pressure, heart disease, asthma, diabetes, cancer. They deserve to know that healthcare will be there when they need it. Yet, if this case were to come before the U.S. Supreme Court and if Judge Kavanaugh were a member, I believe many families in Michigan would find themselves with no coverage and no care. We need judges who will make de-cisions based on what is best for peo-ple—not drug companies, not insurance companies, but for people. A second issue on the minds of our families is our water and the Great Lakes, just like the people of Flint who still struggle with lead in their water. Ask the people in at least 15 Michigan communities whose water is contami-nated with what we now call PFAS chemicals. That is an industrial chem-ical that has been linked to cancer and other diseases. Again and again, Judge Kavanaugh has ruled on behalf of pol-luters, not people. In one case, he argued that the Envi-ronmental Protection Agency exceeded its authority by trying to address pol-lution from one State that drifted into another State—as if somehow the air was going to stop at the border. Thank-fully, the Supreme Court voted 6 to 2 to overturn his decision. What would happen to our air and water if he is one of the people who is deciding this, par-ticularly if he were to be the tie vote? Third, I am deeply concerned by his belief in essentially unlimited Presi-dential power. In 2016, when asked what single case he would like to see over-turned, Judge Kavanaugh said he would like to ‘‘put the final nail’’ in a three-decades-old Supreme Court deci-sion that said independent counsels in-vestigating the President are constitu-tional. Judge Kavanaugh has also written that if a President doesn’t like the law, he can simply decide it is unconstitu-tional. He can simply refuse to enforce it. That might be how things work in Russia, in North Korea, and in Syria. It is not how things are supposed to work in America under our democracy. We have three separate branches of government. We need judges who will ensure that no one—no one, not even the President of the United States—is above the law. Also, Judge Kavanaugh’s views on what we now call dark money in our elections also concerns me greatly. In one 2011 case, Judge Kavanaugh ruled that foreign nationals could not cam-paign for or contribute money to can-didates. That sounds good. Unfortu-nately, he then went on to say that for-eign nationals can take part in issue advocacy—giving money for issue advo-cacy in American elections. In other words, Russians can contribute as much as they want to an issue group, which can then spend on behalf of can-didates. In this way, Judge Kavanaugh opened the door for unlimited dark money from foreign nationals—foreign enti-ties in our American elections. Do we imagine he will rule differently from a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court? Finally, there are the very serious al-legations made against Judge Kavanaugh and serious questions about how he has responded to them. In this country, we have due process. We want accusers to be heard and the accused to be able to defend them-selves. That is why it is so important that we heard from both Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Ford. I found Dr. Ford to be highly cred-ible. Her testimony was heart-wrench-ing. I believe Dr. Ford. Her story reso-nated with so many women because many of us have felt that same fear and heard the same laughter that she described. It takes an incredible amount of courage to speak up, and I know women across the country are grateful to Dr. Ford for doing so. I am grateful for the countless women who have called or written me with their stories of what has happened to them, oftentimes decades ago. I hope we are going to come to a point when all of this is over and use this as an oppor-tunity to make sure that when some-thing happens, women feel they can re-port it immediately and will be taken seriously, and we will have a due proc-ess system that works immediately to address these issues. I reviewed the FBI background file on Judge Kavanaugh. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in the very lim-ited scope. It did nothing to alleviate my concerns about the allegations, his truthfulness before the Senate Judici-ary Committee, or his suitability to sit on the Supreme Court. Judge Kavanaugh’s demeanor during the hearing was a shocking display of entitlement. No one is promised a Su-preme Court seat or entitled to a job interview. There are many people qualified to hold that kind of a posi-tion. But his sense of entitlement and condescension toward members of the Senate committee who were simply doing their jobs was shocking to me. Again, no one is owed a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court. We are talking about a lifetime appointment and an immense amount of power over peo-ple’s lives. Someone once said this: ‘‘The Su-preme Court must never be viewed as a partisan institution. The Justices on the Supreme Court do not sit on oppo-site sides of an aisle. They do not cau-cus in separate rooms.’’ That person was Brett Kavanaugh. He clearly has failed to meet his own standard. I know he has failed to meet mine. The people of Michigan deserve bet-ter. The people of America deserve bet-ter. They deserve someone on the Su-preme Court who understands their lives and will stand up for them, not special interests. They deserve someone on the Su-preme Court who understands that no-body—not even the President of the United States—is above the law. They deserve someone on the Su-preme Court who will work to keep dark money from foreign entities out of our elections. And they deserve someone on the Su-preme Court who has consistently lived up to the high standards we ought to demand of our Nation’s leaders. In Michigan, we teach our children that character matters. Now it is time to show that we mean it. I urge my colleagues to vote no on Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from New Hampshire. Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in express-ing my opposition to Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination. I will speak later in the evening about my overall assessment of Judge Kavanaugh’s record and nomination and about why I think some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are focusing on the wrong thing in deciding to support him. To echo my colleague from Michigan just now, no one has a right to a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court. What we should be focused on is that the coun-try has a right to an impartial, non-partisan U.S. Supreme Court. They have a right to Justices whose char-acter and fitness for the office is be-yond reproach and beyond doubt. De-spite everything I have heard from Judge Kavanaugh’s supporters, I do not think they can make that case.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6591 October 5, 2018 
My purpose in speaking right now is to express my deep concerns with Judge Kavanaugh’s record of ruling against access to healthcare. If confirmed, Judge Kavanaugh will be a deciding factor in the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans. Yet, time and again, he has dem-onstrated a commitment to a partisan agenda that would strip away care from some of our most vulnerable peo-ple. As recently as 2017, Judge Kavanaugh criticized Chief Justice Roberts’ deci-sion upholding the Affordable Care Act, and in his confirmation hearing, Judge Kavanaugh would not commit to up-holding legal protections for people with preexisting conditions—pre-existing conditions such as asthma, cancer, diabetes, and more. Confirming Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court would put those protec-tions at risk. I have heard from people across New Hampshire who are con-cerned about what will happen to them if they are denied coverage because of their preexisting condition. People like Kristen from Derry, NH. Kristen relies on medications that cost more than $1,200 every month to stay healthy, but if she lost her insurance because of her preexisting condition, she would not be able to afford that medication. Kristen said: 
I wouldn’t be able to breathe correctly. My COPD would worsen. My current standard of living—working full time as a social worker, a runner, active with my children—would quickly come to an end. 
That is what is at stake with this vote. Republican attorneys general, backed by the Trump administration, are suing to eliminate protections for pre-existing conditions. This case will soon be in front of the Supreme Court, and the next Supreme Court Justice could very well be the deciding vote in that decision. We need a Justice who would rise above partisanship, someone who will act impartially and rule on behalf of what is right for the American people. It is evident Judge Kavanaugh is not that person, and there is no reason to believe he would be an impartial arbi-ter when it comes to issues related to healthcare. Throughout this confirmation proc-ess, Judge Kavanaugh has revealed himself to be staunchly partisan, and never was that more clear than during his hearing on the allegations raised by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. During that hearing, he called those credible allegations against him ‘‘re-venge on behalf of the Clintons’’ and seemed to threaten his political en-emies by saying: ‘‘What goes around comes around.’’ There is ample reason to believe that Judge Kavanaugh would be an ally on the Supreme Court for the Trump ad-ministration and Republicans in Con-gress who are seeking to undermine our healthcare system, and for the health and well-being of Granite Staters and all Americans, I cannot support his nomination. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from New Jersey. Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court and to ask my colleagues—Republicans and Democrats alike—to recognize exactly what is at stake here. The philosopher Nietzsche once said that if you stare long enough into the abyss, the abyss will stare back into you. My friends, we here in the U.S. Sen-ate are staring into the abyss. What is staring back at us is a future in which the American people’s trust in the Su-preme Court is being irreparably dam-aged. To vote yes on Brett Kavanaugh is to send a message to every woman in America that your voice doesn’t mat-ter. If you risk everything—your secu-rity, your stability, your reputation— to come forward and speak truth to power about a sexual assault, they will call you credible. They will call you courageous. Yet they will not believe you. It is a message that says, if you have survived a sexual assault, don’t bother telling anyone because you must be mistaken. This traumatic and unfor-gettable moment in your life never happened. It must have been someone else. My friends, to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh with what we now know would be to forever tarnish the credi-bility and reputation of the highest Court in our land. Here is what we know. We know Judge Kavanaugh faces multiple credible allegations of sexual assault. Yet the investigation that was conducted looks nothing like the FBI investigation that was promised—not by President Trump, not by the Sen-ators who called for it, or by anyone else. We know neither Dr. Ford nor Judge Kavanaugh was interviewed by law en-forcement—the very essence of what the subject of the investigation is. Nei-ther of them was interviewed. We know dozens of people with corroborating evidence were flatout ignored by inves-tigators. I have heard some of my colleagues call this investigation thorough. How do you call an investigation thorough when neither the accused nor the ac-cuser was interviewed by the FBI? How do you call an investigation thorough when 40 corroborating wit-nesses who volunteered information to the FBI in recent days were reportedly ignored? You can’t get corroboration if you don’t talk to corroborating wit-nesses. The answer is simple: It is not thorough, and it is not trustworthy. This entire process, including the use of Executive privilege to deny the Sen-ate access to hundreds of thousands of documents of Judge Kavanaugh’s, has been shrouded in secrecy. And why the secrecy? Because President Trump and his team are desperate to get Judge Kavanaugh confirmed by any means necessary. Let’s remember what is going on. The President of the United States is the subject of a Federal investigation into whether his campaign accepted as-sistance from a hostile foreign power during the 2016 election. Already, the President’s campaign chairman, For-eign Policy Advisor, and former Na-tional Security Advisor have pled guilty to Federal crimes. He could have chosen any of the judges included on the rightwing list assembled by the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society. Instead, he picked the one judge with unprece-dented views of Presidential power. There is no other explanation for Presi-dent Trump choosing Brett Kavanaugh that I can think of other than he hopes this will be his get-out-of-jail card. The last few weeks have been a flurry of breaking news alerts and breathless gossiping in the halls. I am thankful for Dr. Ford’s courage and candor. She spoke her truth and has inspired count-less others to break their silence. I be-lieve her. I believe survivors. New Jer-sey is home to 1.8 million survivors. That is 1.8 million reasons to oppose Brett Kavanaugh. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, less than a quarter of sexual assault victims reported those inci-dents to police in 2016. After this past week, it is all too easy to see why. Leader MCCONNELL has called the al-legations of Dr. Ford ‘‘unsubstantiated smears.’’ What an insulting statement. When will we as a society begin to be-lieve women, to trust women? It can’t come soon enough. I was in the midst of my first cam-paign for Congress when Anita Hill’s allegations of sexual assault against Justice Clarence Thomas were inves-tigated but ultimately disregarded by the Senate. I am proud to have been elected to the House in 1992, the so- called Year of the Woman. Across the Capitol, a record four women were elected to the Senate. My colleague P
ATTY MURRAY decided to run after watching what happened to Anita Hill. She is still here fighting for survivors, and I am proud to have her as my colleague. We look back at the Clarence Thom-as hearings as a moment that failed America and failed all survivors of sex-ual assault. Yet here we are in 2018, and it appears as though we have made lit-tle progress. After Dr. Ford’s testimony, my Re-publican colleagues and even conserv-ative pundits praised her credibility. It only took Judge Kavanaugh’s out-rageous performance—a performance we now know was misleading at best and untruthful at worst—for these same Republicans to cast her aside. The message they have sent to sur-vivors who are brave enough to come forward is clear: We will listen to you, but we will not believe you, and we will not trust you. Despite having the cards stacked against her, I was shaken to the core

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6592 October 5, 2018 
by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s words last week. She answered every question with bravery, with candor, and with humility. Meanwhile, Judge Kavanaugh was evasive, belligerent, and, according to many of his ac-quaintances, repeatedly untruthful. What my Republican colleagues can’t seem to grasp is that you can be at the top of your wealthy prep school class and still abuse women. You can be a Yale Law School graduate and still abuse women. Unfortunately, you can even be the President of the United States and still abuse women. Furthermore, Judge Kavanaugh’s partisan outburst was downright dis-turbing for a potential Supreme Court Justice. How many norms did Judge Kavanaugh shatter in that hearing room? It is one thing to be emotional; it is another to call the allegations of Dr. Ford or Deborah Ramirez and oth-ers a coordinated leftwing conspiracy and an act of political retribution for the Clintons. He said the questions posed by Democratic Senators during his confirmation hearing were ‘‘an em-barrassment’’ and called the process a circus—this coming from a man who pressed Ken Starr to ask President Clinton sexually explicit questions. And we all know the circus the Starr investigation turned out to be. But I guess the same standards don’t apply to Brett Kavanaugh. If you are Brett Kavanaugh, you can lie under oath about things big and small and never face the consequences. At the end of the day, Judge Kavanaugh’s hysterical political rant confirmed what many of us already knew about this man: He is a political operative cloaked in judicial robes. As Kavanaugh himself said, ‘‘What goes around, comes around.’’ Do those sound like the words of an impartial, inde-pendent judge? Never before in my life have I seen a nominee, let alone a Supreme Court nominee, behave as though he were en-titled to this lifetime appointment. He is not. It is the American people who are entitled to a Justice who tells the truth, who conducts himself in a dig-nified manner, a Justice who doesn’t face credible accusations of sexual as-sault. The Supreme Court deserves better than Brett Kavanaugh, and so do the American people. More than 1,000 legal scholars—and counting—agree, coming out against Kavanaugh’s nomination because his partisan and venomous rhetoric has no place on the Supreme Court. This process has further poisoned the confirmation process. It was Senate Republicans who orchestrated the theft of a Supreme Court seat with more than 9 months left in President Obama’s term. Apparently, being nomi-nated by President Obama is more dis-qualifying than being accused by mul-tiple women of sexual assault. It is clear my colleagues will stop at noth-ing to tip the scales of justice against women, consumers, and patients for generations to come. For women, the stakes couldn’t be higher. President Trump promised to only nominate judges who would over-turn Roe v. Wade. And, yes, earlier today, a colleague of mine pointed out that the Republican National Com-mittee platform has long included overturning Roe v. Wade. In my view, that is precisely why we cannot trust a longtime GOP political operative like Brett Kavanaugh to uphold a woman’s right to choose. There is a difference between saying that precedent deserves respect and saying that it cannot be overturned. They are not the same. I think some of the things I have heard about the aspirations of some of my colleagues about Judge Kavanaugh are unlikely to be realized. This is what is at stake here: the basic principle that women have a right to make their own private med-ical decisions. My daughter has grown up never knowing what it was to live in a country where women were denied re-productive rights. Now I fear my granddaughter may grow up never knowing what it was like to live in a country where women had reproductive rights. It isn’t just women’s health that is at stake. The Trump administration is ar-guing in Federal court as we speak that the ACA’s protections for pre-existing conditions are unconstitu-tional, which makes Judge Kavanaugh’s record of ruling against consumers and siding with corporate interests all the more troubling. There are 3.8 million New Jerseyans who have preexisting conditions—some illness during the course of their lives, heart attack, diabetes, Parkinson’s, maybe some birth defect that in the past had denied them insurance cov-erage. We eliminated that under the Affordable Care Act. No more discrimi-nation. There are 3.8 million New Jerseyans who have preexisting condi-tions. For me, those are another 3.8 million reasons to oppose Kavanaugh’s confirmation. So, yes, the stakes have never been higher. The threat to our democracy is real. The decisions coming down from a Supreme Court with Kavanaugh will change the course of America for dec-ades to come. The Republican majority views the Supreme Court as an instrument to force an unpopular, anti-woman, anti- worker, anti-civil rights agenda on the American people. Meanwhile, President Trump views the Court as yet another weapon to flout the rule of law. Well, it is time we take a stand for the integrity of our democratic institu-tions. It is time we live up to our duty set forth by article II of the Constitu-tion to provide advice and consent on Supreme Court nominations. In be-stowing on us this responsibility, the Framers entrusted us with protecting the reputation and credibility of the highest Court in our land. To confirm Judge Kavanaugh in the face of these allegations; in the face of the secrecy of the documents we could not obtain; in the face of the positions he took that are clearly, in the minds of many of us, untruthful before the committee, risks forever tarnishing one of the crown jewels of our democ-racy. My friends, we are standing on the edge of a cliff. Should we blindly go over that edge, we risk doing irrep-arable damage to the reputation and credibility of the Supreme Court. I im-plore my colleagues in the majority to pull us back in the direction of truth and decency. This isn’t about right or left; this is about right and wrong. A vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh is a vote against survivors of sexual vi-olence. A vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh is a vote to overturn Roe v. Wade and end safe and legal abortion in this country. A vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh is a vote to overturn pro-tections for preexisting conditions. A vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh is a vote to roll back civil rights and voting rights. It is a vote that will take us back to a time and place none of us, I believe, wants to go to. And it is a vote the American people will not forget— not today, not tomorrow, not this No-vember, not ever. I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

I have never seen anything like it in the 8 years that I have been serving in this body. Every day when we show up to work, as we walk to our offices, we have to walk through a sea, a mob, of angry protestors, people screaming, shouting, yelling things at us—not pleasant things. In many instances, Members have to be accompanied as they walk to and from their offices, to and from the Senate floor where they cast their votes, to and from their com-mittee hearings, in and out of rooms where they have to conduct their busi-ness. This is unusual. It is unpleasant. It is relatively unprecedented, certainly, in the time that I have been here. It is un-fortunate and unnecessary. You see, this is not how the process is supposed to work. This is not what the Constitution contemplates or requires in connection with the confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee. It doesn’t need to work this way, but in this case, it did. It did because a lot of people, starting with a small handful of people, made a delib-erate choice to depart from the norm,

to depart from rules, practices, and op-erating procedures that are designed to protect the innocent and the guilty, de-signed to protect accusers and the ac-cused, designed to protect the privacy of people who come forward with alle-gations as well as those who have been nominated to serve in high positions. The allegations brought forward by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford were serious. I still remember and will never forget the precise moment when I was briefed on the nature of these allegations on September 13, 2018. I was briefed by a small handful of Judiciary Committee staffers who had clearance to read to me an FBI document they had just re-ceived. I wasn’t allowed to share the details of that communication with anyone—not even members of my own staff—because at the time they were confidential, couldn’t be discussed with the public, and couldn’t be discussed with anyone who hadn’t received spe-cific clearance from the FBI to do so. At the time these allegations were brought forward, I was able to tell my staff only the following: The allega-tions raised by this individual—I didn’t know her name at the time—are seri-ous. They are serious to the point that I will not support this nominee. I can-not and will not vote to confirm this nominee if these allegations are true, but the allegations are of such a nature that they could be looked into. We can discern whether or not they could be corroborated. We can interview wit-nesses in an effort to get to the truth. Over the last roughly 3 weeks, that is what has happened. We have under-taken everything we know how to do to get to the truth. We have had FBI agents interviewing witnesses. We have had witnesses inter-viewed by committee staff. We our-selves have interviewed Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh. It was at the hear-ing where we heard from Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh when we learned for the first time that Dr. Ford’s attor-neys—I will just state here parentheti-cally—were oddly recommended by the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judi-ciary Committee. But Dr. Ford’s attor-neys—those same attorneys rec-ommended by the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee— failed to ever inform Dr. Ford that, from the outset, she wouldn’t have to go through the process this way. From the outset, she could have and would have been given the opportunity to tell her story in private to FBI agents who would have met her at her home in Palo Alto, CA, interviewing her in the privacy and comfort and protection of her own home with confidentiality. That separate group of FBI agents could have and would have then visited Judge Kavanaugh and any of the other alleged eyewitnesses to this event, and at that point those reports would have been collected and eventually handed over to the Senate Judiciary Com-mittee. The committee then could have and would have had the opportunity to con-vene a closed hearing and to inves-tigate these allegations without having to subject anyone to the indignity of discussing very detailed private cir-cumstances of their lives in front of the American people. It remains clear to me that Dr. Ford never wanted a circus. She never asked for any of this. She was reluctant to come forward. Ultimately, she agreed to allow her name to be released at the moment she recognized that there were enough people who were going to figure out who she was, but she didn’t want to have to tell her story in public. She could have and would have and should have been given the opportunity to tell her story in private, but that is not how it happened because her lawyers didn’t tell her. Even after her name came forward, even after she felt compelled to dis-close her name, her lawyers apparently didn’t tell her that Judiciary Com-mittee staff would be willing to fly out to California and meet with her in pri-vate in her home or anywhere else she wanted to meet. That apparently was not communicated to her. One must ask the question why. Why didn’t they tell her that? I don’t know. At this point I can’t know that. The conversations that occur be-tween attorneys and their clients are typically and permanently confiden-tial, but just as an objective witness to a lot of this and, again, not privy to their private conversations, I have to wonder whether at best her lawyers may have been neglectful in telling her that she had those options. At worst, they may have deliberately sacrificed her privacy, her comfort, and her inter-ests in pursuit of their own vain ambi-tions or perhaps a political agenda. Ei-ther outcome is unfortunate. Either way we got there led to the same out-come, and we are where we are. For the last 3 weeks we have done ev-erything we can to get to the bottom of these allegations. We have had wit-nesses interviewed. We ourselves have interviewed Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh. At the end of this, what we see is someone who has been badly hurt. It is apparent to me that Dr. Ford was harmed and has endured deep pain. Someone hurt her, and they hurt her badly, but there is nothing to corrobo-rate her allegation that it was Judge Kavanaugh who hurt her. Not one of the alleged eyewitnesses to this event can confirm that such a gathering ever occurred, either in the summer of 1982 or at any other time— not one. A number of the witnesses have said that not only do they not re-member such an event ever occurring but that this type of event with this set of circumstances and with this combination and number of people would not have happened. This is not how they gathered. So we are left with an uncorroborated accusation against an individual who has led an exemplary life, a life of public service that in-cludes now 7 FBI background inves-tigations and some 150-plus interviews conducted by the FBI. Again, a lot of that was conducted prior to his ap-pointment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, where he served for 12 years and published some 300 opin-ions, in which he has had no objective other than to find the right answer under the law. This is someone who is a model, ex-emplary citizen from everything we can tell. He serves his community. He feeds the hungry. He clothes the naked. He serves his fellow beings with a love and an admiration for them that is genuine, distinct, and consistent. Against this backdrop, we cannot, we will not, we must not take a single uncorroborated allegation and sink this man’s hard-earned good name. The demands of justice are such that we have to hear accusers and those who have been harmed, but without cor-roboration we cannot assume someone to be guilty in the absence of an ade-quate evidentiary foundation. So I would add here that maybe we do know something more than that be-cause other allegations have come for-ward. Well, yes, there are other allega-tions, but let’s talk about the other al-legations for a minute. The Ramirez allegation came forward about a week after the Washington Post announced Dr. Ford’s name. A story by The New Yorker was itself de-bunked less than 24 hours after the story was run—debunked by the New York Times, which acknowledged hav-ing interviewed literally dozens upon dozens of witnesses in an effort to find corroboration for the Ramirez allega-tions. Not one person could or would corroborate the story—not one. More-over, as the New York Times con-cluded, there were a number of in-stances in which Ms. Ramirez herself, in calling former classmates from Yale, acknowledged that she didn’t know whether or not it was Brett Kavanaugh who engaged in the conduct she al-leged. The other allegation brought forward by the client of Mr. Avenatti was itself on its face of a different sort than the others. This allegation was brazen in what it assumed about Judge Kavanaugh and what it asked the pub-lic to believe. It accused this man, this lifelong public servant, of engaging de-liberately in a sustained criminal en-terprise that had as its object the de-liberate drugging and gang rape of young women. Here, again, is a story that could not find a single shred of corroboration and was severely under-cut by a number of other factors, in-cluding the fact that the accuser her-self was not even in high school at the same time as Judge Kavanaugh, and no one alleged to have been present had any recollection either of the parties described or of any of the cir-cumstances surrounding these alleged events. But the timing of these other allega-tions coming forward was nonetheless

used to smear the good name of Judge Kavanaugh and to imply some sort of guilt on the part of Judge Kavanaugh and some sort of corroboration of the Ford allegation. Again, the Ford alle-gation was itself serious and had a lot of indicia of credibility on its face. That is why I was so concerned the mo-ment I heard about it. That is why we have now spent 3 weeks doing every-thing we can to get to the bottom of it and finding no corroboration. But here we are with these protests going on, with a sea of angry people shouting at us everywhere we go; chas-ing Senator C
RUZand his wife out of a restaurant as they were peacefully en-joying dinner; verbally and physically assaulting Senator P
ERDUE and his wife as they were making their way from a flight into Reagan National Airport to their vehicle, for a sustained period of 30 minutes, including a moment when Mrs. Perdue was nearly pushed down a flight of stairs. These incidents come in the wake of other unfortunate events, including a moment when R
AND P
AUL was attacked at his home and broke six ribs, causing him excru-ciating pain and injuries that have the potential of affecting him for the rest of his life. This same R
AND PAUL was himself also the potential victim of a shooting when a crazed leftist decided to show up at a Republican baseball practice and opened fire on Republican Members of Congress simply because they were Republican Members of Con-gress, almost killing Congressman S
TEVE SCALISE in the process. This moment of emotional intensity came as a result of a process that some are now struggling to say is broken. I insist that it is not. The process isn’t broken. There is nothing wrong with the Constitution. It certainly is not broken. To the extent something wrong happened here, it is not because the thing itself doesn’t work or because it is flawed by its very nature. It is be-cause in this instance, the left broke it. The left sabotaged it. The left delib-erately impeded its ability to do what it was supposed to do. It is not as though this isn’t without precedent. They have done this in the past. They have done it for decades. They did it with Judge Bork, when they converted his last name into a verb when they accused him of being a racist and a sexist. They pretended to be outraged when they found out that Judge Ginsburg had smoked marijuana. Then, a few years later, they engaged in a high-tech public lynching of Clar-ence Thomas. They later did it again to Sam Alito, calling him a racist. Then they did it to Neil Gorsuch, calling him a sexist. These efforts aren’t limited, of course, to Supreme Court nominees. They also deliberately went after Miguel Estrada, specifically and admit-tedly because he was Latino. They tried to take down Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to a Federal ap-pellate court because they considered her ‘‘too Catholic.’’ This is unacceptable. We have been asked to settle for this. It is not time to settle. It is time to expect more. It is time to demand more. It is time to demand a process that is respectful of human beings—of the accusers and the accused in the world. It is time to do this in a manner that respects this in-stitution and allows us to respect each other. You have to remember that when we reduce our arguments from matters of policy, in which we acknowledge good faith disagreements, to simple and emotional questions of good versus evil, people are going to tend to believe that characterization. Ultimately, they are going to tend to act on that charac-terization. The results will not always be pretty. At some point, this descends to a mo-ment when the victim will no longer be someone’s character or reputation or pride or the quiet enjoyment of some-one’s dinner or the ability of someone not to be injured while mowing his lawn. At some point, this is going to be one of us or it is going to be someone’s husband or wife, someone’s children. Earlier this week, we received news that someone had deliberately released personal, private information regard-ing Members of the Senate—Repub-lican Members of the Senate, not coin-cidentally—with the promise and the threat that even more information would be released, including informa-tion about medical records and his-tories of our children, for the specific purpose of influencing and intimi-dating Members into taking a par-ticular position on this nomination. This is unacceptable. It is also unacceptable that in the re-sponse to the attack on R
AND PAUL, which I mentioned a moment ago, an MSNBC anchor actually referred to that horrific event for Senator P
AUL and his family as one of her favorite stories. That is not OK. All of this hurts real people, not just Members of the Senate, not just Dr. Ford and her family or Judge Kavanaugh and his family, although it certainly hurt them. It also hurts the Senate. It hurts the Supreme Court. It hurts our very constitutional Republic as it was set up, as it was designed. So again, we get back to this ques-tion: Why does this happen? I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that it happens because you cannot take this many eggs from the American people and put them in one basket without creating a lot of really high, intense emotions. You cannot require the American people to work many weeks or many months out of any year just to pay their Federal taxes and not have them be very emotional about what happens in Washington. You cannot concentrate this much power in Washington, DC, and take power away from the American people, where the power is supposed to be mostly exercised at the State and local levels, and move it away from them in two steps: first, from the people to Washington and then, within Wash-ington, from the people’s elected rep-resentatives, who are supposed to make law, to unelected, unaccountable bu-reaucrats, who make law without any accountability to the people. You can-not do that without unavoidably, inevi-tably, and unsustainably raising the political temperature in this country. It cannot be done. It is the nature of the thing itself. Sometimes we have to stop giving in to the impulse to expand the size and scope and reach of the Federal Govern-ment because it tends to make the peo-ple less powerful. The whole system was set up so as to lower the political temperature in the country. We are a diverse country. In one way or another, there has always been great diversity within the country, among and between the States and their dif-ferent populations. This was under-stood by the Founders; it is understood today. This is one of the reasons why, by divine design, this whole thing was set up in such a way as to lower the po-litical temperature in Washington by keeping most decisions close to the people at the State and local levels, recognizing that there is a whole lot more unity at the State and local lev-els than there is at the national level. That is why most powers are supposed to remain close to the people through the States and localities. Sometimes our instincts are wrong. Sometimes our instincts lead us into danger. Sometimes we fear the wrong things. People in this country, understand-ably, are terrified, scared to death of rattlesnakes. I myself am scared to death of rattlesnakes. We have them in my State of Utah. We don’t like them. Most people are shocked, however, to discover there are many times more people killed every year as a result of deer than rattlesnakes. Deer, it turns out, cause all kind of accidents, which, in turn, result in a lot of deaths—many more deaths, many times more deaths every year than rattlesnakes. But we fear the rattlesnake more because it looks scary. Sometimes our instinct leads us in the wrong direction. Sometimes our in-stinct is to do something through gov-ernment that might make matters worse rather than better. It reminds me of a time when I worked across the street at the Su-preme Court of the United States. I was a law clerk to Justice Alito. My co-clerks and I worked in a relatively small office. We discovered something during the summer when we started our job. The air conditioning in our of-fice made our office unbearably cold. It was so cold as we sat at our desk and wrote memoranda to the Justices and did our jobs, sometimes our hands would get so cold that we almost couldn’t feel them. What did we do? We went over to the thermostat and turned up the thermostat, thinking that would solve the problem. But after

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6595 October 5, 2018 
we turned up the thermostat, it didn’t do any good. It was still freezing cold. At that point, we opened the window and let in the hot, muggy air that is known to inhabit and pervade Wash-ington, DC, during the summer months. It was inefficient, but we couldn’t figure out another way. We talked to the maintenance people in the building. They weren’t sure what to make of it, so we moved on. As summer faded into fall and fall be-came winter, it got cold. We had a very similar problem, but in the other direc-tion. When it got to be winter, when it was really cold outside, it was burning hot inside our office. It was so hot, we were sweating, so hot we felt compelled to walk over to the thermostat and turn the thermostat down, hoping and expecting, reasonably, that it would lower the temperature and alleviate our discomfort. It didn’t do a bit of good. It was still burning hot. What did we do? We opened the windows. It was inefficient and created a weird feeling in the of-fice—at times burning hot, at times freezing cold, depending how close you were to the window. After many months of this, the head maintenance inspector for the whole building came in and looked at the heating and air conditioning system within the office. After taking it all apart, he came to us and said: I think I have found your problem. Your ther-mostat was installed backward. Every time you were turning the thermostat up to raise the temperature, it was lowering the temperature. Every time you lowered the thermostat, it was, in fact, raising the temperature. Sometimes things have the opposite effect from what we want. I believe it has often been with the best of motives and instincts and intentions that we have taken power to Washington, DC, concentrating, centralizing more power here in Washington, DC, and then allo-cating it to unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats, and, in some cases, Fed-eral judges. In the process, we disempowered the American people. We disconnected them from their own government. This, in turn, has raised the temperature when it comes to things like con-firming a Supreme Court Justice. This, by the way, was often done in the past by a voice vote without even the need for a roll call vote. Sometimes it was done unanimously; sometimes it was done overwhelmingly. Not every nomi-nee was confirmed. I don’t think that should ever be the case. Even in George Washington’s admin-istration, not every nominee to the Su-preme Court was confirmed, but nomi-nees were treated with dignity and with respect. This occurred in part, I believe, because the Constitution kept the temperature appropriately mod-erated; the Federal Government was doing only those things that the Con-stitution unmistakably placed in the hands of the Federal Government and of Congress, which sets policy for the Federal Government. The people, in turn, remained in touch and connected to that government, to the extent it af-fected them, because that policy was still being set by the people’s elected representatives in Congress and not by unelected, unaccountable jurists or bu-reaucrats. The opposite has happened since then. It is not the case that every Su-preme Court nominee in recent history has brought about so much contention. You look at the confirmation process that led to the ultimate appointment of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, of Stephen Breyer, of Elena Kagan, of Sonia Sotomayor. These occurred in recent decades. These Justices were confirmed overwhelmingly, and they were con-firmed with a lot of votes from Mem-bers of both political parties. It doesn’t have to be as contentious as it always is, but in this instance, with Republican nominees—with con-servative nominees—the left has been unwilling to allow the process to even move forward as it should and has cho-sen instead to smear these individuals and to treat them in an unkind, undig-nified manner. No mother and no father would want to see a son or a daughter subjected to this kind of treatment, not in our country, not for a position like this. No one would want that. It does not have to be this way. If we can correct course, if we can figure out that we have in some ways been working with a broken thermo-stat, if we can acknowledge the fact that in trying to make things better, sometimes we make them worse by bringing more power to Washington and then handing this power over to unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats and judges, we can do this. We can lower the temperature, lower the stakes in the United States of America. We live in a diverse Republic. We need to allow the people in all of their diverse viewpoints throughout the var-ious States to work things out as they deem fit. Let Utah be Utah; let New York be New York; let Nebraska be Ne-braska. We don’t have to make as many decisions in Washington, DC, as we have been. I believe, ultimately, this will come down to a question like this. We have a choice to make—a choice between fed-eralism; that is, restoring the proper balance of power between different ac-tors within our system of government on the one hand, or contention and, ul-timately, violence on the other hand. I choose the peaceful way. I choose the way that doesn’t result in as much contention. I choose the constitutional way. I believe that document was writ-ten in such a way as to protect our lib-erty, to respect our divergent interests, and to allow the American people to flourish and prosper because not every decision would have to be made by the same people, and the government would remain accountable to the gov-ernment. Federalism is the answer. At the end of this long and grueling process, I am grateful for the system we have. I hope we can return to its constitutional origins and respect the letter and the spirit of the Constitu-tion of the United States. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Texas. Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the impending confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh. It now ap-pears that tomorrow, Judge Brett Kavanaugh will become Justice Brett Kavanaugh, an Associate Justice on the United States Supreme Court. It is worth pausing for a moment to reflect why that is of such great con-sequence for our country. In recent decades, the courts have seized more and more policymaking authority, have intruded into the authority of the democratically elected legislature, and have taken policy issue after policy issue from the hands of the American people and usurped it instead into the hands of five unelected judges. Given those stakes, the 2016 election in a very real sense was waged over what direction the Supreme Court would go, and there was a markedly different vision, a markedly different promise that was made by Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump promised to nominate constitu-tionalists who would defend the Con-stitution and who would defend the Bill of Rights. That is what the people of Texas want, and I believe that is what the American people want—judges who will follow the law, who will be faithful to the Constitution, who will uphold our fundamental liberties—free speech, religious liberty, the Second Amend-ment, the 10th Amendment—the funda-mental liberties protective of every American in the U.S. Constitution. The stakes here are high, particu-larly with this seat—the seat that was held by Justice Kennedy, a Justice who has been the swing vote for three dec-ades now. Even though the stakes are high, what we have witnessed the last sev-eral weeks is unprecedented in the an-nals of confirmation battles. We saw initially a confirmation hearing that was relatively straightforward. It was marred by protests, coordinated with Democratic Senators, according to media reports. On the first day of the hearing, 70 individuals were arrested for protesting and disrupting the hear-ing. But at the end of that opening week of hearings, not a single Senator on the committee had made the argument that Justice Kavanaugh was not quali-fied to be a Justice—by any measure, he is one of the most respected Federal appellate judges in the country—nor did any of the Senators on the Judici-ary Committee make any meaningful argument that raised serious concerns about Judge Kavanaugh’s jurispru-dence. He has been a court of appeals judge for over a decade. It appeared at that point that the confirmation was a forgone conclusion and that indeed Judge Kavanaugh was

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6596 October 5, 2018 
likely to get a substantially bipartisan confirmation. Then, on the eve of the vote, it was leaked in the press that there were allegations of sexual mis-conduct and sexual assault. Those alle-gations sadly had been in the posses-sion of the ranking Democratic mem-ber of the committee since July 30 in the form of a written letter that had been submitted by Dr. Ford on July 30 detailing the allegations. The allega-tions were serious. The allegations de-served to be treated with respect. In that letter, Dr. Ford requested to stay confidential. She did not want her name thrust into the national news. The Judiciary Committee has a process for handling allegations. As nomina-tions go forward, there are all sorts of allegations that are raised, and the or-dinary process would be for the rank-ing member to refer that letter to the full committee, to the chairman, refer it to the FBI for an investigation, and then the committee has a standing process to engage in a confidential hearing—a closed hearing—where the allegations raised by Dr. Ford could have been considered without dragging her name into the public. That would have been the right way to do that. That would have been the Senate operating the way it is sup-posed to operate, but sadly it didn’t op-erate that way. Instead, it appears the Democratic Members of Congress made the decision to leak the letter to the press and to drag Dr. Ford unwillingly into the public square. That did enor-mous damage to Dr. Ford and her fam-ily, and it did enormous damage to Judge Kavanaugh and his family. When that happened, the Judiciary Committee—the Republican members of the committee met, and I urged my colleagues, once these allegations were made public, that there needed to be a public hearing and that Dr. Ford de-served a full and fair opportunity to tell her story; that she needed to be treated with respect. That, I am glad to say, is exactly what happened. I also believed Judge Kavanaugh de-served a full and fair opportunity to de-fend himself and that he, too, should be treated with respect. That, sadly, is not what happened. The hearing we had last week featured one Democratic member of the committee after an-other dragging Judge Kavanaugh and his family through the mud, raising smear after smear after smear—not just the allegations that Dr. Ford had raised but other, more farfetched and in some cases absurd allegations. Ap-parently, the threshold for dragging a man’s character and besmirching his family in Washington is nonexistent. At that Thursday hearing, we heard powerful testimony from two wit-nesses—Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh. It was clear that both were hurting. It was clear that both had been done enormous damage by the po-liticized way in which Democratic Members of this body launched these allegations in the media. But even though we were seeing political games, that didn’t relieve any Members of this body from the solemn obligation we have to advise and consent, the obliga-tion we have to have a fair process, to consider the allegations, and to make the best judgment we can. After two witnesses presented power-ful testimony, it became clear that their testimony was directly contradic-tory, so we were called to assess the evidence before us. Typically in a court of law, when you have conflicting testi-mony, the way a court of law will as-sess that is to look to other corrobo-rating evidence—what other evidence is there that indicates whether par-ticular allegations are true. In this instance, Dr. Ford had identi-fied three fact witnesses—three named fact witnesses—all of whom gave state-ments to the Judiciary Committee under penalty of perjury. All three of the named fact witnesses—not only did they not corroborate the allegations, but they affirmatively refuted the alle-gations. They did so on penalty of per-jury, meaning if they were lying, they could face up to 5 years in prison. For me, the fact that all of the cor-roborating evidence contradicted the allegations and the fact that Judge Kavanaugh has a many-decades-long record as a distinguished public serv-ant with no allegations whatsoever prior to the eleventh-hour political al-legations that were launched by the Democrats—the balance of that, I be-lieve, leads a fair decision maker to make the decision that I have made and that this body is preparing to make, which is to confirm Judge Kavanaugh. Even so, at the insistence of a num-ber of Senators, the Judiciary Com-mittee went further: Last week, it asked the FBI to conduct a supple-mental background investigation, in-vestigate these allegations. The in-structions to the FBI were to inves-tigate all current, credible allegations. The FBI did 10 interviews. I flew back to DC from Texas last night. At 10 o’clock last night, I came to the Cap-itol and in a classified setting read all 10 of those 302s—the reports the FBI agents prepare coming out of those interviews. Having read every single one of those reports, not a one of them provides additional corroborating evi-dence for Dr. Ford’s allegations. In-deed, the key fact witnesses who had previously given statements— unsurprisingly, their statements are very much the same. They are more de-tailed, and they are more extensive be-cause the FBI agents questioned them at greater length, but at the end of the day, all three named fact witnesses still continue to refute the allegations. That means that this body, if we are to be fair and impartial, I believe, should confirm Judge Kavanaugh. That does not mean, as some have seen in this deeply politicized time in our country, that allegations of sexual assault should not be taken seriously— to the contrary. The fact that we had an extensive public hearing to hear those allegations, to treat Dr. Ford with the utmost respect, that the FBI investigated those allegations, sought out the fact witnesses, looked for cor-roborating evidence—all of that dem-onstrates the seriousness with which those charges should be taken. Sexual assault is a growing problem in our Nation. It is a pervasive problem in our Nation. The #MeToo move-ment—we have seen powerful men in Hollywood, powerful men in jour-nalism, powerful men in politics, and powerful men in business abusing their position of power and harassing or as-saulting women. That is unacceptable. I am glad to have worked with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in passing legislation through this body ensuring that there are tough stand-ards and that we end the process of se-cret taxpayer settlements if a Member of Congress is guilty of harassment or assault. We should have no tolerance for that sort of misconduct. So anyone at home who is watching these proceedings, it would be a mis-take to take the politicized charge of Democrats who wanted to defeat Judge Kavanaugh before these charges came along—virtually every Democrat who is voting no was going to vote no be-fore any allegation had been made. In-deed, a great many of the Democratic Senators announced their opposition to Judge Kavanaugh within minutes or hours of his being named. Every Demo-cratic member of the Judiciary Com-mittee announced their opposition to Judge Kavanaugh before the opening minutes of the confirmation hearing, before hearing a word Judge Kavanaugh had to say. The circus we saw last week was a whole lot of political theater. It fea-tured some Democratic Senators, I be-lieve, vying for the 2020 Presidential nomination and seeing who could be more extreme and put on a bigger spec-tacle. But the American people expect this body to be fair. The American peo-ple expect this body to respect the law and the rule of law. We have been through a process that I believe has been fair, has heard out these claims. It is my hope that, coming out of this, the anger and rage that have been stoked dissipates. It is my hope that Members on both sides of this aisle and, more importantly, Americans on both sides of the political aisle across the country can remember who we are, can remember how to disagree, to dis-agree passionately. We can have pas-sionate arguments about whether taxes should be higher or lower. We can have passionate arguments about immigra-tion policy or any other policy matter. But I hope that we can remember how to disagree without being disagreeable, to disagree while being civil, to dis-agree while respecting each other, while respecting each other’s human-ity. It would have been wrong to vilify and demonize Dr. Ford, and I am glad the Judiciary Committee did not go down that road, but it is equally wrong

for Democratic Senators to demonize and vilify Judge Kavanaugh based on a lone accusation without corroborating evidence. That is not fair, and that is not right. It is empty politics. And if we continue down this politics of per-sonal destruction, we are going to find fewer and fewer people willing to step forward and serve, fewer and fewer peo-ple willing to serve on the Federal judi-ciary, willing to serve in the Cabinet. There was a time when this body was called the world’s greatest deliberative body. That was a long time ago, but I do think it is possible for us to get back to that, for us to keep disagree-ments focused on substance and issues and remember the fundamental human-ity even of those who disagree with us. The American people—certainly the people of Texas—I think a great many were horrified by what they saw last week. Some in the media have charac-terized that women should necessarily oppose Judge Kavanaugh’s confirma-tion because they are women. I don’t think that is right—that is certainly not true from the women I have heard from the State of Texas—because women, like men, want the Constitu-tion followed faithfully, want the Bill of Rights protected, and want our fun-damental liberties upheld. Women, like men, want a system of rule of law and a presumption of innocence that is fair. Yes, if there is serious, credible evi-dence of sexual assault, it should be dealt with seriously. But women and men are mothers and fathers, are hus-bands and wives, are sons and daugh-ters, and brothers and sisters. Every parent of sons should want a system where due process is protected and where one lone and uncorroborated al-legation is not enough to end the ca-reer and reputation of their son. And every parent of daughters—and I am the parent of two daughters—should want a regime where your daughters are protected and their lives can’t be ruined with an uncorroborated allega-tion either. But if, God forbid, they face assault or harassment, there is a system of accountability, and the wrongdoers are held accountable. We want a fair system. We want a just system. We want a system that recognizes the rule of law. There are many countries that are ruled by mob, ruled by accusation, and ruled by in-sinuation. But we need a process. In this case, we have gone through a proc-ess that was designed to be fair. And given the evidence, the right decision, I believe, is the decision this body will make tomorrow to confirm Judge Kavanaugh as Justice Kavanaugh, the newest Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Minnesota. Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak on the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to serve as an Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I said on the first day that Judge Kavanaugh appeared before the Senate that this proceeding was not normal. On its face, it looked like a normal confirmation hearing. The family was there. He was sitting in the chair with the table in front of him, ready to address the com-mittee. The cameras were on. The Sen-ators were all seated, prepared to ask questions. All of it looked normal, but nothing about this confirmation proc-ess has been normal. These hearings began at a time when we had access to only a tiny fraction of the documents from Judge Kavanaugh’s record. In fact, the night before the proceedings started, we got a document dump of 42,000 pages. Even less of the information—the 3 years of his time as a Staff Secretary in the White House—has been available to the American people or to us. That is still true today. These hearings were about a nomi-nee, in the end, who was handpicked by a President—a nominee who had good credentials. There is absolutely no doubt about that. There are many nominees—potential nominees—who have good credentials. In this case, this particular person was picked at a time in our history with perhaps the most expansive view of Presidential power possible—a nominee who has actually written in an opinion that a President should be able to declare laws uncon-stitutional. These views go beyond the main-stream, and this confirmation process has only gone farther astray. With what happened during the last 2 weeks and in light of Dr. Ford’s compelling testimony, it was deeply troubling. I will talk about this at length. I want to begin where I first started— what we know about Judge Kavanaugh’s record and what it sug-gests about the kind of Justice he would be. In the last decades, the Su-preme Court of the United States has decided whom you can marry, where you can go to school, who can vote, and for people like my grandpa, who worked 1,500 feet underground in the mines in Ely, MN, his entire life, the Supreme Court has decided how safe your workplace is. The next Supreme Court Justice will make decisions that affect people across the country—their lives—for-ever. The next Supreme Court Justice will rule on cases that could determine whether health insurers can deny cov-erage to people who are sick or who have preexisting conditions and wheth-er women’s rights are protected. The next Supreme Court Justice will be in a position to serve as a check and bal-ance on the other branches of govern-ment. That person must be someone who is fair and impartial and who dem-onstrates a commitment to the truth without consideration of politics or partisanship. It has been our responsibility—every Senator in this Chamber—to determine if Judge Kavanaugh would protect the careful balance of power among the three coequal branches that our Found-ers designed. We must determine if he would stand up for the rule of law with-out consideration of politics or par-tisanship, if he believes in the simple idea that no one is above the law. We knew coming into the hearing that Judge Kavanaugh’s views of Exec-utive power were among the most ex-pansive we have ever seen and that he has been making the case for strong Presidential powers for decades. In a 2009 piece in the University of Min-nesota Law Review, Judge Kavanaugh wrote that a sitting President should not be the subject of an investigation or even be required to answer questions as part of a special counsel’s investiga-tion. In that article, he argued, it is not a good use of the President’s time to prepare for an interview or ques-tioning by special counsel. He made no exception for an investigation address-ing threats to our national security, even when a foreign power has some-how interfered in our country’s affairs. It is not hard to see why these views are relevant during this critical con-stitutional moment. There is an exten-sive, ongoing investigation by a special counsel, and the President’s private lawyer and campaign chairman have been found guilty of multiple Federal crimes. The man appointed as special coun-sel—a man who has served with dis-tinction under Presidents from both parties—has been under siege, as well as the Attorney General and the Dep-uty Attorney General. In the same article that Judge Kavanaugh wrote, he made the point that if a President did something ‘‘das-tardly,’’ then Congress could act, argu-ing that a criminal investigation should be put on hold until the end of the President’s term. When I asked him what ‘‘dastardly’’ means, he could not answer, even when I asked about a President. Who knows what he or she could do—commit murder, jeopardize our national security, obstruct an in-vestigation, or engage in white collar crime? I still didn’t get an answer about what ‘‘dastardly’’ means. The judge’s expansive view of Presi-dential power is part of a much broader pattern of writing and commentary. More than a decade before, in a 1998 piece in the Georgetown Law Journal, Judge Kavanaugh wrote that the Presi-dent should be able to remove a special counsel at will. This is the opposite direction from what we did in the Judiciary Com-mittee when we passed bipartisan legis-lation earlier this year on a 14-to-7 vote to enact additional protections for the special counsel and all future spe-cial counsels. At a 2016 event at the American En-terprise Institute, the judge was ani-mated and almost gleeful when he said he would ‘‘put the final nail’’ in Morri-son v. Olson, a Supreme Court decision that upheld the now-expired inde-pendent counsel statute. It is hard to imagine that he would respect a 30-

year-old precedent and protect the in-tegrity of a special counsel investiga-tion in light of that statement. At a roundtable discussion in 1999, he criticized the Supreme Court’s unani-mous ruling in U.S. v. Nixon that com-pelled President Nixon to comply with the subpoena to produce tapes and doc-uments written by a Minnesotan, Jus-tice Warren Berger. When this came up in the hearing, Judge Kavanaugh repeatedly charac-terized the case as one of the greatest moments in our country’s judicial his-tory, but he refused to answer, when asked, the question of whether that case was correctly decided. These are incredible statements with implications that are clear when you think about what is going on in our country today. The dedicated public servants who work in our Justice De-partment—including the Attorney Gen-eral, the Deputy Attorney General, the special counsel, and the FBI—have been subjected to repeated threats and have had their work politicized and their motives questioned. I asked Judge Kavanaugh if these statements reflect his views today, but he said only that he wasn’t making constitutional arguments. He did not dispute that he believes, as a matter of policy, that these are the types of broad powers a President should be able to exercise. He said that he was thinking of ways to make the Presi-dency more effective. These are not just abstract legal con-cepts; they are ideas that could di-rectly impact the future of our democ-racy, as well as the lives of Americans. There are other pieces of this puzzle that make clear what a broad view of Executive power Judge Kavanaugh has. To cite one example, his opinion in Seven-Sky v. Holder discusses when a President can decline to enforce a law, even if a court has upheld it as con-stitutional. The judge wrote that ‘‘the President may decline to enforce a statute . . . when the President deems the statute unconstitutional.’’ What does that mean? That means the President could decide he could just hold a statute unconstitutional even if a court has held it is, in fact, constitutional. That is what that means. It is not a law review writing. It is not something written when he was in college or in law school. It is ac-tually something he wrote in a case. What would that mean for women’s health? What would that mean at a time when the administration is chal-lenging protections for people who are sick or have preexisting conditions? I asked him if he believed the President could declare these protections uncon-stitutional, even if a court upheld them. This isn’t a hypothetical exam-ple. The administration is now arguing in a Texas district court that the Af-fordable Care Act’s preexisting condi-tions protection is unconstitutional. The judge refused to answer whether a President could simply ignore a law, even one upheld by the courts. He didn’t answer when Senator D URBIN  asked it, when Senator B
LUMENTHAL  asked it, and when Senator H
ARRIS  posed the same question. The days of the divine rights of Kings ended with the Magna Carta in 1215. Centuries later, in the wake of the American Revolution, a check on the executive was a major foundation of our country’s Constitution, for it was James Madison who wrote in Fed-eralist 47: ‘‘The accumulation of all powers legislative, executive, and judi-ciary in the same hands . . . may just-ly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.’’ There is more. None of the judge’s colleagues joined the section of his opinion in Aiken County outlining his views on when Presidents can ignore the law, and one who was an appointee of President George H.W. Bush stated explicitly that reaching that issue was unnecessary to decide the case. Judge Kavanaugh has made very clear over the years that he has an in-credibly broad view of the types of pro-tections that should be extended to a sitting President. Without further an-swers from him during the hearing, we are left only with his writings and his previous statements. These writings say that a sitting President should not have to be subject to a criminal inves-tigation; that a sitting President should be able to remove a special counsel; that a sitting President should not have to agree to an interview with the special counsel; and that a sitting President has the legal authority to ig-nore the law. At this time in our history, we need a Justice who is independent and who will serve as a check on the other branches, which is what our Founding Fathers set up—not a judge who would allow the President to avoid account-ability or who believes the President’s views alone should carry the day. Despite many opportunities, Judge Kavanaugh did not convince me he would be an independent jurist who would maintain the fundamental idea we all learned in grade school. What is it? No one is above the law. Another concern I have is what Judge Kavanaugh’s views would mean for American consumers. In one opin-ion that was later overturned by the entire DC Circuit, Judge Kavanaugh argued that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was unconstitu-tional, calling it a threat to individual liberty. He said this about the Con-sumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Bureau was founded in the wake, as you know, of the financial crisis and has now helped more than 30 million consumers obtain more than $12 billion in relief. The Bureau helps protect con-sumers as they deal with financial in-stitutions that offer credit cards, loans, and mortgages. What did the judge say? He found it unconstitutional. Thankfully, the full DC Circuit came to the opposite con-clusion—all the other judges. The ma-jority recognized that millions of fami-lies were devastated by the financial crisis, with about 4 million families losing their homes in foreclosure and even more slipping seriously behind on their mortgages. Judges appointed by Presidents from both parties came to the opposite con-clusion of the nominee who is before us today, and the majority on that court concluded that the Bureau should stay in place, as Congress intended. While the DC Circuit made the right decision in that case, what struck me was just how far the judge had gone in his opinion. The judge was not just talking about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in that case. His opinion referred to independent agen-cies as a ‘‘headless fourth branch’’— that is a quote—of government, and it could threaten other agencies, like the Federal Trade Commission, which pro-tects consumers from scams and anti- competitive mergers, or the agencies that helped to stabilize our economy after the financial crisis, like the Fed-eral Reserve and the Securities and Ex-change Commission or the Social Secu-rity Administration, which distributes benefits to more than 60 million elder-ly and disabled Americans and has had a single director, just like the Con-sumer Financial Protection Bureau, for decades, since 1994. Judge Kavanaugh has called inde-pendent agencies a threat to individual liberty not just once—no, more than once. In that same Minnesota Law Re-view article I mentioned that outlined his expansive view of Executive power, the judge criticized the 80-year-old precedent that upheld the constitu-tionality of our independent agencies. I asked Judge Kavanaugh about his conclusion that the Bureau was uncon-stitutional. He did not dispute this conclusion, but he did say his opinion simply called for a change to the law so the Director of the Bureau could be fired by the President at will. I found that answer problematic. When Congress drafted the law that created the Bureau, it made the choice—we made the choice right here in this Chamber—to give the Director a 5-year term to provide some independ-ence from politics. This was a choice that we made in this Chamber. Not ev-eryone agreed with it, but by majority vote it passed. It passed in the Senate, and it passed in the House. We made that decision. During our discussion on the judge’s expansive views of Executive power at the hearing, he kept telling me that the scope of Presidential authority was a matter of policy that Congress should decide. He repeated this answer often to me and to others. When it comes to Presidential power, he said that Con-gress should decide. Look at what happened here when it comes to protecting consumers. In this case, Congress did decide; we actually passed a law. We said we wanted this independent Director to have a 5-year term over this very important agency that returned $12 billion to consumers

who have been victims of scams and mortgage fraud. It was Congress’s deci-sion. Did that matter to the judge in this dissent that he wrote? It did not. It seems to me, just looking at all these opinions, that the judge’s record is this. When he likes what Congress decides, he says: Hey, Congress has the final say. When he doesn’t like what Congress decides, he then thinks the judge should make decision. What does that mean? In this case, he would have rewritten the consumer protection law over the wishes of Con-gress. What would that mean for the lives of Americans? After what this country has been through, after fami-lies who worked hard and tried to save for the future lost billions of dollars, he ruled that the agency that is de-signed to protect them was unconstitu-tional, and it is not an isolated exam-ple. In another case, he argued that the net neutrality rules were unconstitu-tional. Those were the guidelines de-veloped by the FCC to help consumers and small businesses have an even playing field when it came to the inter-net. Those net neutrality protections would have prevented internet service providers from blocking, slowing, and prioritizing web traffic. One again, the full DC Circuit—those other judges— decided against Judge Kavanaugh, and these key consumer protections were upheld by a panel of judges appointed by Presidents of both parties. The question I always come back to is this: What will this mean to Ameri-cans? Here is the kicker: The outcome that the judge went out of his way to reach in the net neutrality case pro-tects the First Amendment rights of corporations at the expense of the First Amendment rights of individuals. That is why that case is such a prob-lem, but these aren’t the only reasons why there is great concern for con-sumers. In announcing the judges’s nomination, the White House touted the fact that he has overruled Federal agency actions 75 times. The White House also said in a document that it sent out that he led the efforts to rein in executive agencies. When I asked him about this in his hearing, he said that he had ruled both for and against executive agencies, but his record makes clear that he has ruled against them in the over-whelming majority of cases. Judge Kavanaugh’s record suggests that health and safety standards and environmental standards would be at risk if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court. He has called the 34-year-old precedent, a case called Chevron—the same precedent that ensures these pro-tections stay on the books—an atextual invention of courts and a ‘‘ju-dicially orchestrated shift of power.’’ That is what he said. To make it clear, this is not just one case that happens to be sitting out there in the old dusty law books. No, it is the most cited case in administra-tive law. It has been referenced in more than 15,000 legal decisions, and it has been championed by scholars and ju-rists across the ideological spectrum, including Justice Scalia. That is that case. What would happen if we didn’t have this case? Well, I guess we would have the judge making decisions instead of agencies with technical expertise. A judge with no scientific background should decide the best reading of dic-tating how pollution is acceptable in our air, lakes, or rivers rather than sci-entists. These decisions have real implica-tions for people across the country. These are the rules that protect our drinking water and keep our work-places safe. In the end, it wasn’t a Fed-eral judge who was helped by the DC Circuit’s reliance on Chevron in inter-preting a Labor Department rule. It was an hourly Minnesota grocery store worker who got to keep his hard- earned pension. As a granddaughter of a miner, I can tell you that it wasn’t a CEO or a cor-porate board chair whose life was saved by mining safety rules. It was the Min-nesota iron ore workers who, like my grandpa, would go down in a cage, 1,500 feet underground, every single day with their black lunch bucket. That is what my grandpa did every day. All my grandpa, who never got to even grad-uate from high school, wanted was to send my dad and his brother to college. My dad ended up as the first kid in his family to graduate from college—a community college, a 2-year commu-nity college. From there he went to the University of Minnesota and got his 4- year degree—all that because my grandpa went down in that mining cage and saved money in a coffee can in his basement to send my dad to college. Everyone would gather at the mines and run over there every time the si-rens went off because it meant some-one died or someone was hurt. My dad still remembers the coffins in St. An-thony’s Church lined up in the front. That is what workplace safety rules have changed. It was the worker protections, cou-pled with the ability to organize a union, that finally made those miners’ jobs safer. Americans rely on these pro-tections to keep them healthy and safe, and we can’t have a Supreme Court Justice who would throw those protec-tions in doubt. The final point I would make about the legal record is what would happen to our antitrust laws. In recent years, the Supreme Court has made it harder and harder to enforce the Nation’s antitrust laws when you have big con-solidations and market dominance. There are cases called Trinko, Twombly, Leegin, and Ohio v. Amer-ican Express. There has been a whole series of them. Why does that matter to us? It mat-ters. It couldn’t be happening at a more troubling time. We are seeing this wave of industry mergers. Ameri-cans know it in their own life. Compa-nies are getting bigger and bigger and bigger. We have now two companies that have surpassed $1 trillion. Annual merger filings with our agencies here in Washington have increased by more than 50 percent in just the last 5 years. So we already have a Court that is going conservative right when I think Americans need this protection, but, instead, we have a judge that is before us today that has written two major cases in this area. Both of them were even more conservative than where the Court was. Both of them made it even harder for mergers to be checked by the Federal Trade Commission—even by a Federal Trade Commission that was run by the Republicans. They thought the merger was troubling in one case. They brought it to court. This judge went the opposite way. Our exchange in the hearing did not convince me that the American people and all those in favor of strong anti-trust enforcement that promotes com-petition and protects consumers should not be concerned. I think back to my favorite game growing up—Monopoly. The basic premise of ‘‘the more you own, the more you made’’ has always been true in American capitalism. If you monop-olized the board by buying up multiple properties in the same color or all those railroads, you could take your opponents out of the game. What does that mean today? Well, the failed merger between Norfolk Southern Railway and Canadian Pa-cific, something I took on only imme-diately when it was announced—we de-feated that. But even without that merger, where are we today? Ninety percent of the freight rail traffic is handled by only four railroads. That is the same number of railroads on the Monopoly board. I don’t think that is a coincidence. So as we look at his rulings in this area, we realize this isn’t just a game. No, this is our economy, and we want judges who are a check and balance, just as the Founders wanted. The Founders cared a lot about monopoly, actually, and they wanted a check and balance in our courts. They set up an independent judiciary. The last point I want to focus on is Judge Kavanaugh’s record and his views on campaign finance. I requested a number of these cam-paign finance documents to become public because I thought they raised serious concerns about Judge Kavanaugh’s views in this area of law. I actually got those documents public, and it is one of the reasons that a num-ber of my colleagues who are opposed to the judge have been able to talk about those records right here on the floor and the public has been able to see them. In one email from March of 2002, he discussed limits on contributions to candidates saying—these are his words: ‘‘And I have heard very few people say that the limits on contributions to candidates are unconstitutional, al-though I for one tend to think those

limits have some constitutional prob-lems.’’ That is a big deal because we have very few campaign finance laws left that allow us to be protected from dark money and unlimited money com-ing into companies. He also described in another email his ‘‘1A’’—that is the First Amend-ment—views as ‘‘pure.’’ This is very concerning when it comes to campaign finance. I have serious doubts, based on his record, as to whether he thinks that Congress has the authority to pass any campaign finance reform and take action to rein in the flood of dark money that has drowned out the voices of ordinary citizens. What does that mean? Well, when the Court stripped away the rules that opened that door to unlimited super- PAC spending—and that is what we have right now—it wasn’t the cam-paign financiers or the ad men who were hurt. No, it was the grandma in Lanesboro, MN, who thought it mattered when she sent in $10 to sup-port her Senator. That is what we are dealing with, and if we get even nar-rower or get rid of all the limits on campaign finance, it is only going to get worse. The American people would not have even known about Judge Kavanaugh’s extreme views on campaign finance if I had not sought to have those docu-ments made public. That is because there are still 186,000 pages of docu-ments that have been produced to the Judiciary Committee, but they have not been made available to the Amer-ican people. Let me put it another way. Even now, only about 7 percent of Judge Kavanaugh’s White House record has been produced to the Judiciary Com-mittee, and even less—that is about 4 percent—is available to all of you, to the public. On top of that, we are missing 3 years of documents from his time as Staff Secretary. So we have no records to re-view from that part of Judge Kavanaugh’s previous work in the White House. We also don’t have 102,000 pages of documents that the White House has withheld under a claim of constitu-tional privilege, even though executive privilege has never been used to block the release of Presidential records to the Senate during a Supreme Court nomination under Presidents from both parties. As a former prosecutor, I know that no lawyer goes to court without re-viewing the evidence and the record, and a good judge would not decide a case with only 7 percent of the key doc-uments. In fact, as I mentioned, we received 42,000 documents the night before. We could not even look at them when we were starting to ask him questions be-cause we had only gotten them the night before. So I asked him if he thought that a judge would grant a continuance in a situation like that when one party dumped 42,000 pages of documents on the other the night before trial. I didn’t get much of an answer. We have already learned that the in-formation in documents from Judge Kavanaugh’s time in the White House is relevant to our consideration of his nomination. We should have those doc-uments before we have this vote, but we don’t. Having full information about the judge’s record brings me to the compel-ling testimony of Dr. Ford. Since Dr. Ford came forward, we have all thought a lot about our justice system. Before I got to the Senate, I was the Hennepin County Attorney in Min-nesota. In that job, we used to say that we were ministers of justice and that that meant that we would work to con-vict the guilty but also to protect the innocent. I hope my colleagues think about this question tomorrow: Are we truly protecting the innocent in how we are moving forward? What have we done? A critical part of carrying out justice is having a fair process. That is some-thing that Judge Kavanaugh himself has repeatedly and publicly said he wants. I appreciate Dr. Ford’s willingness to come before the Judiciary Committee last week, but it was unfortunate that she had to do it before the White House had asked for the FBI to reopen its background investigation and follow up on what she had said. When I think of my work, we always would have those investigations and that information before any kind of a hearing. Back in Minnesota, our office handled all the judicial matters in our county from the juvenile area. In fact, we had about 12,000 cases every year, as well as all adult felonies. We inves-tigated reports like Dr. Ford’s. That job gave me a window into how these types of cases hurt women and impact everyone. I would always tell those stories of those coming before us. I would tell them: You know what. This is going to be hard. You have to tell your story to a jury box of strangers, but you are doing it for justice. You are doing it for the right reason. As for Dr. Ford, she had to tell her story to a nation. It was a moment. So many people in our country were watching her. I don’t think people thought they were going to believe her when they first went in there and they first turned on their TVs, but then they watched her. They watched her grace and her dignity. But, then, sadly, in the afternoon, for my colleagues on the other side, we saw a lot of anger and chest beating. I believe the strategy was to distract and deflect from the moving and in-credible testimony of someone who told her story to the Nation. This was a woman with no political background, who made an attempt to call the front office of her congres-sional Representative. That is all she did. All this stuff about her being part of some kind of smear campaign—she did it even before he was a nominee. She had read that he was one of the people under consideration, and she thought she should warn people. Now, she wanted her name confiden-tial. She explained all that during the hearing. She simply called the front desk of her congressional Representa-tive. This wasn’t the first time that the Senate had confronted this type of sit-uation. When Anita Hill came forward with her allegations against then- Judge Clarence Thomas, President George H.W. Bush immediately re-quested that the FBI reopen its back-ground investigation. Dr. Ford was another person who made a credible claim. Chairman G
RASSLEY actually thanked her for her bravery in coming forward last week. Several of my Republican colleagues talked about how much they respected her. Well, I said: You know, if you really want to respect her and you really want to be brave, then, you at least have to give her the modicum of re-spect by following up on her allega-tions, and that should have been done the minute that letter went public. I found out about it, by the way, on the very same day that my Republican colleagues found out about it, and that was just a few weeks ago. I have heard a lot of complaints about that, and I am not going to get into that issue ex-cept to say one thing: The justice sys-tem is messy. Things come out at the very last minute sometimes. Evidence comes out before trial, but the issue is, When that happens, what do you do with it? What do you do with it when you are in a position of power? Do you just sweep it under the rug, as has hap-pened too many times in this Chamber, in this building? No, you give them a chance to make their case, but also to give them that underlying investiga-tion, and you reopen a background check—not a criminal background check, simply a background check like we do for any other high-level nomina-tion in the Senate. As I told my colleagues last week, if you want to make a political speech about keeping nominees off the floor, here is exhibit A for you: Merrick Gar-land, 10 months. For 10 months he was kept off the floor. Yet people have acted in a sanctimonious way that this was some cataclysmic event—to simply go back in and do an FBI investigation. Dr. Ford’s testimony was powerful. I asked her not about what she remem-bers about that night but what she couldn’t forget. Here is what she said: 
The stairwell. The living room. The bed-room. The bed on the right side of the room. . . . The bathroom in close proximity. The laughter, the uproarious laughter. 
We also heard from Dr. Ford about how she came forward because she felt she had a civic duty, just like we have a civic duty to look at the record that I just laid out for you in the last hour. That is our civic duty. That is why she came forward.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6601 October 5, 2018 
She talked about how she brought this up in therapy 6 years before and how she had given her husband the name of Judge Kavanaugh. This is be-fore he was famous. This is before he was up for the Supreme Court. As a former prosecutor, I understand the critical role that law enforcement has in gathering the information nec-essary to evaluate reports like this one. I don’t like living in an evidence- free zone, and while I am glad the White House reopened the background check and at least went in and talked to some of the witnesses, if you go down there—which you can’t do, but I could do and the other Senators could do—you realize, and you can see this from the public reports, that a lot of people weren’t interviewed. For a lot of the names from Dr. Ford and one of the other victims involved in some allega-tions, Ms. Ramirez, they were not able to have those witnesses interviewed. That is what you see when you are down there. So this was not a fair proc-ess that Judge Kavanaugh said he wanted and that Dr. Ford wanted. What we heard from the judge later in the day could not have been a sharp-er contrast from what we heard from Dr. Ford in the morning. She told her story, and it was a story that so many times in our Nation’s history has been, as I said, swept under the rug because for so long, people have been told that what happens in a house should never end up in a courthouse. Now what we can say to Dr. Ford is, well, this may not end up the way you wanted it, and it may not feel worth it to have come forward to have your life turned upside down. But you know what—there is one reason it was worth it, and that is because the American people learned something and they are speaking out because the times, they are a changing. To conclude, I want to return to some of the thoughts on what this nomination means at this uncertain moment in our history. This nomina-tion comes before us at a time when we are witnessing seismic shifts in our de-mocracy. Foundational elements of our government, including the rule of law, have been challenged and undermined. Today our democracy faces threats that would have seemed unbelievable not long ago. A man who was appointed special counsel in the investigation that is going on right now involving a foreign country interfering in our democracy— a man who served with distinction under Presidents from both parties—is under siege. Dedicated persons in the Justice Department are under siege. A third branch of government—our courts and our individual judges—has been under assault, not by a solitary disappointed litigant but by the Presi-dent of the United States. Our democracy is on trial. It is our duty to carry on the American con-stitutional tradition that John Adams stood up for centuries ago, and that is to be ‘‘a government of laws and not of men.’’ The next Supreme Court Justice should serve as a check on the other branches of government, someone who is fairminded and independent, who will uphold the motto on the Supreme Court building to help all Americans achieve ‘‘equal justice under law.’’ We have all thought a lot about the separation of powers in the last few weeks. All the attacks on the rule of law and our justice system have made me—and, I would guess, some of my other colleagues—pause and think many times about why we decided to come to the Senate in the first place, and in my case, why I decided to go into law in the first place. So I went back and I found an essay that I had written back in high school. I can tell you that not many girls in my high school class said they dreamed of being a lawyer. We had no lawyers in our family, and both of my parents were the first in their families to go to college. But somehow, when I was in high school, my dad convinced me to spend a morning sitting in a courtroom and watching a State court district judge handle a routine calendar of criminal cases. The judge took pleas, listened to arguments, and handed out misdemeanor sentences. It was nothing glamorous—and nothing glamorous like the judge before us is being nomi-nated to do—but it was important just the same. I realized that morning that behind each and every case, no matter how small, there was a story, a person. Each and every decision that judge made that day affected someone’s life, and I noticed how he had to make gut decisions and try his best to take ac-count of what his decisions would mean. There is something I said back then in that essay that I still believe today, and that is this: To be part of an im-perfect system, to have a chance to better that system, was and is a cause worth fighting for, a job worth doing. Our government is far from perfect, and so is our legal system, and so was this hearing, but we are at a crossroads in our Nation’s history where we must make a choice: Are we going to dedi-cate ourselves to improving the justice system or not? Is this nominee going to administer the law with equal justice as it applies to all citizens regardless of whether they live in a poor neighbor-hood or a rich one, in a small house or the White House? Many Americans are troubled today. When they watched the hearing, they were given some hope. They wanted to be fair, and they wanted due process, and I get that, but they also saw the blind partisanship of Washington and its crushing weight. For many of us, this nomination process does not look like it is going to end the way we want it to, but Dr. Ford opened a window on sexual assault that is never going to be closed. Anyone who works here knows they have heard stories, and people tell stories they had never told before. Then there are those who want to see change in government. Well, they opened a door that will never close, and we welcome them. We need some new people around here. So I am going to end with a quote from a song I listened to this morning, and it is a Minnesotan—not Prince; it is Bob Dylan. He was born in Duluth, and he grew up very close to where my dad grew up on the Iron Range of Min-nesota. These are the last words of his song: 
As the present now will later be past, the order is rapidly fading, and the first one now will later be last, for the times they are a changing. 
And they are changing. People’s reac-tions to what happened this week and their focus on government and their focus on making things better—that is changing. As I said last Friday at the com-mittee hearing, the Constitution does not say ‘‘we the ruling party’’; the Con-stitution says ‘‘We the People.’’ And last week, the American people re-sponded like never before. They stood up for something real, for something larger than themselves, for the hope of tomorrow. So that is how we the people prevail, because the times, they are a changing. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. C
AS-
SIDY). The Senator from Alabama. Mr. JONES. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank my colleague and friend, Senator K
LOBUCHAR , for those sober words. As former prosecutors, we share a lot of the same bonds and knowledge, and we come to this in dif-ferent ways sometimes than our col-leagues. She expressed so many senti-ments that I am going to try—and not as eloquently as she—to express today. So I say thank you for those com-ments. I come to the floor today both as a new Member of this body and as a long-time admirer and student of the Senate to offer my perspective on the situa-tion in which this distinguished body finds itself today. I am deeply disappointed and con-cerned by the process, the posturing, and the partisanship that have de-graded what should be one of the most serious, deliberate, and thoughtful de-cisions we in the Senate are entrusted to make. Over the course of my almost 40-year career as a trial lawyer, I have rep-resented just about every kind of client you can imagine, from the indigent to the CEO, major corporations and small business owners, individuals charged with serious crimes and those charged with petty offenses. I have also had the incredible honor of serving in the De-partment of Justice and representing the United States of America. Every one of my clients and every one of those who were on the other side of the litigation in which I was engaged ex-pected and deserved fair, impartial treatment in our courts, and rightly so. But from the moment Justice Kennedy

announced his retirement, the con-versation about his replacement seems to have rarely been about fairness and impartiality; instead, it has been about power and politics. This Supreme Court nomination al-most immediately turned into a divi-sive political campaign, with millions of dollars being spent to sway Senators on both sides of the aisle, including me. In his partisan-fueled tirade last week, Judge Kavanaugh lashed out at the so- called liberal groups who spent so much money attacking his nomination, but he never acknowledged and others in this body have never acknowledged that conservative groups have spent a like amount of money, if not more, promoting Judge Kavanaugh. I want to make my position clear today. I think that this kind of polit-ical campaign for a seat on the Su-preme Court of the United States—a political campaign run by either polit-ical party—should be condemned as completely contrary to the independ-ence of the judicial branch of our gov-ernment. Throughout this nomination process, I have repeatedly expressed my con-cerns about the way it has been con-ducted. It was flawed from the begin-ning, and it will be incomplete at the end because of a needless rush to a con-firmation. From the beginning, I have done my best, the best that I know how, in my experience, to exercise my constitutional duty—my duty of advice and consent—in a fair and impartial manner, putting aside the political considerations that were being thrown at me from every angle. You know, I have often said in the last few months that it seems that for those who supported Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination, if I voted to oppose, I would be seen as nothing but a puppet for my party. On the other hand, for those people who opposed Judge Kavanaugh, if I were to vote for Judge Kavanaugh, I would be seen as bending to a political way to try to get reelected in a conservative State. Nei-ther of those is true. My staff and I have dedicated an in-credible amount of time almost every single day since July 10 to reading Judge Kavanaugh’s opinions, his speeches, and his articles; reviewing documents at the time he worked at the White House—at least those docu-ments we were able to get ahold of; watching his Senate hearing testimony and his television appearances; meet-ing with my constituents and advo-cates; and reading statements and emails both in support of and in opposi-tion to Judge Kavanaugh. This was all done in a very serious effort to give thoughtful and fair consideration to Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination with-out regard to party or politics. The one thing I did not get a chance to do was to meet with Judge Kavanaugh. Judge Kavanaugh and the White House called my office a couple of times early on in the process to try to get a meeting with me, and I told them at that time or my staff told them that my process was to listen and to read, to understand and do my deep dive into his record and to know all that I can know about him. As a law-yer, I wanted to watch that hearing. I wanted to see what would occur at the hearing and how he would present him-self, the questions that he answered and the questions he avoided, so that when I did meet with him following that hearing, it would be meaningful. It would not be a meet-and-greet, like so many of us have in this body, but a meaningful meeting. As soon as Chairman G
RASSLEY  called for the hearing shortly after Labor Day, as soon as that was called in August, my staff started calling the White House to get a meeting. We were told that they would still want a meet-ing, but we continued to get rebuffed. We never got that meeting. We contin-ued to call after the hearing, and we continued to call at least until the time that Dr. Ford’s allegations were made public, and at that point, we knew a meeting was probably not like-ly to happen. So for all of those detractors who say that I didn’t try to get a meeting and that I didn’t have the time, I did my best to follow the process of delibera-tion that I felt appropriate in my due process to make that meeting mean-ingful, and it never happened, through no fault of mine or my staff. After all that, we find ourselves in this moment of historical significance, where we as a body have an oppor-tunity to send a loud and clear message to women and men throughout this country. As I previously have said, I believe Dr. Ford made an incredibly brave de-cision to come forward publicly and to testify to the full Senate Judiciary Committee. It was hard to do, knowing how she would be vilified. As a former prosecutor, I know how hard it is for victims to talk about these experi-ences, particularly in cases of sexual assault. I have been moved by the many re-ports of thousands of women who have felt compelled by recent events to re-veal similar stories that they have bur-ied for many years, some for decades. In the last few weeks, women have shared with me intensely painful and personal descriptions of assaults, some of whom I have known for a period of time but never knew what they were carrying within them. Many of these happened so many years ago—high school, college, as young professionals. Often, they hadn’t told anyone, not even their closest friends and loved ones. Their experi-ences, while different in detail, have so many similarities. Their feelings of fear and shame and guilt were over-whelming at the time of their encoun-ters. Those emotions exert a powerful hold on these women’s lives. Even if they go on to find professional success and fulfilling relationships, it is still buried within them, and they don’t speak up because they do not want to be known as victims or they don’t want others to have to bear their pain, knowing that nothing can undo what happened to them. In last week’s public hearing, I found Dr. Ford to be a compelling and cred-ible witness. Yes, there were gaps in her testimony. There always are. There are always gaps and lapses of certain memories in situations like these. Those who have worked with victims of assault know that the most traumatic details are seared into their memories, while extraneous facts may fade over time. Reactions of the women, when they see their perpetrators, are dif-ferent, depending on the cir-cumstances, but they never forget the pain. They never forget the pain of what happened to them, but rather than relive it or face condemnation or retribution, they simply keep it to themselves and go on day after day after day. If you watched our President this past week at his political rallies, you can understand exactly why these women are afraid to speak out. I am actually appalled at the President’s at-tacks on Dr. Blasey Ford just days after he called her a credible witness— just days after so many in this body called her a credible and compelling witness. His message was simply this: Keep quiet. Nothing happened here. Don’t ruin this man’s life. Let’s con-tinue to stoke the political fires sur-rounding his nomination. We have heard time and again that victims must be heard—time and again. So often have we heard that in the last 2 weeks, that victims must be heard, but the message from the Presi-dent of the United States and those who have surrounded him is, yes, let them be heard. Just don’t listen. Just don’t listen to them. Unfortunately, that message isn’t new. The President used his platform to try to intimidate survivors into staying quiet and hiding their pain from the world, but I think he is going to find that while he is focused on stir-ring up his political base with misogynistic comments, women around this country are rising up, and they are gaining their strength. They are find-ing their foothold. They are finding their voices in an effort to expose what for far too long has been swept under the carpet. Regardless of the vote tomorrow, we cannot and will not ignore where we are in this moment of history. This is a movement that will not be quieted, nor should it be quieted. For Judge Kavanaugh’s part, I was very disappointed in his testimony last week. If the incident did not happen, then I understand full well his frustra-tion and his anger. I get it. Any man would be. It is understandable. Both he and Dr. Ford have endured the ugliness of our society. But, in my view, he sim-ply went too far by leveling unneces-sary and inappropriate partisan at-tacks and accusations, demonstrating a temperament that is unbecoming a sitting judge, much less a Supreme

Court nominee. His testimony ran com-pletely counter to the image he at-tempted to portray in his earlier hear-ing, in all of his interviews on tele-vision, and in the photo opportunities with the various Senators. In addition—and this was incredibly important to me because I had watched it for some time—in simply refusing to acknowledge the need for further inves-tigation, for a further review of his record, as Senator K
LOBUCHAR dis-cussed a few moments ago, by failing to acknowledge the need for further re-view and investigation into these alle-gations, he demonstrated anything but the independence necessary for our ju-diciary. Instead, he has bowed to the White House and to the majority of the Judiciary Committee to plow through this nomination process without a full review of his record and without a full, fair, and complete investigation into the very serious and credible allega-tions made by Dr. Blasey Ford. I am certainly not alone in my views. It is not just people in the Democratic Party or Senators on my side of the aisle. At last count, I saw that there are some 3,000 law professors, about 40 of which are at Yale Law School, from which Judge Kavanaugh graduated. Those law professors have called for his nomination to be either withdrawn or rejected. Religious organizations, in-cluding the editors of the Jesuit Re-view, have done the same. I am told that just this morning, the American Bar Association—the gold standard of review for judicial nominations—has notified the Judiciary Committee that they are reopening their evaluation of Judge Kavanaugh’s character and fit-ness based on what they witnessed in the testimony last week. That is a sig-nificant development that just oc-curred this morning shortly before our vote to proceed. Even before the recent serious allega-tions of sexual assault, I called for a pause so that we could get the docu-ments that are needed, including those that Chairman G
RASSLEY himself had requested. The National Archives re-ported that due to the volume, even producing those documents on a rolling basis would not take place until some-time this month, in October. Well, it is October now, and although we don’t have those documents, we have had two hearings and now are scheduled to vote on confirmation tomorrow. Many of those documents that could have been produced for review were withheld after being screened by a lawyer rep-resenting a number of people under in-vestigation or at least witnesses in the investigation by Special Counsel Mueller, which raises serious questions as to what documents we got, which ones were being held, and why they were being held. Despite the lack of documents, the Judiciary Committee forged ahead and conducted its hearings. Before a vote was taken, Dr. Blasey Ford coura-geously came forward with her very se-rious allegations regarding a sexual as-sault that occurred when she and Judge Kavanaugh were in high school. Again, not for the first time, I and oth-ers called for a pause to allow for fur-ther investigation, to update the back-ground check that every nominee goes through. That call was rebuffed for some period of time. Finally, faced with mounting public pressure, the Judiciary Committee agreed to a second hearing. Both the committee and the White House subse-quently rejected any additional back-ground investigation to be conducted by the FBI. As it turned out, my col-league Senator FLAKE felt compelled to call for such an investigation on the morning of the vote, which delayed the confirmation process for another week. While I am certainly grateful and glad that the chairman and the major-ity leader and the President agreed to delay the vote in order to allow for an FBI investigation, I believe the inves-tigation was far too limited to have any real use, especially since no fur-ther hearings would ever be held. In my career of almost 40 years as a lawyer, I have examined many FBI re-ports, and I have examined many back-ground checks. In my review of what was submitted as a result of Senator F
LAKE ’s request, the FBI was simply not allowed to do what it does best, which is to follow the evidence and the leads. In this case, we put the prover-bial cart before the horse. The inves-tigation should have taken place before the hearing so that the Senators on the Judiciary Committee could have had the benefit of all the information they needed when questioning witnesses and evaluating credibility, which is where this is coming down. I believe that in cases like this, the witnesses should be compelled by sub-poena—not just Dr. Ford, not just Judge Kavanaugh, but other witnesses who are named should have been com-pelled by subpoena, if necessary, to give testimony, whether in the public hearing or by deposition—procedures that have been invoked by this body on many occasions. This leads me to another more proce-dural point. Many of those who want to press forward with this nomination have been invoking the presumption of innocence, and I understand that. The presumption of innocence, however, is afforded to those in this country in our criminal justice system. It is afforded to those who are accused of criminal activity, and it requires the govern-ment to prove, to rebut that presump-tion. In other words, that presumption stands between someone accused of a crime and their going to prison and having their liberty taken away from them. They have now said that the pre-sumption of innocence should be ap-plied to judicial nominations. But the presumption applies in a court before we can deprive someone of their lib-erty, incarcerate them. It is not nec-essarily applicable when we are simply looking to provide someone with a life-time appointment to the judiciary. The presumption of innocence for a nomi-nee would, in effect, turn into a pre-sumption of confirmability that I do not believe is called for in the Con-stitution. I certainly would agree, however, that given the most recent cir-cumstances, we, as a body, need to es-tablish some type of standard, some guidelines for our nominees so that this doesn’t happen again. I would say that if we were to have anything close to the high standard of a presumption of innocence, there has to be a full and complete investigation before any hearing in order to deter-mine whether the presumption can be overcome. It is the only way to do it. Remember, in this instance, there are no appeals; there is no review. We get no do-overs once we make this vote. We have to take the time and put forth the necessary effort to get it right—putting forth the time, even if it means the Supreme Court operates with eight members for a period of time. That is OK. I went to the argu-ments just the other day, and they got along just fine, listening to the argu-ments that were heard that day. The American people are understand-ably disgusted by the way this has been handled. They are disgusted with peo-ple on both sides of the aisle, and they were disgusted even before these alle-gations came to light. They have rea-son to doubt the integrity of our inde-pendent judiciary now more than ever, with a Supreme Court that will be so divided and appears to be so partisan. There will forever be a cloud over this nomination and this nomination proc-ess, regardless of the outcome of to-morrow’s vote. Many also have reason to doubt the integrity of this body for the way this has been handled. When facing difficult decisions, I often reflect on what I learned from one of my most influen-tial mentors, the late Senator Howell Heflin, a former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. Judge Heflin often talked about the Supreme Court as the ‘‘People’s Court.’’ Every day, he said, the Supreme Court of the United States deals with real people, their basic human rights and liberties. It has a direct impact on the daily lives of every American, and the people who serve on the Court should be held to the highest of standards before being allowed the privilege of making those weighty decisions. I don’t believe this process has led us to the person best suited to hold this position. This isn’t about politics; no, it far transcends that. I have always said that I am inclined to vote for Presidential nominees, but they do not have to have that ‘‘presumption of con-firmability.’’ We have serious doubts about this nominee that may never be resolved. It certainly was not resolved by the limited investigation that the Senators had to go view in bulk—one copy with 10 Senators sitting, passing it around. We have serious doubts

about this nominee. People across this country have serious doubts about this nominee. To quote the late Senator Robert Byrd: 
No individual has a particular right to a Supreme Court seat. If we are going to give the benefit of the doubt, let us give it to the Court. Let us give it to the country. 
It was my hope that this body would wind up being on the right side of his-tory with this vote and not a political side chosen in the moment. My pref-erence would have been for the Presi-dent to send us a new, consensus nomi-nee, much as President Reagan did many years ago when he nominated Justice Kennedy. Send us another nominee and give the Senate a second chance to act as a uniter, not a divider. It now appears, however, that we will need to find another way that we, as a body—which has been described in the past as the most deliberative body in the world; many would question that description today—must find another way to show the American people that we can uphold the lofty ideals we have ascribed to. Tomorrow, this nomination process will have run its course, but our work for our constituents and all of those sitting in the Galleries tonight and all of those watching across this country who will see and follow this vote to-morrow—our work for our constituents will go on. Our work for this country will go on. Regardless of this vote to-morrow, it will go on, and we, as a body, have to get to a place where we look forward, not backward. I am confident; I know in my heart that we can restore the Senate to the place it was when I worked here as a young lawyer, a place where com-promise meant progress, not a lost bat-tle. Think about that—compromise meaning progress and not a lost battle or war. We must set aside the divisive-ness, shoulder our responsibilities, and work together. We must do so for the good of this body, for the sake of the country that we all love. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Alaska. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I come to the floor this evening to share my thoughts on what has been an ex-traordinarily long, difficult, and truly painful process. As we took up the cloture motion on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court, the process that led us to this vote today has been, in my view, a horrible process, a gut- wrenching process, where good people— good people—have been needlessly hurt, where a woman who never sought the public spotlight was, I think, cru-elly thrust into the brightest of spot-lights; a good man—a good man—with sterling academic credentials, an un-blemished professional record, both as the professional lawyer and judge that he was and also as a husband and fa-ther of two young girls, has been dam-aged—damaged terribly. As both of these individuals, Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh, have been harmed, their families have, too, and we need to, we must, do better by them. We must do better as a legisla-tive branch. We have an obligation, a moral obligation, to do better than this. I have spent more time evaluating and considering the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh than I have any of the previous nominations to the U.S. Supreme Court that I have been privi-leged to review. I have had the oppor-tunity to vote on five Justices prior to this, and I took my time. I was delib-erate; I was thoughtful. Some accused me of being too deliberate, too thoughtful, taking too much time, but this is important to me. It should be important to all of us, and I know it is important to all of us. I studied the record. I sat with Judge Kavanaugh for a lengthy period of time—about an hour and a half—and asked the questions that I had, and then I did more due diligence, reviewed the cases, and did my homework, lis-tened to the concerns that were raised by many in my State on issues that were all over the board, whether it was a woman’s right to choose, whether it was the Affordable Care Act, whether it was Executive authority, deference to the agencies, Native issues. I took considerable time. When the hearings came, not being on the Judiciary Committee, I paid at-tention. I followed the testimony of the judge, the very critical questioning from many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and then at the end of the process—or, seemingly, what we believed to be the end of the proc-ess—there were more questions. I went back to Judge Kavanaugh and had a good conversation with him. Then the allegations that we have been discussing and trying to under-stand more about came forward, and we all moved from focusing on the issues to truly a discussion that none of us ever thought we would be having when it came to a confirmation process for someone to the highest Court in the land. There was more work to be done. I was one who wanted to make sure there was a process going forward, and when there were more questions that were raised after the initial process, I was one who joined in asking that the FBI step in and do further review. I have been engaged in this lengthy and deliberative process for months now, and I was truly leaning toward supporting Judge Kavanaugh in his nomination as I looked to that record. But we know that in our role of advice and consent, it is not just the record itself. There is more that is attached to it. It is why, when in the State of Alas-ka, nominations for judges go forward, you rate them not only on their profes-sional competence—what they have demonstrated through their record— but also on matters of temperament and demeanor, which are very, very im-portant. So we moved—we shifted—that con-versation from so many of the issues that I had been focused on to other areas that are also important in evalu-ating a nominee for the courts. But I listened very carefully to the remarks, the strong, well-articulated remarks, of my colleague and my friend who sits next to me here, Senator COLLINS , and I found that I agreed with many of the points that she raised on the floor ear-lier. I do not think that Judge Kavanaugh will be a vote to overturn Roe v. Wade, and I also join with her in saying that I do not think that protections for those with preexisting conditions will be at risk. I also do not think that he will be a threat to Alaska Natives. This was an issue that certainly had been raised, but I had an extended conversation with the judge on just these issues, and I believe that he recognizes, as he told me, that Alaska Natives are not in a place identical to Native Hawaiians. Alaskan Tribes are included on the list of federally recognized tribes, and the fact remains that Native Hawaiians are not. This is a distinction; this is a dif-ference. I am one in this body who has said that I would like to see Native Hawai-ians there, and I worked with my friend Senator Akaka when he was in this body to help advance that; I sup-ported that. But the fact remains that the constitutional status of Alaska Na-tives and the Indian Commerce Clause are simply not at play with this nomi-nation. I don’t believe that. So the question is fairly asked: Do you think he is going to be there on issues that matter to Alaskans, that you have taken strong positions on? The reason I could not support Judge Kavanaugh in this cloture motion this afternoon is that in my role, in my re-sponsibility as one Senator on this floor, I take this obligation that we have in the role of advice and consent as seriously as anything that I am obli-gated or privileged to be able to vote on. I have a very high standard. I have a very high bar for any nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States. The Code of Judicial Conduct rule 1.2—this is one that many, many peo-ple in this body know—states that a ‘‘judge shall act at all times in a man-ner that promotes public confidence and the independence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary and shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety.’’ I go back, and I look to that. It is pretty high; it is really high: A judge shall act at all times—not just some-times, when you are wearing your robe, but a judge should act at all times in a manner that promotes public con-fidence—public confidence. Where is the public confidence? So it is high, and even in the face of the worst thing that could happen, a sexual assault allegation, even in the face of an overly and overtly—overt-ly—political process, politicized proc-ess, and even when one side of this Chamber is absolutely dead set on de-feating his nomination from the very

get-go, before he was even named, even in these situations, the standard is that a judge must act at all times in a manner that promotes public con-fidence in the independence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary and avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety. After the hearing that we all watched last week, last Thursday, it became clear to me—or was becoming clearer— that the appearance of impropriety has become unavoidable. I have been deliberating, agonizing, about what is fair. Is this too unfair a burden to place on somebody who is dealing with the worst, the most hor-rific, allegations that go to your integ-rity, that go to everything you are? I think we all struggle with how we would respond, but I am reminded that there are only nine seats on the Bench of the highest Court in the land, and these seats are occupied by these men and women for their lifetime. So those who seek one of these seats must meet the highest standards in all respects at all times, and that is hard. We are in a time when many in this country have lost faith in the Execu-tive branch, and it is not just with this administration. We saw much of that in the last as well. Here in Congress, many around the country have just given up on us. They have completely said: We have had enough. But I maintain that the public still views—I still view—that there is some small shred of hope that remains with our judiciary, this judiciary that must be perceived as independent, as nonpartisan, as fair and balanced in order for our form of government to function. It is that hope—it is that hope—that I seek to maintain, and I think that is why I have demanded such a high standard to maintain or regain that public confidence because it is so crit-ical that we have that public con-fidence in at least one of our three branches of government. I think we saw from the vote earlier today and we have seen from the state-ments of several of our colleagues that it does appear that Judge Kavanaugh will be seated on the Supreme Court without my vote. It is my hope—it is truly my hope—that Judge Kavanaugh will share that same hope of rebuild-ing, maintaining a level of public con-fidence, that he will strive for that ideal every day. It is my hope that he will be that neutral arbiter, the umpire who calls only the balls and the strikes, and that he will be that force for stability. I believe that Judge Kavanaugh is a good man. He is a good man. He is clearly a learned judge, but in my con-science—because how I have to vote at the end of the day with my con-science—I could not conclude that he is the right person for the Court at this time. This decision has been agonizing for me. It is as hard a choice, probably as close a call as any that I can ever re-member, and I hope—I hope and I pray—that we don’t find ourselves in this situation again. But I am worried. I am really worried that this will become the new normal, where we find new and even more cre-ative ways to tear one another down, and good people are just going to say: Forget it. 
It is not worth it. 
I am looking at some of the com-ments and the statements that are being made against me and against my good friend, my dear friend from Maine—the hateful, aggressive, truly, truly awful manner in which so many are acting now. This is not who we are. This is not who we should be. This is not who we raised our children to be. So as we move forward, again, through a very difficult time for this body and for this country, I want to urge us to a place where we are able to engage in that civil discourse that the Senate is supposed to be all about— that we show respect for one another’s views and differences and that when a hard vote is taken, there is a level of respect for the decision that each of us makes. There is something else that I do hope. Again, I refer to my friend from Maine. I will note that if there has been a silver lining in these bitter weeks—which, quite honestly, remains to be seen—I do think what we have seen is a recognition by both sides that we must do more to protect and pre-vent sexual assault and help the vic-tims of these assaults. There has been a national discussion. There has been an outpouring of dis-cussions, conversations, fears, tears, frustration, and rage. There is an emo-tion that really has been unleashed in these recent weeks, and these are dis-cussions that we need to have as a country. We need to bring these survivors to a place where they feel they can heal, but until they come out of the shadows and do so without shame, it is pretty hard to heal. I have met with so many survivors, and I know that every single one of us has. I have heard from colleagues as they shared with me that they have been truly surprised—many stunned— by what they are learning is the preva-lence of this, unfortunately, in our so-ciety today. In Alaska and, as the Presiding Offi-cer knows, in his State, the levels of sexual assault we see within our Native American and Alaskan Native commu-nities are incredibly devastating. It is not something that we can say we will get to tomorrow. We heard those voices, and I hope that we have all learned something. We owe it to the victims of sexual assault to do more and to do better and to do it now, with them. I am going to close. I truly hope that we can be at a place where we can move forward in a manner that shows greater respect, greater comity. We owe it to the people of America to re-turn to a less rancorous confirmation process. In the spirit of that comity—and again, while I voted no on cloture today and I will be a no tomorrow—I will in the final tally be asked to be re-corded as present, and I do this because a friend, a colleague of ours, is in Mon-tana this evening, and tomorrow, at just about the same hour that we are going to be voting, he is going to be walking his daughter down the aisle, and he will not be present to vote. So I have extended this as a courtesy to my friend. It will not change the out-come of the vote, but I do hope that it reminds us that we can take very small steps to be gracious with one another and maybe those small gracious steps can lead to more. I know that as hard as these matters are that we deal with, we are human and we have families that we love. We don’t spend nearly enough time with them. I am sure we can do one small thing to make that family a little bit better. That is a better way for tomor-row. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. H
OEVEN ). The Senator from New Jer-sey. Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, on Sep-tember 16, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford publicly came forward to share that Brett Kavanaugh had sexually as-saulted her when they were in high school. This was a remarkably coura-geous act. It was one that she hesitated to do. It was something that she strug-gled with, but she said time and again that she believed it was her civic duty and her sense of citizenship—that act of grace, that feeling that you have a commitment to country, to causes larger than yourself. She put herself forward. She said she was terrified to do so. She said she feared for what the impact would be on her family. Indeed, the impact on her family was terrifying. She endured hatred and vile poured out to her—death threats. She had to leave her family home and split her family up at times. She had to en-gage security for her own protection. When Dr. Ford came before the Judi-ciary Committee to testify, she reiter-ated that she was afraid. She reiterated how terrified she was, but she stated again and again this ideal of patriotic duty and civic responsibility because she believed that there is something about our institutions that is sacred and that for the highest Court in the land, there could be millions of quali-fied people in America, thousands of folks. Indeed, the President’s list itself has dozens of folks. She said that this person who sexually assaulted her should not go on the highest Court in the land for a lifetime appointment. So she sat before us in the face of endless harassment, with glaring pub-lic scrutiny into all aspects of her life and the threats against her family. Dr. Ford gave testimony that was powerful and that, to many, was jarring. She talked about her private truth, her ex-perience, and how it affected her life. She said again and again that she wanted to be helpful to the committee.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6606 October 5, 2018 
She treated every member of the com-mittee on the Republican side and the Democratic side with respect. She ex-tended them grace. She was cross-ex-amined by a prosecutor for the Repub-licans. She engaged with that pros-ecutor with a sense of decency and honor. She didn’t stretch the truth or try to dodge questions. She spoke hon-estly and candidly and from her heart. She shared details that she said had been seared into her memory. She talked about the narrow set of stairs in that house that she climbed to use the restroom. She talked about being pushed from behind into a bed-room. She talked about the music being turned up louder as she strug-gled. She talked about Brett Kavanaugh on top of her, hand over her mouth, trying to stop her as she yelled for help. She said she thought she was going to be raped. She said she thought she might be accidentally killed. There was Mark Judge, a person she identified, watching, refusing to help her. Both Mark and Brett were laugh-ing. Dr. Ford described that laughter as searing into her memory. She talked about it as being indelible. She told us she would never forget, and that she would ‘‘never forget the uproarious laughter between the two and their having fun at my expense.’’ I believe her. I believe Dr. Ford. I still believe her, and many of my col-leagues on both sides of the aisle spoke up, calling Dr. Ford’s testimony cred-ible. Many have said they believe her or, at least, that they believe someone assaulted her. They gave credence to the power of that experience—an expe-rience that reflects that of many peo-ple who experience trauma. You don’t remember it like a video recording, but there are moments that are seared into your mind. Her experience was con-sistent with people who have experi-enced trauma. Even though the Senate hearing would not allow experts to come in, we all know enough now to know that the way she described her experiences and the things she remem-bered all spoke to the ability of a cou-rageous American doing their civic duty. I was surprised that even the Presi-dent of the United States called her sincere and called her testimony com-pelling. That was until he stood at a rally and mocked her. The President of the United States, the most powerful person in the country—perhaps the most powerful person in the world— mocked her and got uproarious laugh-ter. The same thing that was seared in her memory: People were laughing at her. The President ignited that in a crowd and made her again the focus of laughter and mocking. To this body that I revere, this body that I love; to my colleagues, whom I respect, on both sides of the aisle; to this body that was designed to be the world’s most deliberative body; to this body that was designed to be thought-ful, to take the time to analyze, the question is this: We heard words about her testimony, but what followed those words? Were they like dust in the wind or were they substantive words that cause us to believe her, admiring and honoring her courage for coming for-ward? Did we treat her that way? Well, if they did believe her, if they did honor her words and her courage and the risk she took, then this body and the Judiciary Committee, of which I am a part, would have insisted on a full, fair, thorough, and complete FBI investigation that included the many witnesses who stepped forward who could have corroborated her testimony and could have contradicted Judge Kavanaugh’s testimony. This body would have insisted that we take the time to do a thorough investigation be-cause it is not just about Dr. Ford. There are millions of survivors, women and men, watching how this body will deal with the seriousness of sexual as-sault. Will we listen to survivors? Will we honor them enough to fully investigate their charges? These are not just charges alone. These are charges against someone who is up for one of the most important positions in our Nation—a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. No, they did not honor them. If they had honored them, they would have in-sisted on a full FBI investigation. In-deed, when another survivor, Ms. Ra-mirez, came forward, talking about her incident with Judge Kavanaugh during college days—when Judge Kavanaugh diminished his drinking, evasively talked about his drinking—classmate after classmate, after his testimony, came forward and said he was lying and he was misleading. Republican and Democratic classmates were offended by the way he talked about his behav-ior. It was in those college days that Ms. Ramirez said Judge Kavanaugh ex-posed himself to her. She identified 20 witnesses that were either eye-witnesses or could have corroborated the evidence. She talked in detail about who could have substantiated her claims about the kind of drunkenness that we heard in public statements from his friends, which seemed consistent and seemed to implicate the truthfulness of someone who was going to the highest Court. Did we honor that woman? Did we honor that survivor by doing an inves-tigation, by going to and at least talk-ing to the 20 witnesses that she put for-ward—another woman who is being mocked, another woman who is a vic-tim of hate being spewed at her, belit-tling her? Did we honor a survivor and simply listen and interview the 20 peo-ple she said could have proved the fac-tual nature of her allegation? No, we didn’t. We didn’t honor a sur-vivor. We didn’t listen to a survivor. We didn’t take the time in the world’s most deliberative body to listen to a woman’s claims and take the steps to see if they were true or not. This is what to me is so deeply offen-sive. It is that you have two women who come forward making claims that even the President said, at first, seemed sincere and compelling, but we didn’t take the next step to fully inves-tigate their claims so that we could know what the facts are. The truth is something that the American public deserves. An inves-tigation that gets to the truth is some-thing that the American public de-serves, that Dr. Ford deserves, that Ms. Ramirez deserves, and that even Brett Kavanaugh deserves—to let the truth come out. But this FBI investigation was part of a larger sham. People on the right, colleagues of mine, accused Dr. Ford, with her sin-cere testimony—they accused her of being part of a coordinated, partisan smear campaign. Think about that. She told her husband in 2012 about the attack. Was she somehow coordinating with Democrats back in 2012 before Judge Kavanaugh was anywhere near being on the Supreme Court? No. She talked about it with her thera-pist. She talked about it with her hus-band. She said it was Brett Kavanaugh years before Brett Kavanaugh was even on a list of consideration by the Presi-dent. In 2013, she discussed the assault again in an individual therapy session. In that same year, she told a close friend that she had been assaulted as a teenager while she was trapped in the room with two drunken boys. That was not a coordinated, partisan attack back in 2013. In 2016, she told another friend she had been sexually assaulted in high school by someone who went on to be-come a Federal judge. In 2017, she told yet another friend about the assault. She told each of these three friends that a person who had assaulted her had become a Federal judge. This does not sound like some kind of partisan smear tactics; this sounds like a woman who has been telling the truth for years about Brett Kavanaugh. The least this body could do is pause for a moment and not do a sham FBI investigation where they talk to just a handful of people but do a full FBI in-vestigation, because these charges are serious. Meanwhile, millions of Americans— survivors themselves and others—are watching to see how we deal with something that the Centers for Disease Control says happens to one out of every three women in America. How do we deal with those charges? It happens to one out of every six men in America. How do we deal with those charges? When a survivor comes forward, how does the world’s most deliberative body honor that? What we are seeing here is a coordi-nated, partisan effort to put blinders on, to not seek the truth, and to rush this to tomorrow to a final vote. Long before Dr. Ford’s bravery, I was one of those Democrats, one of those Senators, one of those Americans who expressed their sincere and deeply held concerns about Judge Kavanaugh’s

record. I said early that I would not support him. I opposed his nomination. Then, I opposed his nomination be-cause I was deeply concerned that we have a President of the United States who is the subject of a criminal inves-tigation, and that President picked the one person from his Heritage Founda-tion and Federalist Society list who had a view of Presidential power that I believed would give that President im-munity should issues relating to that investigation come before the Supreme Court. I am deeply troubled about his views on women’s right to make their own medical decisions. I am troubled about his views on workers’ rights to orga-nize, on voting rights, on civil rights, and on the principle of equal justice under the law. I am concerned about things that he said about foreign dark money influencing our campaigns. His record demonstrated very clearly to me that, if confirmed to the Supreme Court, Judge Kavanaugh would con-tinue to prioritize the interests of the powerful few over the rights of every-day Americans and that we would see an erosion of individual rights in this country. But I still believed we needed to have a fair and thorough vetting of this nominee consistent with our con-stitutional obligations and that it would eventually get to the floor and we would have our vote. In the many weeks leading up to Judge Kavanaugh’s hearing before the Judiciary Committee, many Demo-cratic colleagues and I pushed for the same kind of transparency and a proc-ess. Even if we knew where we were going to go, the process should have been fair. The process should have been bipartisan. The Judiciary Committee has a long history of the majority and minority working together to set ground rules for the committee process. I watched the Judiciary Committee for many years before I came to this body. It was the No. 1 committee I wanted to be on 5 years ago when I came to the Senate. There are legends still on that com-mittee, statesmen on both sides of the aisle, men I respect. But this process from the very beginning has been a sham. It has undermined the ability of Senators to perform our constitutional duty to advise and consent on the nominee because of the withholding of critical information that I believe is absolutely necessary to evaluate some-one. This constitutional duty means that we should have a process that allows transparency into that person’s record. The public has a right to know who the individual is that we are voting on to-morrow, what their record is. The pub-lic has a right to know. Why would we hide their record from public scrutiny? Step 1 of the sham was the Repub-lican majority’s refusal to request any records from Judge Kavanaugh’s time as Staff Secretary to President George Bush. Zero records were requested whatsoever. Brett Kavanaugh himself held that position for 3 years. He called those 3 years of his year the ‘‘most in-teresting and most formative years’’ of his career, the most interesting and formative in shaping his approach to serving as a judge and during which he presumably advised the President on everything from national security pol-icy to a proposed constitutional ban on same-sex marriages. So many critical issues that are germane to his job and his experience and the formation of his ideals were happening during those times. But they said we could see noth-ing from his record, even things that are not classified, not national secu-rity, things that would give us a better window into who he is. Step 2 of the sham was to create a wholly unaccountable process for the fraction of the White House records that the Republican majority did re-quest from Kavanaugh’s time in the White House Counsel’s Office. This process was essentially made up. It had no reflection on the history of his body of work—no reflection at all. What happened was they put into place a practice where a private law-yer, Bill Burck—who happens to be a longtime political operative, who was a former deputy to Brett Kavanaugh himself when he was Staff Secretary— was put into part of the process as a choke hold on documents getting to Senators for our evaluation. Most of the documents of this candidate’s work product have not been seen by any Sen-ator here. In fact, about 90 percent of his relevant work experience, his rel-evant work product, has not been re-viewed by any Senator here. Imagine hiring somebody whose re-sume you have only seen 10 percent of because 90 percent is obscured. Most of the folks here wouldn’t hire an intern in their office if somebody was hiding 90 percent of their resume. Then there is step 3 of the sham. In conjunction with Mr. Burck, the com-mittee chairman designated 186,000 pages something that was new called ‘‘committee confidential’’ in order to hide them from the public because they might harm the nomination. Imagine this: With the public having a right to know, the public needing transparency, now they are hiding yet again, under the name ‘‘committee confidential,’’ critical documents. They withheld 102,000 pages from the committee alto-gether, threatening to invoke some nebulous constitutional privilege. As a result, today, just hours before the final vote, only 7 percent of Kavanaugh’s record from the Bush White House has been released to Sen-ators. We are making a decision know-ing only 7 percent of his work product. When women’s rights, workers’ rights, LGBTQ rights, voting rights, and affordable healthcare are all in the balance, we know so little about this candidate. Because of all that is at stake, several colleagues and I made a decision to release those documents, but it was still just a fraction. Meanwhile, Judge Kavanaugh’s ini-tial testimony before the Judiciary Committee raised my concern because he continued to evade questions, re-fused to answer our questions. After Dr. Blasey Ford came forward, he gave his testimony, and I was stunned. You see, at Judge Kavanaugh’s initial hearing in early September, he testified that he wanted to stay ‘‘three zip codes away from pol-itics.’’ He insisted that the Supreme Court must never—I emphasize that word—never be viewed as a partisan in-stitution. But when he came before the Judiciary Committee again last week, Judge Kavanaugh jettisoned his own advice, his own belief in judicial tem-perament, his own belief in how a judge should behave and be nonpartisan, and he leveled blatantly political accusa-tions. He said that the allegations against him were nothing more than ‘‘an orchestrated political hit,’’ even speculating that they were motivated by ‘‘a revenge on behalf of the Clin-tons.’’ He cast blame on outside, left-wing opposition groups. He told the Democrats who were questioning him that the hearings had been ‘‘an embar-rassment.’’ He was belligerent. He was evasive. At times, he was outright de-ceptive, and at times, he was deeply disrespectful to my Senate colleagues. He displayed the type of fierce par-tisanship that no American should ever want to see in a Federal judge. He went on to say almost as a menacing threat that ‘‘what goes around, comes around.’’ Is this someone who can sit on the highest Court in the land, where polit-ical issues might come before him? Has he not already revealed himself to be deeply partisan? Has he not already re-vealed himself to have a deep-seeded anger toward people of certain political stripe? Is this someone who shows the kind of judicial temperament, not for a district court, not for a circuit court, but for the highest Court in the land, the Court of last resort? He didn’t say all of this in response to questions. These weren’t off-the-cuff comments. This was part of his pre-pared testimony. Those quotes were in his prepared testimony. In another instance during his testi-mony, he warned that ‘‘this is a cir-cus.’’ He said, ‘‘The consequences will extend long past my nomination. The consequences will be with us for dec-ades.’’ That is how I want to end. What are the consequences for a sham process, for a sham FBI investigation? What are the consequences in relation to women who came forward before the world’s most deliberative body with credible accusations of sexual misconduct, of sexual assault, of sexual violence? What are the consequences to a body that runs a partisan process, that ig-nores the truth, that shields relevant aspects of his record—90 percent—from the public? What are the consequences as they rush to the Senate floor hoping nobody knows the truth and ignoring investigating some of the most serious charges that could be leveled against

someone—charges of violence, charges of assault? What are the consequences for us in this body behaving in this way? What are the consequences for Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who has for-ever altered her life for her civic duty, for her patriotism, for her love of coun-try? She sacrificed to come forward, and how do we treat her? This has been an emotional week for so many. I have seen and heard and witnessed the pain and the trauma that has been dredged up. I have heard from some of my colleagues in private meet-ings about dozens of people coming for-ward to them, having never told people about their sexual assault, and now they come and tell their Senator, hop-ing that their story and that their pain that they haven’t even shared with their spouse will somehow make a dif-ference in the larger story of our coun-try, will somehow make a difference at this moment when two women are not being listened to and when their stories are not getting worthy recognition, worthy investigation. I heard colleague after colleague tell me the stories, the painful stories. I heard them myself from friends of mine who I never knew had been as-saulted. I never knew of their pain, never knew of their trauma. But at this moment in American history, they felt they had to come forward. They had to tell their truth, like Christine Blasey Ford, like Ms. Ramirez. They felt now was the time to speak up and stop this Nation from making a mis-take and try to stop the injustice and try to end a national nightmare where one out of three women is assaulted and most of them don’t feel com-fortable coming forward. They don’t feel safe coming forward. They feel that if they come forward, they will be maligned, hated, disrespected, dis-regarded; that their charges will be swept under the rug; that their charges will be ignored. Yet a chorus of women and men all across this country have been telling their stories, screaming at this Nation, hoping the national con-versation will shift in this country from abusing those who have been abused to elevating truth again. This body has had a test, and we are failing that test. This body has had a chance. This body has had a responsi-bility, and we have surrendered that responsibility. So tomorrow we vote. It seems like the die is cast. I heard there were celebrations and cheering in the White House. And in the last few hours, I also heard the pain and the anguish and the hurt, and I have heard the tears. It seems so un-just. It seems so unfair that two coura-geous women came forward to this body, and we couldn’t even investigate their claims. We couldn’t even take time to talk to witnesses. A lot of folks are now asking me: What now? I want to conclude by reading some words from another painful period where people didn’t know what this body would do. There was injustice in this land. People didn’t know what this body would do. Hundreds of thousands came forward to march and to protest and to sit in. They didn’t know what this body would do, but they stood any-way and they fought anyway. Some-times they were beaten. In one case, on a bridge in Alabama, they were beaten and bloodied. One of my colleagues in the other Chamber, J
OHN LEWIS, had his head split open. They eventually got over that bridge and got to Mont-gomery, and a man named King gave this speech to those people who were tempted to surrender to cynicism in that time. He gave this speech to those people who wanted to give up. He gave this speech to those people who were hurting. This is what he said: 
I know you’re asking today, ‘‘How long will it take? Somebody’s asking, ‘‘How long will prejudice blind the visions of men, dark-en their understanding, and drive bright- eyed wisdom from her sacred throne?’’ Some-body’s asking, ‘‘When will wounded justice, lying in prostrate on the streets . . . be lift-ed from this dust of shame to reign supreme among the children of men?’’ Somebody’s asking, ‘‘When will the radiant star of hope be plunged against the nocturnal bosom of this lonely night, plucked from the weary soul with chains of fear and the manacles of death? How long will justice be crucified, and truth bear it?’’ I come to say to you this afternoon, how-ever difficult the moment, however frus-trating the hour, it will not be long, because ‘‘truth crushed to the earth will rise again.’’ How long? Not long, because ‘‘no lie can live forever.’’ How long? Not long, because ‘‘you shall reap what you sow.’’ How long? Not long, because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice. 
I say to every American who is hurt-ing tonight, every American who is angry tonight, tomorrow we face a de-feat, but we shall not be defeated. To-morrow, it may seem like a loss, but all hope is not lost. I have faith in us as a country. I know it has been a long journey. I know we have suffered much, but I have a faith in this country that is abiding and cannot be destroyed be-cause we are a nation that always finds a way to move forward, to learn, to grow. What is dependent upon us doing that is for us to never ever give up. Never give up. The days ahead will be difficult. It will not be easy, but I have faith in America. We will learn. We will grow. We will get better. We will come to-gether if we never give up. Tomorrow, the vote may be what it is. The die may be cast, but I will never give up on this country. I will never give up on women. I will never give up on the ideals and principles we all swear an oath to that this Nation, one day, truly will be a nation of liberty and justice for all. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Vermont. Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, sev-eral of my Republican colleagues have mentioned that some of us came out in opposition to Judge Kavanaugh almost immediately after he was nominated by the President. Count me in. I was one of those people. I say that without any apologies whatsoever because I was familiar with the record of Brett Kavanaugh on the court where he sits. I was familiar with his record as a member of the Bush administration. I didn’t have all of the information, but I surely had enough to understand that if confirmed and seated, he would absolutely be a member of the hard- right majority, which has done so much harm to the people of this coun-try over the last many years. Right off, within 24 hours, I was opposed, and that was exactly the right decision. That is why tomorrow I will vote against the seating of Judge Kavanaugh. Many people in this country do not fully appreciate the role the Supreme Court plays in our lives. They know what the President does. Maybe they know what Congress does. They don’t know what the Supreme Court does. I would suggest that in North Dakota and Vermont and all over this country, you have people who are saying: What kind of corrupt campaign finance sys-tem do we have? It is not just progres-sives who say that. Conservatives say that. Republicans say that. Democrats say that. Who believes in the United States of America that a handful of bil-lionaires—some Democrats, mostly Re-publicans—can spend hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars to elect candidates who represent their inter-ests? Who thinks that is right? Not many people do. People do not understand that we are in that position today because of a 5- to-4 Supreme Court decision regarding Citizens United—a decision that is now undermining American democracy. There are those who think Citizens United did not go far enough, that bil-lionaires should be able to give money directly to Senators and Congressmen, make them directly their employees. I have zero doubt that Judge Kavanaugh will continue that majority approach to allowing billionaires to control our political system. In 1965, an enormously important act was signed by Lyndon Johnson, called the Voting Rights Act. It said that all of our people, regardless of the color of their skin, should have the right to vote. It is not a very radical idea. Yet a few years ago, the majority of the Court gutted that decision and said that it wasn’t necessary anymore. States would do the right thing; time has come and gone. Days, hours after that decision was made—a 5-to-4 deci-sion—attorneys general all over this country and Governors were working overtime to figure out how they could suppress the vote, how they could make it easier on themselves to deny people of color, poor people, and young people, the right to vote. That was a Supreme Court decision. If you are upset and you are won-dering about how in America we have States trying to make it harder for people to vote when our voter turnout

numbers are pretty low compared to the rest of the world, that was a Su-preme Court decision. I have zero doubt again, when it comes to protecting our democracy and the rights of people to vote, that Judge Kavanaugh will be on the wrong side of that issue. Today in America we are the only major country on Earth not to guar-antee healthcare to all people. The Af-fordable Care Act was an important step forward. By a 5-to-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that expanding Medicaid in a State was optional, and we had many—I think 17—States that said: No, we are not going to expand Medicaid. Millions of low-income peo-ple, children were denied the healthcare this Congress voted to give them. I have zero doubt that Mr. Kavanaugh will continue that effort to make it impossible for us to guarantee healthcare to all of our people. The Janus decision attacking unions was a 5-to-4 decision; the Muslim travel ban, a 5-to-4 decision. I didn’t need to hear about the issue of sexual assault in the beginning before it arose. I knew this nominee would be highly partisan, and that was only confirmed more strongly just a couple of weeks ago when he went before the Judiciary Committee again. That is issue No. 1. If any of you out there are now deal-ing with cancer, diabetes, heart dis-ease, or other life-threatening ill-nesses, understand that Republicans in a number of States in this country are trying to get the U.S. Supreme Court to rule that major parts of the Afford-able Care Act are unconstitutional, in-cluding the protection for people who have preexisting conditions. If you are struggling with diabetes, cancer, heart disease, serious illness, worry, and worry a lot, about what Mr. Kavanaugh will do with the other four members of the hard right in taking away your ability to get the healthcare you des-perately need at an affordable cost. If you are a woman or, in fact, a man or, in fact, 70 percent of the American people who believe a woman has the right to control her own body and you don’t want to see Roe v. Wade over-turned—and that is the last poll I saw, 70 percent of the American people hold-ing that opinion—worry, and worry a lot, because I fear very much if a case— and we think a case may come before the Supreme Court on Roe v. Wade— worry about what Kavanaugh will do with the other four rightwing members of the Court. That is issue No. 1. If Brett Kavanaugh were a choir boy, if he were one of the most wonderful human beings ever to walk the face of this Earth, based on his policies, based on his decisions, I would vote against him. It turns out that maybe he has not been a choir boy. I could only concur with my col-league from New Jersey, Senator B
OOK-
ER, in expressing what we are hearing in our own office. I come from a small State. Yet as a result of Dr. Ford’s tes-timony, we have received comments from 11 Vermonters who relayed, to some degree, their stories about sexual assault. We received a letter from a woman who was 70 years old, who told us about a horrific experience that hap-pened to her when she was 14 years of age. While almost all of the comments that came in were from women, there were some from men who were abused as boys. Some 20 to 25 percent of women in this country have been sexually abused. Wow, that is a crisis. That is an epidemic. Clearly, our goal must be to do everything we can to make it easier for women to come forward with these terribly painful and life-lasting experiences, make it easier for them to speak their truth. It is hard to talk about President Trump and continue to use the word ‘‘unbelievable’’ because things he does literally are unbelievable every other day, but I think maybe he might have hit a new low, even for Trump. Dr. Ford brought forth her testimony. I think the vast majority of the Amer-ican people believed her. The President of the United States—the man who should be telling women we want to hear your truth, we want to hear your pain—this President, in the most vul-gar way imaginable, actually mocked Dr. Ford. What kind of message does that send to women all across this country who are suffering? It sends the message that they will not be believed. They will be dismissed, and the most powerful person in this country will mock them. Even for a disgraceful President like Trump, this is, in fact, a new low. It is not even the policies I am quite convinced that Kavanaugh will pursue. It is not only the very serious and cred-ible allegations regarding sexual as-sault that were in no way fully inves-tigated by the FBI. I read the report, and it was a very limited report. It cer-tainly did not do justice to Dr. Ford. The FBI agents did not even interview Dr. Ford or Judge Kavanaugh. I don’t know how you have an investigation in which you don’t interview the two major figures in that charge, that alle-gation. It is not only the lingering question that came from two—at least two— credible women, but it is also the very important question of Judge Kavanaugh’s veracity, his honesty. I think I heard more than one Repub-lican Member of this body say: Well, you know, if he is lying, he should not be seated on the U.S. Supreme Court. Yet there is, in fact, very strong evi-dence that the testimonies Judge Kavanaugh gave recently and in years past, when he was first appointed to a judgeship, were not honest. Let me give you a few examples. In his pre-vious testimony before the Judiciary Committee, Judge Kavanaugh was asked more than 100 times if he knew about files stolen by Republican staff-ers from Judiciary Committee Demo-crats. Republican staffers stole files, and that was pretty clear. The question that was asked of Judge Kavanaugh was, in fact, had he seen those files; was he familiar with those files? The answer he gave was no, he was not fa-miliar with those files. It turned out the emails released as part of these hearings show these files were regularly shared with Kavanaugh while he was on the White House staff. One of the emails, in fact, had the sub-ject line ‘‘spying.’’ In 2006, Judge Kavanaugh told Con-gress he didn’t know anything about the NSA warrantless wiretapping pro-gram prior to its being reported by the New York Times this year. An email revealed that while at the White House, he might have been involved in some conversations about that pro-gram. It sounds as though he was not telling the truth. In 2004, Judge Kavanaugh testified that the nomination of William Pryor to the Eleventh Circuit Court was not one that ‘‘I worked on personally.’’ It turns out that may not have been true as well. In 2006, Judge Kavanaugh testified: ‘‘I was not involved and am not involved in the questions about the rules gov-erning detention of combatants.’’ New evidence released that is part of these confirmation hearings suggests that statement may not have been true. Judge Kavanaugh repeatedly said that he did not have a serious drinking problem, that he had never blacked out, never acted in a belligerent way. There are a number of his classmates who suggest otherwise. In fact, there is a piece in the Washington Post today, signed by three of his classmates, I be-lieve, at Yale who suggested the very opposite. Are they lying? Are these people coming forward into the public eye to be abused? Are they lying or, in fact, is Judge Kavanaugh not tell the truth? Judge Kavanaugh testified he treated women ‘‘as friends and equals’’ and ‘‘with ‘‘dignity and respect.’’ Numerous entries in his school yearbook would seem to contradict this. The issue is not just what he did; the issue is that he is not telling the truth about what he did. Judge Kavanaugh was not the only person in America to drink a lot in high school and in col-lege, not the only one. If he had come forward and said ‘‘Yeah, you know, I did have a drinking problem; I have overcome it, but I did,’’ that would have been perhaps telling the truth, but that is not what he said. On it goes. It is likely, as I under-stand it, that those of us who are op-posed to Judge Kavanaugh will, in fact, be on the losing side of that vote to-morrow. I am very sorry about that. History has a funny way of respond-ing to what goes on. I think this nomi-nation, to a much greater degree than I think anyone would have expected, has aroused the American people from coast to coast. It has aroused them in terms of the issue of sexual assault and whether we deal with that issue hon-estly. It has aroused the American peo-ple in terms of the issue of veracity

and whether or not we are going to have a member on the Supreme Court who, in fact, is honest. It has aroused the American people in understanding that the function of the U.S. Supreme Court is to render justice with impar-tiality, with justice for all—not to sim-ply represent the wealthy and the pow-erful and billionaire campaign contrib-utors. So I think this whole process has been an enormous learning experience for the American people. While we may lose tomorrow, I think the end result of what has taken place here—the dis-grace of what has taken place here— will reverberate in a very positive way for the American people. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Rhode Island. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, as a U.S. Senator and a member of the Ju-diciary Committee, giving careful con-sideration to Supreme Court nomina-tions is among my most important re-sponsibilities. These lifetime appoint-ments can change not only the course of the Nation but the course of lives. I began with deep concerns about Judge Kavanaugh: his unfettered views of executive power, effectively believ-ing that the President is beyond the law; his refusal to commit to well-es-tablished precedents on critical issues, like women’s constitutional rights re-garding abortion; his affinity for un-limited and dark political money and his studious blindness to its harm to our democracy; and his very selection and support by big special interest groups. I had significant concerns about his truthfulness and tempera-ment—concerns proven more than jus-tified over the course of these hearings. Another warning sign was flashing. Senate Republicans were stopping at nothing to get this nominee through. Why, it made we wonder. Why? Behind all of the shattered norms and traditions of the Senate, behind all of the hidden documents and unan-swered questions, stands the looming question: Why? In my opening comments in the com-mittee, I chronicled a pattern under Chief Justice Roberts, an unpleasant pattern of 5-to-4 partisan rulings for the big corporate and special interests that are the lifeblood of the Republican Party—not 3 or 4 times, not even a dozen or two dozen times, but 73 times—73 times and all 5-to-4 partisan decisions, all wins for the big corporate and special interests that are the life-blood of the Republican party—73 times. The pattern is clear in these 5-to-4 partisan decisions. Every time big cor-porate and Republican special interests are involved, the big interest wins— every time, 73 to 0. On its way to delivering these Repub-lican special interest victories, the Roberts Court—or I should say the five of them who do this; call it the ‘‘Rob-erts Five’’—leaves a trail—a trail of wrecked precedents, a trail of sketchy, nonfactual fact-finding, a trail of long-standing statutes ignored or rewritten, and a trail of supposedly conservative judicial principles, like modesty, def-erence, originalism, and stare decisis, all violated. The pattern of these 73 partisan ‘‘Roberts Five’’ decisions ex-plains why. It explains why big Repub-lican interests want Kavanaugh on the Court so badly and why Republicans shredded so much Senate precedent to shove him through. The big Republican interests want to be able to pull 5-to-4 wins out of the U.S. Supreme Court as if it were a legislature they controlled. What are the areas of law where the big Republican corporate and special interests have a stake where the Rob-erts Five delivered for those big Repub-lican Party stakeholders? Well, first, they helped Republicans to gerrymander elections in Vieth v. Jubelirer, 5 to 4. This was a big deal. It let Republicans gerrymander their way to control of Congress, to control of the House of Representatives, in a year Republicans lost by a million votes. They lost the House by a million votes and won it by gerrymandering. The Roberts Five has helped Repub-licans to keep minority voters away from the polls: Shelby County, 5 to 4; Bartlett v. Strickland, 5 to 4; Abbott v. Perez, 5 to 4. Making it harder to vote—harder for minorities or poor people or the elderly—is a Republican electioneering tactic, and Republican State legislatures went right to work, passing voter suppression laws right after these partisan decisions. The Roberts Five also helped to un-leash big-money political influence, giving big interests unlimited power to buy elections and threaten and bully Congress. McCutcheon and Bullock and the infamous, grotesque 5-to-4 Citizens United decision were their tools. This is the sockdolager, the really big deal, by the way. There is a very small world of very big interests that have unlimited money to spend and a business strategy to spend it to influ-ence politics. It is not a big group, but it is a powerful group, and it is the heart of the Republican funding ma-chine. These few but big Republican in-terests were given unprecedented polit-ical artillery by the Roberts Five, at least unprecedented since Teddy Roo-sevelt cleaned house over a century ago. Our politics since Citizens United has been contorted and corrupted, but those big influences are, oh, so happy. What else do the big influencers want to get out of courtrooms? Big special interests that can muscle their way around Congress and capture executive agencies hate courtrooms. There is this annoying thing in court-rooms of being treated equally with regular people. There is this annoying thing in courtrooms about having to turn over your actual documents. There is this really annoying thing in courtrooms about having to tell the truth. So, bingo, the Roberts Five pro-tected corporations from group class- action lawsuits—Walmart v. Dukes, 5 to 4; Comcast, 5 to 4; Epic Systems, 5 to 4—and helped corporations to steer customers and workers away from courtrooms and into corporate friendly mandatory arbitration—Concepcion, Italian Colors, and Rent-a-Center, all 5 to 4 at the hands of the Roberts Five. What else? Of course, to bust unions, a perennial Big Business special inter-est classic, kind of a golden oldie for big Republican influencers: Harris v. Quinn, 5 to 4; Janus v. AFSCME, 5 to 4. And, of course, to protect polluters. Big polluters pour big money into the Republican Party. They do this, they will tell you, to protect your freedom. They talk a lot about freedom. It turns out that it is your freedom to breath dirty air, drink dirty water, smell the river going by, eat chemicals with your food, and have climate havoc and acid oceans. It is all about freedom—indeed, the freedom for big polluters to pollute for free and get away with it. Right with them there is the Roberts Five over and over, for the polluters, even stopping the Nation’s Clean Power Plan 5 to 4 for the coal industry. The list goes on. It totals 73 partisan 5-to-4 decisions under Chief Justice Roberts, each giving big wins to big Republican interests. It is an indelible pattern. Although the American people might not be keeping exact score—they might not know that the number is 73—they feel the Court is rigged, and the Court is flying all the warning flags of a cap-tured agency, dancing to special inter-est tunes and rampaging through precedent and principle to get there. This pattern is a disaster for the Court, and I know Kavanaugh will con-tribute to that disaster. How do I know this? I know this be-cause Kavanaugh’s record tells me. That is why he is the nominee, after all. That is the why. He has been sig-naling the big influencers with over 50 speeches to the Federalist Society. I think he has the human record for speeches to the Federalist Society, sig-naling that he is their guy. And he has been signaling with his record as a judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals in the most con-troversial and salient civil cases, those decided by bare 2-to-1 majorities. When Kavanaugh was in the majority with another Republican-appointed judge, he voted to advance the far-right and corporate interests a striking 91 per-cent of the time. That is almost a per-fect match for the Roberts Five major-ity rulings in 5-to-4 cases where these conservative groups show up. The Roberts Five gives conservative groups a 92-percent win rate. Kavanaugh gives conservative groups a 91-percent win rate. No wonder he is their guy. Ninety-one percent—remember that number. Kavanaugh reliably voted for pol-luters and for dark money and for cor-porate interests with a healthy dollop of anti-choice, pro-gun, religious-right

politics thrown in. Ninety-one percent is how he campaigned for this job. Big special interests have a habit of turning up regularly in appellate courtrooms like the DC Circuit. Their tool of influence is one of the worst policed tools of special-interest influ-ence in America—the so-called amicus brief, where big special interests fund front groups to file these amicus briefs to instruct courts how they want the courts to rule. They are called amicus briefs because they are supposedly appearing as a friend of the court, but this has noth-ing to do with friendship. It is a scan-dal of secrecy, deception, and manipu-lation. How does this involve Kavanaugh? In cases where conservative groups weighed in with these amicus briefs be-fore him, Judge Kavanaugh sided with them—wait for it—91 percent of the time—again, 91 percent. Call him ‘‘Judge 91 percent,’’ and you under-stand why those big interests want him so badly on the Supreme Court and why the Republican Party drove like drunk kids over the curbs and across the lawns, smashing mailboxes of pro-cedure and propriety to get him there. The overlap between the groups in Kavanaugh’s 91-percent club and the groups who fund Leonard Leo, the Fed-eralist Society architect of Kavanaugh’s nomination, is telling. The multimillion-dollar scorched-earth ad campaign by groups like the Judi-cial Crisis Network is funded by big dark money interests. The NRA poured its own millions into campaigning for Kavanaugh. They promised NRA members that Kavanaugh would break the tie. They are 91 percent sure. In the face of all this, Kavanaugh feigned impartiality, but then came the ‘‘tell.’’ When Kavanaugh returned to the Judiciary Committee to defend himself against accusations of a sex as-sault, his veneer of impartiality was pulled away, and we saw—America saw—the fierce and rabid conspiracy- mongering partisan within. His per-formance was recently described by a right-of-center columnist as his ‘‘par-tisan, unhinged diatribe and non-judicial demeanor.’’ Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent that the article from which I am quoting be appended to the end of my remarks. (Mr. LANKFORD assumed the Chair.) He even blamed Bill and Hillary Clin-ton—seriously. It shows where we are in this country that this display was not by itself dis-qualifying. But for the big special in-terests behind ‘‘Judge 91 Percent,’’ this was not at all disqualifying. This was reassuring. This was great stuff. It just confirmed what they knew: Judge 91 Percent would be their boy. The Rob-erts Five would get back in the saddle, and they would get 73 more 5-to-4 par-tisan victories. But that moment gave the rest of the country the opportunity to take true measure of a man who claims he is im-partial—a man who asks the Senate to grant him a lifetime seat in judgment of others and claims he will judge fair-ly—fat chance. One longtime observer of the judici-ary who was an early supporter of Kavanaugh recently withdrew his sup-port. He wrote in the Atlantic maga-zine: 
I cannot condone the partisanship which was raw, undisguised, naked, and conspira-torial from someone who asks for public faith as a dispassionate and impartial judi-cial actor. His performance was wholly in-consistent with the conduct we should ex-pect from a member of the judiciary. 
Extraordinarily, even former Su-preme Court Justice Stevens has warned against Kavanaugh for the same reasons. Kavanaugh’s raw, undisguised, naked, and conspiratorial partisan screed may have excited the donors, but it did nothing to address the concerns that had prompted the hearing in the first place. So in addi-tion to an epic fail of any reasonable test of impartiality, Judge Kavanaugh still bears credible allegations of sex-ual assault levied against him. I will confess, I believe Dr. Blasey Ford. We have a big dispute here, but I do hope that in this Senate we at least can agree on one thing. If Dr. Blasey Ford’s testimony was true, I hope we can all agree that Kavanaugh has no business on the Court. Well, I believed her then, and I be-lieve her now, and I did not find him credible at all. I found him belligerent and aggressive—just as his Yale drink-ing buddies said he was while drunk in college—and evasive and nonrespon-sive. Dr. Ford’s allegations were credible enough to get her here before the Sen-ate. Her testimony here was quiet, open, and powerful. She was calm, com-posed, and utterly believable. Even President Trump called her testimony ‘‘credible’’ and ‘‘compelling.’’ So did many of my Republican colleagues. But then came the smear campaign to discredit and demean her, led by the President’s sickening taunts and mock-ery in Mississippi. Then came the ma-jority leader’s criticisms. He knew it wouldn’t do to say outright that she lied, but his every accusation fell to pieces if she was telling the truth. His attacks were a bank shot—a relentless, indirect bank-shot smear of Dr. Ford’s credibility. One element of the smear of Dr. Blasey Ford was to describe her testi-mony as ‘‘uncorroborated.’’ We have heard that over and over. The majority leader said that again just this morn-ing on the floor—uncorroborated. Well, first, that just isn’t true. Prior con-sistent statements are a well-known form of corroboration, and Dr. Ford’s prior consistent statements are abun-dant. It is ironic to have Republicans complain about a lack of corroboration when Republicans did everything pos-sible to prevent corroborating evidence from coming forward. It is deeply un-fair to Dr. Ford to disallow, prevent, and freeze out corroborating evidence and then call her testimony uncorroborated, which bring us to the, to put it politely, abridged FBI inves-tigation. First, the FBI background investiga-tion was closed to this new evidence in an unprecedented break from the en-tire history of background investiga-tions. Then, the investigation was lim-ited by secret orders from the White House we still have not seen. What do we see? We see the dozens of credible, percipient, and corroborating witnesses who came forward to say that they couldn’t get an interview from the FBI, who were never con-tacted when they made themselves known to the FBI. I ask unanimous consent that that two letters from the representatives of Ms. Ramirez and Dr. Ford explaining this be added at the end of my re-marks. Mr. President, many witnesses were fobbed off into a black hole of a tip line—a tip line from which no tip ap-pears ever to have been pursued, a tip line that was just a dumping ground for unwelcome evidence. As a U.S. at-torney, had I received the set of wit-ness summaries we saw, I would have sent the package back for more inves-tigation. A sincere and thorough investigation designed to get at the truth would have broadly interviewed Kavanaugh and Blasey Ford’s known contemporaries to probe their recollections. An investigation to get at the truth would have interviewed the witnesses who corroborated Dr. Blasey Ford’s prior consistent statements. An investigation designed to get at the truth would have tested Kavanaugh’s calendar and yearbook entries with contemporaneous wit-nesses. An investigation designed to get at the truth would have done interviews of witnesses who corroborate the inci-dent alleged by Ms. Ramirez, like the classmate ‘‘100 percent sure’’ he was told at the time that Kavanaugh had exposed himself to Ramirez. An investigation designed to get at the truth would have interviewed peo-ple who recalled Kavanaugh’s propen-sity to drink to excess and his behavior when drunk relevant to these inci-dents. An investigation designed to get at the truth would have certainly sought to interview the alleged victims, like Christine Blasey Ford and the accused perpetrator, Brett Kavanaugh. From public reporting, we know that none of this happened. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that like every-thing else in this nomination, such as hiding 90 percent of the records from the Bush White House days, putting bogus ‘‘Executive Privilege’’ cover over other documents, and claiming docu-ments are ‘‘committee confidential’’ through a nonexistent process that was

partisan from start to finish—like ev-erything else, it is hard to escape the conclusion that this investigation was designed not to get at the truth, but to step carefully around it. I am a huge fan of the FBI. I admire that organization immensely. It must have killed the agents to do such a half-baked and incomplete job because of marching orders from the White House. My heart goes out to the experi-enced FBI professionals hamstrung by the Trump White House through this investigation. They know better than anyone the holes in what they did, but in this matter they don’t have the independence of a criminal investiga-tion. The White House is the client. They must do what they are told. This was yet another Trump abuse of a proud American institution. So here we are. A defendant in a criminal prosecu-tion enjoys a presumption of innocence until proven guilty. A defendant in a civil trial must be found culpable by a preponderance of the evidence. An ex-ecutive agency must make decisions based on substantial evidence. But the question before us is none of those. The question before us is whether Brett Kavanaugh is a man with the char-acter, credibility, impartiality, and temperament to sit in judgment on America’s highest Court. We now know Brett Kavanaugh is not that. He is not close, and Americans know it. But the big Republican inter-est groups don’t care because they see that 91 percent, and they yearn for 73 more 5-to-4 partisan victories. Service to the law has at its heart an earnest pursuit of the truth. In Kavanaugh’s pursuit of office, truth has too often not been his goal but his casualty. The history of falsehoods is well chronicled: denying that he worked on the nomination of the con-troversial Judge Pryor, denying that he knew of documents stolen from Ju-diciary Committee Democrats when he was at the Bush White House, denying that he was involved in questions about the knowledge of the secret de-tention program or the warrantless wiretapping program, denying what he himself said about Presidential immu-nity from investigation, and complicit in the coverup of millions of docu-ments we should have seen, and on and on. Once Dr. Blasey Ford and then Ms. Ramirez came forward with sexual as-sault allegations, the lies came fast and furiously—that he knew nothing about the Ramirez allegations until the ‘‘New Yorker’’ story was published; that he had no alcohol problem and never drank to the point of impairment of his memory; that he had unique defi-nitions of phrases in common parlance he related to binge drinking and sex; that he ‘‘always treated women with dignity and respect’’; and that claim-ing himself as a girl’s ‘‘Alumnius’’ was a sign of affection. As the woman her-self retorted: ‘‘There is nothing affec-tionate or respectful in bragging about making sexual conquests that never happened.’’ On they came, little lies and big lies about not having connections to get into Yale, about honoring grand jury secrecy while helping the Ken Starr in-vestigation—none perhaps individually fatal but together adding up to a pat-tern of dissembling and prevarication. Even before Kavanaugh was nomi-nated, Leader M
CCONNELL smelled trouble and urged the President not to nominate someone he knew was a badly flawed nominee with a lengthy paper trail that would likely disclose how extreme and partisan Judge Kavanaugh truly is. So much has been left by the wayside in the mad rush to jam this nomina-tion through—documents, facts, Senate rules and traditions, real investigation, simple respect for truth—all smashed- up wreckage in the wake of this nomi-nation. But as my fellow New Englander John Adams said, ‘‘Facts are stubborn things.’’ The truth has a way of coming out. The millions of hid-den pages of Kavanaugh’s White House records will come out. The nonasser-tion assertion of Executive privilege will fall or yield to time. The unheard witnesses will ultimately be heard, and others may come forward, which brings me back to the question I began with: Why all the wreckage? Why all the rush? Why all the damage? Why all the violation? The answer is in the num-bers: 5 to 4, 73, and 91 percent. At the end of the day, we go back to a Su-preme Court far too often dancing to the tune of a handful of big Republican special interests. The record of this— the pattern of this—is undeniable. As I said, it will be a disaster for the Court, and Kavanaugh will eagerly contribute to that disaster. This whole mess has been a dark epi-sode for the U.S. Senate, for the Su-preme Court, for our image around the world, for our democracy. But there is one bright jewel that can be picked in the midst of all the filth and wreckage and lies; that is that something very special is happening out there. The tes-timony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford of her assault at the hands of Brett Kavanaugh, though studiously ignored by so many Republicans and mocked by the President of the United States, has lit a fire. Just in my small State of Rhode Is-land, at least 10 women have written to me to share their own personal stories of survival of sexual assault. Like all of us, I get mail everyday about various policies that are being debated here in the Senate. I am coming up on 12 years, and I have never, never had mail like this. These women have come for-ward from widely different ages and backgrounds—college students and grandmothers—to tell their stories. Some have held these secrets close for years, even for decades. Several of these women gave me permission to share their words—words they have al-lowed me to free on the Senate floor after years of silence. What a privilege it is. What an honor for me to be trust-ed in this way by these remarkable women. Some were moved to tell their stories because they see their own fears re-flected in Dr. Blasey Ford’s brave testi-mony—the fear of not being believed, the fear of losing the respect of family or of friends. But they knew that Dr. Blasey Ford’s memories were real, and they told me they wanted me to trust that Dr. Blasey Ford’s memories were real because they knew that their own memories were real, because their own memories of their assaults were seared into their minds. One told me: ‘‘I am Dr. Ford.’’ A woman wrote to me: 
I am sure my rapist hasn’t thought of me since that night 21 years ago either. In fact, he, like Kavanaugh, would likely deny any-thing had ever happened. But here’s the thing about rape—the victims never forget. 
The coverage of Dr. Blasey Ford’s ap-pearance before the Senate for some stirred deep and disquieting emotions. As one woman wrote: 
The past few weeks have been doubly dif-ficult with Dr. Ford coming forward and all of the constant news threads and social media threads. I have been triggered with nightmares, fear of being alone, and emo-tionally wrecked. PTSD and triggers are real. No matter how much therapy and time goes by, one small statement or physical interaction can trigger someone who has ex-perienced a traumatic assault. 
One letter read: 
As a rape survivor (I was 19 years old—I am now 66 years old), I want you to know that that experience does color the rest of a per-son’s life, informing decisions that you make, where and how you go somewhere, how you raise your children and relate to your husband and all other people. Some-times through the decades, you think about it consciously and on purpose, and some-times outside events can bring it back with-out your willing it to be so. 
Dr. Blasey Ford’s quietly compelling testimony has forced our Nation to face up to the tough questions about how women have been treated. The re-demption, if there is one, for this foul nomination process is for us to grasp the power of this moment, for our country to act on the power of this mo-ment. This is about far more than a troubled and troubling nominee. Some-thing big is happening. Women across the country, like these extraordinary women in Rhode Island, are reconciling with their truth, fighting through a long and deeply unfair legacy of shame, fear, and stigma. They are stepping up. They are coming forward, determined, as one wrote to me to leave a different world for their daughters and grand-daughters than the world that silenced them for years, for decades. For me, it is a true personal honor to share this moment with them, to be trusted with these long-held stories, to have the chance to help end that bit-terly unfair legacy, and to support them toward that new and better world for their daughters and grand-daughters. There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6613 October 5, 2018 
[From The Washington Post, Oct. 5, 2018] I
STHESUPREME COURT SALVAGEABLE ? (By Jennifer Rubin) Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh’s frantic op-ed in the Wall Street Journal insisting that he is a fair, impartial judge—and that we should disregard his partisan, unhinged diatribe and nonjudicial demeanor during last week’s Senate testimony—serves as some recogni-tion that the partisan wars in which he has taken up arms now threaten the legitimacy of the Supreme Court. Other than denying a seat to an overt partisan such as Kavanaugh, what can be done to recapture at least the il-lusion that the high court is something more than another blue-vs.-red battlefield? It helps to understand how we got here, how we got to the point at which a Supreme Court nominee doesn’t bother to conceal his animosity toward an entire political party. The federal judiciary and the selection process for it were not intended as expres-sions of representative democracy. We didn’t even directly elect senators who in turn con-firmed judges until the 17th Amendment. It wasn’t intended to be an expression of pop-ular will. The expansion of judicial power in the 20th century was a mixed blessing to be sure, serving as both a last line of defense for individual rights against a growing adminis-trative state and an imperfect, sometimes counterproductive tool for ameliorating deep social conflicts. (As an aside, an unelected judiciary with vastly expanded power used to be the right’s nemesis; now it is a political prize and a midterm election base-pleaser.) The high court certainly became a bone of contention for the right during the tenure of Chief Justice Earl Warren, but the nature of the justices and the institution itself changed when our parties become more overtly ideological, with fewer centrists. Still, matters were not dire for the court due to a very undemocratic instrument—the fili-buster. That required some small degree of consensus for judicial confirmation and be-stowed greater legitimacy on the courts. A justice acceptable to at least a small number of the opposition party’s members had to contain his or her partisanship; he or she couldn’t be a gladiator for one side or the other. Sen. Mitch McConnell (R–Ky.) decided that he had enough of that. He envisioned the Su-preme Court as simply another arena for bare-knuckle brawls. Custom and comity went out the door. He denied a mainstream liberal judge, Merrick Garland, so much as a hearing. He did away with the filibuster for the high court. Post Opinions contributing columnist Ron Klain, speaking to the New Yorker, put it brilliantly: ‘‘If [Republicans] can, they will.’’ Republicans saw no need to release all of Kavanaugh’s records. What could Democrats do other than holler? They saw no need to take Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations se-riously (they’d ‘‘plow right through,’’ McConnell said). So what if Democrats squawked? With impunity they could order an FBI inquiry designed to hopscotch around problems for Kavanaugh (e.g. his claims about drinking). Democrats didn’t have the votes to block him, and the GOP moderates could be counted on to crumble. Hence we got a Supreme Court nominee pleading his case on Fox News and the Wall Street Jour-nal op-ed page. In some respect, the fix for the Supreme Court is the same as the fix for our politics— leveling a right-wing populist party that ab-hors democratic norms and building a cen-ter-left to center-right coalition. (Some structural reforms such as ranked voting, eliminating gerrymandering and automatic voter registration would help.) In the near-term, the goal would be to depoliticize the Supreme Court, reducing the vicious partisanship that accompanies a life-time appointment. A term limit of 12 to 15 years for justices and a 60-vote threshold seem increasingly attractive. A constitu-tional amendment would be needed for the former and probably for the latter (unless both sides finally agree that losing the fili-buster has been a disaster). That’s no easy task considering that an amendment must be proposed by either a two-thirds vote by both houses of Congress, or a call by two- thirds of the state legislatures for a con-stitutional convention (a prospect so alarm-ing given the extremism and anti-democratic passions of the day that it should be avoided at all costs). However, given the right’s former antipathy toward a powerful execu-tive and the left’s recent experience in a hyper-politicized nomination process, it might be doable. The Supreme Court can do its part as well. It has resisted adopting its own ethics rules, including guidelines for recusal. That should end. Justices have become less reticent about making public, political remarks. That should end as well. Judges should es-chew appearances before overtly ideological groups. If they act more like judges of old, they might recapture some of the luster the Supreme Court once had. We’ve witnessed the destruction of a slew of executive branch norms and the collapse of Congress (which is now a partisan handmaiden to the president rather than a coequal branch of government). If we let the court go to seed, we will have pulled off a trifecta. But it’s not an accomplishment that any of us should seek. 
KATZ, MARSHALL & BANKS , LLP, Washington, DC, October 4, 2018. Re Supplemental Background Investigation of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh—UP-DATED Hon. C
HRISTOPHER A. W RAY, Federal Bureau of Investigation. D
EAR DIRECTOR WRAY: As you are aware, the Federal Bureau of Investigation failed to interview our client, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, in connection with its Supplemental Background Investigation of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh. It also declined to interview wit-nesses whose names we provided to the FBI as possessing information highly relevant to Dr. Ford’s allegations. We write to provide you with the names of several of the wit-nesses we requested that the FBI interview in connection with this matter. None were contacted nor, to our knowledge, were more than a dozen other names we provided to the FBI whose interviews would have challenged the credibility of Judge Kavanaugh’s testi-mony before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on September 27, 2018. They re-main available to talk with law enforce-ment. Jeremiah Hanafin: Mr. Hanafin is a former FBI agent and pro-fessional polygraph examiner. He conducted Dr. Ford’s polygraph examination on August 7, 2018, and determined that Dr. Ford’s re-sponses were not indicative of deception. Mr. Hanafin had the data from the examination reviewed by four independent reviewers, who all agreed with his conclusions. Mr. Hanafin would be able to discuss the examination with the FBI, as well as provide the poly-graph examination data to the FBI for its independent review. He also would have been able to refute the false statements made in Rachel Mitchell’s report about Dr. Ford’s mental state on the day of the examination. Russell Ford: As described in his sworn declaration pro-vided to the Judiciary Committee, in 2012 Dr. Ford told her husband and their couples therapist that she was sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh when she was in high school. He can explain how and why this issue arose in therapy. Mr. Ford has been married to Dr. Ford since 2002 and can attest to her character and credibility. Keith Koegler: As described in his sworn declaration pro-vided to the Judiciary Committee, Dr. Ford told Mr. Koegler in 2016 that she was assault led by a man who was then (in 2016) a federal judge. Shortly after Justice Anthony Ken-nedy’s resignation and prior to Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination, Dr. Ford sent an email to Mr. Koegler naming Judge Kavanaugh as her assailant. Mr. Koegler has been close friends with Dr. Ford for over five years and can attest to her character and credibility. Adela Gildo-Mazzon: As described in her sworn declaration pro-vided to the Judiciary Committee, in 2013 Dr. Ford told Ms. Gildo-Mazzon that she was pre-viously sexually assaulted by a man who was then (in 2013) a federal judge. Ms. Gildo- Mazzon has been friends with Dr. Ford for over ten years and can attest to her char-acter and credibility. Rebecca Olson: As described in her sworn declaration pro-vided to the Judiciary Committee, in 2017 Dr. Ford told Ms. Olson that she was previously sexually assaulted by a man who was then (in 2017) a federal judge. Ms. Olson has been friends with Dr. Ford for over six years and can attest to her character and credibility. Kirsten Leimroth: In interviews with the media, Ms. Leimroth described a lunch meeting with Dr. Ford and Jim Gensheimer at a beachside res-taurant with Dr. Ford in early July 2018, be-fore Judge Kavanaugh was nominated. At that meeting, Ms. Leimroth says Dr. Ford named Judge Kavanaugh as her assailant and described her fears about what would happen if her name and her accusations against Judge Kavanaugh became public. Ms. Leimroth is a family friend of Dr. Ford’s and can attest to her character and credibility. See https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/09/17/ metoo-spurred-christine-blasey-ford-to-open- up-about-alleged-attack-year-before- kavanaugh-nomination-friends-say/. Jim Gensheimer: In interviews with the media, Mr. Gensheimer described a lunch meeting at a beachside restaurant with Dr. Ford and Ms. Leimroth in early July 2018—the same meet-ing as the one described by Ms. Leimroth— before Judge Kavanaugh was nominated. At that meeting, Mr. Gensheimer says Dr. Ford named Judge Kavanaugh as her assailant and described her fears about what would happen if her name and her accusations against Judge Kavanaugh became public. Mr. Gensheimer has been friends with Dr. Ford for over eight years and can attest to her character and credibility. See https:// www.mercurynews.com/2018/09/17/metoo- spurred-christine-blasey-ford-to-open-up- about-alleged-attack-year-before- kavanaugh-nomination-friends-say/; https:// www.cnn.com/2018/09/18/politics/kavanaugh- accuser-friend/index.html. Monica L. McLean: Ms. McLean has been friends with Dr. Ford for many years. A letter released to the pub-lic on the night of October 2, 2018, apparently written by Brian Merrick, an ex-boyfriend of Dr. Ford during her 20’s, falsely claims that Dr. Ford helped Ms. McLean prepare for a po-tential polygraph examination sometime in the 1990’s. Ms. McLean can attest to the fal-sity of the claims contained in this letter, as well as the character and credibility of Dr. Ford and that of the former boyfriend. It has come to our attention that another person who requested anonymity came for-ward to the FBI with information highly rel-evant to Judge Kavanaugh’s behavior in high

school and was turned away. His sworn state-ment was published on October 3, 2018 in the New Yorker: https://www.newyorker.com/ news/news-desk/will-the-fbi-ignore-testi-monies-from-kavanaughs-former-classmates. In addition, had the FBI interviewed Dr. Ford, she would have provided her direct ac-count of Judge Kavanaugh’s assault and an-swered any questions about it, including questions that Ms. Mitchell and the Judici-ary Committee members were unwilling or unable to ask during the hearing. She would have also provided corroborating evidence, including her medical records and access to the phone from which she messaged The Washington Post about Judge Kavanaugh’s assault prior to his nomination to the Su-preme Court. The FBI could have also asked her about her conversations with the wit-nesses referenced above in order to establish those witnesses’ credibility. Such an inter-view would have played a crucial role in pro-viding the FBI with a full picture of all of the facts involved in this important and seri-ous matter. We were heartened on September 28, 2018, when Senators Flake and Coons announced that the FBI would conduct a supplemental background investigation. All those men-tioned above, and more, could easily have been interviewed in the time allotted. It took tremendous courage for Dr. Ford to come forward. As she testified before the Ju-diciary Committee, she was eager to talk to the FBI. The ‘‘investigation’’ conducted over the past five days is a stain on the process, on the FBI and on our American ideal of jus-tice. Sincerely, D

HRISTOPHER A. W RAY, Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation, c/o Dana Boente, General Counsel. D
EARDIRECTOR WRAY: My firm represents Deborah Ramirez, as does the law firm of Hutchinson Black and Cook, LLC. As you likely know, a reporter recently reached out to Ms. Ramirez to ask about an incident in-volving Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump’s nominee for the United States Supreme Court. Ms. Ramirez answered the reporter’s questions, and he, after interviewing a num-ber of additional witnesses, wrote a story: https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ senate-democrats-investigate-a-new-allega-tion-of-sexual-misconduct-from-the-su-preme-court-nominee-brett-kavanaughs-col-lege-years-deborah-ramirez. As you likely also are aware, two of your agents met with Ms. Ramirez this past Sun-day, September 30, 2018, in Colorado. Ms. Ra-mirez spoke with the agents for approxi-mately two hours, answering a host of de-tailed questions. Ms. Ramirez offered cred-ible and compelling information—as every-one in the room would acknowledge. Later that day, Ms. Ramirez, through counsel, provided the FBI with a list of more than twenty additional witnesses likely to have relevant information. Ms. Ramirez sus-pected that a number of those individuals could corroborate her account of Mr. Kavanaugh’s behavior. Fewer than four days later, however, the FBI apparently has concluded its investiga-tion—without permitting its agents to inves-tigate. We are deeply disappointed by this failure. We can only conclude that the FBI— or those controlling its investigation—did not want to learn the truth behind Ms. Ra-mirez’s allegations. We know this much, however: If your agents had been permitted to investigate Ms. Ramirez’s allegations, they would have un-covered substantial corroboration. Just last night, The New Yorker published a new arti-cle: https://www.newyorker.com/news/news- desk/will-the-fbi-ignore-testimonies-from- kavanaughs-former-classmates. That article highlights Dr. Kenneth Appold, a professor at the Princeton Theological Seminary. The article reports that, at the time of the rel-evant incident, Dr. Appold was a Yale under-graduate, a resident of the relevant dor-mitory (Lawrence Hall), and a suitemate of Mr. Kavanaugh. The article further reports that Dr. Appold has confirmed that, shortly after the relevant incident occurred, he learned of it, including that Ms. Ramirez was the victim and Mr. Kavanaugh the perpe-trator. Dr. Appold is one of the witnesses that Ms. Ramirez had suggested that the FBI contact; the FBI never did. Dr. Appold apparently himself recounted this incident, years ago, to another indi-vidual, Michael Wetstone. The New Yorker article cited immediately above reports that Mr. Wetstone has confirmed that Dr. Appold in fact relayed the story in late 1980s or early 1990s. Mr. Wetstone is another of the witnesses that Ms. Ramirez had suggested that the FBI contact; the FBI apparently never did. If your agents had been permitted to inves-tigate, they would have uncovered still more corroboration: Dr. Richard Oh is an emergency room doc-tor in Santa Clara, California. He attended Yale for his undergraduate studies, between 1983 and 1987, i.e., at the same time as Ms. Ramirez and Mr. Kavanaugh. He recalls, dur-ing his freshman year at Yale, a female stu-dent ‘‘emotionally reporting’’ what can only have been the same incident as described by Ms. Ramirez. See Decl. of Dr. Richard Oh (Oct. 3, 2018), attached. Dr. Oh is another of the witnesses that Ms. Ramirez had sug-gested that the FBI contact; the FBI never did. There may be many additional witnesses who could offer still further corroboration (if any additional corroboration were needed, which it is not). But we likely never will know, given that your agents were barred from investigating. What we do know, de-spite that lack of investigation, is that mul-tiple witnesses have corroborated Ms. Rami-rez’s allegations. Respectfully, your agents should have been permitted to develop that information. Sincerely, W
ILLIAM PITTARD . 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. R
OUNDS ). The Senator from Maine. Mr. KING. Mr. President, first I want to congratulate and thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his moving and eloquent remarks—so moving and elo-quent, in fact, that I contemplated foregoing my own. The Senator expressed the feelings of many of us, particularly in his closing, which was very powerful, and, I think, very well encapsulated the one possible positive result from this sorry process. I stated my opposition to Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court before Dr. Ford’s alle-gations became public—before I had ever heard about them, before anyone had ever heard about them, as far as I know, except some members of the Ju-diciary Committee. Therefore, I don’t believe you have to believe Dr. Ford to conclude that Judge Kavanaugh should not be ele-vated to the Supreme Court—first, be-cause of his judicial philosophy. If you will pardon me, I want to di-gress for a moment into constitutional history—preconstitutional history, if you will. There is a basic paradox of government. We give power to some-thing called the government in order to protect our security, to protect us as individuals, to protect our liberty. The paradox is that we then have to worry about the government to which we have given the power abusing us. James Madison captured this in the 51st Federalist: If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men— 
And, of course, today Madison would say men and women over men and women— 
the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed, and in the next place oblige it to control itself. 
The Romans put it this way: ‘‘Quis custodiet ipsos custodes.’’ Who will guard the guardians? The other philosopher who talked about this was the English philosopher Lord Acton: ‘‘All power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.’’ The American Constitution, in my view, is the most sublime answer to this ancient question of any instru-ment of government ever formed by people on this Earth. It is based upon a profound understanding of human na-ture: If you give people power, there is the potential for it to be abused—not the potential, the likelihood that it will be abused. So the Constitution is an elaborate scheme for preventing that abuse. The first line of defense is the structure of the government itself. What Madison was talking about was obliging the government to control itself—this herky-jerky, complicated, Rube Gold-berg device involving two Houses, checks and balances, the President, the veto, submitting treaties, two-thirds votes, advise and consent, and then the whole level of the State government and local government, the division of responsibilities between the govern-ments, and enumerated powers. The Framers wanted it to be difficult for majorities to ride roughshod over mi-norities. They wanted it to be difficult to legislate, and they succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. It is a very difficult piece of machin-ery to bring into action, but even after the Framers had designed this elabo-rate structure specifically in the name of protecting the rights of the people, they weren’t satisfied. They wanted to take another step, because going back to our other fundamental document, the Declaration of Independence talks about certain inalienable rights—life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness— and that word ‘‘inalienable’’ isn’t de-fined much. Not much attention is paid

to it. ‘‘Inalienable’’ means neither can you give it away nor can it be taken from you. To alienate is to give away or have it taken from you. That is what ‘‘inalienable rights’’ mean. Going back to when they said we have this elaborate structure that will be very complicated to operate, what if the majority makes this structure work in such a way that is amicable to the fundamental rights of people? The first thing Congress did was to adopt the Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights is the second shield for us as individuals. I always thought of it as a force field around individuals that protects the basic rights, even if the government follows all of the procedures. Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech, establishing re-ligion, or controlling the free exercise thereof. Search and seizure must be reasonable. You don’t have to give tes-timony against yourself. All of these rights in the Bill of Rights are designed to protect us as individuals from the government. The framers then had an interesting problem when they got to the Bill of Rights, and they listed the rights. Somebody—and I can’t remember who it was right now—came up with the problem that if you list the rights, then people will later say: Well those rights are listed. Therefore, there aren’t any other rights that can be pro-tected. So they added the Ninth Amendment, which is one of the most unappreciated and undiscussed amend-ments to the Constitution. The Ninth Amendment says: ‘‘The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.’’ In other words, there are rights that exist—they recognize that—that aren’t the ones listed that we all think of in the First through the Fifth Amend-ment—rights such as freedom of speech, the press, freedom from unrea-sonable searches, the right to bear arms. They were afraid they would ap-pear too exclusive. So they passed as part of the Bill the Rights the Ninth Amendment. What does this have to do with Judge Kavanaugh? To understand Judge Kavanaugh’s jurisprudence, what kind of judge he will be—by the way, that is what we are all doing here. This is an exercise in forecasting the future. What will this person decide? What kind of judge will they be? That in-volves things like demeanor and tem-perament, but it also involves judicial philosophy. To understand the judicial philos-ophy of Judge Kavanaugh, you have to understand the judicial philosophy of Justice William Rehnquist. Judge Kavanaugh has characterized Justice Rehnquist as his judicial hero. He gave a speech about him in 2017. He says that the article in the Texas Law Re-view in 1976 written by Justice Rehnquist is one of the most important legal documents ever written. What do Justice Rehnquist and Jus-tice Kavanaugh have in common? They have a very expansive view of what States can do to limit your rights and a narrow view of what the Federal Gov-ernment can do to protect your health, welfare, the environment—you name it. Justice Rehnquist voted against Roe v. Wade. Justice Rehnquist criticized Griswold v. Connecticut. He voted against Roe v. Wade because he said the right of a woman to control her own reproductive health is not enumer-ated in the Constitution. Obviously, it is not listed in the first two or three Amendments, but the Court found that it was a basic human right of women, and that is the basis of Roe v. Wade. The problem with Justice Rehnquist’s approach and Judge Kavanaugh’s approach to unenumerated rights is that they say unenumerated rights could be recog-nized by the courts only if the asserted right was rooted in the Nation’s his-tory and tradition. That is called originalism, or it is a piece of originalism. In other words, you can’t assert a right unless you can show that the Framers thought about it when they passed the amendments, or that it was somehow rooted in the tradition. If abortion was legal across the country in 1897 or 1867 or 1787, then you couldn’t do it. The Court would be making law. The problem is that this approach freezes rights in history, and it allows no room for the evolution of ethics and morality. A good example is Loving v. Virginia, which is the case that over-turned misogynation laws that made it illegal in many States in the country, including Virginia, at the time—and this was in the 1960s—for people of dif-ferent races to marry one another. It is hard to argue using the Kavanaugh philosophy that that is a legitimate exercise of judicial author-ity because certainly, at the time of the passage of the Bill of Rights and the passage of the 14th Amendment, anti-misogynation laws were all over the place. So Rehnquist and Kavanaugh would say you can’t do that. This isn’t judicial lawmaking. This is judicial protection of individ-uals’ rights from State incursion. In Griswold v. Connecticut, in many ways, Griswold was the case that said the State of Connecticut could not con-stitutionally prohibit the sale of con-traception to married couples. It has been widely criticized in many ways. The Griswold case, I believe, was the founding document of the Federalist Society. It was in reaction to Griswold and the following cases that the Fed-eralist Society arose in the 1980s. So this philosophy is that the States have wide latitude to restrict these rights—enumerated or not. That is why I believe there is—I don’t know—a 50–50 chance, 60–40, or 70–30 that a Justice Kavanaugh would repeal Roe v. Wade. I give it 99 percent that he will gut Roe v. Wade. There are something like 15 cases headed for the Supreme Court right now from various States around the country where the right of a woman to control her reproductive fu-ture is under assault. The decisions may not be an outright repeal, but by piecemeal, chipping away at that right, making it harder and harder to exer-cise Roe v. Wade, it will be a hollow shell. Judge Kavanaugh said in his hearing: I am not going to make these value judgments, ideological judgments. I am going to call balls and strikes like an umpire. I have a new principle for judging Su-preme Court nominees: Anybody who says all they are going to do is call balls and strikes is an automatic no be-cause they are conning us. Deciding whether a particular rule in a State that restricts the ability of a woman to control her reproductive future is un-duly burdensome is not a mechanical ball and strike. It is a value-laden judg-ment call. Don’t tell me there is some easy ball-and-strike thing here. You are making judgment calls based upon values. I don’t have any doubt that a Justice Kavanaugh is going to vote to restrict, to control, to limit, and ultimately, to gut Roe v. Wade. Indeed, that is what the President said he was going to do— to appoint a judge who was going to take that step. That is why he is so widely supported in some parts of the country. By the way, he said Roe v. Wade is a precedent. That is like saying this is a chair. That is a statement of fact. That is not a value. That is not a philos-ophy. That is just a statement of fact. Then he says: Well, we have Planned Parenthood v. Casey. So we have a precedent on a precedent. That is like saying this is a chair and this is a desk. That is a statement of fact. That is not anything that gives you any indication of what he says he is going to do. By the way, Justice Gorsuch sat in my office and talked to me about precedent and how committed he was to precedent. He had written a whole book about precedent. I don’t think he was on the Court even a year, and he voted in the Janus case to absolutely trample 40 years of precedent in a very important area of American law. So when somebody tells me it is a prece-dent or it is settled law, that doesn’t convince me of very much. That is not a predictor of what they will do. He has an expansive view of the State power to restrict individual rights. He has a narrow view of the national legis-lature’s ability to protect individuals, whether it is healthcare, and I will give you 75 percent that he is going to start voting to undercut and destroy the Af-fordable Care Act. In 16 out of 18 cases on the environ-ment that came before his court, the DC Court of Appeals, he voted with the polluters. He narrowed the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency. In one case particularly relevant to my State, he decided against the right of the EPA to tell upwind States they had to control their pollution in order to benefit downwind States. Maine is in

the tailpipe of the Northeast. All the air moves from west to east and ends up in Maine. We could shut off every automobile and every factory in Maine and still have air pollution problems. Telling the EPA they can’t regulate air that moves across State lines is a di-rect shot at the State of Maine. As for campaign finance reform, I predict he will join with the 5-to-4 ma-jority to continue the deregulation of campaign finance, one of the most seri-ous issues facing this country. He even said that net neutrality was unconstitutional because of the right of large internet service providers to have free speech. That is a case that would deny free speech and freedom of activity to millions of internet users across the country. You don’t have to believe Dr. Ford to oppose and believe that Brett Kavanaugh should not be elevated to the Supreme Court. You also don’t have to believe Dr. Ford to believe that Brett Kavanaugh should not be elevated to the Supreme Court because of his views on Presi-dential power, but first let’s establish what he said. In the Minnesota Law Review, he said we should not burden a sitting President with civil suits, criminal investigations, or criminal prosecutions. He has an elaborate argu-ment about that involving impeach-ment and that the Congress should pass a statute and a whole lot of other things. We can argue about that. They are legitimate disputes about the meaning of article III and how it re-lates to impeachment and how it re-lates to the subject of the President being subject to criminal prosecutions. I understand that. I understand we can have those arguments, but once he stated that position, he should have announced that he would recuse him-self from any case involving the Presi-dent who appointed him—the first rule of the judicial canons. Canon No. 2 is that a judge shall avoid not only impropriety but the ap-pearance of impropriety, and 2a, from the Code of Judicial Responsibility says that a ‘‘judge should act at all times in a manner that promotes pub-lic confidence in the integrity and im-partiality of the Judiciary. Let me read that again: ‘‘A judge should act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the Judiciary.’’ The reason for that is obvious. The Judici-ary doesn’t have the power of the purse. It doesn’t have an army. It has to rest on public confidence. He already violated that principle in his testimony to the Judiciary Com-mittee last week. He violated that principle. Imagine the reaction of the public if a newly minted Justice Kavanaugh, within the next couple of years, votes in favor and, indeed, can provide the deciding vote, the swing vote, on a case involving the President who appointed him. I am not saying he can’t take this position ever in his ju-dicial career, but to have not recused himself when he had an opportunity to do so, to announce he would do so, to me, is disqualifying. It is obvious and mandatory that he should not take a position on a case coming before the Court involving the President who ap-pointed him. No. 3, we don’t have to believe Dr. Ford to conclude that Judge Kavanaugh should not be confirmed to a lifetime job because we have been de-nied the ability to learn about his record. Imagine, Mr. President, you are doing a job interview for a very impor-tant job in your company, and a guy comes in and says: I would like this job, and I am going to show you 10 per-cent of my work product. The 10 per-cent that I am going to give you is going to be picked out by an old buddy of mine whom I used to work for. In fact, he used to work for me. Oh, and by the way, once you hire me, you can never fire me; I am there for life. Nobody would take that deal. Any employer in America would laugh at that job applicant. Yet that is exactly what we are doing here this week. We have seen 10 percent of his record in the White House and have been given no reason whatsoever why we can’t see it all. People talk about, oh, we have seen 100,000 pages or 200,000 pages. That is not the point. He has a huge record, so the number of pages isn’t the issue; it is how much of it we have seen as a percentage, and we have seen 10 per-cent of it. If I were on the side of this case pre-paring to vote for this gentleman, I would be terrified about what is going to come out because it is all going to come out. The records of the Bush ad-ministration are going to be available in 2020 under the Presidential Records Act—12 years from the end of the ad-ministration. In 2020, all of these records will come out. In fact, I think they are going to start coming out in the next couple of weeks from the Na-tional Archives. I don’t know what is in those records. There may be noth-ing. The fact that they are being with-held raises my main suspicions. Are they worried that something is in there that will derail this nomination, or do they know it? Asking us to vote on this lifetime ap-pointment, with no do-overs, no amendments, no chances, no repeals, when we haven’t seen the entire record, is beyond me. There is no justification for it. Even if I were inclined to vote yes, I would say: Wait a minute. You can’t ask me to vote for this until I see all his records. We haven’t done it. It is ridiculous. There is no other word for it. No. 4, we don’t have to believe Dr. Ford to conclude Judge Kavanaugh should not be elevated to the Supreme Court because he has demonstrated he lacks the temperament and demeanor to be a Justice of the Supreme Court. First, I think it is only fair to state the standard. What should be the standard for temperament and de-meanor for a judge? Here is the stand-ard, as I have seen it: 
To be a good judge and a good umpire, it’s important to have the proper demeanor. Really important, I think. To walk in the others’ shoes, whether it be the other liti-gants, the litigants in the case, the other judges. To understand them. To keep our emotions in check. To be calm amidst the storm. On the bench, to put it in the vernacular, don’t be a jerk. 
This isn’t me; this is the standard published to show and help display that you are trying to make the decision impartially and dispassionately, based on the law and not based on your emo-tions. Who established that standard? Who wrote it? Brett Kavanaugh. Those are his words from a speech several years ago at Catholic University. Prop-er demeanor. Calm amidst the storm. On the bench, don’t be a jerk. Help dis-play that you are trying to make the decision impartially and dispassion-ately based on the law and not based on your emotions. I don’t see how any-body, with a straight face, can argue that Brett Kavanaugh met that stand-ard last Thursday afternoon. I had an interesting experience that day. I was in a hearing in the afternoon while he was speaking, and there was a television screen in the hearing room, but the sound was off because we were doing other committee work. Every now and then, I could look at the screen, and I could see him. I turned to the person sitting behind me and said: He is coming unhinged. What is going on? What is he saying? He is shouting. You could see it. You could see his face contorted. Then, of course, I saw what he was saying. No one could argue that he demonstrated judicial de-meanor in that hearing. In fact, some-thing like 3,000 law professors, includ-ing 40 from Yale, have come out and said that based on that performance, he should not be confirmed to the Su-preme Court. Justice John Paul Ste-vens, a retired Justice, in an extraor-dinary moment, said: This man should not be confirmed for the Supreme Court. If you were from Mars, Mr. President, or from South Dakota and you knew nothing about the history of this mat-ter, you knew nothing about the docu-ments, the opinions, the philosophy, none of those things, and all you saw was that hearing that afternoon, you would say: This guy has no business anywhere near a courtroom. His defense is, I was angry. I was being charged with something. My fam-ily is being threatened, and I am being threatened. I understand that. All of us have thought about how we would feel if some unjust or untrue charge were made against us, whatever the nature, and a particularly heinous charge was made against him. I understand that he was passionate. But here is what really bothers me: What he said—the con-spiracy, the direct insults to the Demo-cratic Senators, the idea that he was a victim of a smear campaign—he had written down. That wasn’t a sponta-neous outburst—that he was so mad

and caught up in the moment and said something he regretted—it was in writ-ten testimony. He had written it down, his answers to the questions. Back to canon No. 2, avoid anything that would undermine confidence in the judiciary. He actually said, looking at the Democrats, ‘‘What goes around comes around.’’ Everybody knows that is a threat. He was looking at R
ICHARD  B
LUMENTHAL , who is the plaintiff in a case called Blumenthal v. Trump, which is in the Federal district court in Washington and will eventually make its way to the Supreme Court based on the emoluments clause. How can R
ICHARD BLUMENTHAL possibly be-lieve he would get a fair and impartial hearing from somebody who said: ‘‘What goes around comes around’’? That phrase itself should be disquali-fying. Anybody who talks about a po-litical party or a group of people or millions of people or anybody else and says ‘‘What goes around comes around’’—that is disqualifying. I think that based upon judicial phi-losophy, his failure to recuse himself from issues involving the President who appointed him—his refusal to say he will recuse himself in issues involv-ing the President who appointed him, the incredible lack of documentation based upon his record, and his de-meanor last week disqualify him. No, you don’t have to believe Dr. Ford to conclude, as I have, that Judge Kavanaugh should not be elevated to the Supreme Court. Before I close, I should add one note: I do believe Dr. Ford. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Illinois. Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, as I begin speaking tonight, we are less than 24 hours away from handing a seat on the Supreme Court to a man credibly accused of sexual assault—a lifetime appointment that would give him immense power to determine the right of every American to access healthcare, to start or grow a family, or even have access to what the Found-ers called the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. From the beginning, this nomination process has been a sham. The confirma-tion hearing was rushed. Bush- and Trump-era Republicans worked shoul-der to shoulder to ensure that thou-sands of documents never saw the light of day. Questions about Kavanaugh’s seeming habit of perjuring himself only grew by the day. That was all before Dr. Christine Blasey Ford stood up and spoke out, before she took a deep breath and began to relive the worst moment of her life over and over again on the national stage, credibly accus-ing Brett Kavanaugh of pinning her down, covering her mouth, and chang-ing her life forever. Now, even after she has testified about the night she was nearly raped, even after she talked of the memories indelibly etched into her mind and her 100 percent certainty that it was Brett Kavanaugh that night, some on the other side of the aisle have prioritized partisan tribalism over justice, over truth—two of the pillars that sup-posedly define our Supreme Court. How can the FBI investigation be considered anything but a GOP-led sham when Dr. Ford was not even interviewed, when Mr. Kavanaugh him-self wasn’t even questioned or the dozen-plus people Dr. Ford and Debo-rah Ramirez have said could help col-laborate their stories? Why the rush? What are the Repub-licans afraid of? If they are so con-vinced that their nominee is not a se-rial sexual assaulter, why have they done everything in their power to curb and hinder investigations into the inci-dents in question? The Republicans who angrily claimed on TV yesterday that this nomination is taking too long, that the Democrats are obstructing for the sake of ob-structing, are literally the same people who delayed the consideration of Merrick Garland’s nomination for 293 days simply because he was nominated by President Obama. For the chairman to claim that this nomination has gone on longer than the ‘‘average’’ Supreme Court nomina-tion ignores the reality that their nominee, who has been credibly ac-cused of multiple sexual assaults, is being jammed through at lightning speed compared to the only other nom-ination he has ever overseen as chair-man—Merrick Garland. To Leader M
CCONNELL , Chairman G
RASSLEY , and my Republican col-leagues, I warn you, history has its eyes on you. I beg you to slow down and consider the stakes of this debate. Like Neil Gorsuch just a year ago, there are countless other conservatives scattered throughout the Federal judi-ciary who could be confirmed instead of Judge Kavanaugh, potential nomi-nees with zero credible allegations of sexual assault, who are willing to re-lease their records, who are capable of demonstrating the thoughtful, careful temperament we should demand from any possible Supreme Court Justice. As a nominee, Kavanaugh brought his confirmation hearings two things: his record and his character. His record revealed that he would eagerly be the deciding vote in cases that would take away a woman’s right to make her own healthcare decisions, tear healthcare away from millions of Americans with preexisting conditions, and even em-power this President to act as though he were above the law. Equally important, his character can be summed up in just a few words: un-truthful, dishonest, intemperate, and unfit to serve. Anyone who watched the Judiciary Committee hearing last Thursday should have serious, if not disqualifying, doubts about Brett Kavanaugh. He spewed out conspiracy theories about the Clintons, went on partisan rants, appearing belligerent and outraged that anyone would dare keep him from getting what he appears to feel entitled to. He shouted over Senators, attacked and insulted them personally, even pledged to exact re-venge on his political adversaries. Only a man who has never served in harm’s way would dare complain that tough questioning was equivalent to his enemies trying to ‘‘blow him up.’’ Judge Kavanaugh, I have been on the receiving end of an RPG blast, so I can tell you that sitting in a fancy, air- conditioned hearing room with a nice glass of ice water for a few hours is nothing at all like being under attack in the desert and fearing for your life in the middle of a war zone. Over and over again, he told what seemed to be bald-faced lies. He lied about the meaning of his yearbook page, about whether he had any pos-sible memory loss or had ever become aggressive while drinking, about what he knew at age 53 and what he did at age 17. Sadly, we shouldn’t even be sur-prised. Kavanaugh has a habit of ap-pearing to lie under oath. Over the years, he has dissembled and been dis-honest under oath on a number of issues, including his role in developing the Bush administration’s policies on torture. This consistent dishonesty, this dis-regard, even distaste for the truth should be disqualifying for any Su-preme Court nominee, but my col-leagues on the other side of the aisle are turning a blind eye, seemingly not bothered one bit by his dishonesty, much less the credible allegations of sexual assault against him. Today is the 1-year anniversary of the New Yorker’s Harvey Weinstein story that broke open the #MeToo movement. Now, exactly 365 days later, we in the Senate are faced with a choice: Do we believe the survivors who come forward to tell their stories, or would we rather take the easy route, dismissing their claims as misguided or mixed up, as one of my colleagues put it, ignoring their claims, ignoring their pain? Well, I, for one, believe Dr. Ford and Deborah Ramirez. ‘‘Courage’’ is the word that comes to mind when I think of these women. They didn’t ask for this burden. They did not want this spotlight or the death threats and fear that have come right along with it. They have put country before self and have spoken out anyway, knowing full well that some would vilify them for doing so. Take a moment to imagine what they have gone through. Imagine being a teenage girl alone and scared, out-numbered and overpowered and terri-fied. Imagine carrying that trauma with you every day for decades, then having to relive it in front of the entire country, and then being called a liar, having your life threatened, and being victimized all over again in the proc-ess. It now rests on the U.S. Senate to lis-ten. We must set an example for the rest of the country and avoid repeating

the sins of confirmations past. We must condemn efforts to shame sur-vivors even when—especially when it is the President himself doing the bul-lying. By refusing to confirm Brett Kavanaugh, we can send the message that victims of sexual assault matter, that their voices will be heard, and that seeking justice for these survivors is more important than the confirma-tion of any single individual. We can recognize the bravery it took for these women to speak out. Doing so would make clear that, at least in the U.S. Senate, if not in the White House, time is truly up for any judicial nominee credibly accused of sexual assault. Doing so would at least begin to re-store integrity to how the Senate car-ries out its constitutional responsi-bility to provide advice and consent. To any of my colleagues considering voting yes on this nominee, please take just a few minutes to listen again to the opening words of Dr. Ford last Thursday. Hear the pain in her words, the truth in her voice. I will be voting no on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination. On behalf of Dr. Ford and survivors everywhere, I am begging—begging—each of my col-leagues to do the same. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from New Hampshire. Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator D
UCKWORTH and Senator K
INGand so many of my colleagues in opposing Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court. One of the most solemn responsibil-ities of a U.S. Senator is providing ad-vice and consent upon the President’s nominating an individual to the Su-preme Court. This is a duty and a deci-sion that I do not take lightly. This is a lifetime appointment to the highest Court in our land, which will impact the lives of every single person in this country. Supreme Court Justice is not a posi-tion that any person is entitled to. Any individual nominated to the Court must be subject to security on the to-tality of their record, their tempera-ment, and their past actions. Yet, throughout the process of this nomination, my colleagues in the ma-jority have made clear that they will stop at nothing to get Judge Kavanaugh on the Court, no matter his record, no matter his temperament, no matter his character. When Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s se-rious and credible allegations came to light, we saw a truly disturbing scene from both Judge Kavanaugh and my colleagues on the other side of this aisle. Judge Kavanaugh himself lashed out, claiming a political conspiracy against him, refusing to answer ques-tions, and seemingly threatening those who raised serious, good-faith ques-tions about his fitness. He said these words: ‘‘What goes around, comes around.’’ His behavior and his words re-flected a partisan who sees those with whom he differs as enemies, not oppo-nents. While many of my colleagues in the majority praise Dr. Ford’s bravery in sharing her story, and even agreed that her testimony was credible, they blocked any serious professional at-tempt to get to the facts. I want to take a minute here to ad-dress one of the most disingenuous claims I have heard from the majority when it talks about Dr. Blasey Ford. Over the last week, Members on the other side of the aisle have expressed concern and regret that Dr. Blasey Ford’s letter outlining her allegations was leaked, forcing her story into pub-lic view. But the fact that Dr. Blasey Ford didn’t choose if and when to re-veal her allegation to the public does not relieve the U.S. Senate of its duty to pursue the truth or to treat Dr. Blasey Ford with the respect and com-passion the majority says it feels for her, something it could simply dem-onstrate by acceding to her request for what normally happens after a report of sexual assault: a full investigation before the hearing. I, too, will note that I watched and listened to Dr. Blasey Ford’s testi-mony. I considered the additional evi-dence that would have particular weight in a court of law of her corrobo-rating statements well prior to any suggestion that Brett Kavanaugh would ever be nominated to the Su-preme Court of the United States. I compared her testimony to that of Judge Kavanaugh, and I believe Dr. Blasey Ford. Even though the committee rejected the doctor’s request for an investiga-tion prior to the hearing, which would have been normal course, which would have produced a much more meaning-ful and insightful and fact-based hear-ing, I was hopeful when it was an-nounced last week that the nomination process would be paused for the FBI to investigate Dr. Blasey Ford’s allega-tions. I was so hopeful that there would be a thorough, intensive process in order to get to the truth. But after reading the FBI report that was presented to Senators, it is clear that the FBI was not allowed to con-duct a serious investigation. I am an attorney, and I have to say that any good attorney allowed to read the FBI’s supplemental background in-vestigation—what we have been calling the report here—would tell you that it is not the type of comprehensive inves-tigation that could lead to the truth. The limited scope of the investigation produced a sham. Let me be clear. Nothing in the FBI report exonerated Judge Kavanaugh. It wasn’t comprehensive enough to prove or disprove Dr. Blasey Ford’s allega-tions or Judge Kavanaugh’s denials. It was clearly designed just to provide cover so that the majority could vote yes and jam this nomination through. Even before Dr. Ford bravely stepped forward with her allegations of sexual assault, I had concluded that Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination should not go forward, that Judge Kavanaugh did not belong on the Supreme Court of the United States. Having reviewed his record and hear-ing his testimony before the Senate Ju-diciary Committee, it is evident that he does not have the impartiality that is required to serve on the Supreme Court. His record shows that he is a partisan who promotes a partisan rightwing ideology deeply at odds with the will of the American people. On issue after issue, Judge Kavanaugh has promoted a judicial philosophy that diminishes the rights of individuals, particularly women, and puts corporations before people. On healthcare, Judge Kavanaugh’s agenda has been clear. As recently as October 2017, Judge Kavanaugh criti-cized Chief Justice Roberts’ decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act. In his confirmation hearing, Judge Kavanaugh would not commit to up-holding protections for people who have preexisting conditions, such as asthma, cancer, diabetes, and more. The Trump administration and the majority in Congress have been relent-less in their attempts to sabotage our healthcare system, underscoring the need to have a Supreme Court that would rise above partisanship, but Judge Kavanaugh will not do that. On the issue of reproductive rights and a woman’s right to chart her own destiny, Judge Kavanaugh has repeat-edly tried to dodge and mislead, but none of his judicial opinions or com-ments indicate that he believes Roe v. Wade was rightly decided or that he would respect Roe’s precedent if he had the opportunity to do so. With Judge Kavanaugh on the Bench, Roe and the personal, economic, and reproductive freedom that it has deliv-ered to women is directly threatened. When it comes to checks and bal-ances on the President’s power, Judge Kavanaugh’s record and opinions are also extremely concerning, particu-larly given that a clear pattern of criminality continues to emerge from the Mueller investigation. Judge Kavanaugh has a history of supporting an unchecked Presidency. He has written that Presidents should be essentially above the law by claim-ing that they should not be the subject of civil lawsuits, criminal prosecu-tions, or even criminal investigations. During his hearing, Judge Kavanaugh refused to commit to recusing himself from matters involving investigations of the very President who nominated him. Especially at a time like this, it is too dangerous to place a Justice on the Supreme Court who believes in vir-tually no checks on a President’s power, but it appears that the majority is committed to doing just that. This nomination has been an out-rage, and the way it has been handled is a failure of this institution. The ma-jority has put the interests of its party and a nominee who has made clear he will serve those interests before the in-terests of the court and the country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6619 October 5, 2018 
The nominee, who will apparently— given today’s developments—be con-firmed tomorrow, is without the char-acter or temperament needed to serve on the Supreme Court without the credibility that the American people deserve. He is, in fact, the antithesis of that impartial arbiter that a Supreme Court Justice has to be. The people of New Hampshire deserve better. The people of the United States of America deserve better. That is why I will be voting no on Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination tomorrow, and I would urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Utah. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I come be-fore this body this evening after having heard several remarks from a number of my distinguished colleagues, whom I like, whom I respect, whom I admire, and with whom I greatly and substan-tially disagree on many matters dis-cussed tonight. Just in the last little while I have heard arguments presented first by the Senator from Maine, a good friend of mine, who made some arguments that he put into roughly four categories. He opposes Judge Kavanaugh on the basis of judicial philosophy, on the basis of his refusal to agree anticipatorily to certain types of recusals, to the ab-sence of documentation he claims was available to the committee, and to Judge Kavanaugh on issues of de-meanor. I would like to address each of these allegations in turn. First, with regard to judicial philos-ophy, my friend from Maine—who truly is a friend—explained that, in his view, Judge Kavanaugh was unacceptable be-cause, among other things, he counts among those he admires, among his ju-dicial role models, the late William Rehnquist, Chief Justice of the United States. The reason that is apparently a bad thing, according to my colleague from Maine, is that this somehow indi-cates that he would view himself sort of as an umpire, calling the balls and the strikes, reading the law on the basis of what it says rather than on the basis of what he or anyone else might wish were the law. Jurists, you see, are not philosopher kings, not even when they get onto the Supreme Court of the United States. They are not there to impose will but judgment. You see, as Alexander Hamilton ex-plained in Federalist 78, there is a dif-ference between the type of govern-ment activity that goes on in the judi-ciary and the type of government ac-tivity that goes on in the legislative branch. In the judiciary, they exercise judgment; that is, they read the law. They figure out what the law says. When two or more parties come before the court’s proper jurisdiction, they in-terpret the law on the basis of what the law says. That, Hamilton explains, is judgment. Will, on the other hand, is deciding what the law should say, what policies are best for the U.S. Government. That is the prerogative of this branch. That is the prerogative of the political arms of the Federal Government. That is not the prerogative of our friends across the street who wear black robes. So I was surprised to hear that my colleague from Maine, the junior Sen-ator from Maine, Mr. K
ING, was saying that he objects to the judicial philos-ophy of Judge Kavanaugh on the basis that he says he would call the balls and strikes as he sees them. It seems to me that this is the essence of what Fed-eralist 78 was talking about, about the difference between will and judgment. Hamilton explained that if ever the judiciary started exercising will in-stead of judgment, it would upend the entire constitutional order. That, we cannot have. That is not how it should be. Next my colleague from Maine went on to explain that Judge Kavanaugh’s association with the Federalist Society was somehow a problem, that the Fed-eralist Society is somehow some sort of demonic conspiracy to overthrow the U.S. Government—or something to that effect. I embellished slightly his characterization of it, but you would think from what some of my colleagues say about the Federalist Society that there is something terribly wrong with it. Let me tell you about the Federalist Society. I have been aware of the Federalist Society for most of my life. I attended my first Federalist Society event while I was still in high school. I mean, what teenager doesn’t want to attend a Fed-eralist Society event at a nearby law school? That was something we consid-ered to be a lot of fun in Provo, UT. At every Federalist Society event that I have ever attended, starting when I was in high school, all the way through college, through law school, throughout my career as an attorney, and since then in my career in politics, one thing has been consistent: The Federalist Society, when it puts on an event, allows for all sides to be rep-resented. You will see views that are widely divergent. You have people, such as Nadine Strossen, former presi-dent of the American Civil Liberties Union, who have long been affiliated with the Federalist Society and par-ticipated in their symposium. This, you see, makes the Federalist Society rather unlike most American law school experiences, wherein one side is presented—not both. The Federalist Society prides itself in focusing on open, robust, honest debate. So if some people want to criticize the Federalist Society or those who, heaven forbid, have ever attended a Federalist Society event, what they are doing is criticizing academic free-dom, criticizing a robust discussion of law and public policy. We should all be grateful for the Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies. This is an enterprise that really represents the core of what the American people should value—certainly what those who study and admire and respect the law should value. This is not some-thing people should be criticized for participating in. Last I checked, aca-demic freedom and robust discussion of what the law says and which branch of government ought to exercise will and which ought to exercise judgment— that is something to be rewarded. That is part of America’s bedrock. Its core institutions of civil society are people who are willing to come together, not under the auspices of government, not under the control of some bureau or bureaucracy, but rather on their own to discuss and debate things that will inure ultimately to the benefit of the people. Next, my colleague from Maine, Sen-ator K
ING, referred to Judge Kavanaugh’s refusal to agree anticipatorily to a recusal in certain cases. As Judge Kavanaugh very capa-bly explained in his hearing, this is not the kind of judgment a person makes before taking the Bench, before assum-ing a particular judicial office to which he or she has been nominated. It wouldn’t be appropriate for him to anticipatorily agree to recuse himself in a type of case that he has even yet to see. I am not sure why some of my col-leagues wanted to put him on the record as taking himself off of a cer-tain broad category of cases, but that, nonetheless, seems to be what they were after. That, in most cir-cumstances, is improper, just as it would be improper to get Judge Kavanaugh to agree in advance of his confirmation as to how he would vote in a particular type of case. This, too, many of my colleagues find troubling, by the way; yet this, too, is part of the canons of judicial ethics. We don’t want people campaigning as if on political issues to get onto the Su-preme Court of the United States. We will get back to that a little bit more later. Next, Senator K
INGreferred to the supposed lack of documentation from the Bush administration where Judge Kavanaugh worked—the lack of docu-mentation, meaning the lack of docu-ments coming out of the White House. It is important to know that Judge Kavanaugh doesn’t own the documents in question. No, those are owned by the Bush administration. They own the privilege, and under the Presidential Records Act, which Congress itself has enacted, there are terms set. There are agents identified, agents who get to as-sert certain privileges and decide when, whether, and to what extent certain documents will be released and avail-able for our review. I am not sure what it is that they are so terrified might be out there, but whatever it is, it is in a document that doesn’t belong to us, a document to which we have no access, to which we have no rightful claim, but a document that in all events is not Judge Kavanaugh’s call. It is not his call to decide what happens to those documents—when, whether, under

what circumstances we receive them. It is not his fault. It is not under his control. He has no say on that. Do not hold that on his head. That is not his burden. Then my colleague from Maine went on to address Judge Kavanaugh’s de-meanor. Senator K
INGis not a member of the Judiciary Committee. I am. Sen-ator K
INGacknowledged to have viewed some of the hearings from a television while in other parts of the Capitol Complex, sometimes with the volume on, sometimes with it off. He said something to the effect that if he were watching from another planet, he would conclude that this man is not fit for office. Maybe he wasn’t watching the same hearing I was, but I know one thing: Senator K
ING wasn’t in that room; I was. Let me tell you what I saw. I saw a man who has devoted most of his adult professional career to public service; a man who volunteers his time to feed the hungry, the homeless; who coaches his girls’ basketball team, which he has done for a very long time; who teaches; and who supervises those whom he employs. His law clerks over the last 12 years—by the way, men and women of every background in the United States—rave about him, call him the kind of boss that every American would want to have, that every young lawyer would dream of working for, for the simple opportunity of learning under his tutelage, for the opportunity of serving in a judicial apprenticeship of sorts under a true master of the law. I don’t know what Senator K
INGwas referring to, but he wasn’t in that same hearing I was. He certainly didn’t see the same thing I saw, which is someone who was seeking sincerely to defend his own record of public service and his own private conduct against great ad-versity, moreover, in circumstances in which he and his family have been dragged through the mud by no choice of their own. As to the suggestion that he was somehow leveling a threat when he ut-tered the words ‘‘what goes around comes around,’’ I was in that room. I understood that to mean one thing and one thing only, which is to say that when we mess with the process, that process might well remain messed up. That is all he meant. He was not mak-ing any threat. That was apparent to anyone watching that meeting with anything approaching an open mind. Anyone watching that with an open mind would have understood what that meant in context. He was simply stat-ing the obvious: When we allow politics to come into play excessively in the process of naming and confirming peo-ple to the Supreme Court of the United States, it messes it up. It messes it up now and messes it up for the future. We should all be concerned about that. I also heard comments from my col-league, the distinguished junior Sen-ator from Illinois. She said, among other things, that the investigation conducted into allegations involving Judge Kavanaugh were ‘‘a sham.’’ A sham. Think about what that means. It means that she is suggesting that those investigating didn’t want to get to the truth. I don’t know what documents she has reviewed, but I can tell you the docu-ments that I have reviewed. Those compiled by the Federal Bureau of In-vestigation and those compiled by the very faithful investigative staff on the Senate Judiciary Committee were thorough. We are talking about hun-dreds of pages of transcripts, to say nothing of the more than 30 hours of testimony provided by Judge Kavanaugh himself before the Senate Judiciary Committee. We have been thorough in what we have gone through, and to call this a sham is sim-ply disingenuous. It is inaccurate. It is inconsistent with anything I have seen. I heard my colleague from Illinois also refer to what she characterized as untrue statements made by Judge Kavanaugh in connection with Judge Kavanaugh’s alleged participation in the development of the so-called tor-ture policies in the Bush administra-tion. As has been stated over and over again by Judge Kavanaugh and those who worked with him, he wasn’t even cleared, didn’t even have access to that program, was not involved in that pro-gram’s creation. The documents to which they refer in claiming otherwise show only that he was asked about cer-tain arguments that may be presented in court, which is completely different from the question they are talking about—whether he had anything to do with the development, the design, the creation of that program, which he did not. So to say that he lied about that is completely dishonest, it is not borne out by the facts, and I find it shameful that this accusation would be made. It is completely contrary to the evidence. Next, my colleague from Illinois re-ferred to concerns about what she re-ferred to as healthcare outcomes—out-comes in particular cases involving healthcare. She went on to extol the virtues of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare, and spoke at length as if to suggest that Judge Kavanaugh were being considered not for a judicial posi-tion but a position involving law-making, policy-setting. He has, after all, been nominated to a position of As-sociate Justice of the Supreme Court, not policymaker. His exercise of judg-ment, of interpreting the law based on what it says rather than on the basis of what he wishes it said, is his role. It is unfair to compare him to another standard. Moreover, if we are going to compare him to that standard, she has to ac-knowledge that when we are talking about the Affordable Care Act, he actu-ally wrote an opinion upholding it. That is beside the point here, but if she is questioning his judgment and his ability to handle the law and apply the law on the basis of how he views the law and to do so objectively, she ought not to be concerned. If she is concerned about the out-come of cases relating to the Afford-able Care Act—which I don’t think she should be—as separate and apart from the judgment part of his role, then she ought to be consoled by the ruling that he made upholding the Patient Protec-tion and Affordable Care Act. In any event, it is simply not fair to compare him to this standard and to say that because they fear—because my colleagues fear that he might reach a different policy outcome than she might prefer, she is attributing to him political views that he doesn’t have, that he isn’t allowed to have as a ju-rist, and that he has not expressed. If you can point to any one of his 300 written published opinions in the Fed-eral reports, bring them to me—any one of those that suggest that he is in-capable of being impartial in healthcare or in any other arena, please bring them to me. I would love to see them. Yet they can’t, they won’t, and they haven’t, because such opinions do not exist. That is why they resorted to other things. That is why they are talking about policy. That is why they are trying to smear this man’s character and destroy his good name, because they have looked through those opinions, and they can’t find a dud among them. My colleague, the distinguished Sen-ator from New Hampshire, also spoke. She regretted the fact that, in her view, there hadn’t been a full inves-tigation into the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh and suggested that additional evidence would have been helpful and that additional evidence exists corroborating the allegations made against him. Well, having reviewed hundreds and hundreds of pages of transcripts of interviews resulting from the FBI in-vestigation and from our competent Judiciary Committee staff, I don’t know what she is talking about be-cause the only potential corroborators in this case—that is, the alleged eye witnesses to the accusations in ques-tion—those allegedly present in the circumstances in question, say that they can’t remember any instance in which anything like this happened— not just the underlying bad acts them-selves as alleged but the events in which they allegedly occurred. That is what we call corroboration. You can-not have a statement you describe as corroborating unless there is someone who at the time saw or heard or was otherwise made aware of something at or around the time it occurred. That is what corroborating evidence is, and that is what is noticeably absent in this case. She also claimed that the FBI was not allowed to conduct a serious inves-tigation. I do not know what she means. What I do know is that what the FBI was asked to do involved con-ducting a supplemental investigation

into current credible allegations of sex-ual misconduct, and that is what they did. We, the Senate Judiciary Com-mittee, didn’t put guardrails around that, didn’t tell them they couldn’t fol-low up on leads they deemed signifi-cant, didn’t tell them they couldn’t look past a certain witness, didn’t tell them they couldn’t follow up on some-thing that might shed light on this candidate’s credibility or his eligibility to serve in judicial office. That leads to another point. This man has now endured 7 FBI back-ground investigations, with over 150 people interviewed during that time— 150 people interviewed extensively about what they know about him and about what they know about his char-acter. Those interviews and the report that was produced back up this man’s character. And separate and apart from the fact that there is no corroborating evidence for these allegations, these independently backed him up. My colleague from New Hampshire, like my colleague from Illinois, also brought up the Affordable Care Act, as if assuming from the outset that, on the basis of policy, Judge Kavanaugh would rule a certain way in this or that aspect of anything having to do with healthcare. Here again, we have char-acterizations that would be much more fitting in a political debate for a polit-ical office, but, alas, that is not what we have here. My colleague from New Hampshire referred to the Mueller investigation. I don’t know how that is tied to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, but some-how she tried to make that an issue. I don’t know what she is talking about. I don’t know how that could possibly be relevant here. She made the argument—the very se-rious accusation—that Judge Kavanaugh somehow believes that the President of the United States is above the law. I challenge my colleague from New Hampshire to tell me what evi-dence she has that he believes that. This is a serious accusation and one that should not be made lightly. I have never ever heard of Judge Kavanaugh having said or written any-thing suggesting that the President of the United States is above the law. Yes, Judge Kavanaugh acknowledged, as he has repeatedly on a number of oc-casions in a number of settings, that there is a dispute among scholars as to the timing and manner of liability that might be faced by a current sitting President of the United States, but he has never said the President of the United States is above the law— never—never hinted at it, never con-cluded that, and it is therefore unfair to attribute that view to him. Finally, my colleague from New Hampshire characterized Judge Kavanaugh as being someone who is without character and sort of the an-tithesis of being an impartial arbiter. I think the very best way we can view that with regard to his character is through his life of public service, through the way he has interacted with those he knows, those who have truly known him not just over the last 36 years but for his entire lifetime. The best we can evaluate his ability to be an impartial arbiter is to review the 300 published opinions he has writ-ten while serving as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. I challenge any one of my colleagues to bring me any one of those opinions or any combination of those opinions that show that he is incapable of being im-partial or that he is in any way chal-lenged as to impartiality. They can’t do it. They won’t do it. They haven’t done it because such opinions don’t exist. Judge Kavanaugh is a good man. He is eminently qualified to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States. I endorse President Trump’s nomination of him. I was pleased to vote in favor of cloture, and I look forward to voting for his confirmation in the coming hours. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Connecticut. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Thank you, Mr. President. At some point during the confirma-tion hearing—now seemingly years ago but probably only just a month or so ago—I saw young women going through the halls of the Capitol with T-shirts that said ‘‘I am what’s at stake.’’ I want to thank those young women and all of the countless women and men of all ages who have come to our Nation’s Capital to show us what democracy looks like. I know that some of my colleagues have been displeased—in fact, have called it mob rule—but the power and force of democracy within those voices and faces—a lot of them were from Connecticut, and I am proud of your coming here to tell us what you think both for and against this nomination. That is what democracy looks like. When we reject the voices and faces of democracy coming to tell us their truth, we lose something very precious. It is of equal importance to the town-halls and the meetings and parades and all we do at home. I do a lot of it at home, but I was proud of the folks from Connecticut who came here and the folks who came from all over the coun-try from as far away as Alaska and Ha-waii to give us the benefit of their in-sight and perspective. ‘‘I am what’s at stake’’ is the message those women were conveying to us in real time. We talk here in words. Sometimes we hold up posters. We talk in abstract; that is, the legal parlance of the courts and our legislature. But our decisions have real-life consequences, and the ap-pointment of Brett Kavanaugh and the confirmation that likely will take place tomorrow will affect real people in real time for generations to come because it is for a lifetime. The courts are among the most anti- democratic institutions in our country, the greatest democracy in the world and the most enduring of any democ-racy. They are lifetime appointments. They are insulated generally from at-tack or even criticism because folks who criticize a judge in his or her pres-ence can be held in contempt. They have powers to punish contempt by im-mediately jailing someone. They are anti-democratic so long as they fail to reflect the will of the people if there are excesses, if the nomination and confirmation process goes off the rails. And that is what is happening here—a broken promise and process that has caused a rush to judgment simply for the sake of arbitrary deadlines and ir-rational timelines placed on a nomina-tion that is fundamentally flawed. A lot of my colleagues have relied on personal assurances from Brett Kavanaugh in their chambers. He talked to me an hour, and he assured me, I heard my colleagues say. He as-sured me that he will not overturn Roe v. Wade, but his answers to us under oath on those topics were evasive and misleading. When I asked him, for example, in our hearings about Roe v. Wade, he re-peated the vague commitment to set-tled precedent, but he couldn’t explain why he referred to that precedent in his Garza dissent as ‘‘existing prece-dent.’’ It would be like introducing your wife as ‘‘my current wife.’’ How long do you think that wife is going to be around? He referred to abortion-on-demand. These kinds of code words sent a signal to the Federalist Society and the Her-itage Foundation, and they were the direct cause—or at least one of them— for his being on the President’s short list after he hadn’t been on it before he issued that dissent. Looking to what he has actually written and said is a much keener, more reliable insight into what he will do, more than personal assurances. His writings indicate that he be-lieves, in effect, in a President who can refuse to enforce the Affordable Care Act simply because he deems it uncon-stitutional. He concludes, in his vision of the Constitution and his interpreta-tion of the statute, that they are in conflict, even after the Supreme Court of the United States upholds it and a prior President signs the law and a Congress passes it. That kind of monarchial power is an anathema to our constitutional sense of checks and balances, and the result could well be—in fact, likely will be— that millions of Americans will be de-prived of protections when they suffer from diabetes and heart disease, Par-kinson’s, high blood pressure, preg-nancy—the preexisting conditions for which the Affordable Care Act was de-signed to afford people protections in insurance.

right of people across America to de-cide when they want to marry the per-son they love, consumer rights, work-ers’ rights, environmental protection— all are at stake to real people in their real lives for generations to come. ‘‘I am what is at stake’’ applies to every American. I have never been angrier or sadder since coming to the Senate. This nomi-nation was essentially the result of a rush to judgment and of a coverup, starting with the concealment of mil-lions of pages of documents. Those doc-uments are in the National Archives. They belong to the people of the United States, but the White House chose to hide them. Then, there was a straitjacketed sham of an investigation into sexual assault—yes, a sham; really, a white-wash—that refused to interview dozens of witnesses, some of them eye-witnesses who could corroborate the credible and powerful allegations made by sexual assault survivors. My office spoke directly to Kerry Berchem. There is a more recent report out tonight—an excellent report by NBC—about how she and others tried to be interviewed. They sought and be-seeched the FBI to talk to them, but the FBI was given a list because the purpose of that investigation was not to find the facts. It was to offer cover. It was to permit our colleagues to say there has been a seventh investigation. Have my colleagues read those six in-vestigations? Do they understand that the general practice—we can’t talk about the details on the floor, of course—of the FBI is to begin at age 18, not before? Do they understand that the general practice of an FBI back-ground investigation is to interview professional colleagues, coworkers, su-pervisors, and references that are sug-gested by the nominee to any par-ticular position? The seventh investigation was really the crucial one regarding those allega-tions of an individual 17 years old or even 18, in college, where there was no reason in those earlier six investiga-tions to go back. The FBI was straitjacketed, and that is a disservice to the U.S. Supreme Court, to the Sen-ate in our constitutional responsi-bility, to the people of the United States, and, ultimately, to Brett Kavanaugh, himself, because these al-legations will not be going away any time soon. They will hang over him and the Court as a cloud and a stain for years and years to come. Facts and evi-dence have a really powerful way of coming out. Eventually, facts and evi-dence have a way of finding a way to the public realm. From the beginning, this nomination has been a crucial test for the Senate and for the Nation, but this fight is about more than just this Supreme Court seat. It is about a courageous and credible sexual assault survivor who came forward. Actually, she ex-pressed concerns to friends before the nomination was made about Brett Kavanaugh’s possible nomination. She recounted her story years before even the seat opened, as documented by her therapist’s notes and her husband, who, by the way, was never interviewed. Her husband was never interviewed. Talk about corroborating witnesses. Her therapist’s notes were never reviewed, and she herself was never interviewed by the FBI. That is an absence of fact-finding. And, of course, Judge Kavanaugh was never interviewed, as well. She came forward to say she was sex-ually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh, and the details of her claim were lack-ing in some part. She was frank to admit that she couldn’t remember ev-erything, which is not atypical of sex-ual assault survivors, as the experts would have told the FBI if they had interviewed some experts. But she could remember some parts of that story, and they are details that I will never forget: the laughter from Brett Kavanaugh and Mark Judge, the third person she knew to be in that room— the laughter at her expense. The mock-ing and ridiculing laughter are so vivid in her memory. It is the same mocking and ridiculing laughter that we heard at some of the rallies where the Presi-dent mocked and ridiculed her—the same mocking and ridiculing that, for decades, have been applied to survivors of sexual assault who come forward. She has endured the same nightmare of public shaming and character assas-sination and threats—potential retalia-tion that all too often has silenced sex-ual assault survivors. She braved that nightmare, knowing full well what was coming, but maybe she thought it would not come from Members of the Senate. Maybe she had that naive hope, and if she had it, she was wrong. Our colleagues here said she was mixed up. They said they believe her, they find her credible, but she must be wrong about the identity of the person who attacked her. Well, that echos to the second point that rung true and vividly in her testimony when she was asked: Could it be mistaken identity? Absolutely not. Was she sure it was Brett Kavanaugh? 100 percent sure. I have a message for my Republican colleagues: You can’t believe the sur-vivors only when they say what you want to hear. You can’t believe the survivors for only those parts of the story that are comfortable and conven-ient. You can’t believe them only when they tell you how they have been hurt, horrifically harmed, but not the person who harmed them and hurt them. And you can’t believe them if you reject the possibility of a thorough, complete, fair, and impartial investigation into all of the facts and the evidence. My Republican colleagues say they would like to believe Dr. Blasey Ford and they would like to believe Deborah Ramirez, but there is no corroborating evidence. You cannot believe survivors without seeking the corroborating evi-dence. You cannot believe them if you turn a blind eye to witnesses who come forward and not only are willing but, actually, in effect, pound at the FBI’s door. I reviewed those interviews with the people who were on the list that the FBI permitted to be interviewed, but I have also reviewed the mounds of tip line records. I don’t know how many of my colleagues have done so. They are fascinating and illuminating and pro-foundly revealing because there are ac-tually tips from people who came for-ward and had a personal connection to the events of interest. Of course, I am barred from providing details, but none of them were contacted or interviewed. That is not an investigation. That is not an investigation by the FBI worthy of the FBI’s name. I offer no criticism of the FBI be-cause they were, in effect, narrowly circumscribed, limited, straitjacketed, handcuffed by someone in the adminis-tration. We need to find out who it was and how it was done. Both women of-fered evidence of the kind that is rou-tinely offered in sexual assault cases. They can prove that they told others about their experiences long before the current nomination fight. Christine Ford had a polygraph test and thera-pist notes. And both women can point to a history of Brett Kavanaugh acting inappropriately when drunk. What my Republican colleagues apparently mean when they say there are no cor-roborating witnesses is that none were permitted to tell their story to the FBI, not that they weren’t available. I would like to say that this ap-proach to sexual assault survivors is a thing of the past, a throwback to some other time, but the fact is that it re-mains real in the lives of survivors around this country today. They should know that we are going to stand with them, that this example of, in ef-fect, failing a proper and complete im-partial investigation is far from ac-ceptable to us. I want to make a commitment to my colleagues and the public that I will continue fighting to find the facts. The American people deserve to know why the FBI failed to complete a full inves-tigation of these powerful and credible allegations. They deserve a full under-standing of what the investigation would have found. They deserve full ac-cess to Judge Kavanaugh’s record— those millions of pages of documents that were concealed and that raise the question: What are they hiding? What are they afraid of the American people seeing from the time that Brett Kavanaugh served in the White House as Staff Secretary? I filed an FOIA suit to force disclo-sure of millions of pages of Judge Kavanaugh’s documents that have been hidden from the country. The majority leader chose to vote without seeing those documents, but I have no inten-tion of stopping in this effort until they have been disclosed—and they will be. They will come out, adding to the cloud and the stain.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6623 October 5, 2018 
The allegations here are desperately serious. They are credible and power-ful, and our job was to make sure that the facts and the evidence either sup-ported them or not. Debates over the Supreme Court often focus on civil rights and civil lib-erties, those protections enshrined in the first 10 Amendments to the Con-stitution. Make no mistake. Those rights and liberties are at stake here. But this Supreme Court debate is also about the fight between powerful cor-porate interests and ordinary Ameri-cans. Corporations have become adept at using the courts when their argu-ments fail to persuade policymakers and the American people. When the EPA bans polluters from spewing poison into the environment, polluters go to court to stop that Agen-cy. When the FCC prevents cable giants from censoring the internet, those companies go to court to stop that en-forcement. When the Labor Department or the NLRB take action to protect workers or when the CFPB or FTC take action to protect consumers, big employers and financial services firms go to court to stop them. If you want to breathe clean air and drink clean water, if you want a free and open internet, if you want to work or purchase products free of corporate abuse and fraud, this fight is about your life. It is about you. This nomination poses a clear and present danger to those enforcement efforts. He poses a danger to the rights of women to decide when they want to have children and to millions of Ameri-cans with preexisting conditions who want to keep their affordable health in-surance. He poses a danger—clear and present—to workers and consumers who want to live free of corporate domination. He poses, most dan-gerously, a threat to the checks and balances that prevent a President from running this country like his own per-sonal fiefdom. In his opinions, his speeches, his writings, and his testimony, we can see where this nominee will take the coun-try if he is a swing vote, as he is likely to be on so many of these issues. He has used those dog whistles or bumper stickers in his campaign for his nomi-nation, those terms and buzz words, ‘‘abortion on demand.’’ Sometimes he uses a bullhorn, as when he promises conservative organizations that he will overturn longstanding, near-unani-mous precedents that have fallen out of favor with the rightwing or when he goes out of his way to publish long dis-sents, articulating a radical under-standing of the law and its value. He has been not so much a nominee as a candidate for office. He has been campaigning for this job since law school. Like many candidates for of-fice, he has spent that time dem-onstrating to potential political pa-trons that if they pick him, he will diligently represent their interests. He is their guy. That is how he became a member of that elite group on the President’s short list. I will conclude by saying that most chilling—indeed, frightening for me— was his appearance before this com-mittee when he gave a rant and a screed that was written the day before, so he said. It was delivered word for word from that text. It was hardly the result of some spontaneous insult or outburst. It was calculated and planned. It took back the mask of the judge and revealed the man—bitter self-pity, rageful, and a deep partisan, which he had demonstrated before throughout his career as a party opera-tive but perhaps not on the bench. The man revealed there said to us: ‘‘What goes around comes around.’’ He said that the powerful allegations of the sexual assault survivors were the result of a leftwing conspiracy fueled by revenge on behalf of the Clintons. Those remarks demean the brave and courageous survivors who came for-ward on their own initiative, without any encouragement by any Senator, and they were degrading to Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez and to the survivor community. They were directly contrary to Judge Kavanaugh’s own test of what a judge should do: 
The Supreme Court must never be viewed as a partisan institution. The Justices on the Supreme Court do not sit on opposite sides of the aisle. 
He was sitting on one side of the aisle. In fact, he was sitting on one dis-tinct side of that side of the aisle. That is the reason former Justice John Paul Stevens found his appearance before that committee—not only his prepared remarks but what he said after—as dis-qualifying. That is the reason the 2,400 lawyers and professors and former judges have written urging that his nomination be rejected. That is the reason I find most frightening. I have appeared four times before the U.S. Supreme Court. Every time has been an extraordinary honor, and I have spent a good part of my career standing in front of judges, sometimes with juries and sometimes not. What I prized in judges most importantly was that they were nonpartisan, that they were objective and neutral. I don’t know how lawyers or ordinary parties to any case could stand before Judge Kavanaugh now and feel they will be judged fairly and impartially. My colleagues have come to accept these vague assurances from nominees that they will simply call balls and strikes, that they will follow settled precedent, but we have seen those vague promises betrayed when judges or Justices actually reach the Court. I look to what he said in that hearing before the Judiciary Committee as a warning about what will happen if Jus-tice Kavanaugh is confirmed. What he wrote in the op-ed today in the Wall Street Journal provides no assurance because the real Brett Kavanaugh came before our committee, and the real Brett Kavanaugh wrote down in advance what he felt. The real Brett Kavanaugh should not be confirmed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Even at this late hour, I hope my colleagues will heed that warning. We may lose this battle, but we can-not lose the broader struggle for jus-tice in this country. I will stay angry. I hope my colleagues and others around the country will as well. To the young people who came to these halls wearing that T-shirt, ‘‘I am what’s at stake,’’ you are right. You are what is at stake. Stay angry. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. TILLIS ). The Senator from Oregon. Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, our Founders had a very clear design for the ability to put individuals into high posts of great responsibility. They real-ly wrestled with it. They considered giving the ability to appoint judges and executive officers to the assembly, as it was referred to. I think we have to worry a lot about individuals swapping favors. One person saying: You support my friend, and I will support yours— that wouldn’t lead to those with the best qualities serving in these key posi-tions. They concluded after great debate that it would go to a single individual, the President, to nominate. They real-ized that the President can go off track. They thought the President might express favoritism of a variety of sorts. Alexander Hamilton talked about this at some length: maybe fa-voritism to people in the home State, maybe favoritism to a close group of friends, maybe favoritism to individ-uals who were doing favors for the President. Who knows? Therefore, there had to be a check on the poten-tial abuse of the appointment process. That is where the Senate came in, to advise and consent—the President, to nominate; the Senate, to consent. What that meant is that the Senate could not interfere with the President on the nomination process, and the President was not to interfere with the Senate in the confirmation process. Yet we have right now, for the first time in U.S. history, as far as anyone has been able to ascertain, a case in which the President of the United States has interfered greatly, first of all by requesting that the Senate not look at all 3 years in which this indi-vidual, Kavanaugh—the nominee— served as Staff Secretary to President Bush. Second of all, the President ap-pointed an individual to provide the stamp of Presidential privilege on doc-uments for when he served at the White House that they did not want the Senate to see. We have some of those documents. He said: Those are OK. Yet they censored 100,000 docu-ments with the Presidential privilege stamp. This has never been done, ever, as far as we can determine. This body, on a bipartisan basis, re-quested all of those documents. This was not a case of the President saying ‘‘Please don’t request,’’ like with the Staff Secretary; this is a case in which the Senate together said ‘‘Give us the documents,’’ and the President refused.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6624 October 5, 2018 
This is something we should all stand together and say: Unacceptable. It is unacceptable that the President stepped across the separation of powers to interfere with the work of this body to review the nominee’s record. The fact that there have not been loud cries of protests from the leadership of this Senate is a shame on this institution— that it has not fought for the separa-tion of powers embodied in the Con-stitution. It has not fought for the ability of each and every Senator to be able to exercise full responsibility when we took our oath of office to re-view the records of nominees, engage in the advice and consent exercise. Is this to be a precedent for the fu-ture because the leadership here has so shamefully abandoned the core prin-ciples of the Constitution and the re-sponsibilities of this Chamber? I hope not. I hope that, together, all 100 Sen-ators will find in the future they will make sure the President cannot inter-fere with our responsibility. This is only one of the many prob-lems, the many concerns, about Brett Kavanaugh. Brett Kavanaugh didn’t raise a single voice about the inter-ference of the President with the exer-cise of this body. He is being nomi-nated to the Supreme Court. He is sup-posed to have read the Constitution at some point. He is supposed to under-stand the separation of powers. He is supposed to stand up for the principles embodied in that great document, and he did not. That alone should tell you this man does not belong on the Su-preme Court. Then, of course, there is the fact that he has a view of Presidential power that is above and beyond the law. Try to find that in the Constitution. Among the 25, he was the one who had the most expansive view of Presi-dential power. He is the one the Presi-dent chose. Why is that? Because the President is under investigation for conspiring with Russia to fix the elec-tion. That is why. He is worried. He is up at night. He wakes up early. He tweets out to the world—angry, hos-tile. He wants to make sure he has a Justice on that Court who can help write a ‘‘get out of jail free’’ card. What a conflict of interest. What a con-flict of interest that this Court might have to rule on whether a President can pardon himself. It is something we have never had to worry about before, whether a President can fire a special prosecutor, despite the writing under the law. That is not all. We have before us a nominee who has been deceptive and misleading to this Chamber time after time. Different articles have put up dif-ferent lists. They all come down to here is what he said, and here is the truth. Here is what he said, and here is the truth. I want to pivot, though, to perhaps the most shameful, difficult part of this nominee; that is, his record of abuse toward women and the complete failure of this body to look into that. I heard earlier on the floor of this Chamber a number of my colleagues across the aisle use the word ‘‘fair-ness.’’ ‘‘We want fairness.’’ I heard it from one, two, three, four colleagues, ‘‘fairness.’’ Did a single one of them ex-press any regret that when Dr. Ford came forward and asked for those who could corroborate her testimony, asked for the Judiciary Committee to hold a hearing with those folks able to tes-tify? Did they express any regret they turned her down? Even in 1991, the Judiciary Com-mittee brought forward people to cor-roborate Anita Hill’s story. Here we are 27 years later, and we don’t treat a woman coming forward to share an ex-perience of sexual abuse—we don’t even allow those individuals who can cor-roborate to testify before the Judiciary Committee. Did I hear a single Republican stand up and say ‘‘I am embarrassed we treated her so poorly’’? Let’s take Debbie Ramirez. She laid out a list of 20 individuals. The Judici-ary Committee had a lot to say about her experience. Did they invite her to testify and be able to tell her side of the story? No, they did not. She had a list of 20 individuals who could provide corroborating information. Did they ask a single one of those 20 to come be-fore the committee? Did they allow a single one to come? No, they did not. There was no fairness in that com-mittee. Let’s be clear about that. Let’s not hear more highfalutin argu-ments about fairness from the other side of the aisle when these two women were treated in such an egregious and awful fashion. Then, there is the phony FBI inves-tigation. I praise my colleague who in-sisted that the record be reopened, the background check be reopened for the FBI to provide an opportunity to check out these experiences shared by Debbie Ramirez and by Dr. Ford. On a back-ground check, it is not a criminal in-vestigation, and the FBI can’t decide who to talk to. Did I hear a single Member across the aisle express any embarrassment about the fact that they let the President constrain the investigations so not one—not one—of the eight people Dr. Ford asked to be talked to was talked to? Not one. Zero. You call that fair? That is not fair. That is not fair to her, that none of the people she asked to be talked to were talked to. Did I hear a single person across the aisle express any reservations about the fact that that FBI investigation was so constrained by the President of the United States, with advice from the Republican leadership, that they did not talk to one of the 20 people Debbie Ramirez asked to be talked to about her experiences in college? You know, 1 of the 20 was a suite mate of Mr. Kavanaugh’s. Well, when you go through your freshman year and you are a suite mate, you share a com-mon living area, and there is one bed-room here and one bedroom here, so you are with each other all the time. You know a lot about the other folks. Well, that is a pretty powerful associa-tion. That individual is now a professor at Princeton Theological Seminary, and he heard this story when it hap-pened. He heard about it, and he lived right there in the suite, and he thought it was horrific. I heard some colleagues say there was no one who could substantiate her story. That is simply false, and it is shameful to allege that there is no one when you know there is. It is unaccept-able to call something fair when you deliberately instruct or encourage the President to make sure that the people who can provide the information are not talked to. This individual, now a professor at Princeton Theological Seminary, has a very fine reputation. He was so upset about this, he talked about it with his roommate his first year in graduate school long before Mr. Kavanaugh ever came close to any type of nomination debate. So you can’t really say that he made it up now when he told another person about it long ago. And that in-dividual was on the list to be talked to, but did the FBI talk to him? No, be-cause the President wouldn’t let the FBI talk to him, and the President consulted with the Republican leader-ship, and they didn’t want anybody talked to who could actually corrobo-rate these stories. That is a rigged system. For anyone on this floor to say that is anywhere close to a form of justice, that is not true. These women have been horrifically treated by this Chamber. Just as the country knew Anita Hill was treated so poorly, so will, for decades from now, people talk about the abuse of power that emanated from my colleagues across the aisle against these women. Across this land right now, women have been reliving their own experi-ences of abuse. It has been an extraor-dinarily painful experience. They have been calling our offices. I am sure they have been calling all of our offices. I got on the phone and took many calls today. I heard story after story. It takes a lot of energy out of your heart to listen to individuals say, I am shar-ing this with you, and they start cry-ing on the phone—person after person. I also have all of the stories that have been written and sent to me as letters. I thought I would share a few of them with you. Here is a letter: 
What a farce! The disrespect to Dr. Ford and to victims everywhere. I am sincere in saying that this TRIAL is turning my stom-ach. I have fought back tears. I am a victim of similar offenses. It is no better, and in some ways worse, that it is a woman going after Dr. Ford in a subtle attempt to cloud the trust of her experience. 
Well, what is she referring to when she says it is a woman going after Dr. Ford? She is talking about the fact that the leadership on the Judiciary Committee hired a prosecutor to come

in and act as if Dr. Ford were a crimi-nal on trial and to interrogate her as if she were a criminal on trial. That is what this individual said ‘‘is turning my stomach.’’ And it turned my stom-ach, too, to see that abuse of power here in the U.S. Senate. Another letter: 
Hello, Senator. It has been 21 years since I was raped. I had at the time only shared my story with the emergency room doctors, the police, and my mom. Since it occurred, I have only shared my story with my husband, until this week on Twitter with the ‘‘why I didn’t report’’ hashtag. With each new accusation against Brett Kavanaugh, it has forced me to relive all the horrible memories from the night my assail-ant raped me. This moment in history and the fact that the majority of Republican Senators who have either tried to discredit the women coming forward or victim blame and shame them has literally made the event so fresh in my mind; as though it just hap-pened all over again yesterday. As like Dr. Ford, the details of dates, exact time, exact clothing, are not extremely forthcoming to my memory, although I re-member the colors of what we were both wearing. The fear, his actions, what I was feeling, and what was said during the rape, I will never forget. And I will never forget the smell of the cologne he was wearing and how it makes me physically ill when I smell it to this day. Kavanaugh can have his fake tears and shout his anger all he wants because I guar-antee you, if the man who raped me was try-ing to get a job on the Supreme Court, and if I had the strength to come forward like Dr. Ford did, then he too would yell and scream at the realization he was being con-fronted and that it was about to be taken away from him. Not to mention, my sexual assault assailant would NOT require an FBI investigation either. 
And what is she referring to there? She is referring to the fact that Dr. Ford took a polygraph exam, and Dr. Ford asked for an FBI investigation. Mr. Kavanaugh did not take a poly-graph exam, and Mr. Kavanaugh did not want an FBI investigation. Quite a difference there. Here is another story: 
Five years ago, I was assaulted by a trust-ed friend in my dorm room. Although I don’t recall some critical details, indelible in the hippocampus is the humiliation and fear of retaliation. That is why I never reported, even when school nurses urged me to. Years later, I suffered PTSD and rarely feel entirely safe. Watching Kavanaugh’s angry, arrogant performance was deeply triggering to me— would my attacker act the same way if I outed him? And would he also find the support of 33 percent of Americans, just like Kavanaugh? Until now, I haven’t shared that I am a survivor with even the closest of my friends and family. But it is too important to stay quiet now. 
Here is another story: 
Hello, Senator Merkley. When I was young in the early 1970s, I was raped for an entire year by someone close to our family. I didn’t tell. I didn’t tell because his warnings and threats were too powerful and frightening for the child that I was. The man went on to become active in a leadership role. He was, in fact, in a position to give talks about morality and principles, all the while knowing how he affected my life. Because that was the year he took my childhood away. Watching Dr. Ford’s testimony was tough, but I did it. I always knew if I came forward against the man who did this, it would be his word against mine and as a female, I would lose. So I stayed quiet, never naming him publicly and never will. But I’m writing today to ask you for two thing, please—if you hear any of your fellow Senators say ‘‘I know his character. He would never do that. He’s never done any-thing like that in front of me,’’ please re-mind them that they don’t like witnesses. For me, there was never a hint of an assault until he got me alone. And if you hear your fellow Senators say, ‘‘But it happened almost 40 years ago,’’ please assure them that in the victim’s heart, mind and life, it happened last week. It happened yesterday. It happened today. Because you never get past what was done to you. Ever. You can’t. She went on to share that she wrote this letter to me and deleted it and wrote it again and deleted it several times. She had just deleted it again when her husband came in the door carrying a statement that someone had posted on the doors in the neighbor-hood that happened to have a quote from me, one of her two Senators, and she took it as a sign, and she decided to write that letter again and send it. She said: 
Now maybe what happened to me will bring about some good. 
I know all of us are getting letters like this. When she said she never came for-ward because it would be ‘‘his word against mine and as a female I would lose,’’ she is relating exactly what hap-pened to Dr. Ford. It was set up he said, she said, with no corroborating witnesses called even though Dr. Ford asked for them. And then because it was he said, she said, my colleagues could stand up and say: Just can’t prove it. Can’t prove it. But why didn’t my colleagues stand up and say: It is an outrage that we didn’t call the people she asked us to call. It is an outrage that there was this phony FBI investigation that didn’t talk to any of those people. What she was talking about right here is how Dr. Ford was treated in this Chamber, that she would lose be-cause men in power would rig the sys-tem and find for the man. That is what has happened here. That is what happened with Ms. Ra-mirez, Debbie Ramirez. She had cor-roborating information from the suite mate of Brett Kavanaugh, but we here, this Senate, we rigged the system so that that information could not be con-sidered. That is what this woman is talking about, why she didn’t come for-ward, because it would be her word against a man’s. The system would be rigged and would find for the man. That is what is so disturbing to women all over this country—a rigged system, that we couldn’t find in our collective judgment, in our collective process, the ability to rise against partisanship and give fair treatment, a fair process, to the individuals who came forward. It may not have changed the course of events and the final vote, but at least women would know we have come from where we were. We may not have been entirely fair to Anita Hill, but we have learned and we have come further. In-stead, we did worse. That is a regret-table, powerful consequence of what has happened. Another constituent wrote to say that although he was not a direct vic-tim of assault, both of his brothers were repeatedly sexually abused by a Catholic priest who spent 8 years in prison for abusing as many as 150 boys. He went on to say that this priest was in charge of a boys’ choir even though it was known that he had issues with sexual abuse. His brothers were part of the choir, and he is troubled, he writes, that his younger brother served in the same choir he did, and even though he was aware there was a problem, he didn’t intervene. He says, referring to the priest: He ruined our lives. Though I was not di-rectly a victim of his abuse, I carry with me the shame of not knowing to speak up about what I saw. 
He says that shame is amplified be-cause his younger brother sang in the same choir for a time. He goes on to talk about a culture of power and privilege, where people think they can abuse others and get away with it. He says: 
We are seeing this behavior being accepted at the highest level of office in our country. 
He goes on to relate that this is simi-lar to the culture of abuse towards women. He says: 
The culture of abuse towards women is being openly perpetuated by the leaders of our country. The people we are supposed to put trust in. 
That was the end of his quote. He went on to say: 
I have never felt like it was my story to tell. The only reason I tell it is because it il-lustrates how dangerous these power struc-tures can be and how easily they can be abused. We have to take great care when choosing who to give great responsibility to. 
Have we in this Chamber recognized how easily our power structure can be abused? Did we rise to insist on fair-ness for individuals who brought their stories forward? Did we insist that they have the opportunity to have their wit-nesses and corroborating information considered by this Chamber? We did not. We failed them. We failed this country. And when he says that we have to take great care when choosing who to give great responsibility to, he is saying we should have taken great care. And we know that in this par-ticular nomination, there are two pow-erful pieces of it. One, it is lifetime, so the person will serve for decades. The second is, it is the top Court. Are there not individuals in this land of hundreds of millions of people who have stellar records of character who could serve on that Court?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6626 October 5, 2018 
I hope that across America, it will come to great discussion and lead to changes in how we think and how we behave. I hope that between now and the vote tomorrow afternoon, there will be some Members of this Chamber who will decide to take seriously the responsibility that we had and that we failed to exercise appropriately. We will decide that, you know what, yeah, we are going to close debate, but we haven’t yet voted to put this man on the bench, and with the committee having conducted a completely rigged process, we need to stop and rethink what we are doing and not put Brett Kavanaugh on the Court. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, the Su-preme Court nomination before us is of historic importance. We have a nomi-nee whose nomination is clouded with credible allegations of sexual assault, whose truthfulness before Congress is questionable, and who showed himself as partisan and lacking in judicial tem-perament before this body in his sup-plemental hearing. As of today, more than 2,400 law pro-fessors throughout the country are on record that Judge Kavanaugh’s display of lack of judicial restraint during that hearing is disqualifying. The growing list includes professors from all polit-ical stripes and professors who had pre-viously supported his nomination. In-deed, former Justice John Paul Ste-vens, a highly respected jurist, has taken the unusual step of publicly opining the same. Yesterday, I spoke on the Senate floor about why Judge Kavanaugh should not be confirmed in light of the allegations swirling around him, his lack of candor with this body, and his demeanor during the supplemental hearing. But, Mr. President, on the merits as well, Judge Kavanaugh has not shown himself deserving of ele-vation to our highest Court. Let’s start with his overly expansive view of Executive power—a view that could shield our current President from being held to account for potential crimes and misdeeds. Judge Kavanaugh has written and spoken extensively about the need to shield the President from criminal in-vestigation while in office. He is on record that, in his opinion, the Presi-dent has authority under the Constitu-tion to terminate an independent coun-sel at will. Indeed, there is probably no other viable candidate to the seat who has argued more strenuously in favor of Presidential immunity and the President’s absolute authority to fire a special prosecutor. It is no coincidence, then, that this President, who is under criminal investigation by a special counsel, selected Brett Kavanaugh to sit on the Court. Judge Kavanaugh is clear that, as a matter of policy, Presidents should be completely immunized from criminal and civil suit while in office. He writes that ‘‘the President should be free from some of the burdens of ordinary citi-zenship.’’ For Judge Kavanaugh, free-ing the President of ‘‘burdens’’ the rest of us must bear takes precedence over ensuring the President follows the law. Judge Kavanaugh’s supporters point out that his writings in support of broad Presidential immunity represent his policy views, not his constitutional analysis. But his writings do not tell us that he would uphold Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation, nor would he tell us during his confirmation hearing that he would hold the President to ac-count for any crimes. In my view, the ‘‘burdens’’ of a criminal investigation do not outweigh the dangers of a crimi-nal occupying the Oval Office. There is nothing in the Constitution that immunizes a President from criminal investigation and prosecution while in office. The drafters knew how to immunize public officials if they wanted. Members of Congress, for ex-ample, have express immunity ‘‘from arrest or interrogation for any speech or debate entered into during a legisla-tive session.’’ The speech and debate immunity for Congress is narrowly tai-lored. The drafters gave no immunity— narrow or broad—to the President or members of his Cabinet. While Judge Kavanaugh claims to be a strict con-structionist, I have no confidence he would stick to the text of the Constitu-tion and not grant the President im-munity. There is evidence in the public record that close associates and even family of the President may have conspired with Russia, and we have the Presi-dent’s own inexplicable behavior cozying up to and trying to curry favor with Vladmir Putin. There is abundant evidence in the public record that the President has worked to undermine the investigation into Russian interference in our election and investigation into himself. And we have sworn testimony from the President’s former personal lawyer that the President directed commission of two campaign-related felonies. If the President has com-mitted crimes, he should be held re-sponsible, just like the rest of us. Judge Kavanaugh has said he would ‘‘put the final nail in’’ Morrison v. Olson. Morrison v. Olson is the 1988, 8- to-1 decision written by Chief Justice Rehnquist that upheld the Independent Counsel Act. That act was passed in the aftermath of Watergate to curb Ex-ecutive abuse and mitigate the obvious conflict of interest the U.S. Depart-ment of Justice would have inves-tigating the President. Judge Kavanaugh sides with the lone dissent in that case and with the idea that the President should be able to fire the per-son who is investigating him—with no check. If the constitutionality of Spe-cial Counsel Mueller’s investigation comes before the Supreme Court—and it is likely that it will—there is every reason to believe Justice Kavanaugh would have his chance to hammer in that nail. Judge Kavanaugh espouses a ‘‘uni-tary executive’’ theory of the separa-tion of powers. Hidden behind this legalese is a simple and dangerous idea: that the President holds absolute power over the executive branch. Under his theory, President Trump could ac-tually fire Special Counsel Mueller be-cause he uncovered wrongdoing by the President. In plain terms, he would let the fox raid the henhouse. Judge Kavanaugh’s theory that the Constitution requires no checks on the President’s authority strains that doc-ument to the point of breaking. Our en-tire constitutional system of separa-tion of powers is built on the principle of checks and balances—so that one branch of government does not accu-mulate and exercise an inordinate amount of power. Under DOJ regulations, the Attorney General, or Acting Attorney General if the Attorney General is recused, may only appoint a special counsel if it is warranted and there is a conflict with the Department or other ‘‘extraor-dinary circumstances.’’ Only the Attor-ney General—not the President—may remove a special counsel. And the At-torney General—or in the case of Spe-cial Counsel Mueller, the Deputy At-torney General—may only do so for ‘‘misconduct, dereliction of duty, inca-pacity, conflict of interest, or for other good cause, including violation of De-partmental policies.’’ The DOJ regula-tions provide appropriate and constitu-tionally sound checks on the execu-tive’s authority. The American people deserve to know the truth about Russia’s attack on our democracy. They deserve to know whether Candidate Trump or his campaign was part of the attack. And they deserve to know all the facts be-hind the President’s efforts to stop DOJ’s investigation into Russian inter-ference and any Trump collusion. The President should not be able to hide the truth and the facts by firing Spe-cial Counsel Mueller. And that is not all. There is open speculation that the President may pardon close associates. His family. Even himself. The new Justice may be called upon to determine the scope of the President’s power to pardon and whether that power may be exercised for corrupt purpose. Given Judge Kavanaugh’s overly expansive view of Executive authority, I am concerned he would set no limits on the President’s power to pardon and would allow a Presidential pardon even if wielded to obstruct justice. At this point in our history, with so many questions whether the President, his family, or others close to him com-mitted crimes, the American public must be assured that the new Justice will provide a check on the President. And not give him a blank check to commit crimes. I am proud that New Mexico is a ma-jority minority State, but I am really worried that a Justice Kavanaugh will not protect minority rights. Ten per-cent of our State’s population is Native American. Judge Kavanaugh, however,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6627 October 5, 2018 
has shown a distinct hostility to indig-enous people’s rights. For example, in Rice v. Cayetano, he argued in the Su-preme Court against a voting system limited to Native Hawaiians, arguing they should not be treated like Tribes even though Native Hawaiians and Tribes share a history of forced assimi-lation. In that case, he represented the Center for Equal Opportunity—a fer-vently anti-affirmative action group. While the case was pending, he au-thored an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal arguing that ‘‘any racial group with creative reasoning can qualify as an Indian tribe.’’ He called the voting system a ‘‘naked-racial spoils system.’’ Such an offensive view demonstrates a level of misunderstanding—perhaps even willful ignorance unworthy of a nominee to our highest Court. While the Court ultimately struck down the voting system, it did not do so on Mr. Kavanaugh’s claimed grounds. Recently disclosed emails that Judge Kavanaugh wrote as a White House lawyer confirm he is a threat to indige-nous communities. In his view, if Na-tive peoples are not organized into Tribes and live on reservations, they are not entitled to any special recogni-tion under the law. But not all Tribes are alike. Not all indigenous peoples are organized the same way. Alaska Natives, for example, are organized as Tribes, villages, and regional corpora-tions. Alaska Natives are rightfully concerned whether he will protect their rights. Bottom line: Judge Kavanaugh ques-tions the constitutionality of programs specifically dedicated to Native Ameri-cans—a view that could upend decades of progress for Indian Country on ev-erything from housing to government contracting. As ranking member of the Com-mittee on Indian Affairs, I wrote to the chair of the Judiciary Committee in August asking for all of Judge Kavanaugh’s documents related to Na-tive issues. The Chair refused my re-quest. So we don’t even know if we have the full extent of emails and memos from Judge Kavanaugh dispar-aging Native rights. But we do know that Judge Kavanaugh is hostile to affirmative ac-tion programs. When he was a White House lawyer, he called Department of Transportation regulations designed to remedy past and present discrimina-tion ‘‘a naked racial set-aside.’’ But those regulations, which favored ‘‘so-cially and economically disadvantaged individuals,’’ were upheld by the Fed-eral courts under established equal pro-tection principles. While Judge Kavanaugh advocates strongly for ‘‘race neutrality’’ when it comes to distribution of government benefits, he is not so quick to embrace race-neutral policies when it comes to racial profiling. In the aftermath of 9/ 11, in a series of White House emails la-beled ‘‘racial profiling,’’ the idea of long-term use of racial profiling at air-ports and by law enforcement was raised. Mr. Kavanaugh responded that ‘‘the people (such as you and I) who generally favor effective security measures that are race-neutral in fact DO need to grapple—and grapple now— with the interim question of what to do before a truly effective and comprehen-sive race-neutral system is developed and implemented.’’ In other words, maybe we use racial profiling in the in-terim because coming up with a race- neutral system is so hard. In New Mexico, almost 49 percent of our population is Hispanic—the largest percentage of any State. If we were to accept racial profiling in New Mexico— coupled with our Native population and other minority groups—over 62 percent of our population would be targeted. That would be wholly unacceptable, as would be doing away with Federal and State programs intended to redress past and present discrimination. One of the most critical roles the courts play is protecting minority rights, but Judge Kavanaugh’s record does not demonstrate he will fulfill this role. He simply doesn’t appear to understand or to appreciate the dis-crimination, oppression, the assault that Native peoples, Hispanics, African Americans, and other groups have faced over time and continue to face. Supreme Court equal protection juris-prudence is informed by this history. Whether it is affirmative action, vot-ing rights, or redistricting, we must have a Justice on the Court who pro-tects minority rights, and Judge Kavanaugh has not shown himself to be that Justice. The same is true for women’s repro-ductive rights. Trump the candidate promised only to appoint Justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade. Potential Supreme Court candidates can only make it onto the Federalist Society list if they will vote to overturn Roe. Judge Kavanaugh’s record does not bode well for women’s rights. He tried to stand in the way of a 17-year-old pregnant girl, an immigrant held in Federal detention, who wanted an abortion. He would have required her to find a ‘‘sponsor’’ in the United States who would provide housing for her and allow her to terminate her pregnancy. And if the Federal Govern-ment couldn’t find a sponsor, the young woman could return to the dis-trict court in 2 weeks. Of course, the longer a pregnancy continues, the greater the risk to the woman’s health and safety. Judge Kavanaugh did not believe these onerous, bureaucratic require-ments represented an ‘‘undue burden’’ on the young woman’s constitutional right to terminate her pregnancy. For-tunately, however, the full DC Court of Appeals did. They quickly overturned the decision and allowed the young woman to immediately exercise her right. The American public—Democrats, Republicans, and independents—sup-port a woman’s right to choose. If Judge Kavanaugh would have this country go back to the days of back- alley abortions, he should have said so during his confirmation hearings, but he would not. I cannot vote for a nomi-nee who is not willing to affirm a wom-an’s right to choose. A woman’s reproductive right is not the only health care right at risk with Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination. Our entire system of health care rights and benefits under the Affordable Care Act is in jeopardy. A group of Republican attorney General and Governors has filed suit to gut critical ACA protec-tions. They want to take away protec-tions from the millions of Americans with preexisting conditions and allow insurance companies to discriminate on this basis again. They want to take away the prohibition against lifetime limits on benefits, and go back to the days when you could get booted off in-surance because you have high medical expenses. They want to take away the right to cover children up to age 26, to get free preventive care, and prescrip-tion drug coverage for seniors. And they want to eviscerate Medicaid ex-pansion, which has given 11 million Americans healthcare they didn’t have before. The Trump administration has sided with the Republican attorney Generals and Governors who want to decimate our health care system despite the President’s repeated campaign prom-ises to cover everyone, protect people with preexisting illnesses, and cover children up to age 26. This case is now before a Federal court in Texas and will likely make its way to the Supreme Court. We do not want a Justice who sides with cor-porate interests over consumers, who is willing to throw statutory language and constitutional principles aside to get the results he wants. I am con-cerned that a Justice Kavanaugh would do the President’s bidding and gut crit-ical health care rights that Congress has enacted and that the American people overwhelmingly stand by. But there is more at stake. In his legal opinions, Judge Kavanaugh inevi-tably sides with business and against the environment, workers, and con-sumers. His environmental record de-serves a spotlight. Interpreting envi-ronmental statutes, Judge Kavanaugh will veer far from the legal text he claims to honor to reach the result he wants. For example, Judge Kavanaugh once blocked the Environmental Pro-tection Agency from protecting ‘‘down-wind’’ states from nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide coming from ‘‘upwind’’ States under the ‘‘Good Neighbor Pro-vision’’ of the Clean Air Act. Nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide develop into ozone and cause respiratory illnesses and other health problems. However, the Supreme Court reversed Judge Kavanaugh. In a 6-to-2 decision that in-cluded justice Kennedy and Chief Jus-tice Roberts in the majority, the Court found that Judge Kavanaugh ‘‘rewrites a decades-old statute whose plain text and structure’’ are clear.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6628 October 5, 2018 
In case after case, whether in dissent or the majority, Judge Kavanaugh votes against the environment and with industry. He voted to invalidate EPA rules to regulate emission of greenhouse gasses by plants and fac-tories, to overturn EPA’s mercury and air toxics standards limiting hazardous emissions from powerplants, to allow EPA to delay implementation of its methane control rule, to overturn an EPA rule regulating greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks, to overturn an EPA decision to revoke a coal company permit that would harm the environment. This is not the record the American people want from a Jus-tice likely to rule for decades on the most important environmental law cases. His record on matters addressing cli-mate change is especially troubling. Climate change can hit minorities and low-income communities the hardest. In New Mexico, traditional land grant and acequia communities depend on the land to sustain their families. The climate change-induced drought we are experiencing in New Mexico and the Southwest threatens our way of life. If we are looking for a Justice who will put balance back into our cam-paign finance system, Judge Kavanaugh is not a likely candidate. He has been clear that he believes that money equals free speech. So it is a good bet he will not scrutinize Citizens United or the other Supreme Court cases that now allow unlimited, dark money to run roughshod over our cam-paigns and tear at the fabric of our de-mocracy. Our campaign finance system is broken beyond repair. Unless we change the rules—either through Su-preme Court decision or congressional action and constitutional amend-ment—we will continue to see the kinds of perverse results we now see where a few superwealthy individuals and big corporations drown out the many. But we are pretty much assured that a Justice Kavanaugh will not change the rules that now allow unfet-tered dark money to pollute our elec-tions. It is hard to overstate the impor-tance of the Supreme Court nomina-tion before the Senate. New Mexicans and the American people want a nomi-nee who has been 100 percent honest, whose nomination is not tainted by credible allegations of sexual assault and misconduct. New Mexicans and the American people want a nominee who will act as a check on the powerful, but President Trump chose this nominee to do the opposite. At this critical point in our Nation’s history—when we have a President who is under DOJ investigation for con-spiracy with Russia to undermine our national election and obstruction of justice, who may have broken cam-paign finance laws to win the Presi-dency—we must have Justices on the Court who believe in the rule of law, who believe that no one is above the law, even the President. At this his-toric juncture, the American people must have assurance that any judicial nominee will hold the President true to our laws, true to our Constitution, but Judge Kavanaugh cannot give the American people this assurance, and I cannot support his nomination.

MORNING BUSINESS 
200TH ANNIVERSARY OF BROWN BROTHERS HARRIMAN & CO. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I would like to bring the Senate’s atten-tion to the 200th anniversary of the New York City-based institution, Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. The firm, which was founded in 1818, is still in operation in the United States and has had a major presence in New York. The firm evolved from a 19th-century family-operated linen import business among Brown relatives in Northern Ireland, Liverpool, Baltimore, Phila-delphia, and New York City and is one of the world’s storied financial houses. The first office in New York was lo-cated at 191 Pearl Street near the wharfs of South Street. By 1835, the firm had moved to Wall Street as the city experienced the growth in trade from the recently completed Erie Canal and innovations in overseas ship-ping. Philanthropy has been a passion of the partners who were early bene-factors of the Union Theological Semi-nary, as well as founders of the New York Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor. Brown Brothers partners also served on a council whose work led to the enactment of New York State’s first tenement house law in 1867. On October 5, family and partners of the firm will gather to celebrate 200 years of their banking history. I wish them congratulations.

ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, today I wish to submit for the R
ECORD  a column written by Mr. Dennis Sun, a Wyoming journalist and rancher, enti-tled ‘‘The Act is Broken.’’ The article was published in the Wyoming Live-stock Roundup on August 29, 2018. Since its passage in 1973, the Endan-gered Species Act has contributed to the recovery of iconic species like the bald eagle. It has been an important conservation tool, but it is in need of an update. Wyoming has invested more than $50 million for the recovery of the grizzly bear alone. Twice in the last decade, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has found that the grizzly bear met all re-covery targets and no longer should be protected as ‘‘threatened’’ under the Endangered Species Act. Courts have twice overturned the delisting deci-sions and, in so doing, undermined the expert opinion of wildlife biologists who set, approved, and met recovery goals. Mr. Sun’s article highlights the case of the grizzly bear as a prime example for why my efforts to give states more opportunities to engage in conserva-tion under the act have merit. The suc-cessful recovery of the grizzly bear took decades, but I am hopeful we will be able to improve the act and improve conservation much faster. There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the RECORD , as follows: 
[From Wyoming Livestock Roundup, Aug. 29, 2018] T
HEACT IS BROKEN  (By Dennis Sun, Publisher) On Sept. 24, U.S. District Court Judge Dana Christensen issued his decision that stopped the delisting of the Greater Yellow-stone Ecosystem grizzly bear. This ruling was not unexpected, as Judge Christensen had already ruled twice to post-pone the planned grizzly bear hunting sea-sons. The case was brought by some wildlife ad-vocates and a couple of tribes. They argued the bears face continued threats from cli-mate change and loss of habitat. The case was based on more procedural action that they felt was not included the delisting study. During this trial, the questions Judge Christensen asked gave lawyers for Wyoming and the Mountain States Legal Foundation the notion he was going to rule against the state, and he did. An appeal to the Ninth Cir-cuit Court in San Francisco, Calif. is most likely not going to happen, as that court doesn’t rule in favor of the western states often. The Ninth Circuit tends to be pretty liberal in its views. The grizzly bear is now under the jurisdic-tion of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). Gov. Matt Mead said, ‘‘I am disappointed with this decision. Grizzly bear recovery should be viewed as a conservation success story. Due to Wyoming’s investment of ap-proximately $50 million for recovery and management, grizzly bears have exceeded every scientifically established recovery cri-teria in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem since 2003. Numbers have risen from as few as 136 bears when they were listed in 1975, to more than 700 today.’’ Gov. Mead also noted, ‘‘Biologists cor-rectly determined grizzly bears no longer needed Endangered Species Act (ESA) pro-tections. The decision to return grizzly bears to the list of threatened and endangered spe-cies is further evidence the ESA is not work-ing as its drafters intended. Congress should modernize the ESA so we can celebrate suc-cesses and focus our efforts on species in need.’’ Government biologists contended that Yel-lowstone’s grizzlies were thriving, having adapted to changes in their diet and are among the best managed bears in the world. If the judge’s ruling would have different, FWS would have also lifted federal protec-tion for around 1,000 grizzly bears in the Gla-cier National Park and the Bob Marshall Wilderness Area of Montana, but the ruling stopped that, as well. Just like dealing with the wolf issues, this ruling will take some time to get straight-ened out. Hopefully President Trump, our Congress, Sen. Barrasso and other states will get an improved and revised ESA bill passed—that is what it will take to delist bears. More states are having issues with en-dangered species. In Washington, ranchers see wolf predation on livestock, so we should have more sympathy to get ESA corrected. There is a big push today that says many of the risks faced by many species today re-sult from habitat modifications caused by

climate change. Well, if the habitat is chang-ing, usually the species will adapt also. Stud-ies show that is happening. If the grizzly bears are short of white bark pine nuts, that doesn’t mean they can compensate by eating livestock or attacking people. Let’s be rea-sonable about this. f 
REMEMBERING DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, this Sunday, October 14, 2018, we celebrate the 128th birthday of General and President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The last President born, in the 19th cen-tury, Ike came of age in both a chang-ing nation and an ever-shrinking world. As Kansas’ favorite son, Ike left an indelible mark on the Nation and on the world, from being appointed Su-preme Allied Commander during the Second World War, to being duly elect-ed as our President. Ike’s character- driven experiences guided him in all of his workings. Many remember important dates and events surrounding the life of General and President Eisenhower, but October 14, 1890, was probably like any other day in this changing Nation, and the world could not know that one of its staunchest supporters of peace and prosperity would be birthed on that day. President Eisenhower once said, ‘‘When you finally find something that must be done, impossibilities disappear and become merely major obstacles.’’ This determination and dedicated be-lief in America brought Ike from our Nation’s heartland in Abilene, KS, to the U.S. Military Academy, to an ex-traordinary career in the Army, and to the Nation’s Capital as a newly elected President. Among many attributes, Eisenhower embodied the undying American ideal that calls us to achieve more than the previous generation and to strive for a safer and more prosperous world for generations to come. Ike believed this to be his prime duty, and his deter-mination and ability enabled him to achieve that goal. Eisenhower’s histor-ical achievements earned him the re-spect of most citizens in this Nation and from many around the globe. As Americans, we owe a great deal to the man who led the U.S. and Allied Forces in the liberation of Europe and expelled from the world the evil of Hit-ler’s Nazism. Moreover, Ike’s legacy as President included the creation of the Interstate Highway System, NASA, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, now known as HHS and the Department of Education, and the FAA. He also brought Alaska and Ha-waii into the Union. As the chairman of the Dwight D. Ei-senhower Memorial Commission, I am pleased to report that the national me-morialization of President and General Eisenhower is well underway and that the construction of the memorial hon-oring Ike is near the halfway point of completion. We have a dedication scheduled for May 8, 2020, marking the 75th anniversary of the Allied victory in Europe during the Second World War. Today I ask my fellow citizens and Senators to celebrate and memorialize this outstanding president, Kansan, and American by wishing Ike a happy 128th birthday. f 
ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING CENTRAL VALLEY SCHOOL ∑Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the students, fac-ulty, and parents of Central Valley School, located in Buxton, North Da-kota, on being awarded the 2018 Na-tional Blue Ribbon School Award. Founded in 1982, the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program recognizes public and private elementary, middle, and high schools where students per-form at very high levels or where sig-nificant improvements are being made in students’ academic achievement. A National Blue Ribbon Schools flag overhead has become a mark of excel-lence in education recognized by every-one from parents to policymakers in thousands of communities. Since the program’s founding, the U.S. Depart-ment of Education has bestowed this coveted award to more than 8,500 of America’s best schools. Central Valley School serves roughly 196 students and was one of three schools in North Dakota to receive the honor of Exemplary High Performing School in 2018. Receiving recognition as a National Blue Ribbon School sig-nifies the hard work and dedication of the educators, students and parents in-volved, and I have no doubt the stu-dents at Central Valley School are on a path to success. At Central Valley School, teachers focus on each indi-vidual student using their multi-tiered system of support. This personalized teaching can consist of one-on-one with students to focused instructional help from a web-based program. The faculty meets eight times a year to assess what certain students might need to be successful. Central Valley’s innovative commitment to developing student po-tential has resulted in high student outcomes for which we can all be proud. Central Valley School holds true to its motto, ‘‘A Commitment to Edu-cational Excellence for Students, Staff, and Community: Achievement; En-hancement; Involvement,’’ by con-stantly looking at the needs of each in-dividual student. I wish the very best to the community of Buxton and con-gratulations to all engaged at Central Valley School for achieving this high honor. Thank you for your commit-ment to our children and leaders of to-morrow.∑

RECOGNIZING FREEDOM ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ∑Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the students, fac-ulty, and parents of Freedom Elemen-tary School, located in West Fargo, ND, on being awarded the 2018 National Blue Ribbon School Award. Founded in 1982, the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program recognizes public and private elementary, middle, and high schools where students per-form at very high levels or where sig-nificant improvements are being made in students’ academic achievement. A National Blue Ribbon Schools flag overhead has become a mark of excel-lence in education recognized by every-one from parents to policymakers in thousands of communities. Since the program’s founding, the U.S. Depart-ment of Education has bestowed this coveted award to more than 8,500 of America’s best schools. Freedom Elementary School serves nearly 495 students and was one of 3 schools in North Dakota to receive the honor of Exemplary High Performing School in 2018. Receiving recognition as a National Blue Ribbon School sig-nifies the hard work and dedication of the educators, students, and parents involved, and I have no doubt the stu-dents at Freedom Elementary are on a path to success. The school’s theme is RICK, which stands for respect, inclu-sion, compassion, and kindness, which helps ensure all students have the best possible learning environment and treat each other with dignity. They have been successful in developing car-ing, thoughtful, and respectful stu-dents through promoting the RICK phi-losophy and by incentivizing good be-havior and promoting togetherness with various awards and competitions. The West Fargo Public Schools mis-sion statement reads, ‘‘Educating to-day’s learners for tomorrow’s world.’’ This mission embodies all that Free-dom Elementary is working to accom-plish by providing a healthy and re-spectful learning environment that leads to success. I wish the very best to the community of West Fargo and con-gratulations to all engaged at Freedom Elementary for achieving this high honor.

Richland Elementary School serves roughly 152 students and was one of 3 schools in North Dakota to receive the honor of Exemplary High Performing School in 2018. Receiving recognition as a National Blue Ribbon School sig-nifies the hard work and dedication of the educators, students and parents in-volved, and I have no doubt its stu-dents are on a path to success. To ef-fectively bolster reading and writing skills, the school utilizes Sails Lit-eracy which immerses students in oral, written, and visual language. The abil-ity to personalize each student’s learn-ing plan helps ensure they are per-forming to the best of their abilities. Additionally, the school receives con-stant feedback from teachers on the Sails Literacy program, which allows for the program to be molded to fit new classes. The faculty, staff, and commu-nity of Abercrombie are leading the way on literary education in North Da-kota, and this innovation serves as a model that all schools can look to-wards when finding new ways to pro-mote student growth and development. The Richland #44 School District mission statement reads, ‘‘Students will be taught the skills and gain the knowledge to experience success, posi-tive self-worth, and become responsible citizens in society.’’ Richland Elemen-tary School has done an excellent job at providing a positive and enriching learning environment for their stu-dents. I wish the very best to the com-munity of Abercrombie and congratu-lations to all engaged at Richland Ele-mentary School for achieving this high honor.

TRIBUTE TO MASON WILLIAMS ANDREWS ∑Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise today to welcome home and congratu-late a young man from my home State of Louisiana, Mr. Mason Williams An-drews. Mr. Andrews just achieved his mission of setting a new world record as the youngest solo pilot to complete a circumnavigation of the globe, as Mason is about 4 months younger than the current record holder. Mr. Andrews set out on July 22, on ‘‘Mason’s MedCamps Mission’’ from Monroe, LA, in an effort to achieve the new world record, as well as raise fund-ing and awareness about MedCamps, which is a summer camp for children with disabilities and illnesses. Today Mr. Andrews has achieved both of his goals and will make his official and final landing in Monroe tomorrow morning, Saturday, October 6. It is my honor to recognize Mr. An-drews on a job well done. We are grate-ful for his safe return and applaud his courageous efforts to help a worthy cause by raising over $25,000 for MedCamps throughout his 2 month journey. On behalf of the people of Louisiana, I would like to express my congratula-tions to Mason and thank him for his efforts in helping MedCamps continue their mission of serving children. ∑ f

HONORING THE LIFE OF LINDA BROWN COCHRAN 
HON. BONNIE WATSON COLEMAN 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Linda Brown Cochran, who passed away on September 29, 2018, following a lengthy battle with cancer. Linda was the daughter of Ernest and Betty Brown and grew up in Massillon, Ohio. She graduated Washington High School in 1978, and later attended Franklin University. She was the President of Cochran & Assoc. Sales and Marketing Company. She worked hard to develop new businesses and provided support to her team. Additionally, she was a true advocate who championed many causes close to her heart. Among those include the Jack and Jill of America Inc., Junior League, Cuyahoga Democratic Women’s Caucus and Court Appointed Special Advocates of Lorain County. Linda fostered a loving family with her hus-band of 35 years, Harold L. Cochran, in Avon Lake, Ohio. She raised two wonderful daugh-ters, Courtney and Taylor. Along with them, she leaves behind her three sisters, Saundra, Marsha, and Vicki, and a host of nieces, neph-ews, and cousins. It has been a joy to work with Courtney, who currently serves as my Communications Director & Senior Advisor in my Washington Office. Linda’s love, intelligence, and grace shines through her daughter every day. While this is certainly a sad occasion, it is clear that Linda’s spirit carries on through the excellence of her children, and the positive impact on her loved ones and community. Mr. Speaker, I send my condolences to the family and friends of Linda. I ask that my col-leagues join me in commemorating her won-derful life and legacy. Rest in peace, Linda.

HONORING DENNIS ZOTIGH FOR RECEIVING THE GLOBAL CITIZEN AWARD 
HON. TOM COLE 
OF OKLAHOMA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a fellow Oklahoman and Native Amer-ican, Dennis Zotigh, for receiving the Global Citizen Award from the Happy World Founda-tion. A Kiowa, San Juan Pueblo, and Santee Da-kota Indian, Dennis started learning Native American traditions, songs, and dances from an early age. After receiving a Bachelor’s De-gree from the University of Oklahoma, he has devoted his life to promoting Native American culture and history throughout the United States and across the world. He has done ex-tensive work with the Oklahoma Historical So-ciety and the Smithsonian Institution, and he has also represented Native Americans at in-stitutions such as the British Museum in Lon-don. He has helped directed performances of Native American dances and songs for audi-ences ranging from viewers of Monday Night Football to the President of the United States. As a proud Oklahoman and member of the Chickasaw Nation, I have always been pas-sionate about advocating on behalf of Native Americans here in Washington, D.C. There-fore, I am very grateful that there are Oklaho-mans like Dennis Zotigh who have committed themselves to promoting Native American her-itage. He has rightfully earned recognition for his role as a cultural ambassador for Native Americans, and I hope that he continues his great work in the years to come. I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring Dennis Zotigh and his lifelong work to promote and preserve Native American culture. f 
LEW GAITER 
HON. JARED POLIS 
OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, today I would like to honor the memory of Lew Gaiter III and offer my most sincere condolences to his fam-ily and to all who had the pleasure of knowing him. Lew served the people of Larimer County as County Commissioner for nearly a decade, during which he brought innovative ideas that delivered lasting change. While Lew achieved many things as commissioner, two of his most notable accomplishments were his work in ad-vancing rural broadband development, and his help in establishing the Larimer County Office of Emergency Management. In addition to his work as commissioner, Lew added tremendous value to his commu-nity through his volunteer work. Lew was a member of the Loveland Volunteer Ski Patrol for 25 years and dedicated his time to local churches and charitable organizations. I am truly grateful to have been able to call Lew a friend and to have observed the dedica-tion and enthusiasm he served his community with. Lew was a remarkable individual with a terrific work ethic and a servant’s heart. His passing will be felt throughout his community and beyond.

HONORING THE LIFE OF ADE-LAIDE MARGARET CONNAUGHTON 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Ms. MENG. Mr. Speaker, Adelaide Margaret Connaughton, of Forest Hills, New York passed away unexpectedly on Saturday, May 12th, 2018. Adelaide was born in Brooklyn, New York on September 24, 1958 to Veronica (Ronnie) and Kenneth Connaughton. Adelaide Connaughton was a long-time community ac-tivist who participated in New York City politics and civic activities since she was 15 years old. In high school, Adelaide worked as an intern for then Assistant Queens District Attorney, Geraldine Ferraro, and went on to work for several elected officials, including the first Les-bian Latina member of the New York City Council, Margarita Lo´pez. Prior to joining the staff of Council Member Lo´pez, Adelaide served as a Lieutenant for the New York City Emergency Medical Service of the Fire Department of New York and re-tired after 20 years of service. She also briefly sold real-estate, and achieved ‘‘million dollar’’ agent status at a local real estate firm. Her last position before she passed away in May 2018 was as a Senior Entitlement Spe-cialist for the Fortune Society, a non-profit or-ganization with a 50-year track record of pro-viding those in the criminal-justice system with the supportive, wrap-around services needed to thrive as positive, contributing members of society. At Fortune, Adelaide provided assist-ance to formerly incarcerated men and women, and supported them as they re-en-tered society. In her spare time, Adelaide loved to be with family and friends and held many volunteer political and civic positions in New York City. Adelaide has always demonstrated a pas-sion for helping the most vulnerable among us, particularly homeless LGBT youth.

CONGRATULATING THE PASCUA YAQUI TRIBE ON ITS 40TH ANNI-VERSARY 
HON. RAU´L M. GRIJALVA 
OF ARIZONA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Pascua Yaqui Tribe on its 40th year anniversary of being federally-recog-nized. The Pascua Yaqui tribe descended from the Uto-Aztecan people, who occupied a large area of the Southwest regions and west coast of Mexico. Yaqui culture and spirituality are important elements to the tribe. The Pascua Yaqui tribe is best known for the deer dancer and Pascola, along other cultural ceremonies and Yaqui symbols such as ‘‘Our Father Sun;’’ the Tribe has successfully preserved its cul-tural relations through valued oral lore throughout the years. Today, the tribe has communities spanning across Southern Ari-zona surrounded by richly vegetated and sce-nic desert lands. The Pascua Yaqui Tribe provides unique in-sight that adds diverse cultural heritage to Ari-zona’s desert community. The tribe is well- known for its design and manufacture ceremo-nial paraphernalia such as artistic Baskets, reed crowns, wood mask carving, rattles, stuffed-deer heads, and notable arts unique to the Pascua Yaqui Tribe. At present, there are about one hundred hamlets and villages within the Yaqui territory, assigned for political, reli-gious, and ritual purposes. The linguistic clas-sification of the Tribe is a surviving language derived from the Cahita ethnicity, one that the Yaqui and Mayo people still preserve. The Yaqui were, and part still remain, settled agri-culturists, depending on summer rainfall due to the desert lowlands. Mr. Speaker, please join me and all of Ari-zona’s Third Congressional District in express-ing our sincerest congratulations to the Pascua Yaqui Tribe on their 40th anniversary as a Federally-recognized tribe. I am grateful for the Pascua Yaqui Tribe’s dedication to their culture and representation of the South-west Native American roots.

MR. RAY FITZGERALD’S REMARK-ABLE SERVICE TO HIS COUNTRY 
HON. MO BROOKS 
OF ALABAMA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in order to recognize the remark-able career of a great American, Mr. Ray Fitz-gerald, a distinguished member of the Senior Executive Service, upon the occasion of his retirement after 46 years of selfless service to our nation. A highly respected leader, Ray Fitzgerald has made immeasurable contribu-tions to the warfighter and the military commu-nity as a whole. Mr. Fitzgerald had an exemplary military ca-reer. Upon graduating from the University of Alabama in 1972, he entered the U.S. Army. Rising to the rank of Colonel, his assignments included; Chief of Staff of the deployed 101st Airborne Division Task Force in Kosovo; Com-mander of the 101st Airborne Division Garri-son at Fort Campbell, Ky.; Chief of Staff and Deputy Commander of the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk, La.; senior bri-gade observer/controller at the Joint Readi-ness Training Center (JRTC); and Com-mander of U.S. Forces in the Balkans (Bos-nia). Mr. Fitzgerald also commanded the 1st Battalion, 50 8th Infantry (Airborne) during Op-eration Just Cause. Mr. Fitzgerald was appointed to the Senior Executive Service after 30 years of Active Duty service as an Army Infantry Officer. He has led organizations at every level, culmi-nating in his assignment as the Vice Director of the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Organi-zation (JIDO). Mr. Fitzgerald served with distinction as the Deputy Director for Interagency and Inter-departmental Cooperation at the Joint Impro-vised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) and was the Department of Defense Executive Manager detailed to the FBI’s Ter-rorist Explosive Device Analytical Center (TEDAC), Quantico, VA. There he supported TEDAC’s mission to eradicate the lED threat by providing scientific and technical exploi-tation, actionable intelligence, timely re-sponses to requests and forecasting world-wide threats. While assigned to JIEDDO and JIDO, Mr. Fitzgerald has deployed multiple times to both Iraq and Afghanistan. His most recent deployment to Iraq in 2016 was as the Senior Coalition Advisor for the security of Baghdad. His 2014 deployment to Afghanistan was as the Senior Coalition Advisor/Mentor to the Afghanistan National Security Advisor. Prior to JIDO, Mr. Fitzgerald served at the Department of State, where he was the Chief of Staff for the Bureau of Resource Manage-ment. His State Department duties also in-cluded two 18 month tours in Afghanistan and Iraq, where he served as the senior State De-partment representative responsible for Af-ghanistan Police Reform and as the political advisor (POLAD) to Task Force 714. Ray Fitzgerald is the best friend a Warfighter ever had. He is a passionate, self-less leader who has devoted his life and ener-gies to ensuring Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines receive the best possible training, equipment, intelligence, and tactical support. While serving with JIDO, he has applied his extensive military background and knowledge to a myriad of material and non-material prob-lem sets. His tenure spanned some of the most dangerous and critical periods in our Na-tion’s fight against terrorism. As an aside, Mr. Fitzgerald never avoided a difficult task or as-signment, tackled every complex problem, and consistently made a difference for deployed Warfighters. Our Nation’s history is grounded in the ef-forts of those like Ray Fitzgerald, who have served this nation with great distinction. He exemplifies what it means to commit one’s life to his country and has more than earned our admiration and respect. Mr. Fitzgerald leaves a legacy of service that will most certainly serve as an inspiration to others for years to come. My fellow colleagues, please join me in con-gratulating Mr. Ray Fitzgerald as he enters the next chapter of his life. TRIBUTE TO FERNANDO MIGUEL NEGRON RODRIGUEZ HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I want to honor Fernando Miguel Negron Rodriguez, as a dis-tinguished leader in Central Florida for His-panic Heritage Month. Fernando Miguel Negron Rodriguez, was born and raised in the town of Cayey, Puerto Rico. He is the father of Fernando M. Negron Santos and Karina Isabella Negron Santos. He is the son of the legendary TV personality and radio Icon, Miguel Angel Negron. As one of the most popular radio hosts in the Hispanic community in Central Florida. To say that through his veins runs radio, it’s an understatement. For the last 20 years, he has been the host to Que´date con Miguel Radio, he is known to many as a great communicator but also as someone very passionate about the Hispanic community and educating voters in our region. Fernando M. Negron has become an influen-tial and respected personality in local politics as well as national politics. Every day he uses his experience to shine light at problems that affect the Hispanic diaspora in Central and South Florida.

IN MEMORY OF VAIL JOHNSON 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the life and memory of Vail Johnson, a young girl from my district who passed away unexpectedly on August 31, 2016 from a heart condition. Two years after her death, the North Texas community is continuing to honor her life through the work of Friends of Vail. This foun-dation, established by Vail’s parents Susan and Chad Chance, has dedicated a new out-door classroom at the Pilot Point intermediate school in her memory. Through the Friends of Vail foundation, her family has donated funds to other community needs both large and small. The foundation’s work is a testament to an extraordinary child. As a fourth-grade student at Pilot Point Elementary School, Vail was known for kindness and generosity. She loved horses, softball, and the color green. A bright student and writer, Vail also competed nation-ally as an equestrian and began playing soft-ball. Two years after her loss, Vail Johnson is re-membered as a girl who brought love and joy to others wherever she went. She is deeply missed, and her generous spirit will not be for-gotten. I extend my deepest condolences to her family, and all who knew and loved her.

CONGRATULATING DAVID ROLF ON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my friend, David Rolf for his years of dedicated work as founding presi-dent of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 775. After 15 years of im-pressive work, David is handing off the presi-dency of SEIU 775. In the years since David has led the union, he has been an indispen-sable force for labor issues in the State of Washington, and has been recognized nation-ally. I am certain he will continue to be in the years to come. David started his union career as an SEIU organizer where he worked hard and, over the years, rose through the ranks to become the Vice-President of SEIU International. There are few in my community who don’t admire the work he has done, and it is not hard to see why. David and SEIU 775 are a strong force motivated by the interests of the workers they represent. Whether it be winning raises for the care-givers his union represents, expanding SEIU 775 to represent more workers, or leading the movement for a fifteen dollar living wage in the cities of SeaTac and Seattle—a movement that spread throughout the nation, David’s passion for helping members of his community is astounding. His contribution to the fight for working people has changed the lives of so many, and earned the respect of many more. David will still be active and remain presi-dent of Working WA and the Fair Work Cen-ter. I look forward to hearing about his upcom-ing achievements. Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I rec-ognize David Rolf for his diligent work rep-resenting working Americans. I congratulate him on all of his success, and wish him all the luck in his future endeavors.

DR. THORNE’S 90TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. JARED POLIS 
OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, Dr. Oakleigh Thorne II’s accomplishments over the past six decades are truly inspirational—exuding tre-mendous dedication towards making a dif-ference to the wellness of our planet by edu-cating children about the importance of envi-ronmental consciousness. In 1954, Thorne founded the Thorne’s Nature Experience, which serves to environmentally educate adults and children about the importance of ecology, and its impacts on our economy, our social institutions and structures, and the plan-et. Additionally, Thorne helped found the Envi-ronmental Studies Department at Naropa Uni-versity here in Boulder. Thorne’s passion for protecting the environ-ment has driven him to defend and participate in over fifteen programs and boards that pre-serve open space within Boulder, Aspen, Key-stone, Denver, and even Wyoming. Thorne has also raised money for programs to pre-vent infrastructure from building on lands, and has even made personal investments in own-ing property to preserve the beauty of our nat-ural landscapes. Today, Thorne works with two different programs at Yale University: the External Board of the Yale Institute for Bio-sphere Studies and the Leadership Council for the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. Dr. Oakleigh Thorne’s contributions to envi-ronmental protections and education are more than anyone would hope to accomplish in three lifetimes. We could not wish you a happy 90th birthday without acknowledging all you’ve done thus far. Thank you for all you’ve done for the City of Boulder, the state Colo-rado, and the world at large. Happy 90th Birth-day. f 
CONGRATULATING THE CITY OF BESSEMER, MICHIGAN, FOR RE-CEIVING REDEVELOPMENT READY COMMUNITIES CERTIFI-CATION FROM THE MICHIGAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COR-PORATION 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, it’s my honor to recognize the city of Bessemer for receiving certification under the Redevelopment Ready Communities (RRC) program. Through more than 130 years of community investment and success, Bessemer has become an indispen-sable part of the Upper Peninsula and the State of Michigan. The Redevelopment Ready Communities program was first launched to assist Detroit suburbs in need of redevelopment by offering technical assistance, promoting best practices, and recognizing when improvements to local governance have been made. After seeing the success of the program, the initiative was ex-panded statewide by the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC). This certifi-cation is a formal recognition that the city of Bessemer has gone above and beyond what is required of them in order to improve its op-erations and be more competitive in today’s economy. Since its founding in 1887, Bessemer has played a vital role in forming the rich history of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. From its roots in the iron industry, the city has trans-formed into a strong community, a premier destination for lovers of the outdoors, and the home of one of the best Fourth of July cele-brations in the state—an event that culminates in the famous ‘‘Thunder on the Mountain’’ fire-works show. Through the city government’s capital improvement plan, zoning amend-ments, innovative marketing strategy, and em-phasis on public participation, Bessemer has shown that it is dedicated to improving its community and promoting the livelihoods of its citizens and small businesses. By being cer-tified as a Redevelopment Ready Community, the city of Bessemer has shown that it is pre-pared to continue and expand upon this suc-cess. This accomplishment will be recognized by the MEDC on October 9 at Bessemer City Hall Auditorium. Mr. Speaker, day after day, the city of Bes-semer continues to set a positive example of what can be achieved when the people of a community work together for the common good. It’s my honor to congratulate them for receiving RRC certification. On behalf of my constituents, I wish Bessemer all the best as it ventures into the future. f 
RECOGNIZING THE 125TH ANNIVER-SARY OF OSWEGO ELKS LODGE NO. 271 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the Oswego Elks Lodge No. 271, an American fraternity that is commemo-rating its 125th anniversary in Central New York. The Oswego Elks Lodge No. 271 was founded in 1893 with an inaugural initiation class of 30 members. The following year, the lodge received its official charter at the annual Grand Lodge Convention. When the lodge opened its new home in 1900, the group was the only civic or fraternal organization in Oswego that owned its meeting place. The Oswego Elks Lodge No. 271 would continue to convene at this building until the group pur-chased its current home in 1922, where they have held their meetings and events ever since. Since its inception, the Oswego Elks Lodge has found itself at the center of the Elks orga-nization in New York State. In 1932, member James H. Macklin was installed as State President at that year’s state convention in Rochester. Member Daniel J. Capella would later be installed as State President in 1987. Still an active member in the Elk community today, Capella was named a member of the Government Relations Committee at the na-tional convention in San Antonio, Texas earlier this year. Throughout its 125 year history, the Lodge has provided a number of valuable services to the Oswego community. Each year, the frater-nity hosts annual Soccer and Hoop Shoot con-tests for youth as well as a number of different dinners and dances. A participant in the Elks National Foundation Scholarships program, the Lodge has worked to give generous amounts of funding to deserving recipients each year. In addition, the group delivers sup-plies to the Syracuse VA Hospital, as well as the Oswego VA Clinic, and uses its Disabled American Veterans van to help transport vet-erans to and from appointments. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House to join me in celebrating the Oswego Elks Lodge’s 125 years of service to Oswego and the greater community of Central New York. As one of the region’s leading civic and social fraternities, the Lodge deserves ac-knowledgement and praise for its countless years of charitable service.

IN RECOGNITION OF MAPLEWOOD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AS A 2018 NATIONAL BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL 
HON. DAVID P. JOYCE 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I would like to acknowledge Maplewood Elementary School for being recognized as a National Blue Ribbon School for 2018. Since 1982, the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program has recognized public and private schools for aca-demic excellence. This year marks the third time the Maplewood Local School District has been awarded this honorable distinction. Ma-plewood Elementary School holds high aca-demic standards for each and every student. The Blue Ribbon recognition is a testament to the hard work and dedication of the students, teachers, and administrators of this out-standing school. There is no greater cause than educating the minds of the future. As a father, I know the amount of trust parents put into the hands of our educators. I am proud to have this example of academic excellence in Ohio’s 14th Congressional District and I con-gratulate Maplewood Elementary School on this well-deserved recognition.

CONSTITUENT COMMENTS ON SOBER LIVING HOME PROBLEMS 
HON. DANA ROHRABACHER 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to inform my colleagues about the hearing held by the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Con-stitution and Civil Justice on September 28, 2018 on the issue of sober living homes. I had the privilege of testifying at that hearing in support of my bill, H.R. 5724, to restore local oversight over sober living homes. As part of that testimony, I submitted to the Sub-committee letters from many of my constitu-ents about problems with sober living homes caused by current federal law preventing ap-propriate local oversight. For the benefit of my colleagues and the American people, I include in the R
ECORD the first group of these con-stituent letters below: 
Generally speaking, Mr. Rohrabacher, you’re not someone I feel represents me as a constituent. However, this is one topic I agree with you on, and I never thought I’d say that. I’ve seen the sober living home in-dustry firsthand. They exploit the despera-tion of addicts and their families, offer no real help, and when the addict relapses, they are kicked to the curb the same day and don’t get prorated their rent money. If they paid for a month and get kicked out 3 days later, they lose all that money. It’s actually more profitable for sober livings to have high failure rates because when the next person moves in, they effectively get paid twice for the bed; the forfeited rent and the new per-son’s. The sober living home doesn’t concern itself with whether or not the people they evict have somewhere to go. It’s not sur-prising that many end up on the streets. Many sober living homes are poorly main-tained, have bug infestations, are over-crowded, and residents regularly experience theft and violence. If the purpose of a sober living is to give someone a fresh start and chance at redemption, which it should be, then the sober living home industry has failed miserably, and that failure has proven lucrative for those who profit from human suffering. More accountability is needed, ad-dicts are people like everyone else, and de-serve better. STEPHANIE ASHLEY LARCOME , Westminster, California. 
About a year ago my small block of mostly retirees was introduced to ‘‘sober living homes’’. We were also introduced to loss of parking due to various vehicles with out of state plates, frequent local police responses, discarded needles, altercations both verbal and physical and loud music in the wee hours of the morning. Then the non-sober behavior escalated to the overdose and death of 24- year-old Mark Vallas of Chicago on February 24th, 2018. In March 2018, Tim Flinn, the co- owner of New Existence Recovery, which managed the sober living home where Mark Vallas died also overdosed and also died. On July 23rd, four squad cars, a fire truck and ambulance responded to yet another over-dose at the same house. Last week a house three houses down from the initial sober liv-ing home converted to a sober living home. Last week, police responded to a call regard-ing the new sober living home. And two days later the Huntington Beach Police Depart-ment responded yet again. The current sce-nario of unregulated and unsupervised resi-dences for addicts is not working. How many more addicts must die as local governments are threatened with lawsuits in an attempt to protect the health and welfare of all? Please take action and support corrective legislation. Thank you. P
ATRICIA ANNEQUINTANA , Huntington Beach, California. 
We were the unfortunate neighbors of a sober-living home a few years ago. The occu-pants were a source of constant nuisance and criminal activity. My children couldn’t play outside in our backyard due to the constant, heavy cigarette smoke and loud profanity coming from the residents. These homes don’t belong in residential neighborhoods. A
NNEDEBIE, Costa Mesa, California. 
I have lived at this address for 12 years. I have lived in this neighborhood for 27 years. In that time, I have seen cars be broken into at night. If cars are left unlocked, they are ransacked and items taken such as elec-tronic devices. This is routine and typical. Clearly it has increased over the years as more and more people come to the area for treatment and fail. This is a residential neighborhood and not a treatment/medical facility designated area. These homes are not normal by housing multiple adults that would typically have one or two residents in the same space otherwise. We need to stop encouraging such a huge influx of individuals into the community that don’t have jobs, family or a productive reason for being here. It creates a huge burden on the city and its residents. S
HEILA CIMINI , Costa Mesa, California. 
I am a physician in Laguna Beach and my area and many others around me are inun-dated with sober living homes. Unscrupulous property owners are making a fortune hous-ing these individuals, many recruited from out of state. I am sympathetic to these peo-ple and their problems, (as I have experi-enced the pain of addiction in my own fam-ily). However, many of these individuals seem largely unsupervised, hang out in groups around local businesses and our beau-tiful beaches smoking and making these areas less desirable for children, locals and tourists. Once their coverage ends, (if they have not overdosed in these homes) they are dumped onto the street in my area and con-tinue on as homeless. I very much would like to see out of state addicts stay out of state and the rapacious profits these homeowners make destroying my neighborhood ended. JAMES RUSSELL , M.D., Laguna Beach, California. 
A detox/sober living home went in across the street from me over 3 years ago. At the time my boys were 7 and 10. Too young to learn about drugs and inappropriate adult behavior. Since then, there have and con-tinues to be: puking, fighting, patient dump-ing in front of my house, drugs being deliv-ered to my house, medical supplies in front of my house, intimidation of residents and staff towards my children, we’ve almost been hit 3 times by staff and delivery persons while in my driveway, ambulances and firetrucks all hours of day and night, my house has been entered 3 times, my car bro-ken into 2 times, my children cannot play out front from the amount of cars, over 20 or more all day and night, drug deliveries on a regular basis including 2 a.m., parking issues, women walking around naked, cars parked with strangers watching my children, blocking of street, residents coming back with knives and kept outside endangering all the neighbors, house not being taken care of and endangering others with hanging roof parts in howling wind, U-turns 24 hours a day aimed at my house, my children and me, parking in front of my driveway blocking my cars, enormous trash with all the vermin that goes with it, blocking of fire hydrant every day, screaming arguing women out front with foul language in front of my chil-dren, unknown amounts of addicts visiting residents and house while using my driveway and staring at my children, runaway cars with no drivers, drug dealers approaching me after school with children, men leaving the house through side doors in the middle of the night, volatile women coming and going scaring my children, boyfriends of staff com-ing and going all hours of the night, the resi-dents have no air conditioning in extreme weather, no backup generator for power out-ages in cold weather, a regular hole in the front door, broken windows from storms, fire and rattlesnake hazard by not having reg-ular yard maintenance, code violations from the city, drinking. 24 hours a day, 7 days a week businesses that cater to convicted criminals do not belong in residential neigh-borhoods just doors down from a middle school, a most vulnerable population. Busi-nesses do not belong in neighborhoods at all. We moved here and paid millions to keep our children away from drugs, not to have them enter our house and have us living in fear. Have you ever had someone just walk into your home while you are with your family enjoying your Sunday afternoon or having Sunday dinner to the sound of puking out your front door? The fear that someone can walk into your home on drugs and fully high is paralyzing. Police cannot handle people high on drugs and they are trained and have weapons. Not once, not twice, but 3 times my house has been entered by a drug addict, a very scary staff person and a man trying to deliver dangerous meds in front of my chil-dren who would have died if ingested. I was told by the owner that they had insurance for that type of thing. Can you imagine los-ing your child or having them permanently injured but they have insurance? All in what was a safe neighborhood. No one locked their doors now we spend hundreds on security

cameras and lock our doors just to go to an-other room to do laundry in case someone decides to enter your house. Just last week a woman was outside yelling at a parked car about her situation. We had to hide in the house and be quiet because she might jump the fence and harm us if we were too noisy. I have boys. They are active. We have to modify our lives and have done for years. No playing out front without supervision. They are now 10 and 13. How sad to have lost part of their childhood. The workers talk very loudly about the residents and their private health problems right outside my door. They have special drivers that deliver some of the residents like they are at a hotel. Staff and residents are constantly changing, and they are not locals. How many of your neighbors move in and out daily? It’s unnerving. D
IANE BABCOCK , Laguna Beach, California. 
I was driving home from getting breakfast at 6 a.m. on a Sunday morning. As I was stopped at a light I could see a young man in the area of a Bank of America shooting up drugs. I drove over to him and yelled at him to put that down and to stop doing drugs in public where kids can see him. He imme-diately put down whatever he was doing. I asked if he was hungry and he said he was. I gave him half of my sandwich. I asked him why he was out here and doing this. He said he went home and was high and they kicked him out of his sober living house a few days ago. They always end up on the streets if they fail their program. I’ve seen several times where sober living is failing these peo-ple and they seem to be worse off than when they lived around their family and friends and now have no way to get back home. A
DATHORNTON , Costa Mesa, California. 
Yes, there are problems with facilities that are not licensed. There are many that are though and are trying to help these people. I work at a facility in Huntington Beach, we are licensed with the state and certified with the Joint Commission. I’m the program di-rector and deal mostly with our licensing. The problem with local governments that I’ve seen attempting to deal with the ‘‘prob-lem’’ is that they try and shut down all the facilities, even the good ones trying to actu-ally help. If the good facilities are forced to move out of neighborhoods, where would we go? Industrial areas aren’t zoned to have people living there and the cost of having to lease a building and construct it to accom-modate living facilities would put us out of business and other good facilities as well, meaning lots of people losing their jobs. There are many levels of care to the treat-ment process and the ‘‘sober living’’ you speak of is actually the lowest level of care, IOP, or a sober living is also just a house that’s rented out by people that are sober and aren’t actually affiliated with any kind of treatment program. Again, I think this bill would adversely affect the facilities that are trying to do the right things and help these people. IOP ‘‘sober living’’ does not re-quire any licensing or certifications so they aren’t held to any standards of conduct. Res-idential detox and RTC levels of care are. There needs to be a distinction between these in the bill. Unlicensed verses licensed. J
OSHJUROE , Fountain Valley, California. 
I’m writing regarding the sober living trag-edy that is plaguing our community. My family and I live in Huntington Beach, CA aka ‘‘Rehab Riviera’’ and this is a direct re-sult of unethical body brokering into many sober living homes and rehab recovery cen-ters throughout Huntington Beach. Prior to this new generation of entre-preneurs focusing on the sick, weak, drug and alcohol addicted, this community was like a Mayberry at the beach. Now, our com-munity has become a toxic waste of drug needles on the streets and across the beach-es, zombie like drug addicted sober living tenants roaming at all hours of the night, burglaries, harassment, fear to go to our local parks due to drug deals and para-phernalia being constantly discovered and baggies of drugs being left to be picked up and handed to me by my children in the local grocery store parking lot. This is a disgrace to our community and the situation is not be addressed by our local law enforcement. I personally have had sev-eral negative experiences with the tenants of the sober living homes, the recovery centers and those that decided to leave the unhealthy environments and live on the streets of Huntington Beach. The police have been called and they catch and release those that are clearly intoxicated with para-phernalia on them but ‘‘not enough’’ to ar-rest the person. My kids have picked up drug baggies and pointed at dirty needles and ran home from the parks due to the amount of ‘‘left by the wayside dropouts’’ from the re-covery centers and sober livings residing at the parks. Deaths have occurred in the sober livings and my children’s classmates have witness the deceased being rolled out and into ambulances. And to top it off, Wave-lengths Recovery Center is based on Main Street and the owner, Warren Boyd along with his employees and ‘‘patients’’ cloak the street bringing their riffraff, along with foul language, smoking and hanging about in groups of at least 10 along Main Street, while they watch their new multimillion dollar fa-cility being built on the corner of Main and Orange. Is this what we want to show our children as a way of life, is this what the tax payers are wanting in their community? The answer is no! Wavelengths continues to buy up his-torical properties just to tear them down and build multi-roomed homes to maximize ca-pacity for cash flow. It’s unethical and when the fire marshal shows up to check the facil-ity they are tipped off and take the over-stock of people are relocate them tempo-rarily or on a field trip in one of the many white vans that cruise through town aka ‘‘druggie buggies’’. Or we can touch on the fraudulent activi-ties that are being handled between the in-surance companies and these facilities. What are you going to do to protect our families and put a stop to these heinous acts that are plaguing this community and many others around Southern California? The amount of money that is being made off the trans-actions between recovery centers, sober livings and privately owned detoxes is astro-nomical and unacceptable. And has become a misrepresented solution for those addicted. I have many years of sobriety and once upon a time there was a chance to have the freedom I have today. For those that choose these facilities as a solution, there is a slim chance to stay sober. Our local politicians and law enforcement are not addressing this situation with any urgency and that is why I’m expecting you to take action on a larger scale. Please help us to restore safety to our community and remove these facilities. Thank you, R
OBIN GRISHAM , Huntington Beach, California. We live kitty corner to a sober living house. We are constantly hearing dogs bark-ing all night long. Several attempts were made with the manager to solve this issue however the dogs continue to bark. The resi-dents of the facility are still using drugs as they were found at the school as well as sell-ing drugs across the street from the middle school. That particular incident led to the police being called. The suspects ran through several backyards and tried to break into a house down the street. After this incident many residents including children are scared to sleep in their own homes and are seriously considering on moving. There are many chil-dren and elderly people in this area who are easy prey to drug dealers and users. I have been living here for 16 years and I am shocked that this type of thing is happening in my backyard. Not only has my sleep suf-fered I am having trouble concentrating at work. I am afraid for my special needs son’s safety because the suspect ran through our backyard. If this continues people can get hurt or lose their lives if it escalates. Please help us stop the sober living houses from spreading. It is a scam. It doesn’t help the people who are addicted. It allows them a safe place to continue to abuse drugs while stealing from the insurance companies to pay for treatment. These sober living houses only make the owner rich while exploiting those who need help. JENNIFER SHIELDS , Huntington Beach, California. f

CONGRATULATING FRANKLIN HIGH SCHOOL ON WINNING THE NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL MOCK TRIAL CHAMPIONSHIP 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Franklin High School’s Mock Trial team on winning the 2018 National High School Mock Trial Champion-ship. The 2018 championships saw teams from high schools all across the country. Pas-sionate students from over 40 states, the Mar-iana Islands, Guam, and South Korea met in Nevada, and presented their meticulously crafted legal arguments to a judge in hopes of convincing a jury to sympathize with their side. These students prepare for weeks in ad-vance to put together their case and, given the importance of the justice system, it is encour-aging to see teenagers show such enthusiasm to participate in it. Having worked as a pros-ecutor myself, I know the amount of prepara-tion that is needed to effectively present your argument. The fact that these students have been nationally recognized for their ability to do so speaks to the bright future ahead of them. This is the third time a mock trial team from Washington State has earned the national title—two of those times have been Franklin High School. I have no doubt that these stu-dents all have promising careers to look for-ward to. Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I rec-ognize Franklin High School’s extraordinary achievement, and its students for their dedica-tion to the legal system. HONORING THE LIFE OF REVEREND SAMUEL JOSEPH MAY HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Reverend Samuel Joseph May, who served as the second minister of the Uni-tarian Church of the Messiah in Syracuse from 1845 to 1868. Reverend May spent his career championing prevalent social issues in the 19th century, including abolitionism, women’s rights and education reform. For his advocacy of abolition, Reverend May was inducted into the National Abolition Hall of Fame in October 2018. Samuel Joseph May was born on Sep-tember 12, 1797 in Boston, Massachusetts. Following an incident that caused the death of his older brother, May decided to devote his life to God. He graduated from Harvard Divin-ity School in 1820 and became a Unitarian minister in Connecticut. Reverend May was the only Unitarian minister in Connecticut and this propelled him to the forefront of the Uni-tarian movement. Throughout the 1820’s, Rev-erend May spread the Unitarian message with lectures and publications, such as the The Lib-eral Christian. His broader goal during this time was to create a more peaceful society and reform the education system. In 1830, Reverend May was inspired to join the abolitionist movement after meeting Wil-liam Lloyd Garrison. He began working with several anti-slavery organizations, striving to create racial equality and improve education in schools throughout New England. In 1845, after 15 years of advocacy in the abolitionist movement, Reverend May settled in Syracuse and became the pastor at the Unitarian Church of the Messiah. Reverend May was extensively involved in aiding escaped slaves along the Underground Railroad after joining the Syracuse community. Most notably, he assisted in the rescue of a slave named William Henry who had been captured by local authorities. His efforts were ultimately successful and William Henry be-came a free man. Also while living in Syra-cuse, May increased his advocacy for wom-en’s rights and suffrage. His piece The Rights and Condition of Women spoke of struggles women faced in the 19th century, most nota-bly the lack of women’s voting rights. On July 1, 1871, Samuel Joseph May passed away at the age of 73. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House to join me in celebrating the work of Reverend Samuel Joseph May. His efforts to free our world from the evils of slavery and create a more equal society set an out-standing example for all our communities. I congratulate Reverend May on his induction into the National Abolition Hall of Fame and applaud the efforts of all freedom fighters, past and present. RECOGNIZING THE CAREER OF SERGEANT (RET.) RICHARD TAY-LOR HON. KEVIN McCARTHY 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. M
CCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today alongside my colleague, D
AVID VALADAO , to honor Mr. Richard ‘‘Dick’’ Taylor, a community leader from Bakersfield, California. Mr. Taylor retired this year from his position as the Direc-tor of the Kern County Veterans Service De-partment following a lifelong career of service to his community and nation. Born and raised in Bakersfield, Dick at-tended East Bakersfield High School and Ba-kersfield College. Throughout his youth, he had a keen interest in the Armed Services and serving his nation, which pushed him to join the United States Marine Corps. During his military service, Dick served around the world, with deployments in South America and around the Mediterranean Sea. Additionally, he served as a sergeant in several infantry units with the First Marine Division, with the 1st Battalion 5th Marines and 2nd Battalion 5th Marines, serving as a Section Leader in an 81mm Mortar Platoon, then as the Bat-talion Armorer. Prior to leaving the Marines with an honorable discharge, Dick received many medals over his career of service, in-cluding the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, Humanitarian Service Medal, and Sea Service Deployment ribbon. Upon returning to Bakersfield, Dick quickly re-immersed himself in the community he called home, working at his family’s Goodyear dealership, which he operated as President and General Manager for 27 years. Dick also got involved in matters impacting the state and county, serving as a delegate to the California Republican Party and also as a Field Rep-resentative for the California Off-Road Vehicle Association. He played a key role in estab-lishing neighborhood watches across Kern County by partnering with the Kern County Sheriffs Department to deliver presentations to communities. For six years, Dick continued his service to our community by working as a Field Representative for Kern County Super-visor Mike Maggard. Today, Dick continues to serve as one of Kern County’s Liaison Rep-resentatives for the Devil Pups Youth Program for America, where he counsels and trains Kern County’s youth in moral and ethical citi-zenry. Despite his many accomplishments, Dick is best known in town for his dedication to help-ing the veterans of Kern County. As the Kern County Veterans Service Officer, Dick worked each day to promote and honor all veterans, connecting Kern County’s approximately 47,000 local veteran heroes with the re-sources and services they fought and sac-rificed so much for. He is a happy warrior with a tireless work ethic, and his passion for our community’s veterans extends far beyond his desk at the Kern County Veterans Service De-partment. It is not uncommon to see Dick throughout Kern County supporting causes and organizations, such as Kern County Honor Flight, the Veterans History Project, and the Wounded Heroes Project. His efforts have directly made the Kern community a better, more supportive place for veterans to live.

TRIBUTE TO GONZALO GUTIERREZ LEMUS 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I want to honor Gonzalo Gutierrez Lemus as a distinguished leader in Central Florida for Hispanic Heritage Month. Gonzalo Gutierrez Lemus is a first- generation Mexican-American student with big dreams.

CELEBRATING ENERGY EFFICIENCY DAY HON. PETER WELCH 
OF VERMONT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Energy Efficiency Day and rec-ognize the great economic and environmental benefits the United States has realized since the first energy efficiency policies were en-acted more than 40 years ago. On Friday, Oc-tober 5, Americans from every corner of our country will join together to raise awareness of energy efficiency, celebrate the prosperity and innovation these policies have helped foster, and appreciate the work—past and present— of leaders in business, the non-profit sector, and government that has doubled the energy productivity of our economy since 1980. I am proud to count myself among them as a com-mitted advocate for national energy efficiency policy. Since the first energy efficiency policies were enacted in the 1970s, improvements in technologies and practices have resulted in energy savings worth more than 60 quadrillion British Thermal Units (BTUs) (quads) and avoided costs worth more than $800 million annually. Today, the energy efficiency sector boasts a workforce of about 2.25 million Amer-icans (including about 11,000 Vermonters). And the federal government—the largest en-ergy user on the planet—has worked with pri-vate-sector partners on investments that have lowered the energy intensity of government fa-cilities by over 47 percent. These savings are real, and without the gains in energy efficiency we would waste more energy, generate more harmful emissions, release more pollutants into the environment, rely more on foreign oil, and spend more on costly power plants and transmission lines. Any way you look at it, en-ergy efficiency is a wise investment and a worthwhile policy goal of the United States. As many of my colleagues know, energy ef-ficiency has a storied history of bipartisan sup-port in Congress. Since the Energy Policy and Conservation Act was passed in 1975, Con-gress has provided sweeping updates to fed-eral energy efficiency policy six times and ap-proved smaller measures many times. The last stand-alone energy efficiency legislation enacted, I am proud to say, was one I worked on with my colleague and good friend D
AVID M
CKINLEY of West Virginia, who sponsored the bill. We have made great progress over these four decades, but Energy Efficiency Day should be a reminder of our commitment to continue pressing on for our collective benefit. We must do more, achieve more, and save more—all while using less. Mr. Speaker, I en-courage my colleagues to join me in cele-brating Energy Efficiency Day and working across the aisle and across the Capitol to craft the next set of policies we need to remain en-ergy-efficient and productive in the 21st Cen-tury. WHATCOM COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEADERSHIP IN CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION HON. RICK LARSEN 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Whatcom Commu-nity College (WCC) for its leadership in cyber-security education. According to the U.S. Bu-reau of Labor Statistics, as of 2016 there were over 100,000 cybersecurity jobs in the U.S. Yet the cybersecurity workforce gap is pro-jected to reach 1.8 million unfilled cybersecu-rity jobs in 2020. Congress needs to invest in the future of the cybersecurity workforce. WCC is one example of how academic insti-tutions in the U.S. engage students in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) to excel in the cybersecurity field. As a National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance, WCC leads the expansion of cy-bersecurity education nationwide. WCC through their leadership in CyberWatch West, works to improve existing cybersecurity re-sources to develop effective training and teaching modules to raise awareness and build partnerships among academia and in-dustry. It is imperative for local communities to increase connections with industry around cy-bersecurity to better enable the U.S. to foster the growth and complexity Octobers edu-cation. In 2020, WCC is planning to apply to be-come a Center of Excellence in Cybersecurity. Designating WCC as the next Center of Excel-lence in Cybersecurity would provide valuable resources to community colleges seeking to improve their cybersecurity education pro-grams and foster innovation and interest in cy-bersecurity education throughout the U.S. I thank WCC for its contribution to cyberse-curity education in the U.S. and will continue to advocate for increased investment in STEM.

whether it be providing computer workstations for the visually impaired, or employing staff mobility instructors to ensure DeafBlind em-ployees are able to travel independently with a white cane or service dog. The Lighthouse for the Blind has steadfastly stood by their main philosophy of supporting the workplace needs of all their employees. They are the largest employer of DeafBlind people in the nation, as well as the largest employer of blind people on the West Coast. The Lighthouse for the Blind goes above and beyond to support its employees. It does not surprise me that they got their start near my district—as they reflect our key values. It is critical that all members of our commu-nity feel uplifted, and that they are given the tools they need to have successful and ful-filling lives. When we hold each other up, as clearly shown by The Lighthouse for the Blind, everyone benefits. The Lighthouse for the Blind will be cele-brating their centennial on September 15th where they will reflect on the last 100 years, and look forward to the next 100 years. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I congratulate The Lighthouse for the Blind on 100 years of success, and commend them for the vital role they play in our community.

IN HONOR OF CATHEDRAL HIGH SCHOOL’S CENTENNIAL ANNI-VERSARY 
HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Cathedral High School in celebration of its 100th anniversary. The people of Indiana’s 5th Congressional District are forever grateful for Cathedral High School’s commitment to preparing all students to be successful, competent, concerned, re-sponsible, and ethical members of society. It is a pleasure to congratulate Cathedral High School in Indianapolis, Indiana in celebration of this special occasion. Cathedral has been an integral part of the Indianapolis community since its founding by the Indianapolis Catholic Diocese on Sep-tember 13, 1918. Founded as an all boys Catholic high school, Cathedral has seen tre-mendous growth, from 90 students in 1918 to nearly 1,200 today. Originally on the second floor of Cathedral Grade School at 13th and Pennsylvania, the school moved in 1927 to 14th and Meridian, where it stayed for 50 years. Today the school operates under the direction of the Cathedral Trustees, Inc. as an independent private institution located at 56th Street and Emerson Way. In 1976, girls were integrated into the student body for the first time. Today, Cathedral is a premier Catholic high school in the Holy Cross tradition. The school draws students from Marion County and nine other central Indiana counties. Before attend-ing Cathedral, students attended approxi-mately 130 different schools. According to its mission, Cathedral ‘‘transforms a diverse group of students spiritually, intellectually, so-cially, emotionally, and physically to have the competence to see and the courage to act.’’ This mission is carried out both in and out of the classroom by students, parents, teachers, administrators, and coaches through various academic programs and over 120 co-curricular activities. The Fighting Irish have a long his-tory of excellence earning over 60 state cham-pionships across all their sports teams. With a 13:1 student-teacher ratio, Cathedral has a highly personalized, faith-based approach to learning. This approach has resulted in 100 percent of graduating seniors being accepted into colleges and universities across the coun-try. Cathedral’s commitment to its students and their success was recognized by the U.S. Department of Education in 1988, 2004 and again in 2016, when Cathedral earned the dis-tinction as a ‘‘Blue Ribbon School of Excel-lence.’’ The school’s personalized approach to edu-cation has made Cathedral home to a robust alumni network, with previous graduates num-bering among some of the most accomplished business, community, government, and reli-gious leaders in the state and country. These graduates strive to distinguish themselves as scholars, servant leaders and role models who are culturally competent, engaged in the glob-al society, sound in mind and body and spir-itually active. It is important to our nation’s future to en-courage and raise a new generation of Ameri-cans who have the skills, knowledge, and compassion to succeed both in and out of the classroom. Students like those at Cathedral give me hope that we will accomplish this vital mission. Their outstanding work is an inspira-tion to students, educators and parents across the nation. Congratulations on 100 years of excellence in the academic and religious edu-cation of Indiana high school students.

CONGRATULATING INTER-NATIONAL COMMUNITY HEALTH SERVICES ON 45 YEARS OF SERVICE 
HON. ADAM SMITH

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate International Com-munity Health Services (ICHS) on 45 years of dedicated service to the community. ICHS was founded in the 1970s when a group of advocates emphasized one of the City of Seattle’s underserved populations. These advocates recognized elderly, low-in-come, Asian immigrants did not have a place where they could receive healthcare, and be properly informed about their health decisions. This small group of advocates, took it upon themselves to create change, and opened a small clinic—the Asian Community Health Clinic. They started this clinic with the goal of providing culturally and linguistically appro-priate services to those who needed it. As the years went by, their small clinic grew both in size and in the range of services they offered, and changed its name to International Community Health Services. Today, ICHS is larger than ever, having expanded to provide dental care and a vision clinic. Not only have they expanded, but they have also stayed true

to their founding priorities, and offer healthcare services to an ever growing list of minority populations providing in-language medical services for elderly citizens in over 50 lan-guages. ICHS reflects some of the best elements of our community. They took a problem that af-fected a large group of underserved people, and decided to take it upon themselves to work towards resolving it. Healthcare in this country is an area where there is still a lot of work to do. Good healthcare is still unattain-able to many in this country which is why I am grateful to ICHS for making a difference in this area. This February marked the 45th anniversary of the founding of ICHS, and I look forward to hearing about the important work they do in the coming years. Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I rec-ognize ICHS for their essential work in the 9th District and the surrounding area, and I wish them continued success in their mission.

COMBATING SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN SCIENCE ACT OF 2018 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today I am joined by 31 of my colleagues in introducing the Combating Sex-ual Harassment in Science Act of 2018. The nation at large is beginning to reckon with the pervasiveness of sexual harassment and its impact on the lives and careers of women, in-cluding in academia. The academic workplace, when compared to the military, private sector, and government, has the second-highest rate of sexual harass-ment, with 58% of women in academia experi-encing sexual harassment. This behavior un-dermines career advancement for women in critical STEM fields, and many women report leaving promising careers in academic re-search due to sexual harassment. Women of color are even more likely to experience sex-ual harassment and to feel unsafe at work. We cannot afford—morally, scientifically, or economically—to continue to lose these skilled scientists and engineers, particularly from groups that are already underrepresented in STEM. As recommended in a recent report by the National Academies, this bill establishes a Na-tional Science Foundation program to support research into the factors contributing to sexual harassment in the scientific workforce, as well as the collection of data on the prevalence of sexual harassment in STEM. Furthermore, this bill directs the Office of Science and Tech-nology Policy to issue uniform policy guide-lines to Federal science agencies to ensure every agency has clear policies and dedicated resources to prevent and respond to incidents of sexual harassment at academic institutions receiving federal research funding. It also cre-ates an interagency working group to improve coordination and communication among agen-cies. It is our hope that this legislation will build upon progress already made by the National Science Foundation through recent updates to its sexual harassment policy. It is vital that grantees, as stewards of Federal money, take seriously their responsibility to foster a healthy working environment as they train the next generation of scientists. It is encouraging that other agency heads have expressed intent to address sexual harassment in research. Na-tional Institutes of Health Director, Dr. Francis Collins, and nominee for Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, Dr. Kelvin Droegemeier, have both made strong state-ments regarding their intent to tackle the prob-lem of sexual harassment in STEM, and I look forward to seeing these intentions translate into meaningful actions. Our bill is just a start-ing point. Every agency has unique challenges and significant change will require creative so-lutions. Scientific societies also play an important role in combating sexual harassment in the sciences. For example, the American Associa-tion for the Advancement of Science recently adopted a policy that allows the AAAS Council to revoke Fellow status for scientific mis-conduct, which includes sexual harassment. I am pleased that my legislation is endorsed by numerous scientific societies. In developing this bill, feedback from university organizations and scientific societies has been invaluable, and it is encouraging that so many key players are committed to addressing sexual harass-ment in science. This legislation has also been vetted by the National Science Foundation and the Office of Science and Technology Policy, who will be instrumental in carrying out its provisions, and the National Academies, whose recommenda-tions we seek to codify. The result of this process is a bill that enables a coordinated approach to addressing the problem of sexual harassment at grant-receiving institutions and that funds research that will serve as the foun-dation for future initiatives in this area. I thank all of the Members who have co-sponsored this legislation, and I urge the rest of my colleagues to join us and help move this legislation forward into law.

IN MEMORY OF LYNN FALLOWS 
HON. RICK LARSEN 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of Lynn Fallows. Lynn was a passionate mother, wife, teacher and ovarian cancer research advocate. On August 16, 2018, Lynn lost her battle with ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecologic cancer and the fifth-leading cause of cancer deaths for women in the U.S. Despite ad-vancement in medicine, no effective screening test exists for ovarian cancer. To complicate factors, symptoms are hard to catch in early stages, if not altogether absent. In February 2015, Lynn was diagnosed with Stage III ovarian cancer. Lynn did not have a family history of ovarian cancer and, like many women diagnosed, was completely blindsided by her diagnosis. Like the fighter she was, Lynn wasted no time educating herself and getting involved in the ovarian cancer commu-nity. The month she was diagnosed, Lynn started a blog to share her experiences and connect with other ovarian cancer patients and sur-vivors. Within a year of her diagnosis, she began volunteering at the Rivkin Cancer Cen-ter in Seattle to help educate women and raise awareness about ovarian cancer. She later joined the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund Alliance’s Advocate Leader program to advocate for ovarian cancer research and ex-panded access to care. Mr. Speaker, Lynn dedicated the last years of her life making a difference in the lives of others through her advocacy work. Her family and friends will greatly miss and always re-member Lynn’s dedication, resilience and te-nacity. f

HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I want to honor Dr. Edwin DeJesus as a distinguished leader in Central Florida for Hispanic Heritage Month. Dr. DeJesus is a graduate from the University of Puerto Rico, School of Medicine, and com-pleted his Internal Medicine training and Infec-tious Disease fellowship at the Medical Col-lege of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. He is board certified in Infectious Diseases and holds a faculty appointment at the University of Central Florida, School of Medicine in Or-lando, Florida.

HONORING NAPA VALLEY COMMUNITY FOUNDATION 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Napa Valley Community Foundation (NVCF) for its commitment to helping our community during times of dis-aster. Napa Valley Community Foundation was founded in 1994 and since then has distrib-uted more than 50 million dollars to important causes in Napa Valley. For more than a dec-ade it has spearheaded relief and recovery ef-forts following disasters and filled in the gaps to ensure residents received needed assist-ance. NVCF is a vital organization that has supported our community time and time again. After the New Year’s Flood on the Napa River in 2006, the earthquake in August 2014 and the October 2017 Wildfires, Napa Valley Community Foundation provided aid and fund-ed services for those affected and displaced. Following these disasters and recoveries, NVCF developed best practices for short-term, intermediate-term and long-term disaster relief. To address the many needs of our community and the inevitable gaps in the recovery proc-ess, NVCF partners with nonprofits and do-nors to ensure financial resources are avail-able where they are most needed. Addition-ally, Napa Valley Community Foundation part-ners with associations, businesses, individuals and government agencies to provide aid to our community. Napa Valley Community Foundation man-ages the Napa Valley Community Disaster Re-lief Fund, which was established after the 2014 earthquake with a 10 million dollar lead gift from Napa Valley Vintners. The Fund raised an additional 15 million dollars after the October 2017 Wildfires, which greatly assisted local recovery efforts. Because of the Fund, 15,000 fire survivors received immediate relief services such as temporary shelter, meals and medical care; and over 2,000 workers, house-holds and small businesses received direct fi-nancial aid. Mr. Speaker, Napa Valley Community Foun-dation has been a lifeline to our community during times of disaster. It is therefore fitting and proper that we honor it here today.

CELEBRATING THE 60TH ANNIVER-SARY OF THE DOWNEY SYM-PHONY ORCHESTRA AND THE DOWNEY SYMPHONIC SOCIETY 
HON. LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Downey Symphony Or-chestra and the Downey Symphonic Society on their six decades of broadening the cultural and educational horizons of the people of Downey, California, and beyond. On October 20, 2018, the Downey Sym-phony Orchestra (DSO), directed and con-ducted by Sharon Lavery, commences its 60th season of concerts. The DSO has moved and inspired generations of Downey residents, and many from surrounding communities, who would otherwise not have access to live sym-phonic music. The orchestra has fulfilled the hopes of its founders, a group of civic-minded citizens supported by civic and government leaders, who created the DSO in 1957 to help make Downey a more desirable place to live and to do business. Since 1958, the non-profit Downey Sym-phonic Society (DSS) has sponsored the DSO and its educational outreach programs. The society is governed by a volunteer board of di-rectors, who organize and publicize the DSO concerts; seek support from foundations and government entities; solicit donations from in-dividuals, businesses, and service organiza-tions; and promote the symphony. The DSS also enjoys the support of a very enthusiastic and active guild of over 200 members. Each year, the DSO presents three sub-scription concerts in the Downey Theatre in the fall, winter, and spring. The orchestra reaches a larger audience in the summer at its annual free ‘‘Concert in the Park’’ in Furman Park. The summer concert emphasizes selec-tions from musical theatre and films. DSO programs are designed to appeal to a broad audience in terms of age, musical so-phistication and taste, and ethnic and cultural background. In addition to the standard rep-ertoire, programs include works by Latino and Spanish composers and by contemporary composers. The symphony has premiered and commissioned major works, including Oscar Navarro’s ‘‘Downey Overture,’’ which has been declared the city’s ‘‘Official Symphonic Music’’; Bryan Curt Kostors’ ‘‘To Dust’’; and Lars Clutterham’s ‘‘Downey Celebration Suite.’’ The DSO and its members have also worked to promote music appreciation among our youth. In 1995, the previous DSO music director, Thomas Osborn, started the ‘‘Music in the Schools’’ program, which introduces stu-dents to all instruments and sections of the or-chestra. Today, the program reaches almost 20,000 school children a year, including visits during winter and spring by a quintet of DSO musicians to the 13 public and four private el-ementary schools in Downey. Musicians present a sequential, multi-year curriculum on fundamentals of music, such as rhythm, mel-ody, and style, and they perform specially ar-ranged pieces. In addition, two full orchestral concerts are presented for school children at the Downey Theatre. Major funding comes from the City of Dow-ney, the Los Angeles County Performing Arts Commission, the Music Performance Trust Fund of the Musicians Union, the Downey Kiwanis Foundation, and the Downey Unified School District. In addition, the society’s noble mission has been recognized in recent years with two grants from the National Endowment for the Arts. Thanks to the efforts of these supporters and others, the DSO is able to make its ticket prices more affordable and ac-cessible for local residents. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to please join me in saluting the Downey Symphony Or-chestra and the Downey Symphonic Society for providing 60 years of musical enjoyment to communities in my 40th Congressional District of California. Thanks to the continued work of these organizations, the people of Downey and beyond can look forward to many more music-filled years to come. HONORING RICHARD ROMERO HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Seattle Credit Union’s CEO, Richard Romero, for his work helping low income and immigrant families in and around Seattle. Mr. Romero is an example of the American dream in practice. He and his mother immi-grated to the United States from Peru when Mr. Romero was just four years old. He began kindergarten unable to speak English, but through perseverance, he received his Bach-elors of Science in Organizational Manage-ment from La Verne University. Starting his career as a bank teller, Mr. Romero worked his way up through the banking system, and made a name for himself as Chief Operating Officer of the LA Firemen’s Credit Union. Today, Mr. Romero serves as CEO of Seattle Credit Union (SCU) where he has led the co-operative to massive growth and expansion. In his time as CEO, Mr. Romero has di-rected SCU according to the values of com-munity engagement that he grew up with. Under his leadership, SCU has opened two new branches in low income neighborhoods, and begun to offer a variety of resources for immigrants and the underbanked. These re-sources include: a citizenship loan program and emergency financial planning information for immigrant families. Mr. Romero’s empa-thetic approach to running a credit union has not gone unnoticed, as he was named Trail-blazer CEO of the year by the Credit Union Times—an honor he has more than earned. Mr. Romero’s story serves as a reminder of the importance of perseverance and commu-nity involvement. Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I recognize the work that Mr. Ro-mero, and the Seattle Credit Union have done for the Community.

CONSOLER-IN-CHIEF: MAYOR MERLE AARON 
HON. TED POE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Mayor Merle Aaron has faithfully served the folks of Humble since his election to Humble City Council in 2005 and his election to Mayor in 2015. My friend, Merle, is a well-respected businessman, devoted family man, and a pas-sionate advocate for the citizens of Humble, Texas. His patriotic spirit, love for God, and love of the community make him a natural pro-moter of the Humble area. Merle was the middle child in a family of five boys and four girls that grew up in Edinburg, Texas, near the Texas-Mexico border. He was the first in his family to graduate from Edin-burg High School. He was working in con-struction when he met the love of his life and best friend, Linda. They moved their family up to Humble from the Lower Valley in the early 1960s, back when the Bush Intercontinental Airport was nothing but trees. Merle super-vised the crew that poured the runways at

Bush between concourses A and B for the opening of what was then the Houston Inter-national Airport in 1969. Merle poured con-crete all over Houston, including the original Interstate 10. He came across a job with the Marriott Corporation, where he really got to focus on his construction and maintenance certifications. He took computer classes at Lone Star College—Kingwood, eventually earning the top HVAC license. When Marriott wanted to promote Merle and send him to Cin-cinnati, his family had already considered Humble home. He then quickly put that me-chanical education to use and decided to start his own company. In 1978, family-owned and operated Aaron Mechanical opened. Aaron Mechanical had water bill and permit-ting issues with the City of Humble. Rather than battling with the city, Merle ran for Hum-ble City Council to help come up with solu-tions. In 2005, he turned over Aaron Mechan-ical to the experienced hands of his son. This gave him the opportunity to run for Humble City Council and eventually, mayor for the City of Humble. As mayor, Merle has placed a sig-nificant importance in infrastructure. He fo-cused efforts into public safety by improving roads and drainage. Merle has many times been described as ‘‘having a servant’s heart’’, and that held true during the devastation of Hurricane Harvey. He worked tirelessly trying to fulfill the needs of the people of Humble, opening up the Hum-ble Civic Center as a shelter, talking with peo-ple who lost everything, hugging and crying with them. Merle worked aggressively to have contractors ready as quickly as possible to begin the debris removal process. The Lake Houston Chamber of Commerce has been selecting a Citizen of the Year since 1969, recognizing those who show selfless public service and sacrifice. It was no question that Merle most deserved to win the Haden E. McKay, MD Citizen of the Year for 2017. But if you ask him, he would tell you, ‘‘All the first responders and volunteers who went into the flooded areas of Humble to help people af-fected by Hurricane Harvey. These are our citizens of the year.’’ The City of Humble is important to the Aaron Family. Merle and Linda have three children, eight grandchildren, and 14 great grandchildren, who all have or are currently going through Humble ISD schools. For 55 years, their place of worship has been First Baptist Church of Humble. The Aaron family has deep roots in Humble, Texas. Always giv-ing back to the place they call home. And that’s just the way it is.

TRIBUTE TO NANCY BATISTA 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I want to honor Nancy Batista as a distinguished leader in Central Florida for Hispanic Heritage Month. Nancy Batista is a Guatemalan immigrant who came to the U.S. at a very young age. She is the Florida State Director of Mi Familia Vota. Nancy was raised in a single parent home, she understands the sacrifices her mother had to make as she worked three shifts in different factories to sustain the family. Growing up, her family experienced many hurdles due to their immigration status. Now she uses those experiences as a driver. Nancy is a wife and mother of two kids, An-thony and Natalie; they are her biggest inspi-ration. She obtained her Master’s degree in Busi-ness Administration dual concentration in Human Resources and Project management with a scholarship from Herzing University and her Bachelor’s degree in Health Services Ad-ministration from the University of Central Flor-ida. She is thrilled to be a part of the Mi Familia Vota team. She hopes to be an advocate and voice for those who are oppressed. Under her leadership as Florida State Direc-tor, she has led her team to register over 27,000 people to vote this year alone and they are working hard to register 30,000 people by October 9th. Mi Familia Vota is a nonprofit and non-partisan organization, it is their mission to build Latino political power. This year, Mi Familia Vota partnered with the League of Woman Voters to help translate a Voter Guide for Orange county. Nancy is focused on partnering with other organizations that share the same values and agendas to help promote unity in our commu-nities. She believes that our communities will greatly benefit from being continuously in-volved in our government and election proc-esses and she ensures that Mi Familia Vota will be supportive through civic engagement participation. f 
RECOGNIZING FLORIDA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY’S 60TH ANNI-VERSARY 
HON. BILL POSEY 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the 60th anniversary of Florida Insti-tute of Technology (‘‘Florida Tech’’). Dr. Je-rome P. Keuper founded this private, non-prof-it university as a ‘‘night school for missile-men,’’ allowing workers at Cape Canaveral to pursue graduate education. Initially named ‘‘Brevard Engineering College,’’ Florida Tech held its first classes on September 22, 1958. Since its humble beginnings, Florida Tech has soared to great heights. The university now serves nearly 10,000 students through its Melbourne campus, its extended study sites across the nation, and its online facilities. Boasting more than 60,000 alumni around the world, Florida Tech has earned a spot in U.S. News & World Report as the number one national university in attractiveness to inter-national students. This is the fourth year in a row that Florida Tech has been recognized for its diverse student body. Florida Tech has also been recognized for the remarkable leadership of President T. Dwayne McCay and First Lady Mary Helen McCay. This past November, the couple was inducted into the Florida Inventors Hall of Fame in honor of the 15 joint patents they hold in the field of metallurgical engineering. Mayors Kathleen Meehan of Melbourne and Hal Rose of West Melbourne have testified to the significant educational and cultural con-tributions that Florida Tech has made to the region, the state, the nation, as well as the globe. Through ‘‘the university’s core values of research to benefit all humankind; student success for a lifetime; and good global citizen-ship,’’ Florida Tech has raised the bar for every institution of higher education. Last month marked 60 years since the founding of the university that began its life as ‘‘countdown college.’’ Mayor William Capote of Palm Bay delivered remarks at the anniver-sary celebration, and, in a fitting touch, Florida Tech commemorated its achievement by launching fireworks into the sky, reminding many graduates of the rockets and satellites they have helped launch beyond Earth’s at-mosphere. I urge my colleagues to join me in congratu-lating Florida Tech, as well as its faculty, staff, students, and graduates. Please rise in honor of the university’s 60 years of educating excel-lence. f

OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 50th Anniversary of the Great Locomotive Chase Festival in the city of Adairsville, Georgia. In 1968, Marion Lacey, principal of Adairsville High School wanted to host a Fes-tival in the fall for students and members of the community to come together. Two years later, the festival was moved to the downtown Adairsville area, and was renamed the Great Locomotive Chase Festival to commemorate the event during the Civil War when ‘‘the Texas’’ pursued ‘‘the General’’ for eighty- seven miles, passing through the city of Adairsville. This longstanding Adairsville tradition is the 2nd oldest festival in the state of Georgia, and hosts over 30,000 people during the three-day event. The parade, pageants, live entertain-ment, rides, a wide selection of southern fare, and fireworks, offers something for every member of the community. The 50th anniver-sary GLCF will be held this year on October 5–7. On behalf of Georgia’s 11th Congressional District, I recognize the City of Adairsville, the Mayor, and the City Council on this 50th anni-versary of the Great Locomotive Chase Fes-tival.

they gather for their 50-year high school re-union. I am proud to congratulate all of this class as they bring old friends together and cele-brate everything they have accomplished since their graduation 50 years ago. As students at M.B. Smiley, these individ-uals were instilled with the values of a strong work ethic, leadership, and service which en-abled them to succeed in whatever endeavor they chose later in life. This has been made evident by the many educators, doctors, law-yers, community leaders, and elected officials that have gone on to excel in their personal and professional lives. Through their dedica-tion and commitment, many have left a lasting impact on their communities and the people around them—ensuring the preservation of the strong legacy of M.B. Smiley High School. After graduation, numerous young men and women from the class of ‘68 went on to serve in the U.S. Armed Forces during the Vietnam War—with some paying the ultimate sacrifice for our country. These great individuals self-lessly fulfilled their duty and defended our Na-tion in a time of war, and we thank them for their steadfast service and dedication to coun-try. As this group of former students once again joins together to meet with their fellow class-mates from the class of 1968, I am proud to recognize this momentous occasion and wish them the best as they celebrate their 50-year reunion.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Dr. Andrew Torget, a history pro-fessor at the University of North Texas, on his record-breaking accomplishment. This sum-mer, he set out to teach the entire history of Texas in one continuous lecture. Dr. Torget’s passion for the Portal to Texas History moti-vated him to use his world record lecture to raise money for the preservation of historic documents. During this very long lecture, Dr. Torget taught the history of the Lone Star State, from prehistoric times to present day. Speaking for 26 hours straight, Dr. Torget raised nearly $20,000 to help chronicle and preserve the history of Texas. Through social media cov-erage and a live-stream of the event, people as far away as Ireland heard the stories of our great State. As an alum of the University of North Texas, I am particularly honored to congratulate him on this world-renowned achievement. It is an honor to represent Dr. Torget and the Univer-sity of North Texas, in the U.S. House of Rep-resentatives.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF OL’ BILL—MR. BILL CARTER 
HON. TED POE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, way out west, Texas that is, where one can always find a back road and porch with a rocking chair, are towns like Spring, Texas and La-redo, Texas. Here, one could always find Mr. Bill Carter telling stories about how he grew up, sharing past hunting adventures, and ex-plaining how he started Carter’s Country. Ol’ Bill in his starched jeans, crisp shirt, and worn boots was a fine businessman, hunter, husband, father, and devoted family man. He spent his entire life building his family busi-ness, enjoying the outdoors, and serving his community. Spring, Texas and the entire state of Texas lost a legend of a man on October 2, 2018. Bill was born in 1934, in a small town in North Carolina. As a child, his love for fire-arms began at the age of eleven when he bought a used Winchester 22 pump. During this time, his love of the outdoors grew. And at an early age he began delivering papers, he was an entrepreneur in the making. During high school years, Bill joined the North Carolina National Guard. After gradua-tion, he joined the United States Marine Corps. His lifelong passion for firearms deep-ened. He considered a career with the Marine Corps, but decided to leave in 1956 to con-tinue his education. After returning from the Korean War, Bill re-alized college was not for him. He became a seaman on a merchant ship. While sailing routes from Houston to New Jersey, he dis-covered a love for the Houston area. At the end of his shipping route, he met his future wife, Ellen, in New Jersey. Bill and Ellen married and soon talked her into moving to Houston. He got a job as an ironworker, and Ellen worked in the emer-gency room as a registered nurse at Hermann Hospital. He soon started doing custom gun work in his garage for his ironworker friends. His wide-ranging knowledge of guns made him well known in the Houston area. Through Bill and Ellen’s hard work and dedication, they purchased 15 acres of land and a gun club on Aldine Westfield near FM 1960. In 1969, business was booming so they pur-chased a larger piece of property off Treaschwig in Spring, Texas. This location is currently Carter’s Country headquarters. Ellen retired from nursing and helped with everyday business. They had two kids, Billy and Lori. Billy and Lori took over many Carter respon-sibilities and both play an important role in the Carter legacy. Bill’s love of outdoors and passion for hunt-ing brought him to ranching. In the late 70s, he purchased Sombrerito Ranch in South Texas. He treasured managing a 100% native South Texas deer herd. His bucks have the famous 10-point genes. His 11,000 acre ranch was originally part of the Spanish land grant, and now it is known for producing some of the best trophy bucks in North America. Today, the Carter’s have four retail stores, a gun range, and elk and whitetail hunting ranches. It is my hope that Bill’s legacy will be remembered and folks will see if a humble southern boy with modest beginnings can achieve his American dream, they can too. Of course—with hard work, perseverance, pas-sion and dedication. I consider it an honor to have known this true Texas cowboy and have him as a friend. My thoughts are with the love of his life, Ellen, and their two children. They all share the same passion for the great Texas out-doors. His memory will live on, in the many lives he touched along the way. Texas will miss Ol’ Bill, Happy Trails. Semper Fi. And that’s just the way it is.

Standing for ‘‘Realizing Educational Achievement Can Happen,’’ this needs-based mentorship and college scholarship program provides opportunity for academically-prom-ising students from their eighth grade year through high school. In addition to remaining in high academic standing, students are re-quired to meet with a mentor and maintain good attendance. Upon graduation from high school and successful completion of the pro-gram, the student is awarded a $10,000 schol-arship toward the cost of any HOPE-eligible institution in Georgia. These REACH Georgia scholars are our fu-ture. Georgia has made a commitment to awarding those in need who demonstrate a high level of merit—an investment that will in-crease our workforce and grow our economy. I am proud that we take these steps to ensure a brighter future for our children, our state, and our Nation. Mr. Speaker, I expect great things from each of these special young scholars, and on behalf of Georgia’s 10th Congressional Dis-trict, I offer them my congratulations and wish them continued success.

HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Paul Scott. He has been recognized as the 2017 employee of the year by the City of Kent, for his hard work and dedicated commitment to go above and be-yond what is asked of him.

CELEBRATING TAIWAN’S 107TH NATIONAL DAY 
HON. ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, October 10, or Double Ten Day, marks Taiwan’s l07th National Day. From our shared values of free-dom and respect for human rights to our strong economic relationship, Taiwan is a nat-ural and important partner for the United States, and I would like to take this oppor-tunity to wish the people of Taiwan a very Happy Double Ten Day. Over the years, through its commitment to democracy, its contributions to global health initiatives, international development, and hu-manitarian missions, Taiwan has proven its leadership on the global stage. Taiwan has delivered critical aid and supplies in times of need to places such as Haiti, the Philippines, West Africa, Japan, and even in our very own Texas, after hurricane Harvey. Taiwan has also contributed to important non-humanitarian missions, including significant efforts as part of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS. Taiwan’s leadership and humanitarian com-mitment is even more impressive considering the increasing degree of coercion and intimi-dation emanating from Beijing. China’s efforts to block Taiwan from international organiza-tions are depriving the world of Taiwan’s knowledge and expertise, causing unneces-sarily dangerous situations in everything from global health to international commercial flight. With the support of the United States and other like-minded partners, I know that efforts to deny Taiwan appropriate recognition and participation in international organizations will ultimately be overcome. Taiwan is a beacon of freedom, serving as an inspiration for the oppressed, a model for future democratic transitions, and an anchor of security in the Pacific. It is crucial that the U.S. provides the kind of assistance—politically, militarily, and economically—that will allow Taiwan to resist Beijing’s increasing coercion. Throughout my Congressional career, I have worked to strengthen the U.S.-Taiwan relation-ship and to ensure that we do not lose focus on Taiwan’s importance. I am honored to be a friend and strong supporter of Taiwan and its people. As Taiwanese all around the world celebrate Taiwan’s National Day, the United States stands with Taiwan, ready to ensure our part-nership is stronger than ever. With apprecia-tion for and commitment to our important rela-tionship, I again offer my best Double Ten Day wishes to the people of Taiwan. f 
MILLER OUTDOOR THEATRE: 95 YEARS AND COUNTING 
HON. TED POE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Miller Outdoor Theatre is celebrating 95 years in Herman Park. The Miller Outdoor Theatre got its start in 1923, and continues to be one of Houston’s most treasured venues. Located right in the heart of the City of Houston, it pro-vides folks a place to enjoy the performing arts. And it is always free. Miller is a unique treasure to Houstonians and it is dedicated to bringing the arts alive for audiences for over 95 years: classical music, jazz, ethnic music and dance, ballet, Shake-speare, musical theatre, popular concert art-ists, films and more. The theatre has boasted the Summer Sym-phony Series, Shakespeare Festival, Theatre Under the Stars ‘‘Bells are Ringing’’, and even presidential candidate Richard Nixon cam-paigned on stage. The original theatre was an open amphi-theater surrounded by twenty Corinthian-style limestone columns built on land that was given and sold by the Miller estate. Cotton broker and mining engineer, Jesse Wright Miller, originally left the land to the City in 1919. Mayor Oscar Holcombe and his council mem-bers should be commended for their vision to-wards this project. In the 1960s, the City of Houston built a new theatre that consisted of three triangular plates of Corten steel and an air condition to cool the stage. Did I mention it is hot in Texas! The original 1920s columns were moved to the Mecom-Rockwell Colonnade Fountain be-tween Fannin and San Jacinto at Hermann Drive. The Miller received another face lift in the late 1990s. A 6 million dollar expansion and renovation planned and funded by the City of Houston and Friends of Hermann Park. A new roof, additional restrooms and office areas were added. They built a small stage at the east end of the facility. The refurbished theatre reopened in 1998. The Miller’s newest upgrades and additions occurred through the 2000s. New seating, lighting, and landscaping greatly enhance the educational and outreach capacities of the theatre. The Miller can accommodate about 6,200 spectators, with over 1,705 seats and over 4,500 on the grassy hill. While so much has grown and changed over the years, I still remember my children visiting the Miller Outdoor Theatre on school field trips. It was very popular with the Poe kids. The day always included a musical pro-duction or play, a picnic lunch, and a roll down Miller’s ‘‘hill’’. By the way, Miller’s ‘‘hill’’ was created with dirt from Fannin Street exca-vations. In 2008, the iconic hill was regraded and raised. There is a plaque that was erected at the theatre’s dedication that read: ‘‘To the Arts of Music, Poetry, Drama and Oratory, by which the striving spirit of man seeks to interpret the words of God. This theatre of the City of Houston is permanently dedicated.’’ These words still ring true today. Through its mission statement and commit-ment to the arts in Houston, the Miller Outdoor Theatre has proven to be a pillar to the citi-zens of Houston. I congratulate them on their 95th season and commend them for con-tinuing to contribute to Houston’s vibrant arts community. And that’s just the way it is. f

TRIBUTE TO ROXANA DE LA RIVA 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I want to honor Roxana de la Riva as a distinguished leader in Central Florida for Hispanic Heritage Month. Roxana de la Riva is a Mexican-American journalist covering information about Hispanic Community in Central Florida. She has over 18 years of experience in Hispanic journalism and professional writing. Recently, de la Riva returned to La Prensa, the oldest Hispanic Media in Central Florida, the outlet when she started her journalism career in the United States. De la Riva was recently a volunteer in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, with CASA as Coordinator of Support Solidarity and Help, where she assisted distributing donation items and covering stories of the efforts. She is also a past member of AIPEH (The International Association of Hispanic Arts and Culture) a group of artists, poets and writers from Central Florida. De la Riva was a vocational training mentor in journalism for youth female students, whose parents are immigrants and part of the Hope Community Center. Although a reporter educated in traditional journalism, she has now adapted to the new way of mass communication and used her platform to reach a new audience through so-cial media platforms. De la Riva was a freelance writer with El Sentinel for 7 years, where she wrote for the website El Sentinel.com as well as the print edition. During her time at El Sentinel, she covered and researched a wide range of issues and assignments pertaining to the Cen-tral Florida community. Prior to this experience of that she covered Breaking News for El Sol de la Florida. Most notably, she focused on the case of George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin. Educated in Mexico City School of Jour-nalism Carlos Septie´n Garcia, the first Mexi-can educational institution of journalism, de la Riva arrived in the United States in 2002 and has since made Central Florida home. GUN VIOLENCE VICTIMS FROM OHIO HON. ROBIN L. KELLY 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because Americans continue to die from gun violence while this House is on vacation. For more than a year, I’ve been coming to the House Floor to read the names of gun vio-lence victims that this House—the People’s House—has failed by our inability to act and save lives. To date, I’ve read 2,213 names. Each one of them, an American whose life and family have been immeasurably changed forever. And what has the response from this House been? Silence. Nothing but cold silence. Do these names make my colleagues un-comfortable? Do they remind them that real people are impacted by gun violence on a daily basis? Do these names give them a moment of pause before they gleefully accept that next NRA check? Mr. Speaker, today, I want to recognize gun violence victims from Ohio, a state that the NRA has poured tens of thousands of dollars into over this cycle. These are the names of 163 Ohioans, from just four Congressional Districts, who’ve been impacted by gun violence. These people have been shot, many have lost their lives, and still this House majority does nothing to prevention gun violence. The Majority only offers ‘thoughts and prayers’ while families continue to be torn apart. That’s just wrong. Mr. Speaker, here are the names of those 163 Ohioans that this House has failed:

INTRODUCTION OF THE FAIRNESS IN FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRIS-ONS MEDICAL CARE ACT OF 2018 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I intro-duce the Fairness in Federal Bureau of Pris-ons Medical Care Act of 2018. This bill would remove the current copay Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) inmates are required to pay to visit a BOP-provided doctor. Under current BOP rules, inmates are re-quired to ‘‘pay a fee for health services of $2.00 per health care visit.’’ While $2.00 may seem insignificant, when inmates earn only twelve to forty cents per hour on their work as-signments, $2.00 can be substantial. That money could better be used to pay child sup-port or for the cost of necessities. Moreover, while copays can discourage unnecessary ap-pointments, we should be encouraging in-mates to seek medical care before conditions become worse and more expensive for tax-payers. Preventative care is much less expen-sive for the federal government than costly treatment that could have been avoided by a simple doctor’s visit earlier in the process. Under current BOP rules, if an inmate is found responsible through the Disciplinary Hearing Process of having caused another in-mate’s injury that required a medical visit, the offending inmate is required to pay the $2.00 copay for the injured inmate’s visit. That rule would not change under my bill. Removing this unnecessary copay would allow inmates to see a doctor and receive the medical treatment they need, and will likely save the federal government money in the long run. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF UNT STUDENT HEALTH AND WELLNESS CENTER 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the University of North Texas Stu-dent Health and Wellness Center on the 100th Anniversary of its founding on October 3, 1918. Since 2007, the health center has oper-ated from Chestnut Hall, a state-of-the-art fa-cility that serves current student health needs. Its home at Chestnut Hall reflects both the im-provements in care and the growth of the UNT community that have occurred over the past 100 years. The health center has a long history. It first opened in 1918 as the sanitarium for the Stu-dent Army Training Corps students, con-structed by the federal government as an emergency hospital for student soldiers train-ing for World War I during the 1918 Spanish Influenza Pandemic. It served five patients on its opening day, and was only able to provide care for eight patients at a time at its initial W. Mulberry Street location. Although the hospital closed November 11, 1918, North Texas State Normal College purchased the equipment through a $1 fee from all students and staff, relocating the hospital in September 1919 to the corner of Avenue B and Sycamore Street under the supervision of a nurse, Adolphine Grabbe. Dr. L.O. Hayes was hired as head of the hospital in August 1930 and became the first full-time physician on staff. Facility improve-ments were also made that year, including a steam pressure sterilizer and clinical labora-tory. In 1933, the hospital was relocated to a new fifty-bed building on campus that was equipped with an x-ray machine and allowed treatment of first-aid, surgery and care for both contagious and non-contagious diseases. A new hospital with air conditioning was con-structed in 1957, allowing for space on the 2nd floor to be closed-off for an isolation ward. A remodel in 1975 converted the hospital from an inpatient facility to an outpatient facility, and added additional capacity to provide crit-ical health services. The groundbreaking for Chestnut Hall, ap-proved by a student referendum on the 35,000 student campus, was held in 2005. The 74,000 square foot building currently boasts a digital x-ray machine, extensive laboratory, treatment rooms, immunization rooms, urgent care rooms, twenty-nine exam rooms, wellness resources center, pharmacy and space for administrative staff. In August 2018, the center received re-accreditation through the Accreditation Asso-ciation for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC). This is a prestigious honor that serves as a re-minder of the high quality of care provided to meet the health needs of a 38,000 student campus. As a physician, I understand the dedication of those called to a medical career, as well as the satisfaction that comes from helping pa-tients. I offer my sincere appreciation to Dr. Herschel Voorhees and the center’s dedicated team for their efforts to provide outstanding care each day. Thank you for all you do to en-hance the lives of students, faculty, and staff at UNT. I join you in celebration of the accom-plishments of the center’s first 100 years, and the standard you have set for those who fol-low in the next 100 years. f 
CITY OF HUMBLE FIRST RESPOND-ERS—TEXANS SERVING TEXANS 
HON. TED POE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, last year, Humble, Texas suffered a historic flood, one that devastated the entire town. At the height of the flood, the San Jacinto River Bridge was completely submerged, cutting off passage be-tween Humble and Kingwood. To put it in per-spective, 27 trillion gallons of rain fell over Texas. That is enough water to fill the Hous-ton Astrodome 85,000 times. Folks had any-where between 36 and 52 inches of rain. The Humble area recorded around 40 inches of rain. Humble was hammered by this flood. On Friday, August 25, 2017, Hurricane Har-vey made landfall on the Texas Gulf Coast as a Category 4 hurricane. The Texas air just felt different that Friday, ominous. Those of you who have been through a hurricane will under-stand what I am saying. The air pressure dropped and a breeze out of nowhere ap-peared. In August we don’t get a breeze! This was the first evident sign that the storm was headed our way. As I left a meeting in downtown Houston, I decided I better call my staff and check in. I encouraged them to leave early, grab some supplies, and hunker down for the weekend. As I began my commute back to Humble, I called my friend, Merle Aaron. Mayor Aaron could tell me what I needed to hear about preparations in and around the city as the storm approaches. We talked a long time; he mentioned that the police and fire were pre-pared for extended weekend shifts. Little did we know about the nightmare that was coming for Humble later that weekend. The rains and floods ravaged the city. By Sunday night, Humble’s first responders were evacuating folks from their homes and trans-porting them to shelters. Roads were shut down due to high water and some homes were knocked off their foundations. First re-sponders began search and rescue missions. They worked with other agencies in boats in the high water areas. They also maintained a presence in order to keep looters out of the flooded businesses. During the weeks fol-lowing, there were no serious incidents from looters. The first responders proved crucial during the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. I cannot stress enough its role in providing a swift re-sponse during the immediate aftermath and a strong presence during the cleanup phases. Later that week, I witnessed the devastation first hand as I rode with Mayor Aaron in his pickup truck through a neighborhood behind

Deerbrook Mall called Northshire. Over 300 homes were flooded with 4–6ft of water. The roads were impassable and protected by Humble Police. First responders waved us through and immediately I could not be more proud of my city’s response during the worst natural disasters to ever affect Texans. Among the piles of garbage, and stench of rot, folks had spray painted signs that said, ‘‘We love Humble Police’’ and ‘‘Thank you first respond-ers’’. It was an overwhelming display of grati-tude toward our first responders. The City of Humble responders worked tire-lessly around the clock for many days to pro-tect its citizens. The stories following Hurri-cane Harvey give folks the determination to recover from the nightmare they endured that weekend. Harvey will not defeat the City of Humble— they proved to be Texas Strong. And that’s just the way it is.

HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Odle Middle School stu-dents: Ishan Bansal, Eric He, Neil Chowdhury, Eric Liu, and Clarance Zheng for their win at the National Science Bowl (NSB), held this past April 26 to April 30 in Washington, D.C. The Department of Energy (DOE) created the National Science Bowl in 1991 to encour-age students to excel in mathematics and science, and to pursue careers in these fields. More than 290,000 students have participated in the National Science Bowl throughout its 28-year history, and more than 14,000 stu-dents compete in the NSB every year. Coached by Rina Chowdhury with guidance from Interlake High School teacher Michael O’Bryne, the Odle Middle School team was among 48 middle schools from around the United States that competed for the national title. Winning this title is not an easy feat, and their perseverance is truly remarkable. In addi-tion to being named the 2018 National Cham-pions, the team’s diligence and dedication earned Olde’s Science Department $1000, courtesy of the U.S. Department of Energy. Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I rec-ognize the enormous achievement of Odle Middle School and its students Ishan Bansal, Eric He, Neil Chowdhury, Eric Liu, and Clarance Zheng. Their impressive potential to thrive in a range of scientific and mathematical fields is demonstrated by their victory at the 2018 National Science Bowl, and I wish them the best of luck in their future endeavors.

From the hills of San Antonio to the flat lands of Houston, he has helped Texans feel safe and secure by defending and upholding the law. His service to the state and to Houston will withstand time. It is an honor to pay tribute to him today as he retires from public service. Duane graduated from Texas A&M with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science before be-ginning his valorous career with the Texas De-partment of Public Safety (DPS). His career aspirations began when car trouble led to a ride-along with a DPS trooper as a student at A&M. The two got along like old friends, and you might say that was the straw that broke the camel’s back. In 1981, Duane officially began his career serving the people of Texas. His first assignment was in Denton as a High-way Patrol Trooper. During his nearly four decade tenure, Duane served the people of Texas through various positions in the DPS. He served as Narcotics Sergeant, Austin; Narcotics Lieutenant, Waco; Narcotics Captain, Garland and Austin, and Narcotics Assistant Commander, San Antonio and Austin. In the last decade of his career he served in Austin as Major, Criminal Investiga-tions Division, later promoted to Deputy As-sistant Director, and finally as Region 2 Com-mander, Houston. From speeding tickets and drunk drivers to full scale narcotics operations, he was up against some of the roughest and toughest that Texas had to offer. Through it all, he never stopped trying to make the Lone Star state a safer place. He was the type of guy that you wanted on your side because he would not stop until the job was done right. The impact he had on Texans, Houstonians, and the thin blue line will continue to be an example for generations to come. He may have handed in his badge, but his legacy lives on. His family can rest easy now knowing the most dangerous activity he will be doing is spending most days out on the water with his fishing pole. Happy Trails to you, Duane. Thank you for a job well done and for all your hard work to make our Texas a safer place. And that is just the way it is. f 
IN MEMORY OF MR. WELDON BURGOON 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, October 5, 2018 Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the life of Mr. Charles Weldon Burgoon. A lifelong cowboy, dedicated volunteer, and local businessman, Mr. Burgoon recently passed away at the age of 88. A beloved member of the community, Mr. Burgoon was the owner of Weldon’s Saddle Shop and Western Wear where he sold belts, saddles, and other handmade leather acces-sories until he retired in January of 2017. Mr. Burgoon grew up in Denton County and began riding horses when he was just three years old. He began training Shetland ponies as a child, and joined and competed in many rodeos across Texas until 1992. He and his wife Joy met as students at Denton High School, and were married in Green Valley, Texas in 1950. Throughout his life, Mr. Burgoon dedicated much of his time to serving his fellow North Texans. Even after his retirement, Mr. Burgoon continued to dedicate his time to the youth of Denton County. He served on numer-ous organizations in Denton including the Denton County Livestock Association and Youth Fair, North Texas High School Rodeo Association, United Way of Denton County,

and the Methodist Church Men’s group. Mr. Weldon Burgoon was inducted into the Texas Rodeo Cowboy Hall of Fame in 2010 and the National Bit, Spur and Saddle Collectors Asso-ciation in 2012. As a lifelong North Texan, renowned cow-boy, and businessman, Weldon Burgoon self-lessly served the entire Denton community for more than 60 years. He will be deeply missed, and his impact on the Denton community will not be forgotten. I extend my deepest condo-lences to his wife Joy, their family, and all who knew and loved him.
