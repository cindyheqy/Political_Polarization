ADAPTATION TO CHANGING CRUDE 
OIL MARKETS 
SPEECH OF  
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, October 9, 2015 
The House in Committee of the Whole 
House on the state of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 702) to adapt to changing crude oil market conditions: 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 702, legislation by my friend and Texas colleague Congressman J
OEBARTON to 
lift the ban on American exports of crude oil. 
Lifting this outdated and unnecessary ban 
on crude oil exports is a win for Texas and America. It opens up billions of dollars of new economic opportunity for American compa-nies, which will create thousands of good pay-ing jobs. It will help to stabilize the price of en-ergy on the world market, making sure that gasoline and electricity remains abundant and affordable for hardworking families across America. And South East Texas is uniquely positioned to be at the center of it all, with the Port of Houston and other facilities in our area uniquely suited to lead America into this new market. 
Unfortunately, and predictably, the Obama 
Administration has threatened to veto this bi-partisan bill once it passes the House and the Senate. This is the same Administration that just led the way on a deal to lift the crude ex-port ban that has been in place on the Islamic Republic of Iran, a terrorist sponsoring regime that will use the proceeds from selling crude oil to finance terror and mayhem throughout the world. Americans deserve better treatment from their President than he is giving to terror-ists in Iran, and I believe that if he vetoes this bill, we will override that veto.

HONORING THE CREW OF EL FARO 
HON. ANDER CRENSHAW 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, October 13, 2015 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to the crew of the El Faro , the 
790-foot container ship that recently perished in the Atlantic during Hurricane Joaquin. We cannot know the heartache that their families and friends are facing in the midst of the un-answered questions surrounding this maritime disaster. In their time of need, we send them strong prayers of support to help ease their pain. 
The 33 crew members aboard the vessel, 
18 from Florida, 12 from my hometown of Jacksonville, 10 others from cities and towns across America, and five Polish nationals, all faced the toughest of odds from a Category 4 hurricane. These brave men and women in-clude: Jacksonville residents Roosevelt Clark, Brookie Davis, Frank Hamm, Carey Hatch, 
Jack Jackson, Jackie Jones, Jr., Lonnie Jor-dan, Roan Lightfoot, James Porter, Theodore Quammie, Lashawn Rivera and Anthony Thomas. Florida residents Louis Champa of Palm Coast, Keith Griffin of Fort Myers, Joe Hargrove of Orange Park, Howard Schoenly of Cape Coral, German Solar-Cortes of Orlando and Mariette Wright of St. Augustine were also aboard. 
Sylvester Crawford Jr. of Lawrenceville, 
Georgia; Michael Davidson of Windham, Maine; Michael Holland of North Wilton, Maine; Mitchell Kuflik of Brooklyn, New York; Jeffrey Mathias of Kingston, Massachusetts; Dylan Meklin of Rockland, Maine; Richard Pusatere of Virginia Beach, Virginia; Danielle Randolph of Rockland, Maine; Jeremie Riehm of Camden, Delaware; and Steven Shultz of Roan Mountain, Tennessee are also mourned as are Piotr Krause, Marcin Nita, Jan Podgorski, Andrzej Truszkowski and Rafal Zdobych of Poland. 
As we learn more about their lives we see 
the experience and professionalism they brought to their careers, their love of family and the hope they had for the future. May those closest to them take comfort from this diverse collection of stories. 
We also take time to recognize the United 
States Coast Guard, United States Navy, United States Air Force and other maritime as-sets who combined forces in the search for the stricken ship and its members. They are to be commended for their full commitment and dedication to that mission. 
As we move ahead, investigations are un-
derway by the National Transportation Safety Board and the Coast Guard to determine what happened and how to prevent another such disaster from happening in the future. I have no doubt that those answers will come. In the meantime, America’s maritime community is a tight one and will rally around those who need it the most right now—the loved ones of the El 
Faro crew. We stand with them, ready to meet 
their needs in whatever way we can, today and in all of the tomorrows.

IN RECOGNITION OF CHINESE NA-
TIONAL DAY AND THE UNITED STATES-TAIWAN FRIENDSHIP 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, October 13, 2015 
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ex-
press my sincere congratulations to the Re-public of China which recently celebrated its National Day and the anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution, referred to as the ‘‘Double Tenth’’ for October 10th. 
Taiwan is a close ally and dear friend of the 
United States. We share critical and common values, values that include liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and equality, and over time, we have developed our friendship into trade agreements, tourism, national secu-
rity agreements, and cultural and educational exchanges. 
Let me say today, from the halls of Wash-
ington, D.C., that the friendship between the United States and Taiwan is enduring and deep. Our bonds will continue to grow strong-er and the world will be a better place be-cause of it.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, October 13, 2015 
Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Speaker, today, Friday, 
October 9, 2015, I am in Charleston, South Carolina, accompanying Secretary Jeh John-son of the Department of Homeland Security and attending to matters related to the historic storm and flooding in my district and as a con-sequence, I will not be present for votes today. Had I been present, I would have voted in the following manner: 
Roll Call 545—Amash Amendment to H.R. 
702: YEA. 
Roll Call 546—Messer Amendment to H.R. 
702: YEA. 
Roll Call 547—Messer Amendment to H.R. 
702: YEA.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. RON KIND 
OF WISCONSIN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, October 13, 2015 
Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I was unable to 
have my votes recorded on the House floor on Friday, October 9, 2015. Had I been present, I would have voted against H.R. 702 (Roll no. 549) because I believe the crude oil export ban should only be lifted if it includes opportu-nities for increased alternative renewable en-ergy tax credits.

Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with 
my colleague Mr. D AVID VALADAO to pay trib-
ute to the life of our good friend, Joe P. Oliveira, Sr., of Lemoore, California who re-cently passed away at the age of 89. He leaves behind his loving family including his

Patty Silva and Husband Denny, Debbie Etchebehere and husband Jean, Cheryl Silva and husband Russ; daughter in law, Pam Oliveira, Son-in-law Darryl Ray, Brothers Jon, Frank, Westley, Leonard, Manuel, Edward, Louie and sister Mary, along with 16 grand-children; and 29 great grandchildren. 
Joe P. Oliveira, Sr., was born in Hanford, 
CA on January 28, 1926 to John P. and Eliza Leal Oliveira he was the fourth born of 12 chil-
dren. Joe P., as he liked to be called, was a man who dedicated himself to his family and the dairy industry in the San Joaquin Valley and California. He returned to the family dairy after his honorable discharge from the US Army-Air Force in 1947. He bought his own dairy in 1953 and throughout his working years he dedicated his time and efforts to his love of dairy. 
He served on the Kings County Creamery 
Association Board for over 20 years and Chal-lenge Cream and Butter Association Board for fifteen years. This experience and his involve-ment with the Western Dairyman’s Association prompted then Governor Reagan to appoint Joe P. to the Milk Pooling Formulation Com-mittee which resulted in a program that helped all dairymen. 
After selling his dairy, he worked full time for 
Western Dairyman’s from 1973 to 1987 and upon his retirement he was presented with a Resolution from the California State Legisla-ture recognizing his contributions to the dairy industry. Joe P. married the love of his life Adeline 
Paulo; they were blessed with one son, and five daughters. He was actively involved in the Lemoore Trinity Association for over 50 years. He led the efforts of many, placing calves on dairy farms where his many friends raised them. They were then sold with the donations going towards building a new hall at Lemoore Trinity Association. He also served on the Kings County Grand Jury. 
It goes without saying that Joe P. Oliveira, 
Sr., was an honorable man with a commitment to his family and friends and the agricultural community in the San Joaquin Valley that will forever live in the lives of the people he so graciously touched. His passion for family, education, and his community will be remem-bered by all who knew him. He was my friend and I will miss him a great deal. He conducted his life with reverence for humanity. It is with great pride that I honor him for all he did on behalf of the San Joaquin Valley and for Cali-fornia. 
Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect that Mr. 
V
ALADAO and I ask our colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join us in hon-oring the life of Joe P. Oliveira, Sr., a remark-able Californian. We are honored and hum-bled to join his family in celebrating the life of this amazing man who will never be forgotten. PERSONAL EXPLANATION
