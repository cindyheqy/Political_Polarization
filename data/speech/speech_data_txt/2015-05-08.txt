PRAYER 
Reverend Dominic Langevin, OP, Do-
minican House of Studies, Washington, D.C., offered the following prayer: 
God, our Father, order our distracted 
minds to Yourself. Help us to be hum-ble, knowing that all works are worth-while only insofar as they come from You and are oriented back to You. 
Bless the work of this House. 
Strengthen its Members to build bonds that will last: bonds of collaboration among themselves, bonds of fraternity and opportunity in our land, bonds of peace on our planet. 
May the cooperation of these elected 
servants free us all for virtuous excel-lence rather than the ease of wanton-ness or the doldrums of indifference. 
And, loving Father, as we celebrate 
Mother’s Day this weekend, accept our thanks for the love that You have shown us through our mothers. May we cherish the dignity and sacrifices of 
those women whom You have called to bear and sustain life. 
Through Jesus Christ, the Lord. Amen.

FY2015 Project Summary 
The General Services Administration (GSA) proposes the reconfiguration and renovation of 
space within government owned buildings during fiscal year 2015 to support the General 
Services Administration's (GSA's) ongoing consolidation efforts to improve space utilization, 
optimize inventory, decrease reliance on leased space, and reduce the government's 
environmental footpdnt. 
FY2015 Committee Approval and Appropriation Requested ............................ $100,000,000 
Pr,ogt,am Summm 
As part of its ongoing effort to improve space utilization, optimize inventory, decrease reliance 
on leased space, and reduce the government's environmental footprint, GSA is identifying 
~onsolidation opportunities within its inventory of real property assets. These opportunities are 
presented tlrrough surveys and studies, partnering with client agencies, and through agency 
initiatives such as Client Pmifolio Planning (CPP) and Transfonning Real Property Information 
and Management (TRIM). Projects will vary in size by location and agency mission/operations, 
however, no single project will be more than $10M in costs or exceed a 5 year Estimated 
Economic Payback. All projects will aim for a typical Office Utilization Rate of 130 usflper 
person or less. 
Typical projects include the following: 
s Reconfiguration and alteration of existing federal space to accommodate incoming 
agency relocation/consolidation. (Note: May include reconfigurations of existing 
occupied federal tenant space) 
o Incidental alterations and system upgrades such as fire sprinklers or HV AC, needed as 
part of relocation and consolidation 
Projects will be selected in line with the following criteria: 
" First consideration will be given to projects that are identified as a reduction opportunity 
in a Customer Portfolio Plan which has been agreed to by both GSA and the subject 
agency and meet the remaining criteria. 
• Proposed consolidation projects will result in a reduction in annual rent paid by the 
impacted customer agency.

o Consolidation of expiring leases into GSA owned buildings will have preference over 
those business cases for lease cancellations 
• Co-location with other agencies where there are shared resources/special space will 
. receive preference over single agency occupancies 
• Links to other consolidation projects will receive preference over stand-alone projects 
Justification 
Consistent with Administration initiatives such as the June 2010 Presidential Memorandum, 
Disposing of Unneeded Federal Real Estate and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 
Memorandum M-12-12, Promoting Efficient Spending to Support Agency Operations, as well as 
Congressional efforts to dispose of excess and underutilized properties, GSA is continually 
analyzing opportunities to improve space utilization and realize long4enn cost savings for the 
government. Funding for space consolidations is essential to ensuring that GSA can execute 
those opportunities. 
Projects funded under this authorization will enable agencies to relocate from either leased or 
federally-owned space to federally-owned space that more efficiently meets mission needs. 
These relocations will result in improved space Qtilization, cost savings for the American 
taxpayers, and a reduced environmental impact.

The Department of Treasury -Internal Revenue Service (IRS} is currently located in a 26,856 
USF lease at 611 6th Street in Los Angeles and is moving into 300 N. LA Federal Office 
Building. By consolidating IRS into the Federal building, its footprint will decrease by 18,972 
USF, and IRS will save approximately $712,013 in annual rent. The taxpayer will save 
$1,259,249 in annual private sector lease costs. 
The project will also implementiRS' new desk sharing/mobile work environment, reducing the 
number of works paces by an estimated 69 percent and improving the office utilization rate from 
232 to 123 USF per person, a 47 percent reduction. 
In addition to the $1,919,000 in consolidation funds for build-out costs, IRS will provide 
$137,000 to address IT, move, and other project costs. IRS also plans to leverage GSA's FIT 
program to provide the $215,000 needed for furniture.

Overview of Proiect 
As part of its FY2012 Capital Investment and Leasing Program, GSA proposed the 
construction of a new federal complex at 150 Carlos Chardon Avenue, San Juan, PR, to 
consolidate the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Design of the proposed facility 
and the construction of a new parking facility to support the continued need for parking at 
the adjacent facility were funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act 
(ARRA) of 2009. The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works approved 
$145,506,000 for the purpose of constructing a new federal building, but the funds have 
not been appropriated. 
This proposed FBI complex includes a new FBI field office, annex building for vehicle 
maintenance, and visitor screening facility totaling 192,794 gsf along with a secure 
parking garage. The FBI complex will share the 27-acre Federal site in San Juan with the 
existing Federico Degetau Federal Building (Degetau FB). Clemente Ruiz Nazario U.S. 
Courthouse (FB-CT), and Rainforest Kids Child Development Center. The FB-CT will 
remain undisturbed during the construction of the project.

The FBI is currently housed in the Federico Degetau Federal Building (Degetau FB) in 
San Juan, PR and the GSA Center in Guaynabo, PR, approximately 3.5 miles apart. The 
San Juan Field Office (FO) currently is located within the Degetau FB, occupying office 
space on one and a half floors. At present, there is no space within the Degetau FB for 
expansion purposes and the building cannot support the FBI mission in San Juan. The 
mechanical and electrical equipment in the existing facilities do not meet the FBI's 
identified requirements and cannot meet the anticipated personnel growth with projected 
staffmg levels anticipated to increase in the coming years. ' 
The FBI FO needs to integrate additional operational and technical capabilities that are 
currently located off-site at the GSA Center. Once construction of the proposed FBI 
facility is completed, the GSA Center will be disposed of. 
The FBI's criminal and national security mission increasingly relies upon an intelligence­
driven approach. Efficient and cost-effective facilities support the FBI's intelligence­
driven strategy and enable the FBI to successfully carry out its mission. For example, this 
building will support deployment of secure work space needed to handle classified ·

information and will promote co-operation between the FBI and its various Federal, State, 
and local partners. ConsoUdation of their operations in new federal space will enable the 
FBI to effectively perform its mission in Puerto Rico satisfying their security and long­
term housing needs. 
The proposed project will provide the FBI with a modem, state of the art, facility that will 
satisfy the agency's security and long-term space requirements and meet the objectives of 
flexibility of space, sustainable design, seismic safety, durability, and. New construction 
on this federally owned site maximizes use of the existing Federal land. 
This project was proposed as part of GSA's FY2012 Capital Investment and Leasing 
Program. The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works approved 
$145,506,000 for the purpose of constructing a new federal building, but the funds have 
not been appropriated. In the absence of construction-phase funding, FBI and GSA re­
examined the project requirements and concept design, and re-scoped the project to 
reduce its cost. Further evaluation of the project site, based on the revised FBI 
requirements, led GSA to conclude that the previously planned relocation of the existing 
child care center was unnecessary and that only site work around the center is required. 
These adjustments have reduced the construction funding request. 
Summary of Energy Compliance 
This project will be designed to conform to requirements of the Facilities Standards for 
the PubHc Buildings Service and will implement strategies to meet the Guiding Principles 
for High Performance and Sustainable Buildings. GSA encourages design opportunities 
to increase energy and water efficiency above the minimum performance criteria.

HONORING THE LIFE OF ANTHONY 
‘‘TONY’’ ROSSI 
HON. ADAM KINZINGER 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 8, 2015 
Mr. KINZINGER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life of a great Amer-ican: Anthony ‘‘Tony’’ Rossi. 
Tony was born in Italy and his family immi-
grated to the United States when he was young. He grew up in Hoboken, New Jersey and graduated from Demarest High School. Throughout his life he answered the call to serve; beginning in World War II, he joined the Army Air Corps and served as a bombardier. During the war, he was captured and held as a Prisoner of War in Germany for 18 months. His family says those experiences were trans-formational. When Tony returned home to Ho-boken, his approach was: Keep your problems in perspective; accept each day as a blessing; and treasure your family and friends. 
During the Korean War, Tony again an-
swered the call to serve and, following the conflict, continued a career in the Air Force in Japan, England, and throughout the United States. After retirement from the Air Force, Tony worked for General Electric for 16 years and later retired to Florida in 1987. 
He is survived by his wife of 42 years, Ei-
leen Rossi; son, Michael (Marsha) Rossi; daughter Renee (Robert) Faiks; and son, Charles Rossi; 6 grandchildren: Chris (Laura) Rossi, Karen (Rich) Rossi Pickup, Preston (Kristi) Faiks, Grant (Kim) Faiks, Gillian and William Rossi; and 6 great grandchildren: Au-drey and Lillian Faiks, Jason and Sarah Faiks, Daniela Rossi, Jack Pickup. 
Mr. Speaker, today marks the 70th Anniver-
sary of Victory in Europe Day and it is a great honor to recognize and celebrate Tony’s hon-orable service to our country and reflect on his life. In June, our country will honor his service with a funeral at Arlington National Cemetery. 
God bless Tony Rossi, his family, and the 
United States of America.

RECOGNIZING CHASE EWOLDT FOR 
HIS COURAGE AND SERVICE 
HON. PETER J. ROSKAM 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 8, 2015 
Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to 
rise today to recognize Chase Ewoldt, a brave, strong, and exceptional young man from the Sixth District of Illinois. Chase was recently named one of the five ambassadors nationwide for the St. Baldrick’s foundation. 
In July 2012, at the age of two, Chase was 
diagnosed with a rare, aggressive brain and spinal cancer. Experts believe this specific type of cancer is found in just 100 to 200 new patients every year in the United States and Chase was only given a 20% chance of sur-
vival. Over the next 14 months, his family and friends watched him undergo punishing cancer therapy every two to three weeks. Most of his time was spent in and out of hospitals. Never-theless, Chase beat the odds and survived. In August of 2013 there was no longer any sign of the disease in his body. 
Chase is not completely out of the woods, 
and will most likely struggle with aspects of the disease for the rest of his life, but for now the family is celebrating his health and trying to raise awareness about pediatric cancer, a testament not only to Chase’s strength and re-silience, but also the entire family’s compas-sion and determination to help others. Chase is an inspiration to all with cancer and I am sure he will continue to be a light for those in darkness. As Chase told his mother, ‘‘I am a survivor’’. Let us celebrate the life of this sur-vivor. 
Mr. Speaker and Distinguished Colleagues, 
please join me in honoring and celebrating Chase Ewoldt’s nomination as a nationwide ambassador for the St. Baldrick’s foundation.

RECOGNIZING THE DODGE CITY 
COOPERATIVE FOR 100 YEARS OF SERVICE 
HON. TIM HUELSKAMP 
OF KANSAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 8, 2015 
Mr. HUELSKAMP. Mr. Speaker, today I rec-
ognize the Dodge City Cooperative. The coop-erative, now doing business as Pride Ag Re-sources, is completing 100 years serving Dodge City and the southwest Kansas area. 
As a fifth-generation farmer and one of just 
a handful of farmers currently serving in Con-gress, I understand the important role co-operatives play in our agricultural economy. Rural America has long depended on this unique business structure to move our prod-ucts to the marketplace. 
With the founding of one elevator in Dodge 
City in 1915, the hope, vision and needs of farmers for the past 100 years brought into ex-istence fourteen additional elevators, four fer-tilizer locations, two feed mills, six car care centers, four Ace Hardware stores, plus an-other store soon. Dodge City Cooperative cur-rently employs 200 employees with an annual payroll of over $9.2 million dollars. The hard work and services offered have filled a critical need in supplying area farmers, ranchers and the people of our communities with grain, feed, supplies and goods. 
Thank you to Dodge City Cooperative and 
to all of the farmer-owned cooperatives in the ‘‘Big First’’ district who help strengthen our rural communities and make Kansas one of the top agricultural-producing states in the en-tire country. WILLIAM C. PHELON, JR. 
HON. LEE M. ZELDIN 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 8, 2015 
Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Technical Sergeant William C. Phelon, Jr. and his distinguished contributions to the United States Army Air Force. Mr. Phelon enlisted in the US Army Air Force im-mediately after graduating from Mineola High School in June of 1943 and entered active service August 16th 1943, the height of Amer-ican involvement in World War Two. Mr. Phelon served valiantly for three years until March of 1946. Technical Sergeant Phelon flew as part of the illustrious 96th Bombard-ment Group as the Radio Operator Mechanic and Waist Gunner of a B–17 Flying Fortress. In this capacity he was responsible for all radio equipment aboard the B–17 while in flight. Technical Sergeant Phelon received many medals and awards as a result of his meritorious service to his country, including the prestigious U.S. Army Air Forces Air Medal. 
In his position as airman, Technical Ser-
geant Phelon participated in Operation Chow-hound; a humanitarian mission that helped de-liver over 11,000 tons of food to Nazi occupied Holland during the Dutch Famine. This mis-sion was so appreciated by the Dutch people that commemorative ceremonies have been held every five years in Holland to remember the service men that helped feed their starving people. The Third Air Division of the 8th Air Force was responsible for delivering 4,103 tons of food of which the 96th Bombardment Group dropped 366 tons. For his efforts Tech-nical Sergeant Phelon was awarded the Con-spicuous Service Cross by Governor Thomas Dewey on behalf of the people of New York. 
Sadly, Mr. Phelon passed away in Decem-
ber, 2014. I rise today in memory of a brave man who was an exemplary member of the Armed Forces and the community at large, and to posthumously thank him for his years of dedication and service. I hope we all re-member the courage and dedication shown by Mr. Phelon in all he did.

Mr. L OBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I come to the 
floor today to honor Mr. Constantine (Gus) Sarkos. When it comes to fire safety aboard commercial aircraft, Gus Sarkos is the primary expert and a national treasure.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E664 May 8, 2015 
role improving cabin and cargo safety in ways 
that have decreased the risk of injuries to air-line passengers and saved lives. 
According to Dennis Filler, Director of the 
FAA’s William J. Hughes Technical Center, ‘‘Gus Sarkos does the science that becomes the fire safety standards adopted by the whole world.’’ 
His work testing materials and measuring 
the effectiveness of fire detection and sup-pression systems has led to more than a dozen significant changes to U.S. and foreign aircraft during the past three decades to stop fires and curtail the spread of blazes occurring in-flight or during crash landings, increasing the chances of passenger survival. 
Most recently, Mr. Sarkos and his team 
have been examining and reporting on fire threats posed by lighter and potentially flam-mable materials now being used in airplanes, and by the combustibility of large quantities of lithium batteries that have been carried in cargo holds. 
As a result of his team’s work, the Depart-
ment of Transportation (DOT) no longer allows non-rechargeable metal lithium batteries to be shipped in the cargo holds of passenger jets. In addition, a number of U.S. airlines this year unilaterally announced they will no longer ac-cept rechargeable ion lithium batteries be-cause of tests done by Mr. Sarkos and his team showing that a buildup of gases inside bulk containers can lead to explosions and violent fires. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the U.S. DOT cur-rently are considering proposals to ban bulk shipments of these rechargeable batteries or to require safer packaging rules for air trans-port. 
Katherine Rooney, chief of ICAO’s cargo 
safety section, said the work by Mr. Sarkos’ group on the batteries and many other issues has been ‘‘absolutely invaluable.’’ She added that passengers are ‘‘in a safer situation thanks to the research they have provided.’’ 
During his long tenure, Mr. Sarkos has par-
ticipated in and overseen the development of such post-crash aircraft fire safety improve-ments as new fire blocking seat cushions, heat resistant evacuation slides, burn-through resistant fuselage insulation, and interior pan-els that release less heat and smoke. 
‘‘The FAA’s goal’’, Mr. Sarkos said, ‘‘is to 
minimize the likelihood of an aircraft fire in- flight or improve survivability during a post- crash fire. If a fire occurs in-flight, the objec-tive is to reliably detect, extinguish or sup-press it until the aircraft can be safely landed. In the case of a post-crash fire,’’ Sarkos said, ‘‘the goal is to have materials that burn and spread fire more slowly, and releases less heat, so passengers have more time to es-cape.’’ 
Director Filler noted how the work of Mr. 
Sarkos and his team came into play in 2013 when Asiana Airlines Flight 214 crashed and caught fire while landing in San Francisco. Three people died of injuries unrelated to the fire, while 304 survived the crash. He said the fire was slow in developing in large part be-cause of the fire resistant material in the air-craft, and as a result, people had the time to evacuate. 
Director Filler also cited a 2008 accident 
when a Continental 737 veered off the runway in Denver, skidded into a ravine, lost its land-ing gear and left engine, and caught fire. All 110 passengers and five crew members had time to evacuate. In 2005, an Air France A340 
landed in Toronto during a severe thunder-storm, skidded off the runway and erupted into flames. While the fire eventually gutted the air-craft, all 297 passengers and 12 crew mem-bers survived. 
‘‘These are examples of three aircraft that 
caught fire and 728 people survived largely because of the work that Gus and his team have been able to promote throughout the in-dustry,’’ said Filler. ‘‘His efforts have provided added time for passengers to evacuate. In the old days, materials would have burned faster or caused passengers to inhale toxic fumes, and they would have died in the aircraft.’’ 
Mr. Sarkos said his work is challenging, but 
a source of pride because it has resulted in in-creased safety. 
‘‘The worst thing I ever had to do was meet 
with relatives of accident victims,’’ said Mr. Sarkos. ‘‘I am glad that in recent years that conditions have improved because of the work we have done and continue to do.’’ 
I want to publicly commend Gus for being 
named a finalist to receive the Service to America Medal a.k.a. ‘‘Sammies’’. Gus’ vision, leadership, and dedication to saving lives is a testament to his invaluable public service.

CONFERENCE REPORT ON S. CON. 
RES. 11 CONCURRENT RESOLU-TION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2016 
SPEECH OF  
HON. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN 
OF MARYLAND  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Thursday, April 30, 2015 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
take a moment to thank the Democratic staff of the House Budget Committee for their hard work over the past three months on the budg-et resolution. Since early February when the President sent Congress his budget, our staff has worked many late nights and long week-ends to prepare material and provide analysis for our members. Their service to our Commit-tee’s work is indispensable and it’s hard to imagine how the Congress could do its job without their contributions. They toil behind the scenes and without public recognition. For that reason, I want to salute them for their service to the Congress and our nation. 
House Budget Committee Democratic staff: 
Sarah Abernathy, Erika Appel, Ellen Balis, Kathleen Capstick, Ken Cummings, Bridgett Frey, Jonathan Goldman, Jocelyn Griffin, Jose Guillen, Tom Kahn, Najy Kamal, Sheila McDowell, Diana Meredith, Kimberly Overbeek, Karen Robb, Scott Russell, Beth Stephenson, Cody Willming, Ted Zegers.

RECOGNIZING THE 150TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF BARRINGTON, ILLINOIS 
HON. PETER J. ROSKAM 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 8, 2015 
Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
commemorate the 150th anniversary of the in-corporation of Barrington, Illinois. 
From its early origins, Barrington has been 
a model for other cities and towns to follow, through its continued dedication to building a 
friendly and welcoming community for resi-dents and visitors alike. It is no surprise that the village motto is, ‘‘A great place to live, work and play’’. 
In the years since its first mayor, Homer 
Wilmarth, and its incorporation in 1865, Bar-rington has become a center of culture and commerce, serving as a home to families, businesses, professionals, churches and orga-nizations that have made this a vibrant and thriving community. What once started as a small railroad community now boasts a popu-lation of over 10,000 people. Over the years, Barrington has developed a well-deserved rep-utation as a village with hometown charm and small-town heritage. 
On the occasion of this 150th Anniversary, 
we join together to celebrate Barrington’s leg-acy of growth and prosperity and to look ahead to the opportunities facing this great city and our nation. Today both marks 150 years of working together to build a brighter future, and reminds us that our work con-tinues. 
Mr. Speaker and Distinguished Colleagues, 
please join me in recognizing the 150th anni-versary of the incorporation of Barrington, Illi-nois and wishing her residents a very suc-cessful year ahead.

JEWISH AMERICAN HERITAGE 
MONTH 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 8, 2015 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Jewish American Herit-age Month. Nearly 360 years have passed since the establishment of the first Jewish community in North America. Since that time, Jewish Americans have contributed to the cul-tural richness and diversity of our nation in every field of community life, including busi-ness, government, medicine, law, the natural and social sciences, the arts and humanities, academia, religion, and the military. 
There are approximately 5 million Jewish 
Americans and more than 100,000 of them live in Texas, nearly half of those, about 45,000, live in the Houston metropolitan area. Although their numbers may be small in a state with a general population over 20 million, the impact of Jewish Americans in Texas and in Houston has been great indeed. 
Jewish Americans were there during the 
fight for Texas’ independence from Spain and Mexico. Adolphus Sterne, an East Texas mer-chant, became a principal source of financial backing for the Texas Revolution and a close friend of Sam Houston. Albert Moses Levy was surgeon-in-chief in the revolutionary army. The De Cordova family helped develop the city of Waco and Henri Castro settled immi-grants in several Texas towns. In 1859 the first synagogue in Texas was established in Houston. 
Business and trade, especially the merchan-
dising of food, clothing, jewelry with style, ele-gance, and distinction are the arenas in which many Jewish-Texan families made their most visual marks on the state of Texas. There is hardly a city in the Lone Star State whose his-tory is without landmark stores founded and

developed by Jewish entrepreneurs: Neiman, 
Marcus, Sanger in Dallas; Battelstein and Sakowitz in Houston; and Joske in San Anto-nio. 
These cities and towns reaped the benefits 
not only in availability of goods, but also in owners’ generous patronage of the fine arts and in contributions to civic life such as the historic Levy Opera House in Hillsboro and the Brin Opera House in Terrell. Other early Jew-ish Americans who contributed mightily to civic life include Anna Hertzberg, who served as president of the original San Antonio Sym-phony Orchestra before World War I, and Olga Bernstein Kohlberg of El Paso, who started Texas’ first free public kindergarten in 1892. That tradition continues today with the Dell Children’s Hospital in Austin established by Dell Computers founder and CEO, Michael Dell. 
Mr. Speaker, it was 67 years ago this month 
that President Truman recognized the free, independent, and democratic State of Israel, making the United States the first country to welcome Israel into the family of nations. And for 65 years Israel and the United States have remained the best of friends and the strongest of allies. One reason for the enduring strength of this relationship is the enduring contribu-tions made by Jewish Americans in enriching American life and culture. 
Mr. Speaker, as a representative of the 
state of Texas which has welcomed Jews for more than three centuries, I join with my col-leagues and President Obama in calling upon all Americans to learn more about the heritage and contributions of Jewish Americans and to observe this month with appropriate programs, activities, and ceremonies.

RECOGNIZING WALLACE HIGGINS, 
RECIPIENT OF THE 2014 CON-GRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL 
HON. TOM REED 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 8, 2015 
Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-
ognize a constituent, Mr. Wallace Higgins. 
Mr. Higgins was awarded the 2014 Con-
gressional Gold Medal in recognition of his service with the Civil Air Patrol during World War II. 
Mr. Higgins was born in Kendall, New York 
in November 1925. From a young age, he was intrigued by aviation. Mr. Higgins joined the Civil Air Patrol in 1943, during his senior year of high school. Later that year, he enlisted in the Army Air Force and was chosen to join the Tuskegee Airmen. 
During his two enlistments with the Army Air 
Force, Mr. Higgins achieved the rank of Staff Sergeant and earned several commendations for his service, including the WWII Victory Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal, and New York State Medal for Merit. After receiving his honorable discharge, Mr. Higgins settled in Al-fred, New York. 
Mr. Higgins has dedicated the past six dec-
ades to serving his community: he is entering his 50th year with the Alfred Lions Club, he is a life member of the Alfred Station Volunteer Fire Department, he is a member and former chairman of the Allegany County Office for the Aging Advisory Council, and he is a founding member of the Allegany Senior Foundation, 
where he currently serves as President Emer-itus. 
Wallace Higgins truly exemplifies the quali-
ties that characterize the Congressional Gold Medal. It is my pleasure to present this award to Mr. Higgins in recognition of his life-long service to our country and our local commu-nity.

UNVEILING THE SOUTHBURY 
SENIOR CENTER WALL OF HONOR 
HON. ELIZABETH H. ESTY 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 8, 2015 
Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to cele-
brate the unveiling of the Wall of Honor at the Southbury Senior Center. 
Today, we recognize the senior citizens 
from Southbury who proudly served our coun-try in uniform. These men and women an-swered the call of duty to protect our nation and defend its ideals. They served during war and during peace, at home and abroad. No matter their deployment or their mission, each of our veterans deserves the recognition and accolades they will receive during today’s ceremony. 
While we can never fully repay our veterans 
for their service and sacrifice, I believe it is im-portant to take every opportunity to thank and honor them. I hope when the wall is revealed, each veteran will feel the appreciation and gratitude of our community and the entire na-tion. 
I would like to thank Wayne Rioux and the 
staff and volunteers at Southbury Senior Cen-ter for creating this memorial to recognize these local American heroes.

ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN 
HERITAGE MONTH 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 8, 2015 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. Throughout the history of the United States, Asian American and Pacific Is-landers have contributed to our greatest un-dertakings and our vibrant cultural diversity. They have become leaders in business, in the community, and in politics, overcoming adver-sity and prejudice in pursuit of the American Dream. 
Today, there are more than 20 million Asian 
Americans and Pacific Islanders and more than 1 million of them live in Texas. A majority of them are concentrated in the cities, particu-larly Houston. At 80,049, the Vietnamese American community in the City of Houston has the third largest in the country. Houston is also home to sizable populations of Chinese Americans, Indian Americans, and Filipino Americans These communities have trans-formed the city, bringing their cultures, reli-gions, and businesses and creating a new home. 
The first recorded Asian Americans in Texas 
were 250 Chinese laborers, who came to Houston to work on the railroad in 1870. It was thankless, dangerous work, but they helped to build the backbone of our state’s economy. Although many of them would leave soon after the work was done, several stayed behind in Houston, and in the early 1900s the first Chinese business districts were opened. 
The Asian American population in Houston 
remained quite low until the 1970s, when a new wave of immigration brought tens of thou-sands of Asian Americans and Pacific Island-ers to the city. Many of these early immigrants were Vietnamese refugees fleeing the country with the aid of the Indochinese Assistance and Refugee Assistance Act of 1975. Others were Chinese, drawn by the growth of the Chinese Merchants’ Association throughout the dec-ade. 
Today, there are more than 100,000 Asian 
American and Pacific Islanders living in Hous-ton. As of 2007, they operate 16,000 busi-nesses, and there are multiple temples dedi-cated to Buddhism, Hinduism, and Sikhism. The city offers official documents in Viet-namese, Chinese, and Urdu. Neighborhoods from Little Saigon to Chinatown to the Ma-hatma Gandhi District are vibrant community centers for Asian Americans and other resi-dents alike. 
But for all their contributions to our state 
and our country, there are still unacceptable challenges facing Asian American Pacific Is-lander communities. There is an urgent need to fix our broken immigration system by pass-ing legislation that will support families, strengthen small businesses, protect workers

and grow our nation’s economy. These com-
munities have also had historically low enroll-ment in the Deferred Action for Childhood Ar-rivals (DACA) program, which would otherwise help them to achieve stability and security. 
Mr. Speaker, as a representative for tens of 
thousands of Asian Americans and Pacific Is-landers, I join with my colleagues in recog-nizing the contributions of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders to not just our history, but our economy and our future. I call on all Americans to celebrate Asian Pacific American Heritage month by deepening their under-standing about these contributions, and pledge to support and serve Asian American and Pa-cific Islander families.

UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL ROAD 
SAFETY WEEK 
HON. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN 
OF MARYLAND  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 8, 2015 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
recognition of the third annual United Nations Global Road Safety Week and to celebrate the contribution of the Association for Safe Inter-national Road Travel (ASIRT) to the global ef-fort to reduce the number of road crashes around the world. 
ASIRT is extremely active in the global 
movement to promote and improve road safe-ty. Tens of thousands of people are injured as a result of traffic collisions each year. More than 500 children are killed every day in road crashes and 186,300 children under 18 die from road traffic crashes annually. The rates of road traffic death are three times higher in developing countries than in developed coun-tries. 
As part of the Decade of Action for Road 
Safety, ASIRT has joined with the United Na-tions Road Safety Collaboration to announce #SaveKidsLives, a global campaign focused on delivering a Child Declaration on Road Safety to the policymakers who can make a difference. During UN Global Road Safety Week, the #SaveKidsLives Campaign seeks to highlight the plight of children on the world’s roads and generate action to better ensure their safety. The campaign features hundreds of events hosted by governments, international agencies, civil society organizations, and pri-vate companies, including the delivery of the ‘‘Child Declaration for Road Safety’’ to policy- makers. 
During this Global Road Safety Week, I sa-
lute ASIRT and the United Nations for the work they are doing to promote road safety domestically and around the world.

Friday, May 8, 2015 
Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in recognition of University of Miami President Dr. Donna Shalala, a woman who has made such mark on our community since her first day on June 1, 2001. As a two-time 
University of Miami graduate, I have witnessed my alma mater’s immense development during President Shalala’s tenure; a reflection of her tremendous dedication to our community. Dur-ing her tenure, UM has solidified its position among top research universities in the coun-try. The University’s two successful Momen-tum campaigns have raised $3 billion dollars in private support towards its endowment, aca-demic research programs, and world-class fa-cilities. Born in Cleveland, Ohio, President Shalala received her A.B. degree in history from Western College for Women. One of the country’s first Peace Corps Volunteers, she served in Iran from 1962 to 1964. She earned her Ph.D. degree from The Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse Uni-versity. She has held tenured professorships at Columbia University, the City University of New York (CUNY), and the University of Wis-consin-Madison. She served as President of Hunter College of the City University of New York from 1980 to 1987 and as Chancellor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Thank you President Shalala for your commitment to UM, for being a mentor, an educator, and a friend to our country’s next generation of lead-ers.

FORALL THE MOTHER ’S 
For all of the Mother’s of war. 
For all the Mother’s across our shores. Whose son’s and daughters burdens bore. And for all the families who have been sepa-
rated by war. 
While, mommy for our nation so fought for. And all those hours of worry and pain. And all of that heartache with them which 
now remains. 
As they rebuild from the scars and loss of 
war. 
And for all those Mothers who aren’t coming 
home. 
For all their sons or daughters. Who now lie in such cold dark graves so all 
alone. 
Remember them this Mother’s Day, and say a prayer for all of them . . . please 
say. 
And for of those Mothers who must learn to 
walk again. 
And son’s and daughters must somehow start 
their new lives, 
so begin. Without arms and legs, and with scars and burns upon their faces. all in such places. As they help them rebuild, so face this. Lets give thanks and praise for all of them. And for all of those little boys and girls, who have now lost their best friends in the 
world. Their Mother’s who are the heart of the 
home. 
Mommy aint coming home. Who now on Mother’s Day sit with tear in 
eye. 
not understanding why mommy didn’t say 
goodbye. 
For the Mother is the heart of the home. They give us life and they give us love. And in our darkest of all hours help us to 
rise above. 
And how they cry, when their most beloved daughters and sons 
die. 
A pain that can not be healed by time. Only when in heaven they reunite. As they teach us even more. About faith and courage, and with hope how to overcome the scars of 
war. 
This Mother’s Day carry them with you in 
your thoughts, 
upon your way as you pray. And give thanks for what they give, and what they gave. For all the Mother’s this Mother’s Day!

TRIBUTE TO YOUNG STAFF MEM-
BERS FOR THEIR CONTRIBU-TIONS ON BEHALF OF THE PEO-PLE OF THE 18TH CONGRES-SIONAL DISTRICT OF TEXAS AND THE UNITED STATES 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, May 8, 2015 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as Mem-
bers of Congress we know well, perhaps bet-ter than most, how blessed our nation is to have in reserve such exceptional young men and women who will go on to become leaders in their local communities, states, and the na-tion in the areas of business, education, gov-ernment, philanthropy, the arts and culture, and the military. 
We know this because we see them and 
benefit from their contributions every day. Many of them work for us in our offices as jun-ior staff members, congressional fellows, or in-terns and they do amazing work for and on behalf of the constituents we are privileged to represent. 
Mr. Speaker, I believe there is no higher 
calling than the call to serve a cause larger than ourselves. That is why I ran for public of-fice. I was inspired to serve by President Ken-nedy who said, ‘‘Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country,’’ and by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. who said: 
‘‘Everybody can be great because anybody 
can serve. . . . You only need a heart full of grace. A soul generated by love.’’ 
By this measure, there are several other 
great young men and women who served as volunteers this year in my offices. They may toil in obscurity but their contributions to the constituents we serve are deeply appreciated and that is why today I rise to pay tribute to six extraordinary young persons for their serv-ice to my constituents in the 18th Congres-sional District of Texas and to the American people. They are: Kenya Metters, Chelsea Ukoha, Ryan Wallace, Gregory Butchello, Fa-bian Rubio, and Danielle Konerth.

idealism these wonderful young people

Because of persons like them the future of 
our country is bright and its best days lie ahead. I wish them all well. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful that such
