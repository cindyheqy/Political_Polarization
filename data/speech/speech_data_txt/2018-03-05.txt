MORNING-HOUR DEBATE The SPEAKER pro tempore.

AMERICAN ENERGY INDEPENDENCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. M
ARSHALL ) for 5 minutes. Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to progress on a critical nationwide initiative: Amer-ican energy independence. Energy is a bedrock industry of the American eco-nomic machine. Energy fosters innova-tion and has seen substantial leaps in efficiency, which have led to a dra-matic expansion in scale. To highlight the important progress our oil and gas producers have achieved, we need to look no further than my home State of Kansas, even just to think back to my childhood being raised up in Butler County, Kan-sas, which, during World War I, was the world’s largest producer of oil. Kansas has long been known for our production in agriculture and aviation. It is the spirit of innovation that has pushed Kansans to utilize their vast and diverse energy opportunities. The Wheat State is, in fact, a top-10 State for crude oil production and has the Hugoton gas area, one of the top-pro-ducing natural gas fields in the United States. These factors give Kansas the oppor-tunity to be a leader in the national ef-fort to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil. In fact, American energy exports now compete with Middle East oil for buyers in Asia. Daily trading volumes of U.S. oil futures contracts have more than doubled in the past decade. I was reminded of the size of the ex-port opportunity this past week when I was in Mexico City in NAFTA discus-sions. With improved delivery systems and more efficient extraction methods, the United States is now exporting more than 1.7 million barrels of crude oil each day, with an increase of 11 per-cent expected by 2019. The economic impacts of increased United States out-put are encouraging to everyone in the industry who has fought through tough times with low crude oil prices. This expansion has shaved our Na-tion’s oil imports by 20 percent over the past decade and provided 21st cen-tury careers in rural communities. Since the 2008 peak, we have lowered consumer prices for domestic gasoline by 37 percent. Just a few short years ago, no one would have imagined the United States could have increased production of oil and natural gas while still cutting greenhouse gas emissions, which are now near 25-year lows, yet we have. These advancements are evidence of the ingenuity of our producers. Fur-ther, they show that we have balanced energy production and environmental stewardship. For the first time in generations, American energy policy is focusing on domestic production, global leadership, and economic opportunity. And that is something worth recognizing. f 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until 2 p.m. today. Accordingly (at 12 o’clock and 3 min-utes p.m.), the House stood in recess.

RRINGTON ) at 2 p.m.

PRAYER Reverend Brian Chrzastek, O.P., Do-minican House of Studies, Washington, D.C., offered the following prayer: All powerful and ever-living God, thankful for the peace and security of our Nation, won by the many sacrifices of those who have gone before us, we continue to seek Your aid, those who serve our country in this Congress and all who assist them. We humbly ask that You strengthen them by Your grace. May they con-tinue selflessly in the fulfillment of their duties. May they vigorously tend to the constituencies that they rep-resent. May they be fair and attentive in their deliberations with their fellow representatives. And while mindful of particular interests, may they also seek to benefit all of this Nation and all of humanity itself.

THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Jour-nal stands approved. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. B
ROOKS ) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
RECOGNIZING MADIGAN M CGRATH (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a constituent of mine from Bucks County, Pennsyl-vania. Her name is Madigan McGrath, an honor student who works two jobs, volunteers with the Big Brothers Big Sisters, takes three dance classes per week, has an active social life, and hap-pens to have type 1 diabetes. When Madigan was 13 years old, she was diagnosed with type I diabetes. Madigan took it in stride, much quicker than expected. Before she even left the hospital, she asked if there was a brochure that she could give her friends to explain type 1 diabetes. Learning that one did not exist, Mad-igan made one herself. Madigan takes every opportunity to educate others about this disease and has spread awareness of it. Through her fundraising, Madigan made a video about her illness and lifestyle. One of the quotes she used was: ‘‘Diabetes doesn’t define me; I define diabetes.’’ She now wants to pursue a career in the medical field, specifically in pedi-atric endocrinology, so that she can help other kids with type 1 diabetes. Mr. Speaker, I want to join my col-leagues in thanking Madigan for her commitment to helping others with this disease and educating the commu-nity and the country about type 1 dia-betes. 
f 
HONORING DEPUTY JACOB PICKETT (Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to honor Deputy Jacob Pickett of the Boone County Sheriff’s Office, who paid the ultimate sacrifice and sacrificed his life on the job last Friday. As Boone County Sheriff Mike Nielsen said about Jake, as those who are close to him called him: There will forever be a loss felt in our community for him. He was a warrior, and he died laying down his life for you. He will never be forgotten. Last Friday morning, 34-year-old Boone County Sheriff’s Deputy Jacob Pickett was attempting to arrest a per-son who had an outstanding warrant. As is so common, one department helped out another, and Deputy Pick-ett joined police officers from the Leb-anon Police Department in pursuit. During that pursuit, he was fatally shot. Tragically, he will never return home to his loved ones and is leaving behind a wife, Jen, two very young children, and his beloved K–9 partner, a German Shepherd named Brick. The last time a Boone County officer was killed in the line of duty was over 80 years ago, in 1935. Deputy Pickett also served as a Tip-ton County Sheriff’s Department dep-uty and served at the Marion County Jail, all counties I represent in the Fifth District of Indiana. He has led the Boone County Sheriff’s Department K–9 Team for the last 2 years and worked with Brick around the clock. He was known by his childhood friend as a good guy all around who was kind, compassionate, and generous. He dedi-cated his life to serving others and con-tinues to do so even now, as an organ donor. As Sheriff Nielsen said, that thin blue line was crossed. I offer my deep-est condolences to Deputy Pickett’s family, to the Boone County Sheriff’s Department and their friends, the men and women in law enforcement who mourn his loss and will cherish his memory forever. f 
FRUIT OF THE POISONOUS TREE (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, there is a legal term called ‘‘fruit of the poisonous tree.’’ If the evidence, or tree, is tainted, then anything gained from the evi-dence, the fruit, is tainted as well. A former FBI Director intentionally leaked questionable memos about President Trump, hoping it would lead to the appointment of a special pros-ecutor. It did. Since the evidence for a special prosecutor was tainted, the ap-pointment of the special prosecutor was tainted, too. If the premise is faulty, the conclusion is faulty. To continue the investigation is to violate a legal principle and dishonor our system of justice. The process is poisoned. The special prosecutor should cease and desist. USS ‘‘CARL VINSON’’ MAKES A PORT CALL IN VIETNAM (Mr. HILL asked and was given per-mission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, this week, the USS Carl Vinson arrives in Da Nang, Vietnam. This is the first visit of a U.S. aircraft carrier to Vietnam in four decades, and obviously for a very different purpose. Together, Vietnam and America are demonstrating the im-portance of open sea lanes for com-merce, security, and regional develop-ment. Arriving aboard the USS Carl Vinson is a young officer named Tower Cook. Tower is from Dallas, Texas, and the grandson of former U.S. Senator John G. Tower of Texas. Senator Tower was elected to the Senate in a 1961 special election and served the people of Texas for 24 years. He led the implementation of President Reagan’s strategy of a larger, competitive, modern Navy, and it was an honor for me to work for him the final 2 years of his term in office. President Reagan and Senator Tow-er’s vision of the importance of the Navy is illustrated by this week’s visit of the Carl Vinson to Vietnam. Senator Tower, also a master chief petty offi-cer, is looking down from his heavenly perch with great pride in seeing his grandson, Tower Cook, and the success of the United States Navy. f

MISSION VETERANS POST OFFICE BUILDING Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1209) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service lo-cated at 901 N. Francisco Avenue, Mis-sion, Texas, as the ‘‘Mission Veterans Post Office Building’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1209 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. MISSION VETERANS POST OFFICE BUILDING. 
(a) D ESIGNATION .—The facility of the United States Postal Service located at 901 N. Francisco Avenue, Mission, Texas, shall be known and designated as the ‘‘Mission Veterans Post Office Building’’. (b) R
EFERENCES .—Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the facility re-ferred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the ‘‘Mission Veterans Post Office Building’’. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to the rule, the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. P
ALMER ) and the gen-tleman from Missouri (Mr. C
LAY) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alabama. 
GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to re-vise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Alabama? There was no objection. Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1209, introduced by the gen-tleman from Texas, Representative H
ENRY CUELLAR . H.R. 1209 honors the veterans of Mis-sion, Texas, for their service to this Nation, veterans like First Lieutenant Joaquin Castro. Lieutenant Castro, born in Mission, Texas, served as a pilot in the Army Air Corps from 1941 until 1943, when he was declared missing in action. For his service, Lieutenant Castro earned the National Defense Service Medal, the Distinguished Flying Cross, and the Air Medal with an Oak Leaf Cluster. I look forward to hearing more about Lieutenant Castro and the veterans of Mission, Texas, from Mr. C
UELLAR . Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the bal-ance of my time. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 1209, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service lo-cated at 901 North Francisco Avenue, Mission, Texas, as the Mission Vet-erans Post Office Building. At this time, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. C
UELLAR ) so that he may tell us more about the honorable vet-erans from Mission, Texas. Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, I cer-tainly want to thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. C
LAY) for his lead-ership and for his work on this com-mittee; and, also, my friend from Ala-bama (Mr. P
ALMER ) for the work he does on this committee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1209, which will rename a post office facility in my district at 901 North Francisco Avenue in Mission, Texas, as the Mission Veterans Post Office. Across my district, fine men and women of all walks of life have honor-ably served our country, and it is crit-ical that we honor their service and their dedication. Mission alone is home to over 2,000 veterans, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Dedicating this post office to our veterans will serve as an enduring reminder of the sacrifices that our friends, neighbors, and fami-lies have made while serving their country. These individuals put country ahead of self, and I am proud to recog-nize them with the dedicating of this post office facility. Today in particular, I want to ac-knowledge the sacrifice of Captain Joa-quin Castro from Mission, Texas. Cap-tain Castro joined the Army Air Corps in 1941 and served as a B–17 pilot in the Pacific theater. He was stationed at Hickam Field in Hawaii during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, where his airfield was extensively dam-aged and suffered heavy casualties. However, Captain Castro would go on to serve several missions against enemy forces before being declared missing in action during a bombing mission. He received the National Defense Service Medal, the Distinguished Fly-ing Cross, and the Air Medal with an Oak Leaf Cluster. Captain Castro would eventually be honored with an elementary school named after him in his hometown in Mission, Texas. He was known to be a humble and diligent individual who served in a variety of jobs before joining the military. He was a janitor; he was a school bus driver; and he was a stenographer also. We owe our freedom to veterans like Mr. Castro, which is why I am recog-nizing him with the dedication of this post office, not only for his service but also that of the other veterans. He is just one example of many veterans who have made countless sacrifices for their country in the face of danger. The bravery and the commitment of our veterans to our Nation demonstrates what it really means to be an Amer-ican, the essence of an American. Mr. Speaker, I would also, at this time, take a moment to thank the vet-erans organizations throughout my dis-trict for their tireless work in pro-viding the care that our veterans need. Let us remember and express our grati-tude to these courageous people: the veterans, their families, as well as their caregivers. In the words of President John F. Kennedy: A nation reveals itself not only by the men it produces but also by the men it honors, the men it remem-bers. And, of course, we include women in that quote also. This bill allows us to show our appre-ciation for the veterans of Mission, Texas, and to make sure that their sac-rifice to our country is not forgotten. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge the passage of H.R. 1209, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. P
ALMER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1209.

LANCE CORPORAL JORDAN S. BASTEAN POST OFFICE Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2673) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service lo-cated at 514 Broadway Street in Pekin, Illinois, as the ‘‘Lance Corporal Jordan S. Bastean Post Office’’. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows:

Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Alabama? There was no objection. Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2673, introduced by the gentle-woman from Illinois (Mrs. B
USTOS ). H.R. 2673 names the post office at 514 Broadway Street in Pekin, Illinois, after Lance Corporal Jordan S. Bastean. Lance Corporal Jordan S. Bastean enlisted in the United States Marine Corps after graduating high school. He deployed to the Helmand province of Afghanistan, where, on Oc-tober 23, 2011, he gave his life in service of our country. H.R. 2673 pays tribute to Corporal Bastean’s sacrifice. I urge my col-leagues to support the bill, and I re-serve the balance of my time. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 2673, a bill to designate the facility of the U.S. Postal Service located at 514 Broadway Street in Pekin, Illinois, as the Lance Corporal Jordan S. Bastean Post Office. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. BUSTOS ) to tell us more about Lance Corporal Jordan S. Bastean. Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from the great State of Mis-souri (Mr. C
LAY) for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, which would designate the post office in Pekin, Illinois, as the Lance Corporal Jordan S. Bastean Post Office. A 2010 graduate of Pekin Community High School, Jordan was a 4-year cadet in the Junior ROTC and was the cap-tain of the air rifle team. As an avid hunter, an athlete, and a big fan of taking his dad’s Jeep off-roading, he was the very definition of what it means to be a Midwesterner. Just like a lot of young men and women from the heartland, Jordan be-lieved in service, and he believed in being the best he could be. That is why he joined the Marines. And Lance Cor-poral Bastean’s commitment to service was so infectious that his dad quit his job and followed him into the military. But on October 23, 2011, during his first deployment to Afghanistan, Lance Corporal Bastean made the ultimate sacrifice for our Nation in the Helmand province. Back home, Steve and Kathy Bastean lost their only child at the age of 19. Mr. Speaker, this Saturday, when his family releases balloons at his grave site to mark what would have been only his 26th birthday, I hope they know that a grateful Nation mourns with them. On behalf of the families of the 17th Congressional District of Illinois and from the entire United States, I want to offer my deepest condolences to the entire Bastean family, to all of Lance Corporal Bastean’s friends, and to all of the brave men and women in uni-form who fight for our freedom today. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge the passage of H.R. 2673, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. P

yielding time, as well as Ranking Member E
LIJAH CUMMINGS and Chair-man T
REYGOWDY for their support in bringing this bill to the floor. I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4406, my bill to designate the post of-fice located at 99 Macombs Place in New York, New York, as the Tuskegee Airmen Post Office Building. The Tuskegee Airmen hold a historic significance as the first Black military aviators to serve in the U.S. Army Air Corps during the peak of World War II. At the time, racial segregation re-mained in the U.S. Armed Forces as well as much of the country. These men were treated as second-class citi-zens, and much of the military estab-lishment believed back then that Black soldiers were inferior to White soldiers. The Tuskegee Airmen proved them wrong. Collectively, they earned more than 150 Distinguished Flying Crosses, and they flew missions in secondhand P–40 planes, which were slower and more difficult to maneuver. Yet, in their more than 200 escort missions, the Tuskegee Airmen had a better success rate than any other escort groups of the 15th Air Force. The Tuskegee Airmen were active in fighting against Jim Crow laws in the South, and their success and bravery encouraged the eventual integration of the U.S. Armed Forces. Many of the men who served in this squadron dedi-cated their lives to fighting for racial equality and civil rights. Among the Tuskegee Airmen was a 26-year-old second lieutenant of Do-minican heritage named Esteban Hotesse. Mr. Hotesse immigrated to the United States through Ellis Island at the age of 4 with his mother. He went on to serve as a pilot for 3 years with the Tuskegee Airmen before being killed during a military exercise in 1945. Naming this post office after the Tuskegee Airmen is a fitting tribute to honor their memory and contributions to this country. I am proud to have sponsored this bill and look forward to the Tuskegee Airmen’s legacy living on in my district for many, many years to come. Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for bringing up this bill. The State of Alabama takes immense pride in the Tuskegee Airmen for their skill and courage. Mr. Speaker, I would like to make the gentleman from Missouri aware that I have no further speakers, and I am prepared to close. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I urge the pas-sage of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4406, which designates the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 99 Macombs Place in New York, New York, as the ‘‘Tuskegee Air-men Post Office Building.’’ H.R. 4406 is a fitting tribute to the African American men who fought heroically and against great odds and personal hardships, in World War II and is long overdue. The 332nd Fighter Group and the 477th, Bombardment Group of the United States Army Air Forces, which will be forever known as the ‘‘Tuskegee Airmen,’’ were instrumental in the Allied Powers victory in World War II, and is by any standard American heroes. For these reasons it is a fitting tribute that we honor these men by naming the Post Of-fice at 99 Macombs Place, in Harlem, New York after them. A few years ago about this time, I was hon-ored to join my colleagues, Congressman J
OHN LEWIS and Congressman C HARLES RAN-
GEL, a Korean War veteran, in paying tribute to surviving members of the Tuskegee Airmen and the 555th Parachute Infantry, the famed ‘‘Triple Nickels’’ at a moving ceremony spon-sored by the U.S. Army commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The success of the Tuskegee Airmen in es-corting bombers during World War II—achiev-ing one of the lowest loss records of all the escort fighter groups, and being in constant demand for their services by the allied bomber units—is a record unmatched by any other fighter group. So impressive and astounding were the feats of the Tuskegee Airmen that in 1948, it helped persuade President Harry Truman to issue his famous Executive Order No. 9981, which directed equality of treatment and op-portunity in all of the United States Armed Forces and led to the end of racial segrega-tion in the U.S. military forces. It is a source of enormous and enduring pride that my father-in-law, Phillip Ferguson Lee, was one of the Tuskegee Airmen. Clearly, what began as an experiment to de-termine whether ‘‘colored’’ soldiers were capa-ble of operating expensive and complex com-bat aircraft ended as an unqualified success based on the experience of the Tuskegee Air-men, whose record included 261 aircraft de-stroyed, 148 aircraft damaged, 15,553 combat sorties and 1,578 missions over Italy and North Africa. These outstanding African American men defied all odds and became military pilots when the United States was still subject to Jim Crow Laws and the American military was still segregated. Not only were these men exceptional sol-diers who fearlessly defended this nation, but they were torchbearers who illuminated a path for countless African Americans to follow. The Tuskegee Airmen proved that the anti-dote to racism is excellence in performance. This bill would honor the unsung heroes of World War II who valiantly fought to defend this nation and pioneered a movement that led to the desegregation of the American military. For these reasons, I am proud to support, H.R. 4406; and I ask my colleagues to join me in voting to pass this fitting tribute to American heroes. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. P
ALMER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4406, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4646. This bill names the post office at 1900 Corporate Drive in Bir-mingham, Alabama, after Lance Cor-poral Thomas E. Rivers, Jr. Corporal Rivers was a resident of Hoover, Alabama, and a graduate of Briarwood Christian School. Both of Rivers’ grandfathers served in the military, and he desired to fol-low in their footsteps. Corporal Rivers wrote in a high school essay that he ‘‘wanted to be a marine since he was 10 years old,’’ and that he believed ‘‘join-ing the Marines would be a good experi-ence for him because it would teach

him to rely on God to make it through.’’ Two weeks after graduating from high school, Thomas fulfilled his dream by joining the Marines. He was known by his fellow marines as a man of de-vout faith who was always looking for ways to serve his fellow marines. In the early morning hours of April 28, 2010, while deployed in Helmand province, Afghanistan, Rivers ordered his men to take their positions. How-ever, the marine assigned to stand watch was exhausted. As a patrol lead-er, Rivers was never required to stand post, but Thomas had been reading in the Bible about how love isn’t an emo-tion but is demonstrated in laying your life down for your friends. Rivers told the weary marine: ‘‘I’ll stand post for you; you rest.’’ Tragically, while replacing the ex-hausted marine, Rivers activated an improvised explosive device. Rivers gave his life for his country and exem-plified the attitude in John 15:13: 
Greater love has no one than this, that he should lay down his life for his friends. 
This bill pays tribute to Corporal Rivers’ sacrifice. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 4646, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service lo-cated at 1900 Corporate Drive in Bir-mingham, Alabama, as the Lance Cor-poral Thomas E. Rivers, Jr. Post Office Building. Born in Hoover, Alabama, Lance Cor-poral Thomas Rivers, Jr., held a deep love and dedication to both his faith and his country. Mr. Rivers dreamed of becoming a marine from a young age and enlisted following his graduation from Briarwood Christian School in 2007. Tragically, on April 28, 2010, Lance Corporal Rivers was killed by an im-provised explosive device while serving in Afghanistan. He was just 22 years old. In order that they might honor and continue their son’s love of country, Lance Corporal Rivers’ parents now run a nonprofit organization that sends care packages to soldiers. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to commemorate Lance Corporal Thomas Rivers, Jr., and the ultimate sacrifice he made for the country he so loved. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 4646, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I appre-ciate very much the comments from the gentleman from Missouri. I know the family does. I knew Corporal Rivers. He attended the same high school as my children. I know his mom and dad very well. He is another example—as we have heard time and time again on this floor—of young men and women willing to sac-rifice their lives not only for their country, but for their fellow soldiers and marines. It is an honor to stand here with my friend, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. CLAY) to urge pas-sage of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I would like to make the gentleman from Missouri aware that I have no further speakers, and I am prepared to close. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I am hon-ored to urge the passage of this legisla-tion for Lance Corporal Rivers, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PALMER.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Alabama? There was no objection. Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4685, introduced by the gen-tleman from Rhode Island, Representa-tive DAVID CICILLINE . Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4685 names the U.S. Post Office at 515 Hope Street in Bristol, Rhode Island, after U.S. Army First Sergeant P. Andrew McKenna, Jr. First Sergeant McKenna served 15 years in the Army, most recently as a Green Beret, and then as the first ser-geant for the Special Operations Joint Task Forces—Afghanistan. In August 2015, First Sergeant McKenna was killed in action while de-fending Camp Integrity in Kabul, Af-ghanistan, against insurgents. For his bravery and leadership during the at-tack, he was posthumously awarded the Silver Star. This bill would honor his service to the Nation, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am also pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 4685. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. C
ICILLINE ) to tell us about the heroism of First Sergeant Andrew McKenna, Jr. Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I am hon-ored to stand before you today to pay tribute to the life and service of a true American hero, First Sergeant P. An-drew McKenna, by naming the Bristol Post Office in his honor. A native of Bristol, Rhode Island, Sergeant McKenna dedicated 17 years of his life to serve and protect our country in the United States Army. Born in 1980 to his mother, Carol, and father, Peter, Sergeant McKenna knew at the age of 5 years old that he wanted to be a soldier, and by the age of 7 that he wanted to serve the Nation as a Green Beret. His family and close childhood friends recall him wearing camouflage-patterned clothes almost every day. Sergeant McKenna attended Mount Hope High School in Bristol, grad-uating in the spring of 1998. Upon grad-uation, he immediately enlisted in the Army as an infantryman. After just 3 years, he went to selec-tion for the Green Berets. He com-pleted the grueling Special Forces Qualification Course in 2003, achieving his lifelong dream to be a part of the military’s most elite. Sergeant McKenna was then assigned to the First Battalion, 7th Special Forces Group. He went on to serve one tour of duty in Iraq and five more tours in Afghanistan. During his first tour in Afghanistan, from 2004 to 2005, First Sergeant McKenna was awarded the Bronze Star with Valor for his tremendous courage under fierce enemy fire during a mis-sion that resulted in the death of a sen-ior Taliban official. He would then go

on to earn 18 military awards, includ-ing the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Purple Heart, the Army Commendation Medal, and the Army Achievement Medal. First Sergeant McKenna is remem-bered at each of his duty stations for his intense work ethic, strong atten-tion to detail, commitment to excel-lence, quick sense of humor, and infec-tious smile. To this day, former team leaders and fellow servicemembers praise his motivation, leadership, and ability to bring out the best in the peo-ple around him. Of the countless stories I could tell that exemplify these values in Ser-geant McKenna, there is one that stands out. In 2011, Master Sergeant Chris Corbin, a fellow Green Beret, was forced to undergo a double amputation on both legs after stepping on a hidden IED in Afghanistan. During a months- long recovery process at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, First Sergeant McKenna would make the 5-hour drive from Fort Bragg, lo-cated in North Carolina, to visit Mas-ter Sergeant Corbin, sometimes spend-ing multiple days or even weeks at his bedside. Master Sergeant Corbin would later go on to credit Sergeant McKen-na’s reliability and motivation for get-ting him through his recovery. This same selfless devotion to his fel-low servicemembers was, of course, not a first for Sergeant McKenna, and it would not be his last in a decorated life that was ended far too soon. He was stationed at Camp Integrity in Kabul, Afghanistan, in August of 2015 when Taliban soldiers exploded a car bomb outside the gates of the com-pound in the middle of the night. Four heavily armed insurgents opened fire on security contractors guarding the Special Forces complex, killing eight guards and breaching the facility. Ser-geant McKenna was messaging with his mother at the time, and her last mes-sage to her son went unanswered. After hearing an explosion and gun-shots, he immediately grabbed his weapon and proceeded to engage the enemy alongside fellow Green Beret, Master Sergeant George Vera. b1730 During the ensuing firefight, First Sergeant McKenna lost his life and Master Sergeant Vera suffered critical wounds to his spine, kidney, liver, and leg. Their decision to charge into the fight without hesitation and regard for their own safety likely prevented the deaths of many, many soldiers sta-tioned at that base. First Sergeant McKenna’s bravery and his ultimate sacrifice allowed sup-porting personnel to eliminate the Taliban attack and secure the complex. First Sergeant McKenna was post-humously awarded the Silver Star for Valor in Combat, the Nation’s third highest decoration for valor, for his courageous and lifesaving actions. He was fearless. He was heroic. He represented the very highest examples of service, duty, and sacrifice through-out his career and on this fateful day. However, in the words of his friend, Master Sergeant Corbin: ‘‘That’s just Drew. There’s dozens of times he’s done stuff like that.’’ First Sergeant McKenna was laid to rest in St. Mary’s Cemetery in Bristol next to his brother, Patrick, who passed away in 2005. He is survived by his mother and fa-ther, whom I had the honor of hosting for President Obama’s final State of the Union Address. The First Sergeant P. Andrew McKenna, Jr., Memorial Scholarship Fund, set up in his memory, awards $6,000 in scholarships every year to Rhode Island high school students planning to attend college or serve in the Armed Forces. Andrew McKenna was a true Amer-ican hero who embodied the very best of Rhode Island values. His patriotism, loyalty, and sense of shared purpose were reflections of his strong character and the values he learned growing up in Bristol. I consider myself fortunate to have met First Sergeant McKenna in 2015 at the Bristol Fourth of July parade and for my continued relationship with his wonderful family. I am proud to lead the effort here in Congress to honor First Sergeant McKenna’s legacy that means so much to his family, his friends, the town of Bristol, and the State of Rhode Island. Mr. Speaker, I extend my gratitude to Chairman G
OWDY and Ranking Mem-ber C
UMMINGS for their support of this bill, as well as my good friend and co-sponsor of this bill, Congressman J
IM L
ANGEVIN . Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their courtesy and urge my col-leagues to support this bill. Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gen-tleman from Rhode Island (Mr. L
AN-
GEVIN ), my good friend. Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by com-mending my colleague from the First Congressional District of Rhode Island, Mr. C
ICILLINE , for sponsoring this bill in the first place. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a Rhode Island hero and to support the designation of the United States Postal Service facility at 515 Hope Street in Bristol, Rhode Island, as the First Ser-geant P. Andrew McKenna Jr. Post Of-fice. First Sergeant McKenna had served with distinction for 17 years when he was killed on August 7, 2015, during an insurgent attack on Camp Integrity in Afghanistan. That previous summer, I had the privilege of meeting First Sergeant McKenna at the Bristol Fourth of July parade. Mr. Speaker, he was only 35 years old, and he died running toward incom-ing fire, saving the lives of his fellow soldiers. A member of the 1st Battalion, 7th Special Forces Group out of Eglin Air Force Base, First Sergeant McKenna saw six deployments, five to Afghani-stan and one to Iraq, and his extraor-dinary service was recognized through-out. Among his many medals are five Bronze Stars, one of which was award-ed with a valor device for his actions during a mission that resulted in the death of a senior Taliban commander. Following First Sergeant McKenna’s death, he was awarded a Purple Heart and Silver Star, decorations he richly deserved. In my time as ranking member of the Committee on Armed Services Sub-committee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, I have heard the stories of many of our special operators and the heroic deeds they perform to keep us safe here at home. They are the con-summate quiet professionals, never far from danger, yet shying away from the spotlight. First Sergeant McKenna was ‘‘the best of us,’’ his fellow Green Beret, Ser-geant First Class Tim Kennedy, re-marked. He gave his life for his country, and naming the post office at 515 Hope Street in his honor is just a small way that we can thank him for his remark-able service and ensure that his mem-ory lives on. Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank my colleague, Mr. CICILLINE , and our two Senators, J
ACKREEDand S HELDON  W
HITEHOUSE , for coming together to offer this legislation. First Sergeant McKenna has made his parents, Peter and Carol McKenna, his friends, the town of Bristol, and the entire State of Rhode Island extraor-dinarily proud. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring his courage, his service, and his sacrifice today. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge passage of H.R. 4685, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

ATTOOMEY . The bill would name the U.S. Post Office at 120 West Pike Street in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, in honor of Police Officer Scott Bashioum. Officer Bashioum served 29 years in the United States Air Force, retiring as a senior master sergeant. During his service in the Air Force, Officer Bashioum served in the Persian Gulf war, Operation Enduring Free-dom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and was part of the recovery effort in the after-math of Hurricane Wilma. After retiring, Officer Bashioum be-came a police officer for the Canonsburg community. On November 10, 2016, he was shot and killed while responding to a do-mestic violence call. I thank Senator T

Scott Leslie Bashioum was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and joined the U.S. Air Force in June of 1996, as a member of the 911th Airlift Wing’s Civil Engineering Squadron. Scott served in both Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Following 29 years of service in the Air Force, Senior Master Sergeant Bashioum became a full-time police of-ficer in the Canonsburg community. On November 10, 2016, Officer Bashioum was killed in service to his community while responding to a do-mestic violence call. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to commemorate the life of public serv-ice lived by Officer Scott Bashioum and honor his memory.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Alabama? There was no objection. Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3183, introduced by the gen-tleman from Virginia, Representative TOMGARRETT . H.R. 3183 names the post office at 13683 James Madison Highway in Pal-myra, Virginia, after U.S. Navy Sea-man Apprentice Dakota Kyle Rigsby. Seaman Rigsby tragically lost his life on June 17, 2017, as the result of a naval accident while serving on the USS Fitzgerald. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. G
ARRETT ) to hear more about Seaman Rigsby’s life and service. Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Alabama for yield-ing and the gentleman from Missouri. The Bible says: Greater love hath no man than this, to lay down his life for his brothers and sisters. On September 12, 1997, a little boy was born to a hardworking couple and named Dakota Kyle Rigsby. Dakota’s father served in the mili-tary, and this would influence Dakota’s decision to one day follow in his fa-ther’s footsteps and also serve this great Nation. Every young man and woman, and every parent who kisses a child good- bye, understands that the potential price for such a decision is to make the ultimate sacrifice for something that is bigger and greater than yourself, and on June 17, 2017, Dakota Kyle Rigsby did just that, along with six colleagues: Yeoman 3rd Class Shingo Alexander Douglass; Sonar Technician 3rd Class Ngoc Truong Huynh; Gunners Mate 2nd Class Noe Hernandez; Fire Controlman 2nd Class Carlos Victor Ganzon Sibayan; Personnel Specialist 1st Class Xavier Alec Martin; and Fire Controlman 1st Class Gary Leo Rehm, Jr. I often joke that the United States is the worst country in the world except for all the others. When a slave owner named Jefferson articulated an idea for the world that all people were created equal, it hark-ens to the preamble to the Constitu-tion that gives us not a perfect union, but asks us to work towards a more perfect union, which means that there is always work to be done. Mr. Speaker, this work is invariably done in most instances by women and men whose names we will never know. So we carry this bill so that one of those heroes upon the backs of whom our Nation is built will be remembered, even if only in a small place in a small way, for sacrificing every single one of his tomorrows to help us continue to be free.

So this young man, devoted to serv-ice, demonstrated this from his time in high school as a volunteer firefighter to that eventful night when he exe-cuted his duties and went to bed for the day on the USS Fitzgerald. I understand that there is a lot that we still need to do in this country, but please understand that we are where we are because better people than us have given all of their tomorrows for us to be here. I would submit that when you hear that national anthem, while I would defend to my last breath your right not to stand, that you do stand. Stand up for Dakota Kyle Rigsby because, by God, he stood up for us. Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. I am pleased to join my friend from the great State of Virginia (Mr. G
AR-
RETT ) in urging passage of H.R. 3183, the U.S. Navy Seaman Dakota Kyle Rigsby Post Office. The youngest servicemember killed in the collision on the USS Fitzgerald, Seaman Rigsby is remembered today by his family and friends for his sense of humor and true passion for public service. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to honor Seaman Rigsby’s memory and service to his country. Mr. Speaker, I want to inform the gentleman from Alabama that I have no further speakers on this bill. I urge its passage, and I yield back the bal-ance of my time. Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I have been very honored to join with the gen-tleman from Missouri (Mr. C
LAY) and my other colleagues to not only honor those named, but their families and colleagues, as well, and let them know that these heroes, their loved ones, will not be forgotten. I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. P
ALMER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3183. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Sadly, in 2018 alone, over 1.7 million Americans will be diagnosed with can-cer and more than 600,000 individuals will lose the battle against this dread-ful disease. That is why, Mr. Speaker, Relay for Life is such an important event to raise awareness and funds to help can-cer patients and their families in my area of south Florida. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the countless volunteers and local sponsors who are going to make this wonderful day possible, a day filled with activities, games, and fun. Let us all join together to make a difference in the fight against cancer and make this year’s Relay for Life the best one yet. 
f 
COMBATING GUN VIOLENCE (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speak-er, since the tragic events at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, leading American companies, including DICK’S Sporting Goods, Walmart, L.L.Bean, and Kroger, have taken a leadership role in com-bating gun violence. Last week, all four companies an-nounced that they would no longer sell guns to anyone under 21. DICK’S Sporting Goods has dem-onstrated singular courage as the first company to establish a minimum age for gun sales and also by announcing that it would no longer sell assault- style rifles or high-capacity magazines. When DICK’S announced these poli-cies, it also challenged Congress to show the same commitment to com-monsense gun reform. In his open let-ter, DICK’S Sporting Goods’ CEO Ed Stack implored Congress to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, establish the age of 21 as the new min-imum age to buy a firearm, and secure an effective universal background check system. The American business community is already acting to combat gun violence. The private sector is ahead of us. Con-gress must follow suit. 
f 
PERMANENT STATUS FOR LIBE-RIANS IN DEFERRED ENFORCED DEPARTURE (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share my support as a cospon-sor of the Liberian Refugee Immigra-tion Fairness Act, which gives Libe-rians in deferred enforced departure permanent status. Thousands of Liberians came to the United States to escape civil war, seek-ing a better life and a safer environ-ment to raise their families. For the last 25 years, many have sought and re-alized the American Dream through hard work, drive, and determination. They have become small-business own-ers and leaders in our community. Min-nesota is home to one of the largest Li-berian communities in the United States, many of whom live in the west-ern suburbs of the Twin Cities. Mr. Speaker, I have had the distinct pleasure and honor of getting to know many members of the Liberian commu-nity personally. I have heard their sto-ries, and I have seen their love for America firsthand. However, they are facing uncertainty today because their temporary period of protection is about to expire, so it is imperative that ac-tion be taken to ensure they are able to live here, work here, and continue to offer their contributions as important members of our community. f 
SUPPORTING DEFERRED ACTION FOR CHILDHOOD ARRIVALS (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, 6 months ago, the White House shamefully re-scinded the Deferred Action for Child-hood Arrivals program without having legislation in place to protect Dream-ers. That is just wrong. The overwhelming majority of Amer-icans support a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, yet Republican leader-ship refuses to let Congress vote on a clean Dream Act. A few months ago, after ending DACA, the President began rolling back immigration from Black and Latino countries he thinks are s—- holes. After that, he went on a Twitter rant to attack the Diversity Immi-grant Visa program, which helps people from Africa immigrate lawfully to the United States. Eliminating DACA without a plan for Dreamers is just another antiminority move. Removing the Diversity Immi-grant Visa program is more of the same. The administration has shown itself to be hostile to people of color. Mr. Speaker, racism is not a good pol-icy. 
f 
REMEMBERING OFFICER JUSTIN BILLA (Mr. BYRNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of Mobile Police Officer Justin Billa. Officer Billa was tragically shot and killed in the line of duty on February 20. I am not sure my path ever crossed with Officer Billa, but it may have. We take for granted the work our police officers do on a daily basis. Police officers hug their families good-bye and leave their home each day or night not knowing whether they will come home safe. Each and every day, our law enforce-ment and first responders work to keep us safe and support our communities, but we far too often take their service for granted. I can think of no better way to honor the life of Officer Billa than to encour-age every American to take time to say ‘‘thank you’’ to your local police officers. Mr. Speaker, I hope Officer Billa’s wife, Erin, and their young son, Taylor, take comfort in knowing that they are loved. Justin’s service and sacrifice to Mobile, Alabama, and to the United States will never be forgotten. f 
b1915 YUCCA MOUNTAIN NUCLEAR WASTE REPOSITORY IS AN UN-WORKABLE PROJECT (Ms. TITUS asked and was given per-mission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I am here to once again remind my colleagues why the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository is an unworkable project. There are design flaws that the NRC’s own analysis show lead to radio-active waste leaking into the water table, and transportation plans would ship more than 70,000 metric tons of nuclear waste by train and truck through 329 congressional districts for years to come past your homes, your businesses, your schools, and your churches. Now some of my colleagues want to make this bad situation even worse by busting the caps on the amount of al-lowable waste to be stored, increasing the danger and invalidating any exist-ing studies. If the proponents of Yucca Mountain and their industry donors are really se-rious about solving the problems of nu-clear waste storage, they would follow the Blue Ribbon Commission’s rec-ommendations and pass my consent- based bill rather than dumping nuclear waste into a State that does not produce it and does not want it. Nevada is not a wasteland.

POSITIVE EFFECTS OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to recognize the posi-tive effects the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is already having on individuals and businesses in the First Congressional District of Georgia. Two weeks ago, I traveled the First District and visited high school stu-dents, university students, senior citi-zens, small businesses, big businesses, and more to get their feedback on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The results from my trip and the benefits that the First District is already reaping were, frankly, astounding.

For example, Lee Container Company in Homerville said that the new tax law has allowed them to purchase at least three machines a year and to fully amortize them, allowing their company to grow at a substantial rate. Businesses like Lee Container and the large number of individuals in Homerville that they employ are a rea-son it was so important to pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

OUR NATION IS IN THE GRIP OF A GUN VIOLENCE EPIDEMIC (Mr. TONKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, our Nation is in the grip of a gun violence epi-demic; yet, even in the face of national tragedy, Congress has failed again and again to act. On January 10, 2018, a student in Denison, Texas, fired a weapon that be-longed to an adviser, thinking it wasn’t loaded. That same day, a middle school student in Maplewood, Minnesota, fa-tally injured himself with a gun in a school bathroom. On January 23, 2018, a 15-year-old stu-dent in Benton, Kentucky, opened fire with a handgun, killing two people and injuring 18. On February 14, Valentine’s Day, 2018, a 19-year-old gunman killed 14 students and 3 faculty members at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, using a semiautomatic weapon. Two months into 2018, its tragedies are too numerous to list. For too long we have allowed NRA’s gun industry lobbyists to pick and choose our guns laws. I say: No more. Students across America are demand-ing Congress enact commonsense gun violence prevention, including uni-versal background checks, limits on high-capacity magazines, and a ban on the sale of assault weapons designed not for a hunting field, but for a battle-field. We must not fail them again.

RECOGNIZING CLINTON COUNTY’S MISS TEEN UNITED STATES AG-RICULTURE (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute and to re-vise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Haili Marie Frank from Mill Hall, Pennsylvania, who has been named Clinton County’s Miss Teen United States Agriculture. Haili is 16 years old and is the daugh-ter of Eric and Clinta Frank. She is a 10th grader at the Sugar Val-ley Rural Charter School, where she is a member of the National Honor Soci-ety and an officer in the school’s FFA chapter. In 2017, Haili competed in the FFA Creed Speaking competition, placing first in the county and second in the region, which qualified her for the State competition, where she came in 10th. Haili loves animals and is a member of two 4–H groups. Over the past 7 years, Haili has exhibited pigs, goats, lambs, chickens, and rabbits. Haili is also an accomplished archer and shoots with one of her 4–H groups. Last August, she competed in the arch-ery competition at State Days in Rock Run, Pennsylvania, and placed second in her age division. Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly con-gratulate Haili on being an out-standing role model for her peers and a representative for agriculture in Penn-sylvania. f 
YUCCA MOUNTAIN PROJECT (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, it is my understanding that my colleagues plan to speak in favor of Yucca Mountain tonight and once again attempt to re-vive the long-dead project that brings nuclear waste to my State of Nevada. They want to make Nevada’s Fourth Congressional District, my home, my district, the dumping ground for the rest of the country’s nuclear waste. The Nevada delegation has raised a number of concerns about this project, including its location, which sits less than 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas. Nevadans have strongly opposed the construction of this project. As a State with no nuclear energy fa-cilities, it is exceedingly unfair that Nevada is asked to serve as the dump-ing ground for the rest of the country’s waste. Rather than throw away millions more of taxpayer money to revive this shortsighted project, this funding could be better spent on infrastructure and job creation. I will continue fighting tirelessly to ensure the Yucca Mountain project stays dead, and I urge my colleagues to join me in finding better ways to deal with the nuclear waste created in their States.

THE RUSSIAN BEAR IS HUNGRY FOR MOLDOVA, GEORGIA, AND UKRAINE (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, after the fall of the Soviet Union, the Rus-sian bear started roaming Eastern Eu-rope with its hungry appetite to gobble and dominate politics and the Govern-ments of Moldova, Georgia, and Ukraine. Each nation has had a portion of its sovereign territory occupied by the Na-poleon of Siberia, Putin. His military is there, too. I have been in each nation and talked to the speakers of each of the par-liaments. Now the three countries are working together in a trilateral bond to thwart Russian interference and also improve their democratic proc-esses. For as it is written in Ecclesiastes: ‘‘A cord of three strands is not easily broken.’’ I also commend the Atlantic Council for their work with these nations in promoting democratic ideals, com-bating corruption, and increasing per-sonal freedom. The United States should encourage and support this trilateral union to prevent the hungry bear from eating up each nation and returning them to the old days of Russian oppression. And that is just the way it is. f 
PI KAPPA ALPHA’S 150TH ANNIVERSARY (Mr. SESSIONS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor tonight to recognize and honor my fraternity, Pi Kappa Alpha Inter-national Fraternity. I came from Alpha Omicron Chapter in Georgetown, Texas, Southwestern University. Pi Kappa Alpha is an international fraternity, a values-based men’s fra-ternal organization with more than 225 chapters across the United States and Canada, approximately 16,000 under-graduate members, and over 290,000 lifetime members. In 2018, Pi Kappa Alpha celebrates its 150th anniversary from its founding on March 1, 1868, at the University of Vir-ginia, when six young men joined to-gether and resolved to form a frater-nity for the establishment of friendship on a firmer and more lasting basis. Their commitment to the high ideals of scholarship, leadership, and gentle-manly behavior remains strong to this day, which is the reason why I not only pledged my support to the fraternity, but why I support them today.

So my question is this, Mr. Speaker: If it is good enough for a bill to be filed by the gentleman from California in 2013, and if it is good enough to talk about it on Russia Today, why is it not good enough to give President Trump the very same powers that he wanted to give to President Obama? That is my question. I am waiting for an answer.

HIMKUS ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the des-ignee of the majority leader. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by yielding to the chair-man of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, Mr. W
ALDEN . Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman of the Environ-ment Subcommittee, my friend, Mr. S
HIMKUS , who has worked tirelessly— not just this year, not just last year, but probably since the first year he came to Congress—to try and find a permanent solution to the storage of nuclear waste in America. He has been a tireless worker in this endeavor, a smart worker in this endeavor, and a successful, so far, worker in this en-deavor, as this bill passed out of the committee 49–4. I rise tonight to address this pressing national need, and that is the impor-tance of fixing our broken nuclear waste management program. It was more than 35 years ago that the United States Congress made a commitment to communities through-out our Nation which host spent nu-clear fuel and nuclear waste. Congress, the Federal Government, agreed to as-sign the Department of Energy with the responsibility to permanently dis-pose of hazardous material, nuclear waste, by 1998. There are many of those commu-nities, like in the Tri-Cities in Wash-ington State, co-located with the De-partment of Energy’s Hanford site just up Columbia River, across the river from where I live and the people I rep-resent. We have been DOE’s partner to help win World War II at that site. It has maintained a nuclear weapon de-terrent and powered our fleet of nu-clear submarines and aircraft carriers. Additionally, electricity consumers in many other communities have paid the Federal Government more than $40 billion to develop, license, construct, and operate a nuclear waste repository. They have already paid $40 billion to do this, and that was pursuant to the Nu-clear Waste Policy Act, the law that Congress enacted. Yet rate payers have little to see for their investment be-cause, I will call it political science, has deprived the public of the actual science to prove that nuclear waste can be safely and permanently disposed of. As a consequence of this political in-terference, taxpayers and rate payers across the country are on the hook for DOE’s inaction. The American people pay over $2 million every day to tempo-rarily store used fuel scattered throughout the United States. So it is up to us to fix this waste management program and stop this cost that will continue in perpetuity if we don’t act. Now, after hearing from dozens of ex-pert witnesses over many years, the Energy and Commerce Committee de-veloped and passed a bipartisan bill by a vote of 49–4. Mr. SHIMKUS led our ef-fort in this measure. This legislation makes targeted re-forms to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to set the Federal Government up to finally, finally, keep its promise. Nuclear waste challenges have vexed policymakers for generations. We, this Congress, have the chance now in a bipartisan way to successfully build a durable solution. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to achieve that goal, which brings about tonight’s Special Order. Now, Mr. Speaker, I just want to show something. This is a piece of glass. This is not actually nuclear waste. The Pacific Northwest National Lab, when I visited Hanford a little while back with Secretary Perry, gave me this because it is an example of what the liquid waste, the waste at Hanford, will end up being. b1930 It will look like this in a big cyl-inder. It is glass. This is what would go to Hanford, and it would be stored safe-ly when that occurs. If we don’t have a repository, these nuclear wastes, in their various forms, will sit around in various locations, not nearly as safe or secure as we can have with the kind of legislation fully enacted that Mr. S
HIMKUS has led on. So I thank Mr. S
HIMKUS for his leader-ship on this. And I thank my col-leagues on both sides of the aisle for their encouragement, their participa-tion, their counsel. We are going to get this thing done. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my chairman, the gentleman from Or-egon. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. F
LEISCHMANN ), who has actually been a pretty big leader in this issue because of Oak Ridge and the area that he rep-resents. Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to be before the House of Representatives this evening, and I want to thank Chairman S
HIMKUS . When I came to Congress in 2011, I didn’t know many people, and one night I had the privilege of meeting JOHNSHIMKUS from the great State of Illinois. I told him I was from Ten-nessee, and we started talking. And right away we talked about Yucca Mountain. We talked about nuclear waste, and I told him that I was going to be representing a very special place: Oak Ridge, Tennessee. So let me start by thanking Chair-man J
OHN SHIMKUS . He has been the hero for the Yucca Mountain project. He has worked tirelessly. He has seen this through the courts. He has seen it through the House. He has worked so hard. I thank him for his efforts. Oak Ridge, Tennessee, it is a beau-tiful place. I represent the Third Dis-trict of Tennessee: Oak Ridge, where we had the Manhattan Project, where we won World War II; Oak Ridge, where we won the Cold War; Oak Ridge, where we have worked tirelessly to build our Nation’s nuclear arsenal, and today we are still advocating to do that, to keep America strong—great men and women. But Oak Ridge, like many other places around the Nation—Savannah River, Portsmouth, Hanford—years ago, ladies and gentlemen, when we manufactured our nuclear weapons, we were not as safe and secure as we are today. There was an immediacy. There was a need during World War II to get the bomb built, and we did it in Oak Ridge, and it ended World War II. But for years thereafter, we were not as safe at many of these venues. What does that mean? That means that leg-acy wastes were left in communities: sometimes in the soil, sometimes in the water, sometimes in facilities. And what that means is that the Federal Government has a duty to these com-munities to clean this waste up. And this waste has to go somewhere. Now, Chairman S
HIMKUS , and we have heard from Chairman W
ALDEN — for those of you who are listening to-night, they are authorizers. They au-thorize the law. I sit on the Appropria-tions Committee. That is the com-mittee in Congress that authorizes the spending for this. I am the chairman of the Nuclear Cleanup Caucus. That is how pas-sionate I am about cleaning up nuclear waste not only in Oak Ridge, Ten-nessee; Savannah River; or Hanford, but all over these great United States, because we owe this to the American people. The Federal Government caused this problem; the Federal Government needs to clean this up. It is the ulti-mate, I think, in environmental advo-cacy. This is something that Repub-licans and Democrats, Members of the House and Members of the Senate, usu-ally agree upon; and we have worked together in this very important caucus. Why is it important that we pass the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017? Because, first of all, we owe it to the American people. The Depart-ment of Energy does a good job in cleanup, but this will revise their pro-grams. It will give what Congress

should do, give direction to a Federal agency. So, as we advocate for dollars to clean up the nuclear waste, we need this key authorization bill to give it structure, to give it purpose. So, in the end, Yucca is critically im-portant—critically important. And I know the people in these affected com-munities want Yucca Mountain. That is the interesting thing about it. They want it because they realize it is criti-cally important that we store the waste there: it is important for Amer-ica; it is important for our environ-ment; it is important to these commu-nities; and it is long overdue. So I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to please work to support H.R. 3053, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017, and I thank Chairman S
HIMKUS . Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Tennessee for his comments, and I yield to the gen-tleman from Minnesota (Mr. L
EWIS). Mr. LEWIS of Minnesota. Mr. Speak-er, I thank Chairman S
HIMKUS , as well, for continuing to bring light to the broken promise the Federal Govern-ment made to our communities. The State of Minnesota is home to three nuclear reactors, two of which are at the Prairie Island Nuclear Gen-erating Plant in my district. Located directly adjacent to the Prairie Island Indian Reservation and the city of Red Wing, the plant has stored spent nu-clear fuel on site since the 1970s. While this is done in a very safe and highly secure manner, storage in close prox-imity to large communities is simply not appropriate. In 1982, Congress agreed and made it clear that they wanted the Federal Government to oversee and manage the storage of spent fuel. Congress did not want to put the burden and oversight of maintaining safe nuclear storage on our local communities. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act was adopted, and the Federal Government was tasked with creating a national Federal repository for used fuel. The Federal Government began col-lecting taxes on all users of nuclear power. In the end, my constituents, businesses, and Americans throughout the country have paid roughly $40 bil-lion in taxes and interest. In 1995, due to the inaction at the Federal level, the plant in my district was forced to take matters into their own hands. While they continued to help fund a repository, they also in-vested in and began operating a dry cask storage area, a pad on site that could hold up to 48 casks of fuel. Now, that should have been more than enough to cover their needs until the Federal Government finished their job. Today, Prairie Island is home to 40 casks, with 7 more expected to be filled by 2020. Thirty-six years after the passage of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, we still have no repository. Prairie Island now has to go through the process of plan-ning to expand their dry cask facilities in order to accommodate fuel they paid the Federal Government to dispose of. So I strongly support the efforts of Chairman SHIMKUS , and that is why I cosponsored the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017. We owe it to our communities to follow through on our promise to provide a safe place for storage. Meanwhile, it isn’t just our local communities that are impacted by this inaction. When Congress passed a budg-et last year, I worked to point out that the Federal Government had assumed major liabilities associated with its failure to provide safe and environ-mentally friendly storage. The GAO re-cently reported that the Federal Gov-ernment’s environmental liability alone is nearly $450 billion and grow-ing. At the same time, the funds collected from taxpayers to open a repository have begun being diverted to other payout settlements and judgments based on our broken promise. By the end of fiscal year 2016, $6.1 billion had been paid out, with the Department of Energy estimating another $25 billion to follow. It is time to keep our promise. Our communities expect it, and the Federal Government cannot afford not to do so. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge passage of the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Minnesota and ap-preciate him spending this evening with us. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. W
EBER ). Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening in support of America’s nuclear energy in-dustry. Today, America leads the world in nuclear energy production and tech-nological advancement. However, the industry faces unique challenges that prevent us from reaching our full po-tential when it comes to nuclear en-ergy. So I thank Mr. S
HIMKUS for hosting this Special Order which gives us a chance to shed light on some of these issues. Over in the Science, Space, and Tech-nology Committee’s Energy Sub-committee, we talk a lot about nuclear energy R&D as critical for the United States’ national security and energy dominance. Through our numerous meetings over the course of several years, we have put forth multiple bills which will implement long-term R&D investments that will spur American competitiveness and keep us at the forefront of nuclear energy technology. We will need waste sites. My bill, the Nuclear Energy Innova-tion Capabilities Act, actually provides important policy direction for the De-partment of Energy Office of Nuclear Energy. First, it provides DOE with statutory directions to leverage its supercomputing infrastructure for modeling and simulation capabilities to develop advanced fission and fusion reactors. Second, this legislation pro-vides DOE with statutory direction to use its authority to enable the national labs to partner with the private sector to construct and operate reactor proto-types at DOE sites and to leverage ex-pertise from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Because nuclear reactors are so ex-pensive and so highly regulated, de-signing first-of-a-kind reactors re-quires a blend of creative freedom for engineers testing new designs but as-surance of safety throughout that proc-ess. DOE sites, particularly the DOE national laboratories, can provide a unique environment that safely allows for this kind of creative testing and de-velopment for advanced nuclear tech-nology. Finally, the bill lays out a clear timeline and statutory guidance for DOE to complete a research reactor that will allow for materials and fuels R&D to take place right here in the United States. Currently, this type of research, which requires access to fast neutrons, is only accessible for civilian use in Russia. While modeling and sim-ulation can accelerate R&D, this re-search must ultimately be validated through a physical source. The versatile neutron source in this bill will enable this vital research. Last month, my bill, which contains funding for this important research re-actor, the Nuclear Energy Research In-frastructure Act, passed this House unanimously. While we at the Science Committee have been working hard on developing the infrastructure for nu-clear research and development, I am thankful Mr. SHIMKUS is finding a long- term solution to our current challenges with spent nuclear waste. His bill takes an important step forward in author-izing private and interim storage of spent nuclear fuel, while still allowing the Federal Government to responsibly develop a permanent repository for spent nuclear fuel. I applaud Mr. S
HIMKUS and the En-ergy and Commerce Committee’s bipar-tisan effort to find a productive, con-structive answer to this pressing issue. Together, we will ensure that Amer-ica’s nuclear energy continues to lead the world. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Texas for his com-ments. Mr. Speaker, before I introduce the next speaker, I want to highlight that, in the days when people say we don’t work together, there is no bipartisan-ship shown, I just want to remind folks that this bill came out of our com-mittee 49–4. It has 108 cosponsors, many Democrats on there. So, with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. C
ARBAJAL ), a new Member of Congress who has been very active and whom I have been proud to get to know. Mr. CARBAJAL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman S
HIMKUS for yielding. Mr. Speaker, 2 years ago, Pacific Gas and Electric Company announced its

decision not to relicense the two nu-clear reactors at the Diablo Canyon Power Plant in San Luis Obispo Coun-ty. The plant has been a key economic engine in my district, employing around 1,500 people and powering more than 1.7 million homes in central and northern California. As our community works together to mitigate the economic impacts of this closure, I am committed to helping se-cure the central coast’s dominance as a hub for renewable energy development. That is why I am introducing legisla-tion later this month that creates re-newable energy incentives to offset the loss of jobs and revenue resulting from the Diablo Canyon closure. In addition to economic stability, our community also needs certainty of re-sponsible management and safe storage of nuclear waste after the plant’s clo-sure. The Diablo Canyon Power Plant was built against a seaside cliff near Avila Beach, where it was discovered that its reactors are in proximity to earthquake fault lines. Without a long- term solution, Diablo Canyon would become a de facto storage facility for radioactive nuclear waste and would hinder our ability to repurpose any of the scenic coastline where the power plant currently sits. Currently, spent nuclear fuel sits across 39 States in 121 communities, in-cluding San Luis Obispo County. b1945 We need a permanent geologic reposi-tory to store waste that will last far beyond our lifetimes. Congress must establish responsible interim storage solutions, while continuing to work to-wards establishing a safe and secure national repository for spent fuel. H.R. 3053 is a good bipartisan solu-tion to establish a process and outline next steps for interim and permanent storage solutions. With the impending decommissioning of Diablo Canyon, it is vital that we act to find a storage so-lution. I will continue to work to grow business in our area, remove spent fuel safely, and keep our communities safe and thriving as the Diablo Canyon de-commissioning moves forward. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague. So we have heard from Oregon, Ten-nessee, Minnesota, and then from Cali-fornia. Now I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. A
LLEN ). Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his work on this im-portant legislation. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3053, the Nu-clear Waste Policy Amendments Act. Spent nuclear fuel currently sits in 121 communities across 39 States, simply because we lack a permanent geologi-cal repository to dispose of the waste. That is why I am proud to join my col-leagues as a cosponsor of H.R. 3053, which would enact critical reforms to our nuclear waste management strat-egy. Back home, in Georgia’s 12th, we are leading the way in the expansion of our Nation’s nuclear energy resources. My district is the proud home of every nu-clear reactor in the State, with an ad-ditional two reactors under construc-tion at Plant Vogtle. Nuclear energy is Georgia’s most reliable power source and provides over 6,000 high-skilled jobs, many of which are filled by my constituents in Georgia’s 12th. But without a permanent solution, nuclear waste remains on those sites. Now is the time for Congress to act on fulfilling our obligation to dispose of the spent nuclear fuel sitting in our States. I thank the Energy and Com-merce Committee for passing this im-portant legislation, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his comments. I now yield to the gentleman from the State of California (Mr. MCNERNEY ), a mem-ber of the Energy and Commerce Com-mittee, a good friend, also. Mr. M
CNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. S
HIMKUS for yielding. We work together on nuclear waste. I have been to the Yucca Mountain site, and I have seen the work that has gone on there. But, first of all, I just want to say there are a lot of issues out there that we are dealing with here in Congress; so how important is nuclear waste? I mean, we have got the gun issue; we have climate change; we have the econ-omy; we want to create jobs; trade. I mean, there are a lot of issues; so how important is nuclear waste? I mean, it has been festering for decades—for dec-ades—so how urgent is it? You know, we haven’t had a major accident yet, but there are tens of thousands of tons of high-level nuclear waste sitting in relatively exposed con-ditions, so what could possibly go wrong? I mean, high-level nuclear waste is so radioactive that it emits heat. It emits an immense amount of heat. So we could—I will give you a couple of things that could go wrong. The waste could be commandeered and then made into weapons. It doesn’t have to be made into a nuclear fission bomb. It could be made into a dirty bomb. Just put a bunch of nuclear waste with explosive material in some city and that city would be uninhabit-able for the rest of our lifetimes, for sure. There also could be waste leakage. We have nuclear waste sitting on the banks of the Missouri River. We have nuclear waste, tons and tons of nuclear waste, high-level nuclear waste, sitting a quarter mile from the Columbia River, and this is pretty serious stuff. And my friend from Illinois, my col-league from Illinois, I am sure, will tell us about nuclear waste that is on the Great Lakes ready to go. So we have a problem. We have been pretty darn lucky so far. You know, I worked as a graduate student. I was a graduate student in mathematics. I worked for an engineer-ing professor to study the nuclear waste project at WIPP, a waste isola-tion pilot project near Carlsbad, New Mexico, and I can tell you the tech-nical solutions are there. Nuclear waste can be safely engineered for tens of thousands of years, as long as it needs to be stored. Transportation can be done safely. I have seen train cars that are designed to hold high-level nu-clear waste slammed into concrete walls with no damage to the interior of the car. This stuff can be done. It is not an engineering problem. I mean, the engi-neering and the geological solutions are there if we put our minds to mak-ing it happen. It can be done in engi-neering. However, nuclear waste is a political problem, and it hasn’t been managed so far. The politics of the Yucca Mountain waste project were very badly managed from the very beginning. A successful nuclear waste storage project will need complete transparency from the very beginning with the local community. There will always be some amount of opposition, but without local buy-in, the project is going to fail. Local buy- in is absolutely essential. This can be done if there is complete transparency, if the local people understand what the risks are and what the benefits are. This can be done. Mr. Speaker, we need to devote the resources to finding a permanent solu-tion to nuclear waste. Meanwhile, H.R. 3053, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amend-ments Act of 2017 is a step, a very im-portant step in the right direction. I want to thank my colleague from Illinois (Mr. S
HIMKUS ) who has worked on this tirelessly for year after year. I know that some people think that he has gone too far in Nevada, but, none-theless, if we work together and can become transparent, maybe Nevada will never accept nuclear waste, but we have to find a permanent storage solu-tion that can be done. This is a step in the right direction, and I urge my col-leagues to support H.R. 3053 and give this legislation fair and honest consid-eration. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for his com-ments, and I will pull up a chart later on to show that the five surrounding counties have all passed resolutions in support of Yucca Mountain, and there are recent numbers from the northern part of the State that show a very posi-tive movement as far as the accept-ance, as long as we show there is a science. And now I will address that in a later discourse. I want to thank my colleague for joining us. I now yield to the gen-tleman from the State of Georgia (Mr. C
ARTER ), another member from the En-ergy and Commerce Committee. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-er, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my good friend and chairman of the Subcommittee on Environment’s legis-lation, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH1360 March 5, 2018 
This legislation is important, not only because of what it means for the future of clean energy opportunities for this country, but also what this means for the safety of our communities. Nu-clear energy has become a safe and ef-fective way to generate large amounts of energy capability, while maintain-ing a source that doesn’t produce greenhouse gas emissions. We have come a long ways from Three Mile Island and the safety stand-ards in place to ensure our commu-nities and our grid aren’t negatively impacted by nuclear energy. The Nu-clear Waste Policy Amendments Act would finally put in place a permanent repository for the waste generated by energy production that powers millions of homes and businesses across the United States. As of December, there were 61 nu-clear power plants in the United States with 99 operating nuclear reactors. Those nuclear plants provide nearly 20 percent of the country’s energy produc-tion capability. This is significant be-cause these plants have continued to provide reliable flows of energy for dec-ades, giving Americans a carbon-free source of energy to fuel their consump-tion. But one thing hasn’t been addressed: what to do with that spent fuel. We began a process in the 1980s to seek and construct a permanent repository for the Nation’s spent fuel, eventually coming to Yucca Mountain in Nevada. This site was decided upon, due to its geological features, and extensively studied to ensure it could be done in a safe and effective manner. Millions of dollars were spent study-ing and doing initial project develop-ment of the site, but it was eventually halted, and that progress was stalled. While this was going on, ratepayers in 39 States continued to pay towards the cleanup fund for a total of nearly $40 billion. However, that money hasn’t been able to be put towards a perma-nent repository due to resistance. In Georgia, at Plant Vogtle, we are currently undergoing the only nuclear energy construction project in the country, in large part because of issues that have deterred companies from wanting to expand. That means that people are losing out on energy produc-tion, and it actually creates clean en-ergy. My good friend’s legislation author-izes the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste to find a safe, permanent place in con-trast to the temporary locations at each nuclear plant. It also authorizes a consolidated interim storage site to en-sure there is an option available for the eventual transition. This is something that needs to get done, and soon. Right now, spent fuel is sitting on site in either dry casks or spent fuel pools without an alternative. Now is the time for us to pass this bi-partisan legislation and recognize that we have carbon-neutral energy sources in place, and have for decades, but we need to get this across the finish line to support our communities and our country. I urge my colleagues to support the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act because it will give the United States the chance to, once again, be a global leader on our nuclear energy and to se-cure our communities. I thank the gen-tleman for his leadership on this issue. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Georgia for his com-ments, and now I yield to the gen-tleman from Connecticut (Mr. C
OURT -
NEY) for his strong work, his positive statements, and his reaching out so that we could have a national solution to a national problem. Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. S
HIMKUS for yielding. Again, I am here tonight to join a bunch of my colleagues to speak in strong support of H.R. 3053, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017, which Mr. S
HIMKUS has skillfully guided through the Energy and Commerce Committee, again, a 49–4 vote on a committee which basically is challenged, in many instances, with other issues from healthcare and energy policy, you name it. It is really just an amazing accom-plishment on his part dealing with one of the thorniest, toughest issues, which, again, has been out there for 30 years, which is, again, how we, as a na-tion, deal with the tons of nuclear waste that is now piled up and accumu-lating in over 100 communities around the country. Again, I represent the Second Dis-trict of Connecticut, the eastern half of the State, which has two operating nu-clear facilities. One has been decom-missioned, the old Connecticut Yankee facility, which sits very close to the Connecticut River. Again, it has been closed for over a decade. The plant itself has been cut up, dismantled. It is now pretty much, you know, just over-grown with vegetation. But still sitting there is dry cask nuclear spent fuel rods, which, again, are being patrolled every single day, literally, as we are here tonight, by heavily armed guards, which makes perfect sense, because, as has been said by other speakers, again, this is still very dangerous material, and again, very close to one of the larg-est bodies of waters in new England, the Connecticut River. We also have the Dominion nuclear power plant in Waterford, Connecticut, which today is in full operation. Over 45 percent of the energy consumed in the State of Connecticut is generated at Dominion. It is about 15 percent of New England, because, again, it pro-vides a supply for the rest of the region that is there, and again, this is a plant that goes back decades. We are also the home of the Groton sub base, which is a base where, again, we have 15 attack subs that are de-ployed there. Again, the Groton sub base was where the USS Nautilus was launched 62 years ago. Admiral Rick-over, the father of the nuclear Navy, actually designed that first sub, which was christened by Mamie Eisenhower. Again, that sub was built 5 years after the first lightbulb was powered by nuclear power as a nation; again, a pretty amazing accomplishment that Admiral Rickover was able to build and launch a nuclear submarine, something which the folks at the Navy at the time told him wouldn’t happen for 75 years. Yet, today, the nuclear force, both in terms of submarines and car-riers, are the backbone, again, of our away team, the U.S. Navy. So, again, we have a lot of history and experience with the fact that we have got really smart capable people who do amazing things in terms of pro-viding the energy needs but also the national security of this country. But, as has been said, again, a byproduct of that is that nuclear waste which we thought 30 years ago was going to be dealt with with the decision that Con-gress made to dispose of nuclear waste in a central facility in Nevada that, again, ratepayers have paid year in and year out, $40 billion, as was mentioned earlier, but today is still immobilized. So, again, Mr. S
HIMKUS ’ effort, in terms of trying to not just restart the process but also to reform it, again, is such an extraordinary effort that real-ly we, as a House, should really take advantage of and move on a bipartisan basis to enact. b2000 This is not your father’s Yucca Mountain bill that Mr. S
HIMKUS got through. It made some changes for fair-ness in terms of ratepayers. It also cre-ated more transparency so that local stakeholders in Nevada will have an opportunity to really help make deci-sions and see and understand the tech-nology that is being employed there. It also set up an interim process, which, again, if it is over decades, which it is still going to take, that we can at least start moving material out from these over 100 sites situated all across the country, which is so impor-tant in terms of reducing costs and re-ducing national security risk. His proposal, I think, deserves great support and, frankly, congratulations that he has been able to take this on. I would note that the country of Fin-land has actually started to move for-ward with their own waste disposal site, the Onkalo Peninsula Depository, which a country that is very progres-sive in terms of a lot of its policies, but that have shown that the technology is there to safely deposit nuclear waste in a way that has real confidence and is moving forward. We should do it, too. Again, H.R. 3053 is, I think, the road-map for this country to deal with this problem in a way that is safe, is trans-parent, and will reduce costs for rate-payers all across the country. I look forward to seeing a vote take place very soon on the floor of the House. And then, frankly, I look for-ward to a bill signing ceremony at the White House, where Mr. S

should certainly take a front row seat for his great work. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his remarks. I am glad he brought up the debate and the discussion on the nuclear Navy, be-cause that is really a key part of this debate. The nuclear-use fuel for our nuclear fleet is, by law, directed to be housed at Yucca Mountain. Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, may I just make one last point to really un-derscore that? Mr. Speaker, I am on the Armed Services Committee, and we are in the midst of moving forward with a 355- ship Navy. If you look at the force architecture that is going to be in that growth, it is almost all concentrated in submarines and carriers. The fact of the matter is that the challenge of waste disposal for our national defense and national secu-rity is going to be with us for many, many years. To comment again, the gentleman’s proposal is a way for us to deal with that and strengthen our Navy and our national defense. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. D
UNCAN ), a colleague, a new member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, but no stranger to this issue and this debate. Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for holding this Special Order hour to talk about a very critical policy and issue for our country. Mr. Speaker, nuclear energy is a crit-ical component of the United States’ energy matrix. It is no secret that I am passionate about energy independence and nuclear energy as an essential, emission-free, domestic source of elec-tricity. As we create nuclear energy, we also create nuclear waste. In my district, the Oconee Nuclear Station run by Duke Energy in Oconee County, South Carolina, has 40 years’ worth of nuclear waste sitting at the site. Without a permanent geological repository, nu-clear waste will continue to pile up at reactors in South Carolina and all across the Nation. There is currently estimated to be about 4,500 tons of spent nuclear fuel in temporary storage in South Carolina from commercial reactors. Furthermore, there are more than 10,000 tons of military and research nu-clear waste at the Savannah River site, just outside my district. Nuclear waste sits idle and is stored in dry casts and wet pools in 121 com-munities across 39 States. It is impera-tive that we pass Chairman S
HIMKUS ’ legislation, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act, to reform our coun-try’s nuclear waste policy and utilize Yucca Mountain as our main point of nuclear storage. Having nuclear waste dispersed across the country and close to highly populated areas makes zero sense, and is an unnecessary and avoidable risk. The depository at Yucca Mountain, after decades of research, has been independently verified to safely dispose of spent nuclear fuel for a million years. It is the law of the land. It is a perfect site for this. We as a country need to embrace the law of the land. It is a long-term stable storage facility at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. After all the scientific re-search and money taken from rate-payers, it is time to move forward. It is sad that this project has been mothballed because of politics and has been used as a political football at the expense of the American ratepayers. What do I mean by American rate-payers paying for this? U.S. ratepayers have already paid the Federal Government over $40 billion to develop Yucca Mountain, and currently all U.S. taxpayers are paying over $2 million a day because we have not yet fulfilled our legal obligations. Rate-payers are quite literally paying some-thing for nothing. Ratepayers in my State of South Carolina have already paid $1.3 billion in fees, which were intended to pay for a functioning Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository. Ratepayers in other States which utilize nuclear commer-cial energy have paid billions more. It is time to put politics aside. Au-thorize what Congress has already ap-proved and paid for by Americans. Yucca Mountain should not have taken this long to become a reality; not after colossal amounts of money have been poured into this infrastructure project. Members on both sides of the aisle, as you see tonight, are supportive of au-thorizing the use of Yucca Mountain through the Nuclear Waste Policy Act Amendments. It voted out of the House Energy and Commerce Committee by a vote of 49–4. Let’s not let the politics of a few get in the way of reforming our nuclear waste policy and ensuring Americans get what they have already paid billions into. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership, and I look forward to working with him to move this for-ward. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his remarks. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tleman from Illinois has 20 minutes re-maining. GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their re-marks and to include extraneous mate-rial on the topic of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Illinois? There was no objection. Mr. SHIMKUS. I do that, Mr. Speak-er, because we have had Members from Oregon—I am from Illinois—Tennessee, Minnesota, California, Georgia, South Carolina, Texas, Connecticut come down. Many, many Members from all over this country also wanted to join me here tonight, but they could not, so they will be submitting statements for the RECORD . I appreciate the Chair al-lowing us to us do that. Mr. Speaker, I also want to highlight a few things and just follow up on some of my colleagues, who I really appre-ciate coming down and spending their time to talk about the importance of this issue. This issue has national support, I think identified by the 49–4 vote out of the Energy and Commerce Committee. People are very diverse, from all over the country, on the Energy and Com-merce Committee. I would encourage people to go to the Energy and Com-merce Committee website and look at the members of that committee and how wide and how diverse we are. We are all united on this issue. The national newsmakers and the re-corders of what is going on are starting to take interest in solving this prob-lem. We have a couple editorials and statements from some major papers and some smaller ones. Here is The Washington Post: ‘‘Put Yucca Mountain to work. The Nation needs it.’’ As was stated, the law was passed in 1982 and it was amended in 1987. Con-gressman D
UNCAN said it right. This is the law of the land. For the last 8 to 10 years, we have been breaking the law by not moving forward. People have heard me say that numerous times be-fore. Here is The San Diego Union-Trib-une: ‘‘Revival of Yucca Mountain nu-clear waste project overdue.’’ Well, it is 20 years. We should have been receiving spent nuclear fuel and defense waste 20 years ago. Now we are paying judgments because of our in-ability to comply with the law. Wouldn’t you like the government to do what it says it wants to do and then is planning to do it? And then shouldn’t they do it? Here is Aiken Standard: ‘‘Fed should proceed with Yucca Mountain.’’ Here is the Reason: ‘‘Open the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository.’’ Here is the Los Angeles Times and their statement on this issue: ‘‘The Federal Government needs to renew its efforts to bring the Yucca Mountain site into operation.’’ There is a lot of support in California because they are closing nuclear power plants and they have spent nuclear fuel on the beach, as Congressman C
ARBAJAL has said. He is talking about San Luis Obispo. I think I will show a chart later on that shows San Onofre Nuclear Gener-ating Station, or SONGS, which is being decommissioned. Here is the Chicago Tribune, from my State: ‘‘Yucca Mountain is the only viable alternative to the jury-rigged status quo. We hope the Trump admin-istration and Congress will revive it be-cause if they don’t’’—well, you can read it, right?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH1362 March 5, 2018 
So let me give you an example. It was mentioned by one of my col-leagues, and I will talk about Illinois for a little bit. Zion Nuclear Power Station is decommissioned. On the shore of Lake Michigan is spent nu-clear fuel. Part of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act Amendments of 2017 does a couple things. It makes sure the authorization language is in place so that we start moving forward on a final repository. We have listened to my colleagues from around the country to say it is not going to move fast enough, even if you start it. Can’t we find some regional tem-porary locations. Now, in the nuclear timeframe, ‘‘temporary’’ is about 40 years. That is temporary when you are talking about nuclear stuff. So we want to be able to consolidate. What this shows is licensed and oper-ating nuclear spent fuel storage instal-lations. These are just locations where you have nuclear power. And you can see the red dots all over the place, and other nuclear registered locations. I am not talking about the other issue, which is defense locations. That is why I am glad my colleague J
OE C
OURTNEY came down to talk about Connecticut and the nuclear Navy. A colleague that really wanted to be down here was D
ANNEWHOUSE , who represents Hanford. Hanford is the epitome story of why we need to get our act together as a nation and fulfill our obligations to clean up these sites. This is a defense site. We created waste in the production of our nuclear arsenal. Decades, stored in tanks, toxic sludge underneath the ground that needs to be glassified, as Chairman W
ALDEN mentioned. And where that glassified toxic sludge is supposed to go is underneath the mountain in a desert in Yucca Mountain. So these are the different locations we have here across the country. As was stated tonight already, 39 States, 121 locations. Thirty-nine States, 121 locations. So let me give you a few examples of what we are talking about. My colleague J
ASON LEWIS was down here earlier, and he mentioned Prairie Island. These are old charts, but they are oldies but goodies because we haven’t done anything. I can go into the dustbin of history when I talk about this on the floor, and the only thing that has changed is there is more spent nuclear fuel on these sites. So you have Prairie Island. You have waste stored aboveground in pools and in casts. You have, in the Mississippi floodplain, on the Mississippi River, 50 miles from Minneapolis-St. Paul versus Yucca Mountain. Now, what do we have at Yucca Mountain? Now, Yucca Mountain is where, by law, we are supposed to be receiving long-term repository. I refer people, there is no nuclear waste on site. Here is the mountain in a desert. The waste will be stored 1,000 feet underground and 1,000 feet above the water table. b2015 The Colorado River is the closest body of water 100 miles away. So that is the example. That is what we want to show to the American people. Would you rather have nuclear waste or defense waste next to your major cities and by major bodies of water, or would you rather have them in a desert underneath a mountain? I had a few Californians down here tonight. Why? Because they are decom-missioning nuclear power plants. This is the one I visited just maybe 14 months ago. It is no longer an oper-ating nuclear power station. They are decommissioning it. The waste will be stored onsite. It is the San Onofre Nu-clear Generating Station. It is between L.A. and San Diego right on the Pacific Ocean. At this time, there are 2,300 waste rods onsite. That has probably increased by a number I don’t know. Waste is stored aboveground. It is adja-cent to the Pacific Ocean, and it is lo-cated 45 miles from San Diego, versus Yucca Mountain which is located here, which is a mountain in a desert. The waste would be 1,000 feet underground, and that is 1,000 feet above the water table. So I have listened to my colleagues from Nevada. In fact, in this picture, this green area, these are all the coun-ties around the Federal land site that have passed resolutions in support of moving forward. Now, what do the Nevadans tell me? They want to make sure it is safe. How do you make it safe? You decide to ad-judicate the science. We give Nevada, as per law, their last chance to ques-tion the science. That is what we are trying to do in the appropriation proc-ess is get the money to do the final ad-judication so that the question can be answered. To my friends from the State of Nevada: Is a mountain in a desert a safe place to store the defense waste and spent fuel? Now, the red part is Federal land. Yucca Mountain would be about right here, a little pinhole. That yellow there is—when you hear people say local consensus, the yellow here is a local consensus from Sweden, and if you notice, it is smaller than the Fed-eral land that we have. So I would argue the local consensus is the Fed-eral Government since it is all that property. Now, why do we have all that property? Because Yucca Flat is there. Because we put nuclear fuel—nuclear waste, in some short and some shade, is already housed there. So, again, it is a great location. I was given a pin tonight from Nye County, and it says, ‘‘Host of Yucca Mountain.’’ So with all due respect to my colleagues from the State of Ne-vada, when they say that everyone is against it, they are not talking to ev-eryone in the State of Nevada. I have been to Las Vegas, I have been to Reno, and I have been to Pahrump, and there are people that—if proven safe. So I would ask the Governor, allow us to have the litigation to fight the science. That is what he wants to prove, that is what we want to prove, and that is what we need to appro-priate the money, get the final adju-dication, and then I am convinced that our nuclear scientists, the studies, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that issued a safety and evaluation re-port will come out and say: You are not going to find a safer place on this planet; there is no more of a studied lo-cation on the planet than Yucca Moun-tain. So, again, I want to thank my col-leagues for coming down to do a couple things. First of all, we want to high-light to our leadership in this House and our appropriators that we need to get money into the final omnibus to do the adjudication to fight for the science, and we have to do that now— issue one. Issue two, there is a bipartisan con-sensus, as proven by the 49–4 vote in the committee and by 108 cosponsors, and when we get the bill on the floor, a passage of a bill that we probably would project to get 300 votes out of 435. So the nuclear era started in World War II. It was started to beat Hitler to make sure they didn’t win World War II. Then we had the arms race with the Soviet Union. It has helped protect our freedom and liberty. There was a price to pay, environmental degradations across this country. We owe it to these communities and to ourselves to safely gather, store, and protect the environ-ment and protect our citizens. We do that through the appropriation proc-ess. We do it by passing the Nuclear Waste Policy Act amendments of 2007. Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank my friends from both sides of the aisle for coming down this night. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speak-er, in 2002, after extensive research by the Department of Energy (DOE), scientists con-cluded that Yucca Mountain met all the re-quirements to act as a repository for high level radioactive waste. After which, the DOE ap-plied for the license from the Nuclear Regu-latory Commission to begin construction of the Yucca Mountain facility. Unfortunately, due to political brinksmanship, those plans have stalled indefi-nitely, despite the fact that ratepayers have contributed nearly $30 Billion to the nuclear waste fund, which is specifically designated to be used for Yucca Mountain. The federal government and taxpayers have dedicated enormous resources to completing the nuclear storage facility at Yucca Mountain. However, the Obama Administration did every-thing in its power to stall the completion of the facility, holding up construction under political red tape—even though the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s own safety evaluation found it would not be a threat to the local population of Nevada as it would benefit all of America. Thankfully, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2017 will finally remove

unnecessary burdens to make much needed improvements to our national nuclear waste strategy. This legislation is especially important to the residents of South Carolina. South Carolina ratepayers have invested over $1.3 billion into Yucca over the last 30 years—that’s in addi-tion to the billions of dollars collected from ratepayers across the country. During this time, states like South Carolina have remained de facto repositories for nuclear waste. The federal government should finish what they started and complete the Yucca Mountain li-cense application. Currently, SNF is stored in 121 different neighborhoods, across 39 states—all waiting to be moved to a permanent location. The Nu-clear Waste Policy Amendments Act will ad-dress the concerns of communities across the country, in a cost-effective manner, and passed the Energy and Commerce Committee with bi-partisan support, 49 members voting in favor and only 4 against. I am grateful for the opportunity to support this legislation, and am hopeful that it will provide much needed clari-fication on the disposal of spent nuclear fuel. I am grateful that text from my bill, the Sen-sible Nuclear Waste Disposition Act was in-cluded in this bill and thank Chairman J
OHN S
HIMKUS for his leadership.

SEPARATE AND UNEQUAL: RACISM AND POVERTY 50 YEARS AFTER THE KERNER REPORT The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-uary 3, 2017, the gentleman from Penn-sylvania (Mr. E
VANS ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the mi-nority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-imous consent that all Members may have 5 days legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the subject of the Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, it is a great honor that I rise today to anchor the CBC Special Order. I would like to thank the CBC chairman, Chairman R
ICHMOND , for his leadership in this ef-fort. For the next 60 minutes, we have an opportunity to speak directly to the American people about issues of great importance to the Congressional Black Caucus and the millions of constitu-ents we represent. Tonight, Mr. Speaker, I want to speak about a topic that has affected this country and plagued us all. Over 50 years ago, in the middle of the Detroit riot, President Lyndon B. Johnson es-tablished the National Advisory Com-mission on Civil Disorders, commonly known as the Kerner Commission. The goal of that Commission was to iden-tify the underlying causes of the civil unrest in communities across the coun-try. This was a time of tremendous ten-sion in our great Nation. Many Ameri-cans were confused about the root causes of the riots and the unsure path forward. On February 29, 1968, following sev-eral field trips to troubled commu-nities, the Commission released the Kerner Report, a 176-page report that examined cultural institutional rac-ism, from segregated schools and hous-ing discrimination to generational pov-erty and to limited economic oppor-tunity. The Commission largely held racism responsible for Black rioting and warned that our Nation is moving to two societies, one Black, one White— separate and unequal. The Commission called for bold policies to counter dec-ades of political failure, such as invest-ment in much-needed social services, housing, and education programs; and incentivizing diversity among law en-forcement. Sadly, President Johnson ignored the Kerner Report and rejected its rec-ommendations. In the midst of that, we had the assassinations of several prominent Americans: President John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, and Dr. Martin Luther King. Fifty years later, America has made some improvements, but African Amer-icans continue to face some of the same issues discussed in the Kerner Re-port. Since its release, Black American homeownership has been flat, and un-employment is still twice that of White Americans. The Black prison popu-lation has tripled here in America. It used to be two other countries, South Africa during the apartheid years and the former Soviet Union, had more peo-ple in prison. Now the United States has more people in prison than any na-tion in the world. Black household wealth is less than one-fifth of the national average, and almost 33 percent of Black children are growing up in poverty. Recently, Fred Harris, the last living member of the Kerner Commission, issued a new report highlighting the persistent issues plaguing the Black community and calling on major in-vestments in education, workforce de-velopment, and a living wage. This comes in stark contrast to the severe cuts proposed by President Trump in the fiscal year 2019 budget. Today, in fact, I attended a meeting for the CEO Council for Growth at Drexel University. The council’s mis-sion is to lead our region forward by convening decisionmakers, taking ac-tion, and doing the things necessary to strengthen our regional economy. With poverty at 26 percent in my dis-trict, I am committed to working with the CEOs present at today’s meeting and others who are using creativity and innovation to help reduce poverty, combat hunger, and spur economic growth. I also attended a discussion at Tem-ple University in Philadelphia. Al-though the recently passed budget was by no means perfect, I firmly believe that our leadership and our actions matter. So it was great to hear firsthand from professors at Temple University today about how the recent jolt in NIH funding will allow them to keep their research on the rise. If we want to con-tinue moving the needle on poverty re-duction, we must make it our priority to invest in all of our neighborhoods. We are in the business of doing no harm. As elected officials, we are here to help move our neighborhoods for-ward, not backward, and we must con-tinue to urgently press for common-sense economic solutions for Ameri-cans most in need. I stand before you today to tell you just as I have always done before, we must continue to make ideas matter. We must push for commonsense solu-tions to help move us past the condi-tions that led to the Kerner Report. Mr. Speaker, I have my colleague from California (Ms. LEE) here, who is someone whom I have watched and ob-served. As a matter of fact, she is the chair leading the effort from the Demo-cratic perspective on attacking this issue of poverty. She has been in the forefront of this particular issue, and her voice is heard throughout this en-tire Nation, the Honorable B
ARBARA  L
EEfrom the 13th District. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-woman from California (Ms. L
EE). Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank Congressman D
WIGHT EVANS for, once again, hosting this very impor-tant Special Order and for really con-tinuing this fight for racial and eco-nomic justice both here in the House of Representatives but also in his con-gressional district. So I thank the gen-tleman very much for his tremendous leadership. Fifty years ago at the height of the civil rights movement, violence erupt-ed in cities across America. Over gen-erations, systemic racism had produced what Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., called a tale of two cities. One city was bright and full of opportunity for a se-lect few, and another city was shrouded in darkness and locked in a never-end-ing cycle of poverty. African Americans, suffocating under the pressure of institutional racism and discrimination, took to the streets. After race riots erupted in Watts and Chicago; Newark, New Jersey; and De-troit, our government took notice. President Johnson convened the Kerner Commission, which Congress-man E
VANS laid out, which had three goals to investigate the root cause of the unrest. Many activists and civil rights lead-ers were concerned that the Commis-sion wouldn’t reveal the true facts. But to our surprise—and I remember this very clearly—the report was brutally honest. According to the report, White rac-ism was responsible for the rising ten-sions and explosive violence ripping our Nation apart. So that should have been a wake-up call.

b2030 Racism had created two societies: one Black, one White, separate and un-equal. The report identified the prob-lem and proposed a series of targeted solutions that could right this terrible wrong. According to the report, there were three options for our government: One, do nothing, which would result in more riots and economic devastation and racial division in our country; Two, we could make robust invest-ments into African-American neighbor-hoods and schools; Three, take racism and discrimina-tion head-on, removing discriminatory barriers that lock African Americans into poverty and prevent them from ac-cessing the basics and a basic standard of living. Option three, of course, could have drastically changed the lives of mil-lions of African Americans. Sadly, the Kerner Commission’s report was large-ly ignored. Again, Congressman E
VANS  laid that out. Instead of investing in education, employment opportunities, livable wages, raising incomes, and pathways out of poverty, this country, unfortu-nately, has allowed institutional rac-ism to divide this Nation. Of course, we have made some progress, but this up-dated report clearly shows that is not nearly enough. We really are still a di-vided country. As a result, the findings of the 1968 Kerner Commission’s report remain constant to this very day. In 1968, almost half of all students of color, primarily African Americans, went to majority-White schools. Today, that number has plummeted to 20 percent. In 1968, the unemployment rate for African Americans was 6.7 percent. Today, 7.5 percent of African Ameri-cans are unemployed. In 1968, African Americans were 5.4 times as likely as Whites to be in pris-on or in jail. Today, African Americans are 6.4 times as likely as Whites to be incarcerated. Five decades have passed and eco-nomic inequality still prevents the Af-rican-American community from ac-cessing the American Dream. I represent the 13th Congressional District of California, which includes Alameda County. While some are wit-nessing and experiencing enormous wealth and economic growth in my dis-trict, 43 percent of African-American children in Oakland are living in pov-erty, 23.6 percent of African Americans in my district are locked in poverty, and the average income for African- American families in the San Fran-cisco Bay Area is $46,571 a year, com-pared to White families, who make more than $109,000. That is in my dis-trict in the San Francisco Bay Area. This gap is one of the hugest gaps in the country. It is a total disgrace. We should be leveling the economic playing field for African Americans across the Nation. Instead, we throw Black workers meager wages and apply trickle-down economics that only ben-efit the rich. Our Federal Government should pro-vide the impetus, incentive, and invest-ment for good-paying jobs for African- American workers. Instead, this ad-ministration is attacking unions and produced a budget that guts job train-ing programs and a tax law that makes it easier to ship jobs overseas. We should be investing in affordable housing, which, yes, is a basic human right for everyone, including the Afri-can-American community. Instead, this administration is weakening fair housing laws and rationing off afford-able housing funding. The majority of this administration’s proposed budget—the cuts, especially— will disproportionately negatively im-pact African Americans and people of color. This really is a twisted and sick reality that shouldn’t be possible in the United States of America. But members of the Congressional Black Caucus are here tonight to say that we continue to be determined to change this reality because, yes, Black lives do matter. We are here to tell the truth about what is dividing America: racism. It is manifest in many forms in our policy, in our budget, in our fund-ing priorities, and in many, many ways. In January, a group of nearly 100 reli-gious leaders came together to issue a unity declaration on racism and pov-erty. Mr. Speaker, I include in the record a letter, a document, entitled, ‘‘Unity Declaration on Racism and Poverty,’’ and a document entitled, ‘‘Circle of Protection.’’ 
UNITY DECLARATION ON RACISM AND POVERTY  As leaders from diverse families of U.S. Christianity, we are called by the Spirit to work together with new urgency against the resurgence of racism and the persistence of poverty in America. We see around us an in-crease of harmful attitudes and policies to-ward people of color and people in need. That painful reality and the current push for tril-lions of dollars in cuts to anti-poverty pro-grams are bringing us together in a new way. While we have different positions on other questions, we are united on the gospel and biblical teaching on poverty and racism— feeling invited to do so by the grace of God in Jesus Christ. 
WE BELIEVE THAT RACISM AND POVERTY ARE  
THEOLOGICAL ISSUES  The integral relationship between poverty and racism unifies us against both. They are both issues to which the gospel of Jesus Christ speaks—which also calls us to love our neighbors, without exceptions. Our unity on these issues is because they are theo-logical issues for us, not merely political or partisan ones. These fundamentally biblical concerns challenge all of us and both of the major political parties. Racism is a sin that goes back to the founding of our nation. At its root, racism is in conflict with the opening declaration in Genesis 1, that we are all made in the image and likeness of God. Racism literally throws away the biblical principle of imago dei—the image of God in all of us, with no exceptions. Racism is a sin against God and all of God’s children. Therefore, the whole counsel of God calls us to preach against the sin of racism from all of our churches’ pulpits and call for repentance. The body of Christ is perhaps the most di-verse racial community in the world. When people of color in the body of Christ suffer— while many white members of the body of Christ do not acknowledge their pain—we are violating the principle laid down in 1 Co-rinthians 12: that we are one body with many parts, who suffer with and honor one an-other. As Galatians instructs us, ‘‘there is no more Jew or Greek, bond or free, male or fe-male, because we are all united as one in Christ’’ (3:28). The historical sin of racism lingers on in America today, continuing and evolving in our social systems of economics and edu-cation, policing and criminal justice, hous-ing and gentrification, voting rights and sup-pression, in our racial geography, and, pain-fully, in the continued segregation of our churches, which adds to our own complicity. Racism is more than individual behavior, language, and overt hostility toward par-ticular people. Racism is systematic and structural in America and harms people of color in very specific, measurable, and tan-gible ways. The failure to defend the lives and dignity of people living in poverty, by individuals or governments, is also a sin against God, with 2,000 verses in the Bible clearly outlining God’s fundamental concern for people who are poor, vulnerable, and oppressed, instruct-ing the people of God to protect and help them and holding political leaders respon-sible for them. Jesus says, in Matthew 25, that how we treat the ‘‘least of these’’ is how we treat Christ himself. The world and our country have made progress against poverty in recent decades. It is possible to make further progress—per-haps virtually end—hunger and extreme pov-erty in our time. We see the alleviation of material misery as an experience of God’s loving presence in our own time, and believe that God wants us to seize this opportunity. TO OUR CHURCHES : WHAT WE ARE DOING AND  
CAN DO  Most of our churches are active in helping people in need, struggling people within their congregations or in their communities. We need to do more, but many of our church-es directly help millions of people every day. Local church leaders often work to bridge the racial divides in our communities, and many are searching for authentic and spe-cific ways to address the rise of white su-premacy. Since the God of the Bible requires social justice and charity, our churches and many of our members also work to influence public policies. Christians have a wide array of po-litical viewpoints. But a majority of the leaders of national church bodies have spo-ken out repeatedly against cuts to programs that provide help and opportunity to hungry and poor people in our country and around the world. We have also spoken out against renewed expressions of white racism, ethnic nationalism, and hateful attitudes toward people of color, immigrants, refugees, Jews, and Muslims. Many of us are active in sup-port of immigration reform, criminal justice reform, and voting rights for all. We are deeply troubled by the budget pro-posals coming from Congress and the presi-dent. They outline more than $2 trillion of cuts in programs for hungry and poor people in our country and around the world. These cuts would hurt struggling people of all races, including millions of low- and middle- income people who need safety-net programs at some time in their lives. The hardest hit would be African American, Latino, and Na-tive American communities, where the pov-erty rate is already high, and among people in the poorest countries in the world. The threat over the coming year of this broad assault on anti-poverty programs that

support families struggling to make ends meet is unifying us—bringing us together in a more vigorous, multiracial Christian movement to maintain a circle of protection around all people in poverty and God’s chil-dren of color in particular, who are disproportionally impacted. 
TO CONGRESS AND THE WHITE HOUSE : OUR 
UNITED APPEAL FOR HEALING AND REFORM IN  
OUR NATION ’S POLITICS  We appeal to the president and Congress to work together for the common good. We es-pecially call upon political leaders who are also people of faith to protect all the people in our country and world who are struggling with economic deprivation and frustration, hunger and poverty, disability and disadvan-tage—and racial bigotry that often contrib-utes to inaction and hard-heartedness. God’s love for all people moves us to reach out to people and leaders all across the polit-ical spectrum. We respect and pray for all those who are in authority—that our nation and world ‘‘may lead a quiet and peaceable life’’ (1 Timothy 2:1–2). Conservative and lib-eral people, and those with differing political philosophies, may disagree on how to live up to our nation’s ideals, but our loving God calls all of us to work together for liberty and justice for everyone. We appeal to all people, especially Chris-tians, to actively work against racism and poverty—in their personal and local engage-ment and as advocates for public policies that foster racial equity and healing, shared prosperity, and peace in our country and worldwide. The spiritual power of a fresh, en-ergetic, multiracial Christian movement against both racism and poverty is our pray-er. So help us God.

EARMEMBERS OF CONGRESS : As the presi-dent and Congress are preparing their plans for this year, almost 100 church leaders— from all the families of U.S. Christianity— are sharing a common ‘‘Unity Statement’’ on racism and poverty. As Christians, we are grounded in God’s love for all people, and we feel called to ask our churches and political leaders of both parties to work together to overcome racism and poverty which are theological, biblical, and gospel issues for us, not merely political or partisan ones. This moment in time and the clear move-ment of the Spirit have brought diverse multi-racial church leaders together over the last several months for dinner conversa-tions and times of prayer. Out of those mov-ing times together, we developed a Unity Statement on Racism and Poverty. It has at-tracted many more racially and theo-logically diverse church leaders and is now

embraced by the Circle of Protection, the broadest group of Christian leaders focused on poverty. The leaders who have signed this statement are from African-American, His-panic, Asian-American, Native American, Evangelical, Catholic, Pentecostal, and mainline Protestant churches; and many na-tional faith-based organizations. We are all committed to help build a fresh, newly ener-getic, multi-racial Christian movement to make the integral connection between rac-ism and poverty and seek the spiritual power to end both. We are also committed to work-ing in alliance with other faith communities on the crucial intersection of racism and poverty as it is worked out in public policies. While the Circle of Protection is a Christian group, we believe this statement reflects the values and principles of people of diverse faiths. We are purposefully sending you this state-ment before you go to your respective re-treats. In addition to reading this statement thoughtfully, we ask for the following three things: first, we ask you to discuss this statement and the issues central to it—rac-ism and poverty—at your retreats; second, we ask you to incorporate these concerns into your policy decisions and legislation in 2018 and beyond; third, we ask you to con-vene meetings with faith leaders in your communities to plan follow-up action on these issues in your states and districts. Racism and poverty are systemic issues that are central to the Bible and the teachings of Jesus. Therefore, they are critical to policy choices made by political leaders of faith and conscience. We will be following up with you directly to see how we can be helpful and useful to you as you consider these deeply biblical and theological issues. We believe if we Christians from diverse backgrounds and traditions were known, not mostly for our divisions, but for our unity in a shared commitment to faithfully address both racism and poverty—together—it could be powerful force—both for our churches and the country. So help us God. R

Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I want to share a passage from the unity state-ment that was developed. This was an ecumenical group of over 100 religious denominations: ‘‘Racism is more than individual behavior, language, and overt hostility toward particular peo-ple. Racism is systematic and struc-tural in America and harms people of color in very specific, measurable, and tangible ways.’’ Mr. Speaker, the Kerner report, un-fortunately, was ignored, and 50 years later, we are still feeling and reaping the consequences. The difficult truth is that, until we address the impact of the middle passage and slavery of gen-erations of African Americans and be-lieve that truth and reconciliation must happen, 50 years from now, two cities will have destroyed the very fab-ric of our Nation. As the unity declaration goes on to say: ‘‘Racism is a sin that goes back to the founding of our Nation.’’ We know what is plaguing our soci-ety, and we know what to do about it. The time for talk is over. It is time we do what is right for all Americans. Yes, Black lives do matter. Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I heard the gentlewoman say, obviously, 1968, and we are now in 2018. I yield to the gen-tlewoman to tell me what she thinks, in terms of the conditions in 1968, which were obviously the riots, to where we are in 2018. I know there has been some progress, but in terms of things moving back. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, in many com-munities, housing was segregated. We passed fair housing laws. Affordable housing now is out of reach for many African Americans. This administra-tion is now gutting all of our fair hous-ing programs, our public housing pro-grams, our Section 8 programs. The banks, of course, did target Afri-can-American communities for these subprime scam loans. Unfortunately, any equity that had been built in the homes that we purchased after 1968 is gone. So the wealth gap is huge. It is greater than what it was probably in 1968. When you look at the number of Afri-can Americans who were unemployed in 1968, I believe it was a little over 5 percent. Now we are looking at 7 per-cent. When you look at the incarceration rates for the war on drugs, the mari-juana laws in this country, especially in the eighties and the impacts of that, we have so many of our young African- American men incarcerated for mis-demeanor and felony charges for mari-juana distribution and use. We are looking at mass incarceration that has taken place since 1968 of African-Amer-ican young men and women. So, yes, we have made a lot of progress. I stand here as the 100th Black Member of Congress. Mr. EVANS  is here. We have a Congressional Black Caucus that has increased in size. We have many, many allies in our fight. But I think what we haven’t addressed is the issue of racism and institutional racism, because it is so subconscious for so many people until many deci-sions are made which negatively im-pact the African-American community. So from 1968 to now, we have made some progress. We have some great professionals, people doing wonderful things in our community. We have great leaders. We have great scientists, lawyers, doctors, teachers, firefighters, and workers. We have so many people who have been able to lift themselves into the middle class, but we have left so many behind. That is the point, I think, that, while this new report shows that some of us have progressed, we didn’t do what was necessary to bring everyone along with us, to lift everyone out of poverty in the Black community and provide for a level playing field for equality, for par-ity, and for a pathway into the Amer-ican Dream. That is really very sad and very shameful, but I have a lot of hope that our young people and that we here in the House and that the country really begin to understand that we have to address the root causes of what has happened in this country as it relates to the middle passage and slavery, and to understand that what we see today in these respects that cause these eco-nomic and racial disparities go right back to the unfortunate, devastating, and horrific middle passage. Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman to speak about the panel she is leading on poverty. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, several years ago, we established the Whip’s Task Force on Poverty, Inequality, and Op-portunity. For so many years, I wanted to see our caucus talk about more issues relating to low-income and working people and people of color. I really appreciate our whip, STENY  H
OYER , and our leader, N ANCY PELOSI , for rallying around this concept of looking around all these issues of pov-erty, inequality, and opportunity. We put together this task force to begin to look at the policies that not only we need to support that are lifting people out of poverty, but what we need to do to fight against some of the policies and funding priorities that would lead more people into the ranks of the poor. This task force now has over 100 peo-ple. We have meetings with experts, with organizations that are doing won-derful work throughout the country in communities of color and low-income communities and the Black commu-nities, really demonstrating that there are some grassroots efforts and com-munity efforts that, while here in Con-gress we haven’t been able to change many policies, at the grassroots levels and the community level there are some wonderful people doing some great things to help lift people out of poverty and into the middle class. So we try to highlight and showcase those organizations and individuals so that we can replicate them around the country, so that, until we can get the policies right, we can support those ef-forts that are taking place that are really doing a wonderful job. Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. E
LLISON ), someone I had the pleasure of spending time with. We have a little running conversation with the Eagles playing in the Super Bowl. He has turned out to be a very good friend in spite of that. He has traveled this Nation and been very thoughtful in his comments and the things he has said. He wanted to really weigh in on this subject. He has been in the forefront of economic op-portunity, poverty reduction, racism, and income equality. He has been in there.

Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, even though the gentleman from Pennsylva-nia’s football team, the Eagles, beat the Vikings pretty badly, I forgive him for that because at least they beat New England and Tom Brady. Now, on to the serious business. I thank the gentleman, Mr. E
VANS , for hosting this Special Order talking about the Kerner Commission. I was born and raised in the city of Detroit. I am honored to represent Minnesota. I am a Minnesotan and very proud of Minnesota, but I started life out in the city of Detroit. I remember 1968. I was born in Au-gust of 1963. I distinctly remember the riots. As a small child, my father was a medical professional, and I remember him being gone for long hours, coming home extremely tired. I remember the earnest conversations my parents were having, talking about the riots. I remember looking outside my door and seeing military-style vehicles driv-ing by, which is something we didn’t really see. I remember being afraid be-cause we heard some noises, and my mother had me and my brothers get under the bed. I had no idea, really, what was going on, but those memories for me are very vivid because, when you are a child and your parents are afraid, you can feel it. I don’t think I will ever forget it. As I got older, I wanted to know more about the causes of the riots, and I learned and read about the Kerner Commission. The Kerner Commission’s report was designed to focus on all of the civil disturbances that had been happening in the United States, includ-ing the Detroit riot, which I was alive and have some memory of. b2045 I think it is difficult for young people who want to understand the Kerner Commission report—a report that was prophetic, a report that was thorough and important, a report that was actu-ally a pretty good piece of literature that had good recommendations that our country has never really taken se-riously. But to understand this report and to really delve into the roots of it, I think it is important, Mr. Speaker, to under-stand that, before 1968, before there ever was a Kerner Commission report, our country, the United States, was a slave-holding nation for about 250 years. If you mark African-American presence in the United States from 1619 and you say slavery officially ended in 1865, America, our country, the United States, was a slave-holding nation longer than it was not one—longer, ac-tually longer. This country held men, women, and children in bondage in ab-solute absence of freedom for longer than it has not, which is particularly ironic, given that our country is dedi-cated to liberty and freedom. Literally millions of Americans ex-isted in a state of anti-freedom, which is slavery. We have yet to contemplate it. I remember going to law school studying property and contracts. We never talked about America’s greatest amount of property, which is human property. We never actually asked: What is the law about leasing on slaves? What is the law about property ownership on slaves? What is this spe-cies of property? We talked about real estate. We talked about other forms of property. We talked about intellectual property. But for many years of this Nation’s history, the predominant form of prop-erty was human property in the United States, and we never stopped to even slow down. I bet you there is not more than two or three law schools in the United States that take on this topic so that people can really understand the ground upon which we stand. We are in the U.S. Capitol, built by people who were not free. In this cathedral of free-dom, the people who built it were not free for 250 years. People stand by and say: Why don’t you all get over that? You are always talking about that. I say: Well, you all still celebrate the Fourth of July. We are all proud on the Fourth of July that happened in 1776, but we are not supposed to talk about an institu-tion that prevailed in the United States for most of its history. And it wasn’t quite over in 1865, was it? No. In 1865, we passed the 13th Amendment banning involuntary ser-vitude. We passed the 14th Amendment granting citizenship in, I think, 1868. In 1870, we passed the 15th Amendment granting Black men the right to vote. This is essentially war measures. I am glad they exist, trust me. I am quite grateful they exist. But when you consider that over 200,000 Black sol-diers took up arms to keep the Union— the Union—it was the very least that could happen that Black men would get to vote. Black women didn’t get to vote. But then after that, it is important, Mr. Speaker, to bear in mind another phenomenon took place. By 1877, the Tilden-Hayes compromise was effected, in which there was a dead heat polit-ical election. And the Republicans of that day, who, ironically, were the peo-ple who were against slavery at that time and against racism and bigotry, they said: We are tired of fighting about racism, slavery, and what is to happen with the Freedman. We will pull Union troops out of the South if you Democrats give us the election. That allowed Rutherford B. Hayes to become President. Samuel Tilden did not become the President, but the Southerners, Democrats at that time, got what they wanted. This phenomenon that occurred after that was the end of reconstruction. Lynching, slavery by another name, and true terrorism, under the auspices of the Ku Klux Klan, reined in America at this time. Pulaski, Tennessee, was the home of the Klan. But there were many other White supremacist groups that received the sanction of our gov-ernment. In fact, one might even argue that the whole government of the State of Indiana at one time was domi-nated by the Klan. People interested in this phenomena can study a very important piece of film and book called ‘‘Slavery By An-other Name,’’ that talked about con-vict leasing. The 13th Amendment says that you cannot hold anybody in an in-voluntary servitude unless convicted of a crime. That loophole allowed our country to use the criminal justice system to push Black men into it to take advantage of their labor through convict leasing. And even though the industry in Ala-bama of steelmaking really had not taken root during slavery, it did take root after slavery. The people who mined the iron ore and who worked in those mines were, essentially, in con-vict leasing. Convict leasing prevailed in our country up until the 1930s and 1940s. In fact, cotton production dropped after the Civil War, but then went back up because of convict leasing because Black men and women were held in bondage through an unjust criminal justice system that forced them to work cotton up until mechanization made hand cotton picking not advan-tageous anymore. That, together with the sharecropping system, maintained that system. We think about the Kerner Commis-sion report, we think about the riots of 1968, 1965, and 1966, all of these things, Black rage exploding on the national scene, and people ask: What are they mad about? Two hundred and fifty years of slav-ery and 100 years after Jim Crow after that might make you a little upset. Black people never missed a war. Af-rican-American soldiers helped fight for the Union; African-American sol-diers helped fight in Korea; the Span-ish-American war. As a matter of fact, you can’t name a military conflict that Black people didn’t fight for this coun-try and die for it. Yet, after the serv-ice, usually we came back to racism and discrimination. There is a great movie out now called ‘‘Mudbound’’ about this very phe-nomena. If people want to learn more about this, they can look at this film ‘‘Mudbound’’ about a Black soldier who comes back, gets treated with human dignity in Europe, comes back to Mis-sissippi, and then gets lynched. This is our country. I am proud of my country and I love my country, but I am not blind to it. The Kerner Commission tried to open our eyes and tell us what was really going on. One of the phenomenon—and I would like to just note this—is that one of the many ways that racism manifested itself is through residential segregation. Blacks were not allowed to live in certain areas, work in certain areas, and, in 1903, the great Woodrow

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH1368 March 5, 2018 
Wilson kicked Black people out of Fed-eral employment. His reason was that we carry disease. This is in the modern era. Black people were relegated to liv-ing in certain neighborhoods. And, ac-tually, when it was found to be illegal to say Blacks can’t live in this neigh-borhood by the Supreme Court, then that is when redlining took hold. Residential segregation was so effec-tive, Mr. Speaker, for 50 years, that we now in America today—and I am talk-ing about 2018—if you survey White Americans and you ask them, Have you had a significant and meaningful con-versation in the last 6 months, who are those people and who are the top seven, 91 percent of White Americans will say that they haven’t had a meaningful conversation with a person of color. Residential segregation is so bad that we don’t talk to each other. The result is no empathy—no sympathy; no empa-thy; no sense of, gee, that is really too bad. People say: Well, they don’t work hard. That is the problem. Well, wait a minute. How could it be that the people who worked for 250 years for free don’t work hard? How could it be that people who don’t have any power are some big threat to be feared in this Nation when all we have done is serve it and build it? At the end of the day, the Kerner Commission tried to highlight dis-crimination against African Americans in education, housing, and employ-ment; tried to help the Nation under-stand why some African Americans get enraged about incidents of official vio-lence; why we don’t condone, nor even do we agree, with riots. We cannot act like we don’t under-stand them. Of course we understand them. Many of us have chosen that we are going to try to reform our country and help it reach its promise through our electoral system, through orga-nizing, and activism. We are going to try to make America a stronger and better place by working within the sys-tems that exist. I am proud that I am one of those people. But I often have to find myself trying to convince people who don’t agree with me that there are answers within the system that I am right and they are not, because they come with arguments sometimes based on the his-tory. The bottom line is the Kerner Com-mission report, 50 years ago today, we have made progress. There is no doubt about it. We don’t have Jim Crow any-more. But we have also seen stagna-tion. There is a new report by the Eisen-hower Foundation, which shows that since the late 1960s, income inequality and the wealth gap have actually got-ten wider. While high school and col-lege graduation rates have improved for the Black community since the Kerner Commission report—thank goodness, and this is an important ad-vance, and we are grateful for it—these gains in access have not translated in economic vitality. Black families have the highest stu-dent debt. Thirty-one percent of all Black families have college debt, com-pared to about 20 percent of White fam-ilies. College debt is tough on families of any color, but African Americans, having a lower overall income and a much lower wealth, have to borrow more to seek out education, and that is limiting African-American oppor-tunity. More than 70 percent of White fami-lies own their own homes compared to less than half of Black and Hispanic families. Since 1968, White homeowner-ship has steadily increased, but Black homeownership has not changed. In 1968, 41 percent of Black families owned their own home. And what is the homeownership rate today? Now it is 41.2. Given what I shared with you earlier about residential segregation and about how Blacks and Whites and Latinos don’t really interact nearly as much as they should, given the fact that we are all Americans, people may not understand why African-American economic progress has not been as swift as we might want it to be. To that I say it is a matter of resi-dential segregation and even current redlining. I recommend to people to read an important book called ‘‘Evict-ed’’ by Matthew Desmond, and also lis-ten to a podcast called ‘‘Reveal’’ about redlining. This prospect of redlining is very important. ‘‘Reveal’’ looked at lit-erally thousands and thousands of pieces of data from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. They found that, in 61 metropolitan areas in the United States, there is substantial evidence of mortgage discrimination. That is Afri-can Americans, who got the same cred-it score, the same down payment as other people, who are denied loans. Mr. Speaker, this even happens in neighborhoods where Black people are the majority. People wonder: How is it that you have gentrification? Well, the Black person with the downpayment and the 700 credit score gets told that they cannot have a loan; and the White person with the 500 or 600 credit score and a 3 percent down-payment gets told: Sure, have the loan. It is happening every day. Listen to the podcast ‘‘Reveal.’’ You will see a woman who went through this herself. It left her not only with-out a house, but she had to have her partner, who is White and Asian mix, be the one who took out the mortgage because they wouldn’t give her one. I am saying that our country is truly a great nation, but to get to its true greatness, it has got to confront racial discrimination. I am not talking about prejudice. I am talking about racism. What is the difference? Prejudice means I don’t like you be-cause of your color, your race, and it is a personal thing. It is just I don’t like you. What I am talking about by racism is systematic denial of opportunity with-out regard to personality. They didn’t turn that Black woman down in that ‘‘Reveal’’ podcast because they didn’t like her. They don’t know her. They know she is Black, and that is all they need to know to turn her down. This is what we have to confront as a country. And as I close, Congressman E
VANS , and as I get ready to take my seat, I just want to point out that, in 2016, White families had a median net worth of $171,000 compared to $17,000 for Blacks and $20,000 for Latinos. Sixty percent of White families reported hav-ing retirement savings, which is double the rate for Black and Hispanic fami-lies. We have to understand what Martin Luther King tried to teach us, and that is: What difference does it make if you can sit at a lunch counter if you can-not afford a hamburger? b2100 The Kerner Commission tried to sig-nal to us the way forward. In 2018, we still have the opportunity to take the lessons of it and to build a truly be-loved society, as Martin Luther King tried to teach us, but it cannot just be platitudes and pretty talk. It has got to be real commitment, real money, and real investment in opportunity for all. At the end of the day, in the United States, we say, as we say the Pledge of Allegiance, ‘‘liberty and justice for all.’’ I say economic liberty and eco-nomic justice for all, and I say we will then see much more social inclusion, and we will live up to the recommenda-tions of the Kerner Commission. We can’t wait another 50 years. Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the gentleman a question. I hope people heard him. I want to ask a couple things. The goal of the Commission was to identify the underlying causes of the civil unrest in communities across the country, and obviously a lot has hap-pened in that 50 years. Technology, trade policies, tax policies, education policies, all those types of things have occurred, and it is clear knowing—ob-viously, in 1968, they didn’t know any-thing about the internet, trade poli-cies, tax policies. Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the gentleman: Should there be another commission report? Should there be something that, in a sense, tries to up-date, in 2018, knowing the cir-cumstances that we are in, and espe-cially poverty has even grown more? Mr. Speaker, I told you, in the dis-trict I am in, which has a lot of wealth with major universities, there is 26 per-cent poverty. In 1968, there was a riot in the city of Philadelphia. Now, we don’t have riots, you know, fortunately, anymore today in commu-nities, but do we have a form of quiet riot that is occurring in these commu-nities, not physically the way they were, but in some way there is still this growing gap? So we know what the goal was.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1369 March 5, 2018 
Mr. ELLISON. Right. Mr. EVANS. We know the goal was to identify the underlying causes of the civil unrest. Mr. Speaker, what I hear Mr. E
LLISON  saying with that 250 years, the first time I ever heard that described that way, I would ask him to talk to us a little bit about here it is 2018, 50 years later, with all these things that have happened. I yield to the gentleman from Min-nesota. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I think another Kerner Commission report is definitely appropriate. It is right. It is good. But I will say that the Eisen-hower Foundation did a report that showed that, since the late 1960s, in-come inequality and the wealth gap have widened. I really believe that what we really need to do is say to ourselves, as a na-tion, that we are going to actually live out the true meaning of our creed. At the end of the day, the problem is not intellectual; the problem is a matter of will. Actually, we have real challenges in our Nation today because, I happen to believe, we have a President who is less willing to move progress forward than even other Republicans who have been in office. We live in a time, now, where we have seen the rollback of the 1965 Vot-ing Rights Act. We have seen the— right now, there is an attack on public employees in the Supreme Court. It feels like 1870. You remember I was talking about the Civil War. Black soldiers entered the Civil War in 1863 after the Emanci-pation Proclamation; 200,000 fought in that Civil War. Black soldiers helped win the Civil War and maintained the Union. In fact, Lincoln himself said that, without Black soldiers, we might not have a Union. We went through Reconstruction. Of course, Lincoln was killed in April of 1865, but by 1870, we began to roll back, we began to see the progress and the promise roll back. It feels a little bit like that right now. It feels a little bit like that. But, you know, we are not going back to them bad old days. I want everyone to hear that African Americans, Latinos, women, the LGBT community, people of other religious groups, minority reli-gions, we are not going to the back of the bus. It is just not going to happen. Better to say, okay, instead of hav-ing one group in America be supreme over everyone, what if that group were simply equal to everyone? Some people in our country seem to believe that having 43 Presidents who are White men, you get one that is Black, and now, all of a sudden, oh, my God, the world is coming to an end. No, it isn’t. Everything is fine. Everyone is fine. It just means that what we wrote on paper is actually getting reflected a little bit more in reality. I think we need to make a firm com-mitment to end housing discrimina-tion, a firm commitment to let the people vote, a firm commitment to stop giving tax breaks to the richest people and give the working and mid-dle class a chance to earn a decent level of pay. I think we need a Republican caucus who will help work with us to stop the carnage of guns on these streets and to allow people who have come here as children not to be thrown out of the country summarily. That is what we really need. But I am not getting the sense that they want to help out, so I am thinking we need to get elections that will get some people, Republican or Democrat, to come out here and do some good things for the American people—and not just the wealthiest, most privileged people. Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. Mr. Speaker, we have another person, who is a neighbor of mine and has been a very good friend, from the great State of New Jersey. We have got that Benjamin Franklin, Walt Whitman Bridge connection. He is a very good friend. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. P
AYNE ), from the 10th District of New Jersey. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from the Keystone State for hosting tonight’s Special Order hour. He has demonstrated great leadership during this time, and the issues that we are tackling during these Special Order hours are very im-portant to this country as we move for-ward. As has been stated today, it has been 50 years since the Kerner report warned us that the Nation was headed into a separate and unequal future. The Kerner report was supposed to be a wake-up call for the United States to break the cycle that kept African- Americans in poverty. It called for gov-ernment to invest in job creation pro-grams, to expand public housing, and to guarantee minimum family in-comes. The Kerner report understood that such actions were necessary for the United States to confront its leg-acy of race and inequality. Unfortunately, 50 years later, the same problems persist. The rate of child poverty in the United States today is greater than it was in 1968. The percent of Americans who live in the depths of poverty has grown as well. Welfare reform has failed. Afri-can-American unemployment is still nearly double the rate of our White counterparts. Labor unions, once a great equalizer for workers, have shrunk, and inequality has grown. Rich people in the United States are healthier than poor people. They live longer. They go to better schools, get better jobs, and generate more wealth. They are also more likely to be White than to be Black. Our schools are more segregated than they were in the 1980s. Our prisons are darker. The Voting Rights Act, a land-mark achievement of the civil rights movement, has been gutted. These and other barriers to equality threaten our democracy. The resegregation of our schools means that people of color and those who struggle with poverty are often forced to go to underfunded schools. Their education suffers. They aren’t given adequate preparation for college or a trade school, and they ultimately make less money than their White counterparts. A recent Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco study found that Black men and women earn persistently lower wages compared to their White counterparts, a gap that cannot be fully explained by differences in age, education, job type, or location. So what can Congress do? We need to invest in housing programs that help desegregate communities once again. We need to make it easier for people of color to get federally backed loans to buy homes and finally do away with red lining. We need to invest in public schools. We need to expand preschool education. We need to spend money on job train-ing programs and public universities. We need to increase the minimum wage, and we need to strengthen over-sight of mortgage lenders. We need to restore the Voting Rights Act, because people who cannot vote cannot lead. Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to, if I can, just follow up a little bit on the Voting Rights Act. Obviously, that is the foundation of a democracy, and it is rather amazing to me that all of us in this Congress are elected by the people. I tell people the greatest title is citizen. It is not Con-gressman; it is not President; it is cit-izen. So, Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the gentleman to speak a little bit about what has that impact been about the Voting Rights Act, as he sees it today, and the fact that, for some rea-son, this Congress doesn’t seem to un-derstand that we still need the Voting Rights Act in 2018. Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I would say that, as we have all stated tonight, it apparently appears that we are going backwards in this country, and so why wouldn’t the Voting Rights Act be under attack? It was finally the oppor-tunity for African-American citizens to be full citizens. The only right you are born with in the United States of America is the right to vote as an American citizen. You are born with that right, and yet it is stripped away through the gutting of the Voting Rights Act. So what does that say to people who fall under the Voting Rights Act? It says that you are not equal, that you don’t deserve the same rights as other Americans, that somehow you are less than a first-class citizen in this coun-try, yet you can go to war for us, you can do other things, contribute to this society, but not be able to vote. The three-fifths compromise, we can go all the way back to that and talk about the inequality.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH1370 March 5, 2018 
So we need people of goodwill on both sides of the issue, on both sides of the aisle, to understand how equality is ar-rived at and come together and do the things that we need to do in order to make this a more perfect Union. I be-lieve in that. I have not always seen it, but I believe that we need to continue to strive to make this a more perfect Union, to live out the mantra of this great Nation. This is the greatest country in the world, no question about it, absolutely incredible, but let’s live up to it. Let’s really live up to what this Nation stands for, because you don’t need peo-ple who are citizens here that don’t be-lieve in what you are saying. Every day, we get up and we pledge allegiance to the flag like every other resident, every other citizen in this country, but every once in a while it fails us. We need to stay vigilant. We at the Congressional Black Caucus will be the voice and be vigilant on this floor in this House for people through-out this country who seem to be on the wrong side of this issue. b2115 Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. H
OLLINGSWORTH ). The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 6 minutes remaining. Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, what oth-ers have heard this evening from the Congressional Black Caucus is sort of like a canary in the mine. The Kerner Report, when President Johnson estab-lished it 50 years ago, was an attempt to shine a light and to send a warning that we were two nations, one Black and one White. And for every Member who stood up here and spoke, they all talked about how proud they are, as Americans; and that we all recognize the beauty and the idea of America and what it has meant. I come from the city of Philadelphia, where it all started. In those conversa-tions, there is no question it started out as a very flawed document, where African Americans and women basi-cally were left out of that discussion. But as you think about what my good friend from Minnesota said as he laid out the historical aspect to where we are here in 2018 and the opportunity we have—because I do believe we have an opportunity, and I do believe it is not any more words on paper. It is not a report or anything. It is a question of what is in our hearts collectively. I don’t think this is a Democrat or Republican issue. I don’t think this is a Black or White issue. I think this is an issue about inclusion and involvement. I think that when you go back to that report that talks about the underlying causes of the civil unrest in these com-munities across this country, I think that we all have an obligation to try to address those issues. The issues are very fundamental. May you live in rural America, or urban America, or suburban America, you know, everybody needs quality healthcare. Everyone needs a job op-portunity. Everyone needs a good, solid education. And those things we should not take lightly. All of those things, we all need. So what we, as the Congressional Black Caucus, attempted to do is con-tinue to raise the consciousness and to get people to understand that we still have a lot of work to do. This should not be taken lightly; that we all recog-nize that though, as Dr. King used to say, we have come over here on dif-ferent boats, we are in the same boat now; and that boat is America; that boat is we are in a much more competi-tive world than in 1968. This is 2018. The world has radically changed. The question is: Are we going to be in the forefront of the change, or are we going to be in the back of change? I like to believe we should be in the forefront of change. I like to believe that we all understand, as a country, that it is in our collective interests to work together and to make a dif-ference. I am not saying to you it will be easy. And it was not easy in 1968. As I said, President Johnson was a Democrat, but he did not heed the re-port the way he should have probably heeded it. But it is no use talking about the past. The question is: How do we deal with the future, and where do we go? We should applaud him and others for at least having the discussion. We should not be fearful of discussion. We should all recognize that we have some challenges ahead for us in the 21st cen-tury. Again, I will repeat myself. It will not be easy. It will take a lot of work, and it will take us confronting those issues that we face today. It is not easy, as we have debated the issue about healthcare or the issue about jobs or the issue about education. Ev-erybody wants to work. Everybody wants a quality job and a quality op-portunity. No one wants to sit on the sidelines. So we have a chance today, in my view, to take advantage of the opportu-nities. I hope we will, Mr. Speaker. I believe that all members of the Con-gressional Black Caucus strongly feel that way. I thank the chairman of our caucus for initiating these efforts that we have been doing for this last year or so. I really appreciate that oppor-tunity. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

HONORING PASTOR ED SEARS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-uary 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. F
OXX) for 30 minutes. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, Grace Baptist Church, in Winston- Salem, North Carolina, paid tribute to its pastor of the past 37 years, Ed Sears, and his wife, Linda. Pastor Sears is transitioning out of his role as senior pastor, and the members of the church, along with people from across the State, met to acknowledge the leadership and inspiration provided by Pastor Sears. Pastor Sears is known as a servant of God who is held in high esteem by all who know him and his reputation. He is a person who made those around him feel loved. There is general agreement that the love that he shows others is a result of his commitment to and his re-lationship with Jesus Christ. He has made a difference in the lives of thousands of others to whom he min-istered whenever they were in need. He has been totally committed to his min-istry and been a true role model for us all. As he retires from a full-time min-istry to face health challenges, we wish him well. We know that he will deal with these challenges in the same way he has lived his life thus far, with honor, integrity, strength, and faith that will inspire others. May God continue to bless you, Pas-tor Sears. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. f

The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was called to order by the President pro tempore (Mr. H
ATCH ). 
f 
PRAYER The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-fered the following prayer: Almighty God, the sovereign Lord of nations, empower our lawmakers to be as faithful to others as You have been to them. May they be willing to show patience in dealing with the short-comings of others in the same way that You have shown them mercy and long- suffering. Lord, help them to seek to respect the beliefs and ideas of others, being tolerant even to those with whom they may disagree. Give them the wisdom to refuse to do to others what they would not want done to themselves. Lord, we commit this day to You, to-tally desiring to work for Your glory. We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The President pro tempore led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Y
OUNG ). The majority leader is recog-nized. 
f 
CONGRATULATING KENTUCKY COLLEGE BASKETBALL TEAMS Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, there is a simple reason nearly every Kentuckian looks forward to March— college basketball. I would like to take a moment to recognize several teams that are already making the State proud by winning their conference tournaments. This weekend, the women of the Uni-versity of Louisville won their first- ever ACC tournament title. Finishing the regular season with a record of 29 to 2, the Cardinals are currently ranked third in the Nation. Led by ACC Coach of the Year Jeff Walz and ACC Player of the Year Asia Durr, these tal-ented women are looking to add yet an-other title. So are the Murray State Racers. Its men’s team won the Ohio Valley Con-ference championship and earned its first NCAA tournament appearance since 2012. It will look to build on the longest winning streak in the Nation. Also in Louisville, the Bellarmine Knights men’s team earned its second straight conference championship and a two-seed in the NCAA Division II tournament. At Thomas More College, both the men’s and women’s teams are cele-brating conference championships which earned them spots in the NCAA Division III tournaments. Lindsey Wilson College won its con-ference title and is headed back to the NAIA Division I tournament for the first time since advancing to the Fab Four in 2013. The Union College men’s team clinched its fifth consecutive con-ference title. The Kentucky Christian Lady Knights took home the Mideast Region title as well. I congratulate all of these con-ference-winning Kentucky teams, their coaches, and, of course, their dedicated fans. f 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, on another matter, we will vote on the nominations of three more talented in-dividuals today whom the President has asked to serve as Federal district judges: Karen Scholer for the Northern District of Texas, Tilman Self for the Middle District of Georgia, and Terry Doughty for the Western District of Louisiana. These are three excellent nominees, and I encourage all of our colleagues to vote in support of each of them. f 
TAX REFORM Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, on one final matter, it has been 73 days since President Trump signed historic tax reform into law. It feels as though it has been longer than that because, practically every day, another major national employer announces a new commitment to in-vest in American workers because of tax reform. Every day, we hear about more local businesses realizing new savings and putting it toward equip-ment, expansion, and employees. Every day, we hear about how bonuses, rising wages, expanded benefits, and lower taxes are giving middle-class families a whole lot more breathing room. Yet, every day, we are reminded that some of our friends across the aisle are still desperately trying to minimize this good news. Democratic leaders have tried to say that these new jobs, raises, bonuses, and business expansions amount to no more than ‘‘crumbs.’’ I leave the final verdict to the hard- working families across the country, including the many Kentuckians from whom I hear. In the meantime, the eco-nomic data are painting quite an opti-mistic picture. Last week, the Labor Department an-nounced that weekly jobless claims had reached a 48-year low. Let me repeat that. Fewer Americans are filing for unemployment today than at any time since 1969. The labor market is tight-ening; employers are competing for tal-ent; and workers and their families are coming out on top. In January, Americans’ real dispos-able income rose more quickly than it had since April of 2015. That is the big-gest jump in spending money available to American families, accounting for tax rates and inflation, in nearly 3

years. That is more money to save for a home purchase or a college fund. It is more to save for retirement or to spend on a family vacation. U.S. consumer confidence is higher today than it has been since the year 2000, and, last week, news broke that U.S. manufac-turing is expanding at its fastest pace since 2004. Look, it is not complicated. The bill passed by the Republicans in Congress last year was designed with a very sim-ple philosophy in mind: that when we put more of Americans’ hard-earned money back in their own pockets, they will know what best to do with it, that when we level the playing field and take weight off the shoulders of small businesses, they will help their commu-nities thrive, and that when we wel-come investment from entrepreneurs and job creators, instead of discour-aging it, the economy will respond in kind. The idea was simple enough, but as we are already seeing, because the Re-publicans in Congress and the Presi-dent were able to overcome lockstep partisan opposition on the other side and get tax reform across the finish line, that simple idea is having an ex-traordinary impact.

DACA  
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today is the day—March 5—the deadline im-posed by President Trump on those who are being protected and allowed to stay in the United States under the DACA Program. It was last September 5 when Presi-dent Trump’s Attorney General held a press conference and said: That is it. The protection that is currently given to 780,000 young people in America to allow them to stay in this country and pursue their dreams will end on March 5 of 2018—today—780,000 who were brought to the United States as in-fants, toddlers, children, and teenagers, who have lived their lives in this coun-try, who have gone to school, who have never had a serious run-in with the law, who have gone through criminal background checks, come up with $500 filing fees, and who were given permis-sion under an Executive order by Presi-dent Obama to legally stay in this country for 2 years at a time. During that period, they would not be de-ported, and they would be allowed to work. Who are these young people? They are known as the Dreamers, although President Trump hates that term. They are known as the Dreamers be-cause they represent young people who went to school in America, stood up in their classroom every day and pledged allegiance to that flag. This is the only country they have ever known. This was to be the country of their future, but at some point in their lives, a member of their family sat down and said: We have to have a serious con-versation. You see, we never filed the papers when we brought you to this country as an infant, and right now you are undocumented in the United States of America. What that means is that any minute, there could be a knock on the door and you and perhaps your entire family would be asked to leave. I introduced a bill called the DREAM Act 17 years ago. Senator HATCH was my cosponsor when I introduced it. The purpose of the DREAM Act was to say to these young people: We will give you a chance. Though you are illegal in the eyes of the law in the United States— undocumented—we will give you a chance to earn your way to legal sta-tus, give you a chance someday to be a citizen of the United States. It will not be easy. There is no helping hand for you. If you want to go to college, there will be no Federal assistance for you. You are going to have to make it on your own. You will have to work and work harder than perhaps the person sitting next to you at their desk in high school. See if you can do it. If you can, we will give you your chance. That is what the DREAM Act said. It passed with a majority vote in the Sen-ate many times, but it never quite made it to 60 votes, which it needs to become the law of the land. President Obama, when he was a Sen-ator in this Chamber, was my colleague from Illinois. He cosponsored the DREAM Act with me. So the time came when he was elected President, and I wrote him a letter. Dick Lugar, Republican of Indiana, joined me in that letter. He supported the DREAM Act when he served in the Senate. We wrote to President Obama and said: Can you do anything to give these young people a chance, to spare them from deportation? He worked on it for 1 year. Then President Obama came up with something called DACA, a pro-gram by Executive order that gave these young people their chance— 780,000 of them went through the back-ground check, paid their filing fee, and proved they were eligible. They were spared for 2 years at a time and allowed to stay in this coun-try. During the course of the campaign, President Trump said many strong words about immigration. We remem-ber them well—it is hard to forget—the words about the wall, words about Mexican rapists, on and on, but he seemed to have a soft spot in his heart for these kids. Many times he would say: We have to give them a chance. They are different. The very first time I met President Donald Trump was minutes after he had been sworn in. It was at a luncheon here in the Capitol. I went up to him and said: Congratu-lations. I want to thank you for the kind words you said about the Dream-ers and those protected by DACA. He said: DICK, don’t worry about those kids. We are going to take care of those kids. That is what President Trump said on January 20, 2017. I brought it up to him several times too. It is an issue that is important to me, but, more im-portantly, it is an issue that is critical to the future of these young people. Then, what happened on September 5 of last year, just 9 months after the President was sworn in? His Attorney General held a press conference and said: That is the end of the protection for these young people. As of March 5, 2018, no protection. Then he challenged Congress. He said: Pass a law. Do what you are sup-posed to do here in the House and Sen-ate. Pass a law that will protect these young people. A number of us took up the Presi-dent’s challenge. We had a bipartisan effort, six of us—three Democrats and three Republicans—and we worked through some really hard issues on im-migration and on these young people. I want to salute my colleagues who were part of that: L
INDSEY GRAHAM , Repub-lican of South Carolina; J
EFFFLAKE , a Republican of Arizona; C
ORYGARDNER , a Republican of Colorado; joined with myself and M
ICHAEL BENNET , a Demo-crat of Colorado; B
OBMENENDEZ , a Democrat of New Jersey, and we put together an approach that gave these young people protection and a fighting chance to prove they deserve to stay in America. We felt pretty good about it. The President called a meeting in the White House on January 9—I remember these dates. I will always remember them—with about 25 Members of Con-gress, Democrats and Republicans, House and Senate. He held an open press conference for an hour, which is unusual and rarely done in the White House. We talked about DACA and we talked about Dreamers and we talked about

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1327 March 5, 2018 
what was going to happen next, since the President had given us a deadline of today, March 5, to do something. The President outlined what he wanted to see, and then he said in front of the television cameras: Send me the bill, and I will sign it. I will take the heat on this one. That was January 9. So a number of us, the six I mentioned earlier, came together immediately that same day and said: Let’s finish this bill, and let’s get it in his hands as quickly as possible. By January 11, 2 days later, we were ready. We reached a compromise, and it truly was a compromise. Parts of it I didn’t care for at all, but that is what we do around here if Democrats and Republicans are going to produce some-thing that might become a law. We called the President. We met the Presi-dent—Senator G
RAHAM and I and a number of others, and he totally re-jected what we had done. In fact, the President went on to reject five other bipartisan proposals to try to solve this problem. This is the same President who said on January 9 of this year, ‘‘Send me a bill, and I will sign it,’’ who turned down bipartisan option after bipartisan option. He just said no. We had a vote on the floor of the Sen-ate. It has been about 3 weeks ago now. It was a vote on four different pro-posals to deal with this challenge. Not one of those proposals received 60 votes. The one I had hoped for, a bill with a version of the Dream Act, was put to-gether by Senator C
OONS and Senator M
CCAINand brought to the floor. I re-member it had 52 votes. It needed 60 votes. It fell short. The bipartisan com-promise led by Senator R
OUNDS and Senator K
INGwith the President’s op-position ended up with 54 votes—6 votes short of what it needed to pass. Then the President’s own immigration proposal came up here on the floor of the Senate. Now, there are 49 Demo-crats and 51 Republicans in the Senate. The President’s proposal came up and got 39 votes—60 votes in opposition. It was a rejection by his own party and the Democrats in the Senate. So here we are on March 5. The dead-line is here. No bill has passed the Sen-ate. The House will not even consider the measure—will not take up any version of the measure. What is at stake? There are 780,000 young people protected by DACA, which officially, by President Trump’s order, ends today. They have one ray of hope, perhaps two. Two courts have said they are going to suspend this abolition of DACA until we hear the arguments of the President’s authority in the Con-stitution. So there is a temporary—and I underline temporary—injunction in place while these cases are pending, but I can tell you as a Member of the Senate and as a lawyer, no one—no one—can predict how long that protec-tion will last. Is it a matter of days or weeks or months, at best? That is what these young people live with, this uncertainty. This humanitarian crisis in this country—and I call it that—was cre-ated by President Trump on September 5. He has failed to agree to six different bipartisan proposals to solve the prob-lem he created, and now these lives hang in the balance. Well, who are they? Who are these young people? I was with one of them earlier today. Her name is Ana Flores. Ana grew up in Aurora, IL, and went to the public schools there. She is a very bright young woman who was brought to the United States at the age of 5 from Mex-ico by her parents. She is undocu-mented in America and lives under the protection of DACA. What did she do with her life? She went to the Illinois Institute of Technology, one of the best in the Na-tion, and she won a civil engineering degree there. Clark Dietz is an engi-neering firm in Illinois that stepped up and said: We want that bright young woman on our staff as an engineer, and they hired her. I met her for the first time today. She is a wonderful person. She strug-gled against the odds all of her life. She is protected by DACA, a program that officially, under President Trump’s edict, ends today. Will Illinois be a better State, Chi-cago be a better city, the United States be a better nation with this young lady and her engineering talents at work for us? Of course, there is no question about it. Why in the world would we ever want to deport someone who has gone through our educational system and excelled like this young lady? She is not the only one, by any means. This is a photo of Elizabeth Vilchis. She is the 109th Dreamer whom I have spoken about on the floor of the U.S. Senate. She was brought to the United States at the age of 7. She grew up in Yonkers, NY. As a child, she heard about STEM subjects—science, technology, engineering, and math. She decided to make that her life’s work. She excelled in math and science and decided she would be part of the fu-ture of this country and took on these important subjects. She said: ‘‘From that point forward I made pursuing a career in STEM my responsibility, as an American.’’ During high school, Elizabeth was a member of the Honor Society, the Key Club, the Architecture, Construction and Engineering Program. She was edi-tor of the yearbook and also played on the volleyball team. She graduated high school with an Advanced Regents diploma. She was then accepted into the Hon-ors College at City University, New York City College. Remember, these Dreamers—these undocumented students—don’t qualify for Federal assistance to go to school as most kids do. They have to find an-other way to work and save their money or take private loans. She received a Community Service Award from the School of Engineering 4 years in a row for her work orga-nizing engineering education programs for low-income students. She received a Student Leader Award for her work with an engineering student associa-tion. She was named Volunteer of the Year 4 years in a row for managing the Manhattan robotics competition. I have seen those robotics competi-tions. A lot of young people in high school do some amazing things in these competitions, and it launches a career and a life in the STEM subjects. Elizabeth graduated with a double major in mechanical engineering and political science. She worked as an en-gineer for Samsung for 2 years. Then she founded a nonprofit organization focused on creating funding opportuni-ties for early stage technology startups. Today, Elizabeth’s nonprofit has over 700 members. To date, they have raised over $8 million to grow their companies. She wrote me a letter and Elizabeth said: To me DACA is my opportunity to give back to the United States and my family the way I dreamed of since I was 10 years old. It’s the ability to help solve the STEM talent shortage after 15 years of preparing for it and being told it was impossible. It’s the power to say ‘‘No’’ to going back to the shad-ows and ‘‘Yes’’ to serving as a role model for young girls across the country who aspire to be engineers and entrepreneurs. 
People like Elizabeth are the reason why more than 400 business leaders signed a letter to Congress urging us to pass the bipartisan Dream Act. The letter says: 
Dreamers are vital to the future of our companies and our economy. With them, we grow and create jobs. They are part of why we will continue to have global competitive advantage. 
It would be a personal tragedy for us to deport Elizabeth Vilchis, but the de-cision of President Trump to abolish the program that protects her, sadly, makes that a possibility. If this injunc-tion by the court is lifted, at that mo-ment, there could be a knock on her door—or perhaps on the door of the company that hires her or her engi-neering firm—and she could be told that her time is up. Under President Trump, she has to leave the United States of America. President Trump created this crisis. Instead of working toward a solution, he has rejected every bipartisan effort that has been sent his way to save the Dreamers. What will happen next? Do we have to stand by and watch as these families are divided, as talented young people like Elizabeth and Ana are deported? Is that what we are all about? Is that what the President meant when he told me ‘‘We’ll take care of those kids’’? That is what it has come down to. It is a sad reality that all across America, hundreds of thousands of these young people now live in fear of deportation. They should be living, as Elizabeth said, outside the shadows and

as part of America and its future. What can we do about it? I am at a loss. Unless and until this President ac-cepts the responsibility to help us solve the problem he created, I am afraid we will never be able to rally the nec-essary Republican votes to make this a reality. It is up to President Trump. In the part of the world that I come from in the Middle West, there is a say-ing that I am going to clean up a little bit, and it goes something like this: Any old mule can kick down a barn door, but it takes a carpenter to build one. This President has kicked down DACA, kicked it down to the dirt, and this is the day—the deadline that he set. The question is, Does he have the will or the heart to rebuild it? Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Utah. 
ORDER OF PROCEDURE  
Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that notwith-standing rule XXII and the order of March 1, the confirmation vote on the Doughty nomination occur following the cloture vote on the motion to pro-ceed to S. 2155, with all other provi-sions of the previous order in effect. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I enjoyed listening to the minority whip, and I don’t believe the President is as heart-less as he is indicating, but the Presi-dent does want the American laws to be observed. There are ways of getting that done, and I think he is doing some of that to see that it is done. I happen to empathize very much with Senator D

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER  
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized. 
GUN SAFETY  
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it is nice to hear my colleague’s words. I would also want to mention a few things about the same issue. Mr. President, it has been nearly 3 weeks since the shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL. Still, unfortunately, the majority lead-er hasn’t committed to any floor time for the debate on the issue of gun safe-ty—no time to debate universal back-ground checks, a policy that over 90 percent of Americans support, includ-ing the vast majority of gun owners; no time to debate protective orders to allow law enforcement to temporarily disarm individuals who have shown credible signs of being a harm to them-selves or others, especially relevant after Parkland; no time to at least have a debate on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines on the floor of the Senate. The kids who survived that horrific shooting are speaking up and speaking out and are demanding that we address this issue head-on. I believe they are moving the conscience of the Nation. I met with them. They are fine young men and women. Instead of just curs-ing the darkness after what they went through with the losses of friends and colleagues they suffered, they are try-ing to light a candle, urging us to de-bate and do something real. Yet, the majority leader is moving to a banking bill today with no promise of time to consider a package of commonsense gun safety measures. We need to debate them on the floor. We can’t just try to do one little bill by UC with no debate or put it into some other big bill. This needs a national de-bate. This issue is consuming America, and for the Senate to turn its back and do nothing, or to try to just slip some minor measure through, doesn’t work. Last week, America watched Presi-dent Trump whipsaw on gun safety issues in a matter of days. All of Amer-ica felt pretty good when the President met with a bipartisan group. He seemed to be open to tackling gun safe-ty in a bipartisan way in a nationally televised meeting. Then, the next day, he met with the NRA behind closed doors and seems to once again have backed off. It is a show we have seen before, and it is getting old. Too many times we have watched the President say the right things when the cameras are on but refuse to follow through the mo-ment they are switched off—oftentimes doing a 180-degree reversal of his posi-tion. On the issue of gun safety, just like the issue of immigration, we could find a bipartisan consensus. It is very pos-sible, but it requires the President to show some leadership, some follow-through, and some consistency. Other-wise, Congress will do what it has done after every mass shooting for the past decade—nothing. Those brave, young students will be here in a few weeks, having watched Congress do nothing again. What a black mark that will be—lowering the even low ratings of this body. 
REPUBLICAN TAX BILL  
Mr. President, on to another matter, the Republican tax bill. Over and over, we have heard the Republican mantra that their tax bill was aimed at giving working Americans a boost. Yet every analysis showed that when you looked at the actual policy, the lion’s share of the tax cuts are going to corporations and the richest 1 percent. According to one study, 83 percent of the benefits from the Republican tax bill go to the top 1 percent of earners. Don’t worry, our Republican friends say, that money will trickle down to workers, but trickle-down economics has never worked. It has failed time and again. Most of our Republican col-leagues are even afraid to admit that the majority of the tax cuts go to the very wealthy. They simply say it is helping working people, but their mechanism of trickle-down is some-thing they will not utter in public. Instead of giving workers major wage increases, hiring new workers, or in-vesting in new equipment and research, the most popular use of the savings from the tax bill for corporations is corporate share buybacks. That is from the big corporations. Already, big cor-porations have announced more than $200 billion in share buybacks this year. We just started March, and al-ready, corporations are on pace to spend over $1 trillion this year buying back their own stock. The problem here is, share buybacks don’t really help workers. They don’t really help grow the economy. They are a quick way for a big corporation to take more of their stock off the market, raising the value of the shares. Who benefits? Well, corporate execu-tives who own lots of these shares and wealthy shareholders who hold the vast preponderance of the shares. As one economist told Bloomberg, ‘‘You’re not going to get the macro- economic benefit the administration thought it was going to get from its tax cuts. It’s going to go to the areas that don’t stimulate growth,’’ namely, buybacks, dividends. An analysis by Just Capital, which the New York Times called ‘‘one of the most detailed accountings to date’’ of how companies are spending the windfall from tax re-form, finds that ‘‘just 6% of capital al-located so far is going to [employees], while 58% is going to shareholders in the form of dividends, share buy-backs, or retained earnings.’’ That is 6 percent for the workers and nearly 60 percent to share buybacks and other corporate benefits. Today, the Joint Economic Com-mittee, led by our wonderful ranking member, Senator HEINRICH , pointed out that if you distributed the savings that went to just one big company—Berk-shire Hathaway, which gained $29 bil-lion as a result of the tax bill—you could give a $1,000 bonus to 29 million Americans. This is amazing. That is the equiva-lent of every employee in Arizona, In-diana, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia combined from just one com-pany’s worth of savings. The public is beginning to realize what is going on here. They see they are putting their children and grandchildren into deep debt, not to benefit themselves, the workers, preponderantly, but to benefit corporate leadership, owners of shares—the vast preponderance of whom are in the top 10 percent of American wealth. Corporations are not putting the vast preponderance of the money where they should be—raising the salaries of workers or increasing productivity of the company by investing in new ma-chinery and new techniques. No; it is that quick hit, the stock buyback. It goes to show how beneficial tax re-form could have been if it were aimed

at the middle class and those strug-gling to reach it. Instead, the Repub-licans made a conscious effort to give corporations and the wealthiest Ameri-cans the bulk of the tax cuts and prom-ised it would trickle down to everyone else. Unfortunately, past is prologue, and corporate America will invest in what is best for corporate America, while working America is getting left behind. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator for Texas. 
ECONOMIC GROWTH , REGULATORY RELIEF , AND 
CONSUMER PROTECTION BILL  
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this week, we will be voting on an impor-tant piece of bipartisan legislation that recently passed out of the Senate Banking Committee, led by our col-league, Chairman M
IKECRAPO . The bill is called the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Con-sumer Protection Act. The purpose of the bill is to rightsize the onerous reg-ulations that are currently imposed on community and independent banks and that stifle their ability to loan money to people who need access to credit in order to start a business or to grow a small business. Under the current law famously known as Dodd-Frank, these smaller banks are often treated just like the largest banks and financial institu-tions in our economy. That doesn’t make any sense at all. Main Street, we need to remind some of our colleagues, is not Wall Street. The bill would make changes to re-flect that important distinction. I can’t tell you how many of my small bankers in Texas have told me they had to hire additional personnel, not to make more loans, just to comply with the onerous overregulation coming out of Washington, DC. Unfortunately, we lost over 2,000 banks nationwide since the end of 2010. Two thousand banks have gone out of business, either as a result of a merger with a larger bank that could sustain the additional cost of complying with these regulations or those that have just given up and said: We can’t cut it because of the costs, and we are hang-ing up our spurs. In Texas, 165 bank charters have vanished during that same timeframe—a 26-percent reduc-tion. Like I said, some of the decline is due to mergers with larger banks, but there have also been a number of bank failures. We all heard about too big to fail, but some institutions were deemed essen-tially too small to save. They were the ones left behind and forgotten under Dodd-Frank. Because of the regulatory burdens, some small banks said enough is enough and opted to get out of the lending business altogether. You know who ends up paying the price and who ends up getting hurt? It is the married couple who wants to borrow money to buy their first home or, as I said ear-lier, a business that wants to expand and hire more people. Those are the people who ultimately get hurt. In this bill we are considering this week, we are trying to change that sit-uation. No less than former Congress-man Barney Frank—the Democratic author of the original law—has empha-sized the point that we need now to re-member: The bill we are voting on keeps in place rules and regulations that were imposed on large Wall Street banks after the financial crisis. In other words, the big banks on Wall Street were the ones that helped con-tribute to the financial crisis, and they are the ones that will continue to be regulated under Dodd-Frank, but the community and regional banks that were, in essence, the collateral damage to the great recession of 2008, following the big financial crisis, will finally see some needed and welcomed relief. Rig-orous stress testing of large financial institutions will continue. Congress-man Frank has said it would be ‘‘whol-ly inaccurate’’ to claim otherwise. So when some try to distort the bill’s purpose and the provisions in the days ahead, I think it is important to keep that in mind and don’t buy what they are selling. This bill will mostly, as I said, affect smaller community banks, which clearly don’t fall under the same category as the titans of global fi-nance. Last year, the Banking Committee solicited input from a broad array of stakeholders. The committee’s idea was to say: Hey, all of you out there who greatly suffered under Dodd- Frank, how can we reduce the burdens you face? Those are the kind of ques-tions all of us need to be asking back in our States. After extensive negotiations at all levels, and after hearing not just from financial entities great and small but also from consumer groups, the result is the bipartisan legislation we will soon consider on the Senate floor. The bill was formally introduced by a group of 10 Democrats and 10 Repub-licans. You don’t get much more bipar-tisan than that. I know the Senator from Idaho, the chairman of the com-mittee, has had productive discussions as well with my friend and fellow Texan Chairman H
ENSARLING on the House side, who heads up the House Fi-nancial Services Committee. While the new provisions will help community banks, credit unions, as well as midsized and regional banks, they will also ensure that key con-sumer protections remain in place. Some of these protections will even in-crease for consumers who have fallen on hard financial times or who are vic-tims of fraud. Veterans and seniors particularly will benefit. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has agreed that this common-sense bill will provide significant regu-latory relief, and his predecessor, Janet Yellen, said it was a move in a good di-rection. While I would like to go further and provide additional relief from Dodd- Frank, we should nonetheless pass as much as we can and help America’s local lenders build small businesses and strengthen our local communities. Let’s get this bill—which is sup-ported by a variety of stakeholders, in-cluding the Texas Independent Bankers Association—across the finish line this week. I wish to especially congratulate and thank our colleague from Idaho for all of his hard work, and I hope that all of us can emulate that hard work on a bi-partisan basis to get this bill across the Senate floor and ultimately to the President for his signature. TAX REFORM  
Mr. President, I would like to shift gears for a moment and discuss a mat-ter that my friends back home in Texas are talking about a lot, and that is the benefits of tax reform. I happened to walk out here just as the Democratic leader, the Senator from New York, was saying that tax re-form is not working. Well, I note that his message seems to be a little out of sync with the news, which in part re-ported today that the number of Amer-icans applying for unemployment bene-fits is at its lowest level in more than 49 years. In other words, our economy is finally growing again, and it is work-ing again for the people who needed the jobs and needed the income that are provided by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Sometimes I wonder whether our Democratic friends, who took great po-litical risk by voting uniformly to a person to oppose the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, are worried not that it will not work but that it will work and they will be proved completely wrong in an-ticipating what the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will be. In par-ticular, Ms. P
ELOSI , the minority lead-er of the House, said that these were crumbs—crumbs. Well, I think she will be proved wrong, and that will be to the great benefit of all of the people of America. So everyone remembers, this was not an easy lift. We passed the first tax re-form in more than 30 years. The imme-diate consequences of the bill have been transformative. In other words, we just did this in December, but we have already seen encouraging signs. My constituents in Texas know as well as anyone—just ask a man by the name of Scott McDonald, who called my office last week. Scott owns a resi-dential roofing company in Burleson, which is near Dallas. It is called F- Wave, and its mission is to ‘‘create the best [roofing] shingle the world has ever seen. Period.’’ That is Scott’s dream. Do you know what Scott told us over the phone? He said that his 47 em-ployees are really feeling the positive impact in their paychecks. He said: ‘‘There are a lot of happy people around here.’’ People are happy because of the re-duced tax rates. Now that the IRS has updated its withholding tables, in Feb-ruary people saw the first boost in their take-home pay they have seen in a long, long time. Scott also said that the positive cli-mate has created a lot of incentive for

his company to invest and grow. If you think about it, looking at what has happened in the stock market and, more importantly, what it has done to 401(k)s and pension plans and people’s savings, there is a lot of enthusiasm and newfound confidence in the Amer-ican economy, and that is an unequivo-cally good thing. Scott sees that in his place of business. He said that it has created a lot of incentive for his com-pany to invest and grow, and that is good for the people who will benefit from those jobs. He is looking to hand out bonuses when the company’s fiscal year ends at the end of this month, and he is hoping that a new facility his company is building will create jobs for as many as 500 people. You heard me right earlier. He said 47 people work there now, and he is hoping that this new facility will create jobs for as many as 500 people. Scott, we appreciate your story, and we are glad you took the time to share it. Back home in Texas, we are trying to keep track of all the tax reform suc-cesses, but there are so many, some-times it is hard to keep up. In West Texas, El Paso Electric has just announced that homeowners will get new refunds on their electric bills due to the lower tax rate. Seniors, peo-ple on fixed incomes, will actually see their utility bills go down because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. What great news. In Helotes, which is right outside of San Antonio, my friend, Representa-tive W
ILLHURD, who represents that area, tells us that Jeff and Mary Marsh, the owners of two coffee shops, are particularly thrilled. They are passing along the tax savings directly to their staff of 11 employees in the form of increased hourly wages, bene-fits packages, and bonus programs. They hope to upgrade their systems and equipment and expand with new lo-cations too. Stories like these sure don’t sound like ‘‘Armageddon.’’ That is the term House Minority Leader P
ELOSI used to describe the tax reforms last year, in addition to calling them ‘‘crumbs.’’ She called them ‘‘Armageddon’’ and ‘‘crumbs.’’ Well, I am not sure how those two go together, but she and other Democrats did their dead-level best to scare the living daylights out of the American people and to tell them that this would not work and that it would actually hurt them. I heard the Democratic leader, my friend from New York, Senator S
CHU-
MER, out here talking about how money that is being brought back from overseas isn’t being invested properly here in the United States, as if it were the government’s money. The whole point is that this is not the govern-ment’s money, this is money earned by the people and the businesses that take the risks and that we need to succeed so that our country will succeed and we will continue to grow so that the American dream can remain alive. It is almost as if they think that any money saved as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is somehow stolen from the clutches of the Federal Gov-ernment that knows how to spend that money better than they do. Well, I cer-tainly have a different view. I guess, though, our Democratic col-leagues were not totally off base in mentioning Armageddon because the tax cuts did spell doom for progressive rationales and excuses for not cutting taxes and making our system more competitive globally. It really was Ar-mageddon when you consider what it did to their outrageous arguments. Our reforms have exploded the notion that the only way government can en-sure prosperity is with higher taxes. Again, it is based on this crazy idea that the money you earn is not really yours to keep, it is the Federal Govern-ment’s, and the government will only let you keep a certain amount of it, and that when we cut taxes, it actually somehow is not money that is yours in the first place. It seems like it is com-pletely reverse logic. The bill’s well-documented effects have killed the ludicrous claims we heard before Christmas that Americans who faced stagnant wages for years wouldn’t really benefit from the raises or that companies are incapable or un-willing to actually give those raises or invest in their businesses and create new jobs. I wonder what the critics have to say about all this now. They have mostly been quiet since the good news started rolling in—although I guess, listening to my friend from New York, they have not given up entirely. I wonder what they have to say to or-ganizations like the Health Care Serv-ice Corporation, which operates Blue Cross Blue Shield in my State. Thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, it has announced a $1.5 billion initiative to make health insurance more afford-able. This $1.5 billion initiative to make health insurance more affordable comes as more good news to men and women like those in my State who have struggled to pay for healthcare. I wonder what the naysayers have to say to this one lady in particular. I am thinking about somebody from Lewisville, TX. She recently contacted me and preferred not to be identified. Originally in my remarks, I was going to mention her name, but out of re-spect for her privacy, let me just tell her story and leave her name out of it. She had surgery a while back and had to borrow money up front to pay for it. On top of her student loans, this stressed her out. She was pretty anx-ious. She was wondering: How am I going to pay these bills? Well, in her note that she sent to my office, she said that she is extremely grateful for the reduced taxes because now she brings home an additional $125 in each paycheck—$125. That $125 helps her pay the bills she was so worried about. I hope our friends across the aisle who opposed this bill uniformly—every single one of them voted against it—I hope they will listen not to our claims but, rather, to the evidence and realize that this $125 to this woman from Lewisville, TX, is not crumbs; it is the difference between living in fear that she will not be able to meet her obliga-tions and living in peace knowing that she is going to be able to meet those responsibilities. Her story is America’s story, too, and it is a snapshot of what is occurring in the economy. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said last week that ‘‘some of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have [now] turned into tailwinds.’’ The economy con-tinues to pick up steam. I have already mentioned that the number of people making unemploy-ment claims is at its lowest level in the last 49 years, but when you look at con-sumer confidence, when you look at the stock market, when you look at businesses willing to invest in new plants and equipment and you see the benefits of employers competing for labor—you know, one of the benefits of seeing unemployment so low and the economy growing again is that employ-ers are going to have to start bidding up for the workers they need in order to do the job. What that means is that wages, which have been stagnant for so many years, are now going to grow again. So in addition to the lower rates, people will have more take-home pay. They are going to see more take- home pay in addition because of the in-creased wages they are going to be able to demand for their hard work. These are great and positive signs, but we have to keep telling the good stories because they so often get drowned out by the scare tactics and the hyperbole that comes from those who seem to be afraid—not that this will not work but, rather, that it will work and they will be proved terribly wrong. Madam President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. ERNST ). The clerk will call the roll. The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
FLORIDA HURRICANE DISASTER ASSISTANCE  
Mr. NELSON. Madam President, it has been almost 6 months since Hurri-cane Irma struck Florida. It has been about a month since we passed the most recent disaster supplemental ap-propriations bill, which finally in-cluded the money for Florida’s fish-eries, citrus growers, and communities across the State that we have been fighting for since day one, since the storm passed. Today, I spoke to the Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross, and I asked him to immediately release this crit-ical funding to help the people of our State. Florida’s fishermen are still waiting for their help too.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1331 March 5, 2018 
Hurricane Irma caused extensive damage to vessels, facilities, docks, equipment, and gear, especially in the Keys. Many in the spiny lobster indus-try lost all of their traps. The disaster supplemental appropriations gave NOAA $200 million for Federal fishery disasters like the one that Secretary Ross declared for Florida. Where is the money? Let’s talk about the broader impact to the oceans. Did you know that Flor-ida’s coral reef tract is the third larg-est barrier reef in the world? It is a reef that starts south of Key West and goes all the way up the coast, almost all the way to Fort Pierce. The coral supports the spiny lobsters and the stone crabs, which are served in restaurants around the country. This industry is impor-tant to Florida’s economy. Hurricane Irma tossed all manner of debris around. Monroe County has al-ready spent almost $20 million to re-move over 2 million cubic yards of waste—roofs, appliances, bicycles, trailer homes, and boats. The debris was also swept into the water, which is threatening the corals, and into the ca-nals, where it blocks transportation. I want you to take a look at this pic-ture. This is one of the canals in the Keys. Look at what is sitting in the canal—a whole mobile home that was lifted up from the mobile home park on this side of the canal. There it is, in the water. Take a look at this. Do you see what is in the canal? Do you see out here? That is the ocean. This canal is coming right in. What happens is that eventu-ally some of the debris goes into the Atlantic. It gets near the reef. Some of it submerges. The wave action is send-ing it back and forth. You can imagine any one of those pieces of debris knocking constantly into delicate coral that is already dis-eased, that is already overheated be-cause the rising temperature of the water. You can imagine what is hap-pening. Whether it is a mobile home sitting in the canal or whether it is all of this junk that is sitting in the canal and that eventually goes out, this is what we need help with. It has been over a month since we passed the disaster supplemental ap-propriations bill. Why isn’t the money flowing? That is what I called the Sec-retary of Commerce about this morn-ing. I told him: Mr. Secretary, my re-quest is very, very simple. Just get the money out. The money is appropriated. It is there. I said: Mr. Secretary, will you please crack the whip on NOAA so that you can get this money out and we can get this place cleaned up, as well as protect those coral reefs from the damage they have already undergone? Then I said: What happened in this storm is, whether for lobster or stone crab, the traps were all swept away. The poor fishermen don’t have any traps. They need help too. That is what this disaster appropriations bill is for. Mr. Secretary, you have to crack the whip to get them going. Unfortunately, this is not the only issue we are facing. Florida’s citrus in-dustry suffered over $760 million in losses from the storm. Why? Because the trees were full of fruit that was going to be picked within just a few weeks. Along came the storm; the winds were severe. In Southwest Flor-ida, some of the citrus crops were 100 percent lost. In fact, the winds were so high that they ended up uprooting cit-rus trees. Further north, in Central Florida, the groves there lost 50 to 60 percent of their crops. The citrus industry cannot survive those kinds of losses, and that is why we have a disaster appropriations bill. There were losses of over $760 million from the storm. The rest of Florida’s agriculture took a big hit, too, with an estimated $2.5 billion in total damages. In February, we finally came through with $3.8 billion for the U.S. Depart-ment of Agriculture. Of that money, $2.6 billion was supposed to go directly to farmers and ranchers. It is March, and those folks haven’t seen a dime. After I talked to the Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross, I put in a call to the Secretary of Agriculture. I have called several times today. I have yet to connect with him. If any of his staff are listening, there is a bottleneck at the USDA that is preventing this money from going to the families who desperately need it. I will continue to call Secretary Perdue to ask him to do what I asked Secretary Wilbur Ross to do: Crack the whip on his organization to get the money flowing. That is why we passed supplemental emergency ap-propriations. Now the Federal agencies need to get the money out the door. This is so frustrating because the ad-ministration knew that Congress was discussing a disaster supplemental bill when Hurricane Harvey hit Texas in August. Then Irma hit, and then Maria hit. Six months later, most of the Federal agencies are just starting to dust off their pencils and figure out how they are going to allocate the funding. What is wrong with you? People are hurting. They are going bankrupt. You have to get that money out. Can you imagine how you would feel if your family’s entire citrus crop had been wiped out and you had been hold-ing your breath waiting for disaster as-sistance funding, which finally came over a month ago, and then you were told by the folks at the USDA that you were going to have to wait for several more months until USDA figures out how to get you the money? It is no wonder that people are fed up with bu-reaucracy. Additionally, many of our cities and counties have yet to see any reim-bursements from FEMA for Hurricane Irma. In fact, many have yet to be fully reimbursed for Hurricane Mat-thew, which struck almost 2 years ago. Unbelievably, all those counties that were devastated had paid for the debris removal. The State of Florida missed the deadline—didn’t turn it in on time. Of course, what we had to do to cover the State of Florida’s mistake was to plead with FEMA: Forget the mistake; it is the local counties and cities that need the money. Not getting the money out is totally unacceptable. While we are still wait-ing for reimbursements from these storms, how can we expect these local governments to prepare for the 2018 hurricane season that will start in just a few months, right around the corner? Let me say it again. This is unac-ceptable for the slow-walking—the foot-dragging—that is going on in get-ting the money out the door. I am going to keep pounding on this until the folks in Florida start getting the help they need and deserve. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Florida. 
GUN VIOLENCE  
Mr. NELSON. Madam President, since I see no other Senator who seeks recognition, I thought I would take the occasion to bring the Senate up to date on what is happening down in Florida in the aftermath of 17 people being gunned down at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. As we know, we have seen those stu-dents speak out with a boldness and clarity that is rarely seen, and they are not being intimidated at all as to what needs to be done. As a matter of fact, in the aftermath of the shooting—and while some of the funerals have still been going on—since our Florida State Legislature is in session, over the course of 2 weeks, the students have gone to the capital city of Tallahassee and have held individual meetings with State legislators. They have held a rally outside of the capital and insisted that maybe—just maybe—this might be a time that the State legislature should confront this issue head-on: that, in fact, there was something to the fact that a weapon that was origi-nally developed for the military, an AR–15—the semiautomatic version of a military weapon—could do such dam-age and quickly go about killing so many people. It was 17 in the case of the high school. Just 2 years earlier, it was 49 people in Orlando at the Pulse nightclub. In between, we saw several mass killings with high-powered, military-style as-sault rifles in Texas, as well as 59 peo-ple being gunned down in Las Vegas. Last week, I talked about the assault weapon, and I have since had, over the weekend, constituents in Florida ask me to come back and speak on the floor of the Senate about the difference in the damage—the mayhem, the car-nage, the slaughter—that occurs as a result of an assault rifle as compared to a handgun. You don’t have to take it from this Senator. You can talk to the trauma surgeons. You can talk to the radiologist in the trauma center. As a matter of fact, several articles in the past week have been written in various publications in Florida and in the na-tional press, along with there being

photographs to show the difference. Let me paraphrase the words of one of the trauma surgeons in Broward Coun-ty who attended to some of the vic-tims. He cited that on any normal night, particularly on a weekend, they have to treat gunshots. If that gunshot is from a handgun—say, a .22 pistol or, say, a .9 millimeter pistol—the bullet will enter the victim, and unless that bullet goes to a critical organ, such as the heart or, for example, to the blood supply going into the liver, that bullet will continue through. If it comes out the other side, it will come out with a hole that is the same size as when it penetrated the body in the first place. It is not so with a bullet from an as-sault rifle because those weapons, which are developed for the military, are clearly for killing. The bullet, first of all, comes out at three times the speed—three times the velocity. Therefore, when it hits its target, it hits with three times the en-ergy. Often, the bullet is designed so that when it hits the target, it will tumble and just tear through and de-stroy any flesh in its path, including bone and organs. The trauma center’s radiologist ex-plains that if a handgun’s bullet, such as a .9 millimeter, goes through the liver, they can usually save the pa-tient’s life. They point out that of al-most all handgun wounds, they can save the life unless the bullet hits a major artery or organ, like the heart, or a major blood supply. It is not so with the bullet from an assault weap-on. The bullet enters at three times the velocity, with three times the energy. It starts tumbling, ripping away flesh. If it goes, for example, to a kidney or to the liver, it pulverizes that organ and comes out the other side of the vic-tim with a hole as large as an orange. That is the difference between a handgun wound and a wound from a high-velocity assault rifle, whether it is a semiautomatic or whether it is an automatic. It was made automatic, with what we saw in Las Vegas, with the bump stocks. He made a semiauto-matic, which was legal to purchase, into an automatic rifle. It is because of that carnage that one has to ask one-self: Would any American citizen want to have those kinds of assault rifles loose on the streets for people who want to use them for dastardly pur-poses? I think the answer is no. This Senator grew up on a ranch. I have hunted all of my life. I still hunt with my son, but an AR–15 is not for hunting; it is for killing. It is an under-standing of the difference of these weapons that is causing the American people to gradually understand that these kinds of weapons have no place on the streets of America. One can imagine the SWAT team. Had they been there while the shooter had still been inside and had they en-tered that school and tried to find the killer and known that what they were going to come up against was an AR–15 instead of a handgun, that would have been a terrible thing. One can imagine, if there had happened to be an armed guard with a pistol and he had gone after the shooter but the shooter had had an AR–15, that would not have been a fair firefight. With a pistol against an AR–15, one can imagine who is going to win that fight. These are the questions that the American people need to have answered as we go through these discussions about what to do. Thus, when these students all gather in Washington and in 100 cities around this country on March 24—a Saturday—and start marching in untold numbers, they are going to be asking: Isn’t enough enough? Haven’t we come to the point at which we ought to reexamine that the Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms but if these are the arms we want borne on our streets? I yield the floor.

NOMINATION OF TILMAN SELF  
Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise out of a great sense of pride to exercise one of my responsibilities in the U.S. Senate to speak on behalf of Tripp Self, a judge from the Georgia courts, who has been nominated to become a judge for the U.S. District Court for the Mid-dle District of Georgia. The vote will take place not too long from now, and I encourage every Senator to cast his vote for Judge Self. He is the whole package. He has a wonderful wife and family and four great children. He worked in the private sector for years and accom-plished many things in the private sec-tor. He went to the University of Geor-gia School of Law and graduated cum laude and summa cum laude from The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina, and went on to have a distin-guished private career. He then served as a superior court judge on the Macon Judicial Circuit for the State of Geor-gia. In that job with the superior court, he did something that I am very close to. He is an entrepreneur because he started the Veterans Treatment Court for the Middle District of Georgia and for that judicial circuit. The Veterans Treatment Court, as all of you know, is a court that is formed to help veterans who stray from the law or who have difficulties when they come home either because of PTSD or TBI. It helps them with the struggles of battle that they have had and with whatever problems they may have had from representing us on the battlefield. They trip and they fall, and they need somebody to help get them up. We want to make them do the right thing but also help them get themselves brushed off, look forward to careers, and help them get that step forward. We do that with teenagers with what are called CASAs, Court Appointed Special Advocates. We turn people around who otherwise might go to jail—young kids. The Veterans Treat-ment Court takes those who have risked paying the ultimate sacrifice— that of their lives for you and for me and for everybody else—who might have fallen off just a little bit. When we get them back into the judicial sys-tem, we get them straightened out, and we move them forward so they have better lives and rewarding careers of their own—thanking them for all of the things they have done for us as vet-erans. As the chairman of the Veterans’ Af-fairs Committee of the U.S. Senate and as one who recognizes the value of the court system for all of the things it does to administer justice, I am par-ticularly proud to have a judge who has used his entrepreneurial skills to deal with a problem our society has in the legal sense and in the court sense and to see to it that our veterans are get-ting the help they need and that our communities are getting the represen-tation they need. I am also a football fan. I know call-ing football games is tough, just as making judicial decisions is tough. Tripp Self officiates NCAA football in the Southern Conference. Two years ago, he was selected to do the 2017 FCS national championship game, which is a testament to his ability to call balls and strikes on the field. He is a pretty good shot too. He is a turkey hunter and likes to turkey hunt and likes the outdoors. Most importantly, he loves the United States of America. He respects and loves the law for what it does. We are a nation of laws and not of men. He does everything in his capacity as an individual and as one on the bench to see to it that our country is a better country and our State is a better State—the State I represent, Georgia. When each Senator turns to vote in a few minutes on the confirmations of the three judges that will come before us today, when it comes to Judge Tripp Self, of Georgia, may each cast a vote proudly for someone who is a legal en-trepreneur for veterans, one who has served with distinction in the State as a private sector practicing attorney and on the bench already, and one who will serve the United States of America very well in the years to come. I commend him and his family for being willing to take on this responsi-bility, and I thank the President of the United States for the wisdom to make this appointment. I yield the floor.

RETIREMENT OF THAD COCHRAN Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, late this afternoon, Senator T
HAD C
OCHRAN , the senior Senator from Mis-sissippi, announced he will be retiring from the Senate on April 1. He said his health had become an ongoing concern. I saw a steady stream of Senators visiting with Senator C
OCHRAN today expressing their best wishes to him and for good reason: Senator C
OCHRAN is a gentleman, first of all; he is a skilled legislator, second of all. He has earned the respect of his colleagues on both sides of the aisle through his chairman-ship of the Senate Appropriations Com-mittee, the one-time chairman of the Senate Republican conference, and back in Mississippi, he was a pioneer in the development of that State’s two- party system in the Republican Party. He and Trent Lott were both elected to Congress in 1972, in the Nixon sweep. Then, T
HAD COCHRAN became the first statewide-elected Republican in Mis-sissippi since Reconstruction, in 1978, when he was elected to the U.S. Sen-ate. He has been here ever since. He is a close friend. I admire him greatly. We will miss him greatly, but I especially admire his service and wanted to say that before I made other remarks. f 
TARIFFS Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, 16 years ago President George W. Bush announced that tariffs would be im-posed on steel imports from several countries. The goal was to help protect the domestic steel industry. It was a good goal by a well-intentioned Presi-dent whom I supported, but it back-fired. Last week President Trump an-nounced that he intends to impose new tariffs on imports of steel and alu-minum for the same reasons. It is a good goal by a well-intentioned Presi-dent, but I am afraid it will backfire, just as it did for President Bush 16 years ago. Here is the problem: Tariffs are big taxes, and they are big taxes that raise consumer prices. These new tariffs may temporarily save a few jobs in plants that produce steel and aluminum, but they will destroy many more jobs in auto plants that use steel and alu-minum. This is especially bad news for Ten-nesseans because one-third of our State’s manufacturing jobs are auto jobs, with more than 900 plants in 87 of our 95 counties. Anything that threat-ens to destroy or damage auto jobs is of grave concern to Tennesseans. It will now be cheaper for some Tennessee auto parts suppliers to move outside the United States, buy steel and alu-minum there, and then ship finished parts back to this country. These new tariffs will hurt more than U.S. auto manufacturers. The Presi-dent indicated this morning that a final decision hasn’t been made. I hope that before he makes a final decision, he will take into consideration the choices that companies such as Electrolux are making, which dem-onstrate that broad tariffs are bad for American workers and will cost Ameri-cans jobs, not just auto jobs. Here is one example of the damage the proposed steel tariff would do in Tennessee to a home appliance manu-facturer that uses 100 percent Amer-ican steel. Immediately after the tariff was announced last week, Electrolux— Europe’s largest home appliance manu-facturer—announced that it was put-ting on hold a $250 million expansion in Springfield, TN, just outside of Nash-ville. Electrolux has made multiple in-vestments in Tennessee, with plants in Memphis, as well as Springfield. Electrolux employs more than 1,000 Tennesseans. The company said: ‘‘Unfortunately, this decision gives foreign appliance manufacturers a cost advantage that is

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES1334 March 5, 2018 
hard to compete against.’’ Note that Electrolux says that it gives foreign manufacturers an advantage. Electrolux buys all of the carbon steel it uses in its Tennessee plants from American steel mills. Let me say that again. Electrolux, which employees 1,000 people in Tennessee making home appliances, buys all of the carbon steel it uses in Tennessee plants from Amer-ican steel mills. Yet it has put its ex-pansion on hold because it believes the tariff will make it difficult for Ten-nessee plants to compete with plants overseas. Why? Because the new tariff is expected to cause American steel mills to raise their prices to match the newer, higher price of imported steel. The result of the tariff, therefore, will be higher costs for Electrolux and fewer jobs in Springfield, TN, making home appliances with 100 percent American steel. Instead, there will be more jobs overseas making home appli-ances with 100 percent foreign steel. The new U.S. tariffs on imported steel will raise the price of all steel sold in our country, so appliance manu-facturers with plants in the United States will have a hard time competing with plants outside of our country. We should learn the lesson from 2002 when President Bush imposed similar tariffs—again, a good goal, a well-in-tentioned President, but it backfired. According to one widely cited inde-pendent study, the tariffs raised con-sumer prices and ‘‘[m]ore American workers lost their jobs in 2002 to higher steel prices than the total number em-ployed by the U.S. steel industry itself.’’ President Bush’s tariffs also led to retaliation, as other countries threatened to impose new tariffs on American exports, which would have cost even more U.S. jobs. On Friday, the Wall Street Journal editorial board reminded readers: ‘‘Steel using industries in the U.S. em-ploy some 6.5 million Americans, while steel makers employ about 140,000. Transportation industries, including aircraft and autos, account for about 40% of domestic steel consumption, fol-lowed by packaging with 20% and building construction with 15%. All will have to pay higher prices, making them less competitive globally and in the U.S.’’ That was the Wall Street Journal. The backlash to the 2002 tariffs was so strong that President Bush termi-nated them early. I want to give President Trump cred-it for listening. He invited a number of us who disagree with his advisers on trade to the White House. He has lis-tened carefully. So far, we haven’t per-suaded him. I hope we still can. I thank him for listening. I hope he will con-tinue to listen. It is unusual to have a lesson in American history so much like the ac-tion he is proposing to take that was not good for the country no matter how well-intentioned the President was or how good an idea it seemed. Since history can often serve as a guide, I refer my colleagues to two ad-dresses I delivered on the U.S. Senate floor on September 2, 2003, and Novem-ber 11, 2003, summarizing the disas-trous effect President Bush’s proposed steel tariffs had on U.S. jobs. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent to have printed in the R
ECORD a copy of the Wall Street Journal’s March 2 editorial on tariffs. There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows: 
[From the Wall Street Journal, Updated March 1, 2018] T
RUMP ’STARIFF FOLLY  (By the Editorial Board) Donald Trump made the biggest policy blunder of his Presidency Thursday by an-nouncing that next week he’ll impose tariffs of 25% on imported steel and 10% on alu-minum. This tax increase will punish Amer-ican workers, invite retaliation that will harm U.S. exports, divide his political coali-tion at home, anger allies abroad, and under-mine his tax and regulatory reforms. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.7% on the news, as investors absorbed the self-in-flicted folly. Mr. Trump has spent a year trying to lift the economy from its Obama doldrums, with considerable success. Annual GDP growth has averaged 3% in the past nine months if you adjust for temporary factors, and on Tuesday the ISM manufacturing index for February came in at a gaudy 60.8. American factories are humming, and consumer and business confidence are soaring. Apparently Mr. Trump can’t stand all this winning. His tariffs will benefit a handful of companies, at least for a while, but they will harm many more. ‘‘We have with us the big-gest steel companies in the United States. They used to be a lot bigger, but they’re going to be a lot bigger again,’’ Mr. Trump declared in a meeting Thursday at the White House with steel and aluminum executives. No, they won’t. The immediate impact will be to make the U.S. an island of high-priced steel and aluminum. The U.S. companies will raise their prices to nearly match the tariffs while snatching some market share. The ad-ditional profits will flow to executives in higher bonuses and shareholders, at least until the higher prices hurt their steel- and aluminum-using customers. Then U.S. steel and aluminum makers will be hurt as well. Mr. Trump seems not to understand that steel-using industries in the U.S. employ some 6.5 million Americans, while steel mak-ers employ about 140,000. Transportation in-dustries, including aircraft and autos, ac-count for about 40% of domestic steel con-sumption, followed by packaging with 20% and building construction with 15%. All will have to pay higher prices, making them less competitive globally and in the U.S. Instead of importing steel to make goods in America, many companies will simply im-port the finished product made from cheaper steel or aluminum abroad. Mr. Trump fan-cies himself the savior of the U.S. auto in-dustry, but he might note that Ford Motor shares fell 3% Thursday and GM’s fell 4%. U.S. Steel gained 5.8%. Mr. Trump has hand-ed a giant gift to foreign car makers, which will now have a cost advantage over Detroit. How do you think that will play in Michigan in 2020? The National Retail Federation called the tariffs a ‘‘tax on American fami-lies,’’ who will pay higher prices for canned goods and even beer in aluminum cans. An-other name for this is the Trump voter tax. The economic damage will quickly com-pound because other countries can and will retaliate against U.S. exports. Not steel, but against farm goods, Harley-Davidson motor-cycles, Cummins engines, John Deere trac-tors, and much more. Foreign countries are canny enough to know how to impose max-imum political pain on Republican Senators and Congressmen in an election year by tar-geting exports from their states and dis-tricts. Has anyone at the White House polit-ical shop thought this through? Then there’s the diplomatic damage, made worse by Mr. Trump’s use of Section 232 to claim a threat to national security. In the process Mr. Trump is declaring a unilateral exception to U.S. trade agreements that other countries won’t forget and will surely emulate. The national security threat from foreign steel is preposterous because China supplies only 2.2% of U.S. imports and Russia 8.7%. But the tariffs will whack that menace to world peace known as Canada, which sup-plies 16%. South Korea, which Mr. Trump needs for his strategy against North Korea, supplies 10%, Brazil 13% and Mexico 9%. Oh, and Canada buys more American steel than any other country, accounting for 50% of U.S. steel exports. Mr. Trump is punishing our most important trading partner in the middle of a Nafta renegotiation that he claims will result in a much better deal. In-stead he is taking a machete to America’s trade credibility. Why should Canada believe a word he says? Mr. Trump announced his intentions Thursday, so there’s still time to reconsider. GOP Senators Orrin Hatch (Utah) and Ben Sasse (Nebraska) spoke up loudly against the tariffs, but a larger business and labor cho-rus is required. Mr. Trump is a bona fide pro-tectionist so he won’t be dissuaded by argu-ments about comparative advantage. But perhaps he will heed the message from the falling stock market, and from the harm he will do to the economy, his voters, and his Presidency.

SYRIAN CIVIL WAR Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today as Syria is about to enter its eighth year of conflict. We have wit-nessed 7 years of displacement and vio-lence, 7 years of war crimes, and 7 years of Bashar al-Assad’s illegitimate grasp on power. To say that it is past time for Assad to go or that it is past time for the conflict to be resolved dra-matically underestimates the horrible suffering and destruction the people of Syria have experienced. In these 7 years, almost 500,000 Syrians have been killed and more than 12 million have been displaced from their homes. This conflict has disproportionately affected children, as all conflicts do. According to Save the Children, inside Syria, 7.5 million children have lived their whole lives knowing nothing but war. Emotional and psychological stress has manifested itself physically; Syrian children now face an increase in heart disease, diabetes, and depression. These children are growing up in ref-ugee camps, with no end in sight. This means the loss of their childhood and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1335 March 5, 2018 
of educational opportunities. I don’t exaggerate when I say that because of this war, an entire generation of Syr-ians will be both displaced and dis-affected in an already volatile region. Ignoring these children ensures decades of instability to come. In Eastern Ghouta this past week, we saw the most recent example of the brutality of the Assad regime, aided and abetted by Russia and Iran. While only just now making headlines, East-ern Ghouta has been held under siege by the Syrian Government since 2013. This neighborhood, which had sup-posedly been designated as a deescala-tion zone, has been bombarded by Syr-ian Government forces armed with Russian weapons. In just a few days, 500 civilians have been killed, and that number is growing. Years after the international commu-nity reached a consensus that Assad had lost his legitimacy as the leader of Syria, he not only remains in power but is more secure than ever. The United States has not only failed to exert moral leadership in the face of Syrian suffering but has also failed to show strategic leadership in the face of a tangible threat to U.S. national secu-rity. I have long called on both the Obama and Trump administrations, warning that U.S. interests were not being rep-resented in Syrian negotiations, but this has never been more clearly illus-trated than in November of this past year, November of 2017, when a picture circulated of Presidents Ruhani, Putin, and Erdogan shaking hands in Russia after a round of negotiations to deter-mine a potential resolution of the Syr-ian conflict. I have to ask, is it now U.S. policy to let these three dictate policy in the Middle East—Ruhani, Putin, and Erdogan? The United States was not there, nor were our European allies. The United States is failing our own interests by ceding leadership in Syria to Iran and Russia, whose national se-curity interests often directly con-tradict our own. What do these bullying regimes want from Syria? Let’s start with Iran. Iran sees Syria as an investment in its political infra-structure and its campaign for regional hegemony. It is their ‘‘land bridge’’ from Tehran to Beirut, a weapons pipe-line, a training camp for Hezbollah. It is a practice ground for a future war with Israel. What about the Russians? The Rus-sian Government, led by Mr. Putin, has made clear that they believe all Syrian territory must return to the Assad re-gime and to the Assad regime’s control before political reforms can be consid-ered. Putin seeks a solution that shows that he is the arbiter of events in the Middle East. Lately, foreign leaders— including Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel, President Ruhani, and King Salman of Saudi Arabia—fly to Moscow instead of Washington. They see a Rus-sia that seeks to write the rules of international order and an America that sits back, too enmeshed in our own political strife to lead. This is not the America that I know and that most Americans know. The America I know does not believe that where you are born should dictate where you live or die or if you spend your childhood in a refugee camp. The America I know does not stand by while enemy nations threaten to ex-pand their spheres of influence. The America I know sees the complexity of our own foreign involvements, under-standing, for instance, that ISIS can-not be fully defeated without consid-ering the context of the Syrian civil war. The America I know supports its allies, like Israel, that share a chaotic border with a nation at war with itself. In 1963, President John F. Kennedy spoke at the Fort Worth, TX, Chamber of Commerce on the challenges posed by the Soviet regime. He said: 
This country, which desires only to be free, which desires to be secure, which desired to live at peace for 18 years under three dif-ferent administrations, has borne more than its share of the burden, has stood watch for more than its number of years. I don’t think we are fatigued or tired. We would like to live as we once lived. But history will not permit it. . . . The balance of power is still on the side of freedom. We are still the key-stone in the arch of freedom, and I think we will continue to do as we have done in our past, our duty. 
So said President Kennedy. He spoke to the paradox of our country then and now, what we continue to face. If we are to remain the keystone in the arch of freedom, we cannot become fatigued by the responsibility to fight tyranny. These are the very issues that should receive public debate as part of the congressional consideration of a new authorization for the use of military force, known by the acronym AUMF. We undermine our own credibility when we continue to send our men and women into conflicts that Congress has not authorized. Secretary Tillerson, our Secretary of State, has indicated that he sees a need for a long-term U.S. military presence in Syria; yet many of us believe that there is no purely mili-tary solution to this conflict. Where is the strategy? we ask. I would like to see the administration put forward a plan that encompasses all components of this conflict—military, political, and humanitarian. When we ask our men and women in uniform to put their lives on the line to protect our homeland and fight ter-rorism, we need to be willing to back them up by doing our jobs here in Washington. Just consider Pennsyl-vania. Pennsylvanians have made a substantial sacrifice in the past 17 years of war as 288 of our brave service-members have been killed in action in those 17 years and as almost 2,000 have been wounded in action in Afghanistan and Iraq. We owe it to these men and women to have a robust, bipartisan debate about this strategy and a vote on an AUMF. We should also vote on legislation to cut off financing for ISIS or any other terrorist organization in the world. I have a bipartisan bill, the Stop Terror-ists Operational Resources and Money Act, the so-called STORM Act, with Senator ISAKSON . I have a bill, as well, with Senator R
UBIO, the Preventing Destabilization of Iraq and Syria Act, to promote humanitarian aid and sanc-tion the Russian and Iranian actors who are destabilizing this region—all of the components of a comprehensive strategy. Let’s have a serious debate on this critical national security issue. We are not always faced with situations in which our moral obligation and our strategic priorities lead to the same conclusion, but this is one of those rare moments. May it be said of us years from now, just as President Kennedy said, that we do our duty to continue to be the key-stone in the arch of freedom, including helping the Syrian people, especially her children, be free of Assad’s bru-tality and bombing.

NORTHERN KENTUCKY UNIVERSITY’S FOUNDERS DAY Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, it is my privilege to highlight the 50th anni-versary of the founding of Northern Kentucky University, NKU. I am proud to join with NKU’s more than 14,000 students, its faculty and staff, and its supporters in marking the history of the institution. As northern Kentucky was previously the only region in the State without a traditional public university, many students lacked the opportunity to at-tend a local 4-year institution of higher education that students in other re-gions of Kentucky enjoyed. In re-sponse, a bipartisan group of State leg-islators from the region worked with Kentucky Governor Louie B. Nunn to establish a new school in 1968. Origi-nally named Northern Kentucky State College, the school proved to be an at-tractive option for local students from the region. Less than a decade later, as the campus continued to expand its programs and services to accommodate a growing student population, the school became a university, changing its name to Northern Kentucky Uni-versity, NKU. Since that time, NKU has continued to thrive, adding more undergraduate, graduate, and even doc-toral programs, which have attracted a broader base of students to the univer-sity. These advancements, coupled with the region’s population growth and economic development, have been an immense benefit to Northern Ken-tucky. NKU has also expanded athletic op-portunities for its students and has built a number of strong teams. Having dominated NCAA Division II play with two women’s basketball national championships and one men’s soccer national championship, the Norse re-cently transitioned into NCAA Divi-sion I. With this new reclassification, the Norse teams have continued to excel. Winning the Horizon League tournament last year, the men’s bas-ketball team earned their first trip to the NCAA Division I tournament. This year, the team’s hard work earned their title as the Horizon League’s reg-ular season champions. In addition, the Norse have many other impressive teams and dedicated fans. On its golden anniversary, NKU has so much to be proud of. Under the lead-ership of Interim President Gerard St. Amand, the school continues to grow in both size and prominence. It has ma-tured into a comprehensive university that delivers innovative, student-cen-tered education and engages in impactful scholarly and creative en-deavors, all of which empower its grad-uates to have fulfilling careers and meaningful lives. With successful alumni who have en-tered a wide range of careers, from gov-ernment leaders to entrepreneurs, to artists, and to coaches, NKU has helped more than 60,000 students achieve their dreams. For a half century, NKU has had a tremendous impact on the eco-nomic, civic, and social vitality of the region, and all Kentuckians are bene-fiting from having such an outstanding higher education institution in our Commonwealth. I would like to con-gratulate the entire Northern Ken-tucky University community on reach-ing this Founders Day milestone, and I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in recognizing its accomplishments.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO CAITLIN ‘‘KATIE’’ BRAND AND RECOGNIZING UCWIP ∑Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the Uni-Capitol Wash-ington Internship Programme, UCWIP. Our Nation has benefited from the service of outstanding Australian col-lege students who participate in in-ternships throughout the U.S. Congress through this program. The program provides students with the opportunity to obtain considerable experience through their congressional internships, while also making avail-able other educational experiences throughout their time in the U.S. Uni- Capitol Washington Programme in-terns have helped me serve Idaho con-stituents, and I am grateful for their efforts and dedication. Caitlin ‘‘Katie’’ Brand, a UCWIP par-ticipant, joined my staff as an intern this semester. Katie is studying a dou-ble bachelor of commerce, accounting, and law with a diploma of languages, Mandarin, at Monash University. Upon completion of her degree, Katie intends to pursue a career in either the inter-national relations, finance, or banking fields. Katie has been a pleasure to have on my staff and quickly adapted to her role and responsibilities in the office. Her eager and intelligent de-meanor have allowed Katie to put forth her best work in helping to advance crucial work for Idahoans. I commend the level of professionalism Katie ex-hibits in every office interaction. She has shared with us some of the polit-ical and cultural differences between the U.S. and Australia, and it has been a great learning experience for both Katie and the staff. ‘‘Being part of the UCWIP program and working in Senator Mike Crapo’s office was an invaluable experience,’’ Katie has said about her experiences in Washington. ‘‘The opportunity has af-forded me unparalleled insight into the world’s foremost legislative body and enriched my professional development, including opportunities beyond what I imagined, such as attending the State of the Union as the Senator’s guest. I want to wholeheartedly thank Senator Crapo and the staff in Senator Crapo’s office who have made my internship so enjoyable and educational.’’ Eric Federing, UCWIP’s director and founder, has successfully focused his Capitol Hill and Australia experiences to provide this valuable educational exchange opportunity that benefits Australian students and congressional offices. His dedication to advancing this learning experience is remarkable. I have been honored to have worked with the Uni-Capitol Washington In-ternship Programme for several years. The program is shaping young leaders who are helping to deepen under-standing between our two nations while providing outstanding con-stituent support. I commend Katie Brand, Eric Federing, and the other Uni-Capitol Washington Internship Programme participants and interns for their achievements and wish them continued success.∑

TRIBUTE TO IRMA CLOUGH ∑Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize the very spe-cial occasion of the 100th birthday of Mrs. Irma Clough, which occurred on February 18, 2018. Born in 1918, Irma has lived in Bath, NH, for the majority of her life. Irma’s friends describe her as an independent spirit with a great sense of humor. She loves wildlife, playing cards and dominos, and keeping up with basketball games. As a young woman, she cleaned people’s houses to help support her family. While working as a cook at the Village Bath School, Irma was well known for her baking skills. Irma is a dedicated member of the Bath Congregational Church where she has sung in the choir and served as the church treasurer. Twenty-three years ago, Irma started the annual Fall Foli-age Festival in her town. She has also been a member of Pine Grove Grange for over 85 years and continues to serve as their treasurer. Irma and her husband, Edwin Clough, who passed away in 1993, were married for 45 years. Together they raised three children, and now, Irma has 8 grand-children and 10 great-grandchildren. I hope everyone joins me in wishing an accomplished and well-loved Gran-ite Stater, Irma Clough, a very happy 100th birthday.∑

TRIBUTE TO KATERI CALLAHAN ∑Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I want to recognize the leadership of Kateri Callahan, who has served as president of the Alliance to Save En-ergy since 2004. As the honorary chair of the alliance, I have been a firsthand witness to many of Kateri’s most re-cent accomplishments. Before Kateri starts the next chapter of her career, I want take this opportunity to look back upon her 14 years with the alli-ance and thank her for her contribu-tions to Federal energy-efficiency pol-icy. In 1977, Senators Charles Percy and Hubert Humphrey—a Republican from Illinois and a Democrat from Min-nesota—founded the alliance as the leading energy-efficiency coalition of businesses, governments, environ-mental groups, and consumer advo-cates. The goal of the Alliance from the start has been simple: ‘‘Use less and do more.’’ In the wake of the oil embargoes and energy shortages of the 1970s, that message resonated loud and clear, and it still does. Energy efficiency saves money, im-proves national security, reduces pollu-tion, encourages innovation, boosts U.S. competitiveness, and creates jobs. Without the economywide improve-ments in energy efficiency made since 1973, it is estimated that today’s econ-omy would require 60 percent more en-ergy than we consume now. In fact, savings from energy-efficiency im-provements over the last 40 years have reduced our national energy bill by an estimated $800 billion, all while grow-ing and expanding our economy. Since its establishment, the alliance has taken great care to cultivate and maintain bipartisan support for poli-cies supporting energy efficiency. While doing so, the organization has been led by a distinguished groups of energy efficiency thought-leaders and advocates like Kateri. For my colleagues who have not met Kateri, you need to know she is per-sistent and tenacious. Once she gets ahold of something, believe me she never lets go and sees it through to the end. I am thankful for Kateri’s leader-ship, and on behalf of my House and Senate colleagues who are also part of the alliance, I am thankful for the coa-lition’s support for my proposals over the years. Highlights abound during Kateri’s tenure at the alliance. She was a key negotiator on many of the most impactful energy-efficiency provisions of the 2005 and 2007 energy bills that passed Congress with strong bipartisan support and were signed into law by President George W. Bush. She helped ensure that the 2009 stimulus package provided significant investments in en-ergy efficiency and encouraged states to adopt updated building energy codes. In 2015, she stood with me and my colleagues, Senator ROBPORTMAN  and Representatives D
AVID MCKINLEY  and P
ETER WELCH , as President Barack Obama signed our bipartisan and bi-cameral bill, the Energy Efficiency Im-provement Act, which was the first sig-nificant energy-efficiency legislation to pass Congress in nearly a decade. In addition to her work in Wash-ington, Kateri has spurred initiatives to connect directly with energy con-sumers and educate the public about

the economic and environmental op-portunities of energy efficiency. She produced a series of award-winning consumer education campaigns, includ-ing the Power is in Your Hands, Energy Hog, Drive$marter, LUMEN, and Six Degrees of Energy Efficiency. She also led the establishment of the Southeast Energy Efficiency Alliance to ensure that American families and businesses in the southeastern States have the knowledge, resources, and opportuni-ties to optimize energy use. The alliance’s reach does not stop at our borders. Under the leadership of Kateri, the alliance created the Euro-pean Alliance to Save Energy and es-tablished EE Global, the world’s pre-mier gathering of energy-efficiency leaders to discuss new ideas and chart new paths to do more by using less. Serving 14 years as president of an organization like the alliance is its own commendable accomplishment, but Kateri has had a more profound and positive impact on Federal energy- efficiency policy than can be counted just in years. I congratulate Kateri and express sincere thanks for her support over the years. I wish her the best in her future pursuits and good health and good luck. Thank you.∑

ETERS ): S. 2495. A bill to reauthorize the grant program for school security in the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968; to the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, 1 week ago today I stood here and urged my colleagues on both the left and the right to lay aside their differences and work together to prevent future trage-dies like that in Parkland, FL. It has been nearly 3 weeks since the murder of 17 students and staff at Mar-jory Stoneman Douglas High School. While time will continue to march on, our resolve to do something about school violence must grow only strong-er. Over the past 3 weeks my colleagues have put forth a number of legislative proposals. Some are recycled versions of earlier proposals, while others pro-pose creative new ideas. Some enjoy broad bipartisan support, while others have not been widely embraced. We have seen much discussion and debate but little legislative progress. To break the impasse, we must unite on the issues where we agree. Let today be the day that we come together to take a meaningful step to-ward legislation that has the potential to prevent school gun violence, save lives, and restore the sense of peace and security that all children should enjoy when they walk through the doors of their respective schools. Today I come together with my part-ners on both sides of the aisle to intro-duce the Students, Teachers, and Offi-cers Preventing School Violence Act, or STOP School Violence Act. As I out-lined on the Senate floor last week, the bill will make Department of Justice grants available to fund four initia-tives. Last week I outlined those four initiatives, and today I would like to describe them in even greater detail. First, the bill will provide grants to be used for evidence-based training to prevent student violence against others and self, including training for local law enforcement officers, school per-sonnel, and students. One kind of training this bill would fund could prevent many incidents of school violence. Over the last 25 years, research has revealed that in 7 out of 10 acts of gun violence, a friend or some-one else was told that an act of vio-lence would be committed before it happened. In one study, it was reported that in four out of five school shoot-ings, the attacker had told people of his plans ahead of time. We must ensure that everyone in the school ecosystem is educated to recog-nize the signs of a potential threat and likewise—students, teachers, and ad-ministrators—take action and follow up when they see warning signs. By building a culture in which students and teachers understand the impor-tance of reporting possible threats of violence, this bill will save lives and help keep our communities safe. Second, the bill will fund evidence- based technology and equipment to im-prove school security and prevent school violence. After the shooting at Columbine High School nearly 19 years ago, I au-thored legislation that made Depart-ment of Justice grant funds available for metal detectors, locks, lighting, and other deterrent measures. The Se-cure Our Schools Program, which ran from 2002 through 2011, was the only Federal school safety program that ex-clusively provided direct funding for the purchase and implementation of se-curity technologies to improve school safety. The legislation I am intro-ducing today will reauthorize and build on that program to provide funding for proven school security infrastructure improvements consistent with schools’ individualized needs and industry best practices. While we certainly don’t need to turn our schools into for-tresses, we must do more to protect our children from harm. Third, the bill will provide funding for the development and operation of evidence-based school threat assess-ment and crisis intervention teams, which may include evidence-based training for school officials in respond-ing to mental health crises. These mul-tidisciplinary teams—based on existing staff of school personnel, administra-tors, law enforcement, and mental health professionals—can implement proven, evidence-based approaches like the Virginia Student Threat Assess-ment Guidelines. These guidelines, which have been documented to be ef-fective in field tests and controlled studies, provide schools with a safe, structured, and efficient way to re-spond to student threats of violence. Used at thousands of schools across the country, these are the types of proactive, preventive solutions that should be available for all schools. Fourth, the bill will authorize fund-ing for continued coordination with local law enforcement. These four initiatives do not operate in isolation but together are a com-prehensive approach to improving school security and reducing student violence. Training students and teach-ers to identify and report warning signs is critical to stopping acts of school violence before they happen. As we saw in Parkland, having folks identify warning signs is not enough. There must be a process for acting on this information when it is brought to the attention of school administrators or law enforcement officials. The school threat assessment and crisis intervention teams that could be fund-ed through this bill will ensure that schools have an effective procedure for evaluating and responding to potential threats of school violence. Unfortunately, no amount of preven-tion will ever be able to stop every act of school violence before it happens. For those hopefully rare instances where we cannot intervene ahead of time, this bill ensures that funding is available to assist schools with com-monsense security infrastructure im-provements to harden schools and make it more difficult for attackers to succeed. Through each step of this process, local law enforcement has an important role to play in partnering with school personnel to prevent and respond to incidents of school violence. States are already taking the lead in these areas to ensure that our schools are safe and secure. Last week I high-lighted the Safe Utah smartphone app, a statewide service that provides real- time crisis intervention to youth through texting and a confidential tip program. Since the app was unveiled in 2016, 86 planned school attacks have been stopped. Utah and other States across the country are rolling out prov-en solutions that prevent and reduce student violence. We must respect the leading role of the States in this space, and we must do what we can to ensure that proven, evidence-based solutions are available to protect all students nationwide. The STOP School Violence Act will com-plement and magnify those efforts at the State and local level. With a re-quirement that States and localities contribute to the cost of these pro-grams, my bill will authorize $75 mil-lion in fiscal year 2018 and $100 million

each year for the following 10 years. In total, that is more than $1 billion to se-cure our schools and train our stu-dents, teachers, and law enforcement. Many of my colleagues have called for reforms and restrictions related to firearms—something this bill does not address. Those are important discus-sions, and I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on these and other issues. In the meantime, we need to work with what we have, and what we have in the STOP School Vio-lence Act is good, commonsense legis-lation that can save hundreds of lives. I will not pretend that my bill is a catch-all solution to the problem of school violence. It is not, but it is a start. Indeed, this bipartisan proposal is the catalyst to a critical conversa-tion that will take place in the weeks and months to come. For far too long, we have allowed pol-itics to get in the way of real reform. For far too long, we have been holed up in our partisan foxholes, ducking the difficult issues of the day in hopes that the problem of school violence would solve itself. For far too long, we have clung to our rhetorical weapons, but now is the time to lay those weapons aside. Now is the time to reconcile our differences for the good of our Nation and for the good of our children. As I said last week, now is not the time for argument but for action. Rather than letting the perfect be the enemy of the good, I implore my friends on both sides of the aisle to come together for the safety of our children. Rather than resorting to re-cycled talking points, I ask my col-leagues to heed minority leader S
CHU-
MER’Scall to ‘‘pass real legislation that makes a difference.’’ I thought that was a good statement. Mr. President, I wish to emphasize the singularity of the opportunity we have in front of us. My bill represents a respite from the anger and acrimony that far too often pervade our politics. It is a symbol of the great good we can accomplish when we come together in common cause. Already, dozens of my colleagues from both the left and the right have signed on to support this bill. The STOP Act is just the start we need to prevent violence in our schools, so let’s come together to get this done, and I hope we can.

RUSSIA INVESTIGATION BY SPECIAL COUNSEL MUELLER Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I restate my support for the investigations by Robert Mueller into Russia’s election interference, as well as to condemn the partisan attacks on the independent in-vestigation being led by Robert Mueller, who has been an honorable public servant over many decades. In 2016, our Nation came under at-tack by a hostile foreign power. Every-one knows that now. Our election proc-ess—the bedrock of our system of gov-ernment—was targeted by Russian agents. They used a variety of meas-ures to pursue their goals. The intel-ligence community’s unclassified re-port concluded: 
We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election. Rus-sia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Sec-retary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government devel-oped a clear preference for President-elect Trump. 
That is from the unclassified report of our intelligence community. These brazen and illegal actions have already resulted in the indictments of 13 Russian individuals and three Rus-sian companies as part of Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation. Russia may not have used traditional military force against us, but the ac-tions they took present just as serious a threat to our national security. Make no mistake, when a foreign adversary targets an American election, it has targeted America, itself. Yet the Presi-dent, whose own campaign is being ex-amined as part of the Russia investiga-tion, has refused to enforce sanctions against Russia. He has refused to fight back against Putin and his regime, de-spite there being clear evidence that they attacked us. The President’s fail-ure to take action against Russia un-derscores the urgent need for Special Counsel Mueller’s independent inves-tigation to continue unfettered. In this investigation, Mr. Mueller has already amassed enough evidence to have a grand jury indict Russian operatives and high-ranking members of the Trump campaign, including former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and deputy campaign man-ager Rick Gates. Other Trump advis-ers, like Mr. Papadopoulos and Michael Flynn, have pled guilty to Federal crimes. Unfortunately, as this evidence has come forward, unwarranted, dangerous, and partisan attacks on Mr. Mueller’s investigation and on Mr. Mueller, him-self, have accelerated; yet a brief glance at Mr. Mueller’s lifetime of service reflects his commitment to serving the American people with honor, integrity, and courage that, I think, is unmatched by anyone I know in Washington. Here are a couple of ex-amples. As a young man, Mr. Mueller served with distinction in the Vietnam war and was awarded a Bronze Star, two Navy Commendation Medals, the Pur-ple Heart, and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry for his leadership and exem-plary service. Mr. Mueller received the Bronze Star for his ‘‘heroic achievement’’ after leading his fellow marines through an 8-hour battle, where, under enemy fire, ‘‘Second Lieutenant Mueller fearlessly moved from one position to another, directing the accurate counterfire of his men and shouting words of encour-agement to them. . . . [H]e then skill-fully supervised the evacuation of cas-ualties from the hazardous fire area.’’ After that battle, he was promoted to first lieutenant. Just 4 months later, he sustained a bullet wound when he responded to an ambush by enemy forces on marines who were in his command. For his he-roic response, Mr. Mueller received the Navy Commendation Medal with a ci-tation praising him for rushing to save his fellow marines while ‘‘completely disregarding his own safety.’’ I will give a recitation of some of the record that Special Counsel Mueller de-veloped long before he was named to this position. I was going through his actions as a marine in combat, and I have a few more parts of his record to review. Mr. Mueller not only fought coura-geously on the battlefield, but upon re-turning home earned his law degree. He continued serving his country through-out his legal career. After serving in U.S. attorney’s of-fices in both Boston and San Francisco for over a decade, he later served at the Justice Department leading the Crimi-nal Division of the Justice Department under President George H.W. Bush. There he oversaw cases ranging from the prosecution of the Panamanian dic-tator, Manuel Noriega, to the Lockerbie bombing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES1342 March 5, 2018 
In 1995, Mr. Mueller left a high-pay-ing position in the private sector to join the DC U.S. attorney’s office—in this case, the Homicide Division— working to hold violent offenders ac-countable for their crimes. Three years later, he became a U.S. attorney himself, serving again in San Francisco and earning a reputation as a dogged and fair prosecutor com-mitted to enforcing the rule of law. In 2001, Mr. Mueller was nominated by a second Republican President, President George W. Bush, to be the Director of the FBI. He was then con-firmed unanimously by this body. His tenure at the FBI included leading the response to the September 11 attacks, spearheading the Bureau’s efforts to combat cyber crime, which has been widely praised. In fact, in 2011, when his 10-year term was scheduled to end, we in the Senate voted 100 to 0 to ex-tend his term as FBI Director through 2013, another 10 years. Though our political system has be-come more polarized, each time Mr. Mueller has been named or nominated for a new position, he has received un-qualified praise from people across the political spectrum and rightly so. With Mr. Mueller’s record as a war hero, a dedicated public servant, and an expert in law enforcement, it is hard to imagine anyone better suited to lead the investigation into Russian inter-ference in the 2016 election. There is no one in Washington, DC, or, frankly, in all of America better prepared to do this job. Serious congressional oversight of executive branch operations is always appropriate. However, the reckless par-tisan attacks on Mr. Mueller’s inves-tigation and on Mr. Mueller himself are not the same as congressional over-sight. Such attacks have made us less safe as a nation. The political smears like those we have seen undermine our rule of law and strike at the heart of our democracy. They are a disservice to the brave men and women in law en-forcement who put their lives on the line to keep all of us safe. As Members of the U.S. Congress, we have a duty to uphold the rule of law and the principles of fairness and inde-pendence that American democracy is built upon. I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to defend the integrity of Mr. Mueller’s investigation and reject the politically motivated attempts to discredit the investigation and its un-derlying conclusions. I call on the House and Senate majority to give us a vote on legislation to protect Special Counsel Mueller’s independence and en-sure that he can continue his inves-tigation free from interference. To ensure the integrity of our elec-tions and our democracy, we must make sure we never allow a hostile for-eign power to interfere in our electoral process again, and to do that we must allow the special counsel to get to the bottom of what Russia did in 2016 and whether it was aided by American indi-viduals. That is what the whole inves-tigation is about—those two parts. History, of course, will be our judge. We will be judged about how we han-dled this crisis. We know that in 1787, when the Constitutional Convention had just adjourned, Benjamin Franklin was asked what kind of government the Convention had chosen for our young nation. He responded that the Convention has given us ‘‘[a] Republic, if you can keep it.’’ Democratic principles are only as strong as those elected to uphold them. I hope my colleagues will stand to-gether and stand strong to preserve the rule of law and the institutions of this Republic we have been given, and we must ‘‘keep it,’’ as Franklin said. I yield the floor.

COMMEMORATING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF DONALD W. LEMKA 
HON. LAMAR SMITH 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 5, 2018 Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today we commemorate the life and service of Super-visory Special Agent Donald W. Lemka (Don) who passed away at the young age of 41 late last year after a valiant battle with cancer. He is survived by his wife, Tracey, and daughter, Madison Bridges. Don served his country in the U.S. Marine Corps where his assignments included work on Marine One as Crew Chief and at three U.S. embassies. He then continued his service to our country as a special agent at the Fed-eral Bureau of Investigation. Don’s first office assignment was at the San Antonio Field Of-fice’s Resident Agency in Austin, Texas, where he worked until 2015. Given the confidential nature of his work, many of his accomplishments cannot be made public. The people of South and Central Texas are more secure today because of honorable Americans like Don who protect them from global and domestic threats they are often not aware of. We owe Don a debt of gratitude for a life well lived in service to his country.

RECOGNIZING THE 83RD ANNUAL FLORIDA STRAWBERRY FESTIVAL 
HON. DENNIS A. ROSS 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 5, 2018 Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 83rd Annual Florida Strawberry Festival in Plant City, Florida, an important celebration in my district. Plant City, Florida, is recognized as the Winter Strawberry Capital of the World, and the state of Florida is the second largest strawberry producing state in the United States, with more than 10,000 acres of straw-berries planted annually. The Florida Strawberry Festival serves to bring the community together to celebrate the agricultural and historical legacy of the Florida strawberry. The festival is scheduled to take place over eleven days this year, and has pro-vided family-friendly fun since 1930 and wel-comes over 500,000 visitors from across the country to enjoy musical concerts, agricultural exhibits, parades, youth developmental pro-grams, other forms of entertainment, and deli-cious strawberry treats. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to recognize this treasured community tradition that has brought together countless participants, volun-teers, and sponsors. I thank all of those who have given their time and resources to make the Florida Strawberry Festival such a cher-ished tradition in our community. OATH OF CITIZENSHIP ON MARCH 9, 2018 HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 5, 2018 Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure and sincerity that I take this time to congratulate twenty-five individuals who will take their oaths of citizenship on March 9, 2018. This memorable occasion will be held at the United States Courthouse and Federal Building in Hammond, Indiana. America is a country founded by immi-grants. From its beginning, settlers have come from countries around the world to the United States in search of better lives for their fami-lies. Oath ceremonies are a shining example of what is so great about the United States of America—that people from all over the world can come together and unite as members of a free, democratic nation. These individuals realize that nowhere else in the world offers a better opportunity for success than here in America. On March 9, 2018, the following people, representing many nations throughout the world, will take their oaths of citizenship in Hammond, Indiana: Domingo Virruete, Berna-dette Augustynski, Haroldas Vysniauskas, Jose Otoniel Campos, Maria Georgina Rivera, Jorge Robles, Humberto Morales Jr., Ernestina Caro, Omar Awad Sobih, Maria Francisca Aguliar, Katie Rizhkov, Haneen Mo-hammad Al-Zeer, Rania Shwqi Abudayyeh, Christine Nasr Mousa, Tannya Marisa Viramontes, Paul Alejandro Beltran, Jimmy Trang, Lissette Jesus Sayan Thompson, George Gonzalez, Luis Alberto Salazar, Ana M. Ramirez, Hina Naz Chaudhry, Beth Wanjiru Kavolu, Said Saad, and Karoline R. Stiglich. Although each individual has sought to be-come a citizen of the United States for his or her own reasons, be it for education, occupa-tion, or to offer their loved ones better lives, each is inspired by the fact that the United States of America is, as Abraham Lincoln de-scribed it, a country ‘‘. . . of the people, by the people, and for the people.’’ They realize that the United States is truly a free nation. By seeking American citizenship, they have made the decision that they want to live in a place where, as guaranteed by the First Amendment of the Constitution, they can practice religion as they choose, speak their minds without fear of punishment, and assemble in peaceful pro-test should they choose to do so. Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating these individuals who will be-come citizens of the United States of America on March 9, 2018. They, too, are American citizens, guaranteed the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We, as a free and democratic nation, congratulate them and welcome them. RECOGNIZING NACDS RXIMPACT DAY HON. MARKWAYNE MULLIN 
OF OKLAHOMA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 5, 2018 Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recog-nize the Tenth Annual NACDS RxIMPACT Day on Capitol Hill. This is a special day where we will have the chance to recognize pharmacy’s many contributions to the Amer-ican health care system. Organized by the National Association of Chain Drug Stores (NACDS) for the past dec-ade, this event will take place March 7–8, 2018. This year alone, more than 400 individ-uals from the pharmacy community—including practicing pharmacists, pharmacy school fac-ulty and students, state pharmacy association representatives and pharmacy company lead-ers—will visit us here on Capitol Hill. Advo-cates from all 50 states will share their views with us about the importance of supporting their access agenda—legislative priorities that will ensure that our constituents will continue to have access to more than 40,000 commu-nity and neighborhood pharmacies across the country and be better able to utilize phar-macists to improve health care quality while reducing the cost of care. Patients have always relied on their local pharmacist to meet their health care needs and we as policymakers know our local phar-macists to be important community leaders. They are trusted, highly accessible health care providers deeply committed to providing high quality, convenient, and efficient health care services. As demand for health care services con-tinues to grow, pharmacists have expanded their role in health care delivery, partnering with physicians, nurses and other health care providers to meet their patients’ needs. Inno-vative services provided by pharmacists do even more to improve overall patient health and wellness. Pharmacists are highly valued by those that rely on them most—those in rural and under-served areas, as well as older Americans, and those struggling to manage chronic diseases. Pharmacy services improve patients’ quality of life as well as health care affordability. By helping patients take their medications effec-tively and providing preventive services, phar-macists help avoid more costly forms of care. Pharmacists also help patients identify strate-gies to save money, such as through better understanding of their pharmacy benefits, using generic medications, and obtaining 90- day supplies of prescription drugs from local pharmacies. Pharmacists are the nation’s most acces-sible health care providers. In many commu-nities, especially in rural areas, the local phar-macist is a patient’s most direct link to health care. Utilizing their specialized education, pharmacists play a major role in medication therapy management, disease-state manage-ment, immunizations, health care screenings,

and other health care services designed to im-prove patient health and reduce overall health care costs. Pharmacists are also expanding their role into new models of care based on quality of services and outcomes, such as ac-countable care organizations (ACOs) and medical homes. The pharmacy advocates of NACDS RxIMPACT Day on Capitol Hill will be pro-moting an access agenda. They know that we face difficult debates about the future of health care and the pharmacy community wishes to work with us to help in the effort to develop comprehensive and consistent approaches to public policy that put pharmacy’s value to work for patients and payers. They understand well that the issues we are debating today are highly connected and vital to pharmacy, to all of health care, and to society as a whole. I believe Congress should look at every op-portunity to make sure that pharmacists are al-lowed to utilize their training to the fullest to provide the services that can improve care, in-crease access and lower costs. In recognition of the Tenth Annual NACDS RxIMPACT Day on Capitol Hill, I would like to congratulate pharmacy leaders, pharmacists, students, and the entire pharmacy community represented by NACDS, for their contributions to the health and wellness of the American people.

IN HONOR OF LOGAN GROSZ AND SEAMUS CASEY’S SELECTION AS WYOMING’S TOP YOUTH VOLUN-TEERS, AND SADIE HOGAN AND MICKAYLA VANNATTER AS DIS-TINGUISHED FINALISTS BY THE PRUDENTIAL SPIRIT OF COMMU-NITY AWARDS 
HON. LIZ CHENEY 
OF WYOMING  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 5, 2018 Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Logan Grosz and Seamus Casey for being honored as Wyoming’s top youth vol-unteers by the Prudential Spirit of Community Awards, and Sadie Hogan and Mickayla Vannatter for being recognized as Distin-guished Finalists. The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards is a nationwide program that recognizes four middle level and high school students from each state for their outstanding volunteerism. Each year, two students are selected as the State Honorees, and two as Distinguished Fi-nalists. This year’s honored students are com-mitted to service and to going above and be-yond for their communities. Logan Grosz was selected as the High School State Honoree for Wyoming for his dedication to supporting the Children’s Hos-pital Colorado. As a patient and its Champion for the State of Wyoming, he organizes and runs fundraisers that have raised over $7,500 for the hospital and its other patients. Seamus Casey is this year’s Middle Level State Honoree for his support of the Folds of Honor Foundation. Last summer, he designed and completed his own triathlon, raising $10,000 for the Foundation’s scholarships for family members of fallen or disabled service-men. Sadie Hogan was recognized as a Distin-guished Finalist for her leadership in a project that compiled and distributed sacks of food and toiletries to homeless members of her community. Mickayla Vannatter was recognized as a Distinguished Finalist for her program that en-courages children at her school to choose in-clusion over bullying. Again, Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend my congratulations to Logan, Seamus, Sadie, and Mickayla. They have set excellent exam-ples for their friends and families, and I appre-ciate all they do to support the great state of Wyoming and our great country. f 
GUN VIOLENCE 
SPEECH OF  
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, February 26, 2018 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the issue of gun violence in America. This Valentine’s Day, February 14, 2018, marked the thirtieth mass shooting in our country this year, when a mentally unstable 19-year-old opened fire on Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida with an AR–15 military style weapon, killing 17 indi-viduals and injuring 15 others. We extend our deepest sympathies to all those affected by this tragedy and recognize the skill and heroism of the law enforcement officers and first responders who came to the aid of others. We commend the efforts of those who are working to care for the injured and investigate this horrific incident. We extend our heartfelt condolences and prayers to the families of the fallen, and to all those affected in the community of Parkland, Florida and in the United States. The horrifying events in Parkland mark the 378th mass shooting in the U.S. since 2017, and the 30th this year, according to Gun Vio-lence Archive. Mass shootings are a near daily occurrence in America, but what happened in Las Vegas on October 1, 2017 stands out: It was the deadliest such incident in U.S. history, with more than 58 killed and 515 injured. A mass shooting is defined by Gun Violence Archive as any incident in which four or more are shot and/or killed in a single event, at the same general time and location not including the shooter. Recent U.S. mass shootings include: Las Vegas, 2017: 58 killed; 515 wounded Orlando, 2016: 50 killed Virginia Tech, 2007: 32 killed Sandy Hook, 2012: 27 killed San Ysirdo, 1984: 21 killed San Bernadino, 2015: 14 killed Edmond, 1986: 14 killed Fort Hood, 2009: 13 killed Columbine, 1999: 13 killed Charleston, 2015: 9 killed There were more than 11,600 deaths linked to gun violence in 2017, which is roughly equivalent to nearly four 9/11 attacks in terms of the total number killed on September 11, 2001. Comparatively, more than 15 thousand were killed by gun violence in 2016, and there were 383 mass shootings. It is horrifying to admit that gun violence now seems to be a staple of American life. The United States ranks No. 1 in the world in terms of firearms per capita—with 88.8 guns per 100 people—and it has the highest homicide-by-firearm rate in the developed world. The problem is so endemic that gun vio-lence is now the third leading cause of death for children in the U.S. An average of 1,297 children die annually from gun-related injuries. Guns are linked to roughly 33 thousand deaths in the U.S. per year; about two-thirds of them are suicides. According to Pew Research Center, a ma-jority of Americans (across partisan lines) sup-port gun policy proposals such as barring peo-ple with mental illnesses from buying guns; prohibiting gun purchases by people on fed-eral no-fly or watch lists; and background checks for private gun sales and sales at gun shows. America has six times as many firearm homicides as Canada, and nearly 16 times as many as Germany. United Nations data shows that America far and away leads other developed countries when it comes to gun-related homicides. America has 4.4 percent of the world’s pop-ulation, but almost half of the civilian-owned guns around the world. In December 2012, a gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 20 children, six adults, and himself. Since then, there have been at least 1,518 mass shootings, with at least 1,715 people killed and 6,089 wounded. The fairly broad definition of ‘‘mass shoot-ing’’ includes not only shootings in which four or more people were murdered, but shootings in which four or more people were shot at all (excluding the shooter). Even under this broad definition, mass shootings make up a tiny portion of America’s firearm deaths, which totaled more than 33,000 in 2014. On average, there is more than one mass shooting for each day in America. Whenever a mass shooting occurs, sup-porters of gun rights often argue that it is inap-propriate to bring up political debates about gun control in the aftermath of a tragedy. For example, former Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, a strong supporter of gun rights, criticized former President Barack Obama for ‘‘trying to score cheap political points’’ when Obama mentioned gun control after a mass shooting in Charleston, South Carolina. But if this argument is followed to its logical end, then it will never be the right time to dis-cuss mass shootings. Under the-broader definition of mass shoot-ings, America has nearly one mass shooting a day. So if Congress is forced to wait for a time when there is not a mass shooting to talk gun control, Congress could find itself waiting for a very long time. The time for responding to mass shootings with thoughts and prayers has long since passed. The time for responding with effective legis-lation is now. I have called upon this Administration to se-cure the passage of H.R. 4268, the ‘‘Gun Safety Not Sorry Act,’’ legislation I have intro-duced that would impose a 7-day waiting, or ‘‘cooling off,’’ period prior to the purchase or

transfer of ownership of a semiautomatic fire-arm, silencers, armor piercing ammunition, or large capacity ammunition magazines. According to Newsweek, the ‘‘Gun Safety Not Sorry Act’’ is the No. 1 legislative proposal that Congress can and should pass right now. The majority must cut its close ties to the powerful gun lobby to facilitate useful gun con-trol legislation necessary immediately. The ‘‘Gun Safety Not Sorry Act will not abridge the Second Amendment, it will not take away gun rights, and it does not impose greater restrictions on gun ownership—it will not stop all mass shootings but it will certainly help. In the wake of the horrific Valentine’s Day mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, the emboldened survivors of the high school shooting are calling for immediate gun reform. States with tighter gun control laws have fewer gun-related deaths. I will soon introduce legislation to keep our children safe from mass shootings: the ‘‘No More Atrocities with Guns Act’’ (No MAGA Act) raises the minimum age from 18 to 21 for a person to purchase or possess semi-auto-matic assault weapons. Teenagers, whose brains are not yet fully developed should not yet be entrusted with a weapon that is designed to inflict maximum damage in minimum time. Americans cannot understand how it is le-gally possible for a 19-year-old mentally unsta-ble person to purchase such a highly lethal weapon such as the AR–15 assault rifle and then use that weapon to slaughter 17 high school students. Although Americans say they want to pro-tect the right to bear arms, they are very much supportive of many gun policy proposals—in-cluding some fairly contentious ideas, such as more background checks on private and gun show sales and banning semi-automatic and assault-style weapons. Mass shootings occur more frequently in states that do not require background checks for all gun sales. Analyses of mass shootings in the United States between 2009 and 2015 document that the majority of mass shootings occur in venues where the carrying of firearm is not re-stricted. In states that require background checks for all handgun sales, including guns offered in unlicensed sales online and at gun shows, there are 52 percent fewer mass shootings. Congress must take action to prevent other incidents such as the recent act of terror and hatred in Parkland, Florida that resulted in the tragic loss of 17 innocent lives. There have been 32 moments of silence ob-served on the House Floor related to Gun Vio-lence since 2012. The time for moments of silence has long since passed. The American people are demanding mo-ments of action. I pledge to continue to work to reduce gun violence and prevent mass shootings. HONORING THE LIFE OF MARCUS RASKIN 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 5, 2018 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life of a strong voice in the progressive movement, and a great mentor and friend, Marcus Raskin. Marcus’ excep-tional work as a national security staffer, polit-ical theorist, and progressive thought leader has deeply shaped our nation’s consciousness about war, economic inequality, and civil rights. Born in 1934 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Marcus initially pursued a career as a pianist, before changing direction and studying law and policy at the University of Chicago. After attaining his law degree, Marcus moved to Washington D.C. and became a staffer for Representatives Robert W. Kastenmeier & James Roosevelt. He quickly distinguished himself as a lead-ing voice of liberal thought, and was hired as staff on the National Security Council by Presi-dent Kennedy’s National Security Advisor, McGeorge Bundy. He also later served in the Bureau of the Budget (now the Office of Man-agement and Budget), and the Presidential Panel on Education. Following his service in the Kennedy Admin-istration, Raskin formed the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) along with Richard Barnet. As a progressive policy think-tank, IPS was the first of its kind. To this day, the institute remains committed to economic and racial justice, cli-mate justice, peace and foreign policy, com-munity engagement, and leadership develop-ment. Marcus also played a pivotal role in the re-lease of the Pentagon Papers during the Nixon Administration. His criticisms of the Viet-nam War and American military policy led to Daniel Ellsberg noticing Marcus and relying on his help to get the leaked documents to re-porters at the New York Times. This initiated a watershed moment in our country’s history about the need for transparency and account-ability in government. I first met Marcus Raskin, during the mid- 1970’s, while I worked on Capitol Hill for Con-gressman Ron Dellums, and I am grateful to him for his wise counsel over the years. Marcus was one of the first to congratulate me on my election to Congress, and acted as a reassuring confidant as I considered my vote against the overly broad 2001 authorization to use military force. Marcus Raskin passed on December 24, 2017, and is survived by his wife, Lynn, and his children Erika, Eden, Noah, and my col-league in Congress—J
AMIE. Today, on behalf of California’s 13th Con-gressional District, it is my honor to commend Marcus Raskin for his moral leadership and to thank him for his mentorship. I cherish my time serving alongside his son, Representative J
AMIE RASKIN of Maryland’s 8th Congressional District and wish my sincere condolences to the rest of his surviving family. THE INVALUABLE HELP OF ANDY IGREJAS IN STRENGTHENING THE LAUTENBERG TSCA RE-FORM ACT HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 5, 2018 Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recog-nize the outstanding contributions Andy Igrejas has made in improving the lives of the Amer-ican people through his tireless advocacy and expertise in reducing public exposure to harm-ful chemicals. A native of Bloomfield, New Jersey and a proud graduate of Rutgers College, Andy has worked on environmental health and govern-ment reform issues in New Jersey, California, and Washington, D.C. over his decades of service. Every day, we see the steps the Environ-mental Protection Agency is taking to imple-ment the Lautenberg TSCA Reform law passed in 2016. While that implementation is so far not living up to the letter of the law, we will continue to work to hold the EPA account-able for meeting its essential duty under the law: removing toxic chemicals from commerce and from our homes. We are only able to do this because of im-portant changes that were made in the Lau-tenberg Act as it went through Congress— changes that came about because of Andy’s tireless work and dedication as Executive Di-rector of the Safer Chemicals Healthy Families Coalition. The work to reform the Toxic Substances Control Act began in earnest in 2009, when the major stakeholders published principles for reform. It was that year that Andy organized the Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families coali-tion to create a unified voice for health, envi-ronmental, and labor organizations interested in advancing chemical policy reform. With Andy as its director, the coalition has grown to include 450 organizations and small businesses from across the country and across the political spectrum. By unifying these groups, Andy made their voices strong-er, strong enough to stand up to extraordinary expenditures from industry interests. Andy’s work also kept the interest in TSCA reform alive when negotiating a deal seemed impossible. Andy’s appreciation for the role of entrepreneurship and the private sector in cre-ating positive social change led to the coali-tion’s decision to launch Mind the Store, an initiative challenging the nation’s largest retail-ers to restrict hazardous chemicals in their supply chains. It was that effort at the retail level, along with legislative efforts in the states, which kept industry at the table pur-suing a comprehensive federal program. I want to thank Andy for his bold thinking, tireless efforts, and strategic counsel to me and my staff, without which many of the public health and environmental improvements in the Lautenberg TSCA reform law would not have been possible.

SPECIAL OLYMPIAN, ‘‘BEEBO’’ 
HON. TED POE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 5, 2018 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, once Brendan West picked up a basketball, he was never able to put it down. Nicknamed ‘‘Beebo,’’ Brendan is a 22 year old Special Olympian from Houston, Texas, who has be-come an aficionado of the game of basketball. Beebo has Roberts Syndrome, a genetic disorder that delays the growth of limbs and facial features. He was born without arms, so naturally he learned to do everything with his feet. His father, Ray, and his mother, Ann, adopted Beebo when he was 6 weeks old. Doctors told his parents he wouldn’t be able to do anything other than eat and go to the bath-room. His diagnosis didn’t keep Beebo down for long, continuing to defy the odds. Just about anytime and anywhere, you can find a smile on Beebo’s face and a basketball between his feet. Beebo first learned how to play basketball when he was in Jr. High. With just his feet, he is able to dribble and shoot the ball with deadly accuracy. His basketball skills have earned him multiple titles and pro-pelled him forward as an award winning Spe-cial Olympian. Beebo was even honored with an honorary ESPY, the Excellence in Sports Performance Yearly Award, last year. The basketball star has shot hoops with NBA play-er James Harden and even played with the world-renowned Harlem Globetrotters. Beebo is not only an amazing basketball player, but also an exceptional bowler and tennis player, winning gold medals in both events. Perhaps the most shining quality Beebo ex-udes is his personality. When you step onto a basketball court, you can hear Beebo’s laugh echoing from every corner. His enthusiasm for the game of basketball and life is infectious, and he inspires everyone around him. I am honored to be able to spread the in-spiring story of Beebo. His resiliency, deter-mination, and grit all are to be admired and something we should all seek in our lives. He is the perfect embodiment of what it means to be a Special Olympian and Houstonian. Keep playing basketball, Beebo, we will all be cheering him on.

PI KAPPA ALPHA 150TH ANNIVERSARY RECOGNITION 
HON. PETE SESSIONS 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 5, 2018 Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and to recognize the Pi Kappa Alpha International Fraternity—a values-based men’s fraternal organization with more than 225 chapters in the United States and Canada, ap-proximately 16,000 undergraduate members, and over 290,000 lifetime members. In 2018, Pi Kappa Alpha celebrated the 150th anniver-sary of its founding on March 1, 1868 at the University of Virginia when six young men joined together and resolved to form a frater-nity for the establishment of friendship on a firmer and more lasting basis. Their commit-ment to high ideals of scholarship, leadership and gentlemanly behavior remain strong to this day. In 1868 there were 38 states. Pi Kappa Alpha predates two rows of stars on the Amer-ican Flag. The nation of Canada, home to sev-eral Pi Kappa Alpha chapters, was founded one year earlier in 1867. The fIrst organized baseball and football games were played in 1869. Coca-Cola was founded in 1886 and basketball was fIrst played in 1891. Pi Kappa Alpha has persevered and grown through world wars, generational and cultural changes, depressions, recessions, and other challenges on college campuses that have at times threatened its existence. Its members have explored space, served as leaders of business and industry, filled the ranks of pub-lic servants in the arenas of education, gov-ernment and the military; authored books; per-formed on athletic fields and entertainment venues. Throughout its history Pi Kappa Alpha has answered the call to arms to preserve and protect the United States of America and its friends and allies. More than 600 Pi Kappa Al-phas are recognized as Gold Star Heroes, making the ultimate sacrifIce in conflicts dating back to the Spanish American War and includ-ing the War on Terror today. Pi Kappa Alpha has prepared nearly 300,000 men to lead on their campuses and in their homes, communities, and businesses. It has endured and it thrives today because valuing friendship, showing love for your fellow man and defending the truth of its ideals are timeless, lifelong virtues. Nearly 16,000 PIKE student members are impacting and influencing their campuses and communities today, serving as leaders in stu-dent government, Interfraternity councils, sports teams and student organizations. Col-lectively, PIKE chapters annually perform over 360,000 hours of community service and do-nate more than $3.6 million to philanthropy. These student leaders are supported by 2,500 men (and women) who volunteer to serve on advisory boards and house corpora-tions. Over 150 alumni associations ensure that the admonition, ‘‘Once a Pike, Always a Pike,’’ remains true, inspiring the lifetime fra-ternal experience for its members. Pi Kappa Alpha seeks to enrich the under-graduate experience and the quality of its vol-unteer support through a comprehensive, in-dustry-leading educational program that incor-porates all aspects of the Fraternity including scholastic performance, personal develop-ment, leadership training, innovative learning, community engagement, campus involvement and participation. Today, in its 150th year, Pi Kappa Alpha calls upon its members to live anew its legacy, to reflect on the principles of its Founders and to commit to a strong future for its great broth-erhood. As a proud member of the Pi Kappa Alpha International Fraternity, I would like to congratulate the fraternity on its 150 years of success.

HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 5, 2018 Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the exemplary life and career of Thomas J. Moran, Chief of the ‘‘A’’ District of the Buffalo Police Department, who passed away on March 1st of this year. Chief Moran was 49 years old. Chief Moran first joined the Buffalo Police Department on February 4, 1994 at age 25, a recent graduate of the State University of New York at Brockport. In May of 2006, he received the Edward H. Butler Award for Heroism for having success-fully disrupted an armed robbery of a retail store in the Ferry-Fillmore district where he had been stationed. After performing admirably in various roles as a Police Officer for eighteen years, he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant in April of 2012, and again promoted to Chief in June of 2013. As Chief of the ‘‘A’’ District covering South Buffalo and the adjacent neighborhoods, he was known for his responsiveness and en-gagement with community stakeholders, for his clear leadership and helpful mentorship of the officers under his command, and for his dedication and commitment to the citizens of the City of Buffalo, to the Buffalo Police De-partment, and to the principles of law and order. Like so many in my community, I am grate-ful to have known Chief Moran and to have called him a friend. I shall remain grateful for his leadership, and his work to serve and pro-tect the people of South Buffalo and the entire City of Buffalo. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join with me and with Members of the House to express our deepest condolences to his wife, Kelly, to his daughters Ava and Lila, and to the entire fam-ily of the late Chief Tom Moran, and join me in recognizing his many years of dedicated public service.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 5, 2018 Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of the late Russell N. Collins, Jr., of Palmyra, New Jersey, for his service to our nation. Russell N. Collins Jr. was born in Camden, New Jersey in 1925. He attended Woodrow Wilson High School where he was a gifted drum player in the school band. Upon learning of the surprise attack on the American naval base at Pearl Harbor, Mr. Collins enlisted into the United States Navy and proudly served his country during World War II as an original crew member of the USS New Jersey (BB– 62), from 1943 to 1946. After the war, Mr. Collins returned home to New Jersey and married his high school sweetheart, Helen S. Collins. They were mar-ried more than fifty years until Mrs. Collins’ passing in 2004. Later in life, Mr. Collins would return to the Battleship New Jersey, where he served as a volunteer and valued member of the floating Museum and Memorial along the Camden, New Jersey waterfront. Mr. Collins is remembered by those close to him as having a hearty laugh, a gentle grin and was adept at storytelling. He was a Mason, a Shriner and an Odd Fellow, and was never seen without his USS New Jersey hat. On December 21, 2017, Mr. Collins passed away at the age of 92. He was the last mu-seum volunteer who served as a U.S. Navy sailor on the Battleship during World War II. Mr. Collin’s life was a rich collection of love, friendship, loyalty, bravery, and heroism. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Russell N. Collins, Jr. was a true American hero. I ask you to join me in celebrating this patriot and his selfless sac-rifices on behalf of our grateful nation. f

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 5, 2018 Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my congratulations to Jim and Jean Lake on the celebration of their 50th Wedding Anniversary. This significant benchmark is a symbol of their commitment to each other and to their family. I am happy to join their friends and family in extending my best to them on this special occasion.

I wish them the best today and for many more blessed years to come.

RETIREMENT RECOGNITION FOR DIANE DZURISIN 
HON. CHELLIE PINGREE 
OF MAINE  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 5, 2018 Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize a tireless and visionary veteran and federal employee for her work to protect and improve the lives of her fellow citizens. Diane Dzurisin is retiring after seventeen years with the VA, two decades in the military, and six years of long-term care nursing. It has been said that if you choose work that you love, then you never have to work another day. I suspect that has been the case for Diane during her impressive career. When my constituent services staff has needed guid-ance to resolve the most challenging VA cases, she has never failed to ensure that each veteran’s concerns were appropriately and expeditiously addressed. Her awareness of and sensitivity to the unique challenges of adjudicating claims following military sexual trauma has lifted the burdens and changed the lives of countless veterans. People like Diane Dzurisin never really re-tire—they reinvent. On behalf of a grateful na-tion, I want to thank her for her service, honor her for her dedication to veterans, and wish her all the best as she embarks on this new journey.

HONORING ELAINE BROWN ON HER 75TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 5, 2018 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 75th birthday of Elaine Brown, a commu-nity leader, civil rights activist, and advocate for the underrepresented. Elaine Brown was born on March 2, 1943, in North Philadelphia, an area affected by sig-nificant poverty and racial segregation. She

was raised by her mother, Dorothy Clark, who worked to support her and instilled in her a love of music. Starting with classical piano les-sons, Elaine grew as a songwriter and eventu-ally moved to Los Angeles to pursue music as a career. In LA, she engaged with the civil rights movement, and after the assassination of Mar-tin Luther King, Jr., Brown was motivated to join the Black Panther Party. As a party mem-ber, she helped establish the groundbreaking Free Breakfast for Children Program, Free Busing to Prisons Program, and Free Legal Aid Program. In 1968, Brown was commissioned by David Hilliard, the Party Chief of Staff, to record the album ‘‘Seize the Time,’’ which includes the anthem of the Black Panther Party. The Par-ty’s co-founder, Huey P. Newton, later com-missioned her to record a second album, ‘‘Until We’re Free’’, to promote the party’s message, ‘‘All Power to the People.’’ In August of 1974, Elaine Brown took over as the chair of the Black Panther Party—the first and only woman to lead the revolutionary organization. Under her leadership, the party focused on electoral politics and community service. In 1977, she managed Lionel Wilson’s victorious campaign to become Oakland’s first black mayor. That same year, I was proud to work on her trailblazing campaign for the Oak-land City Council. After leaving the party in 1977, she wrote her memoir ‘‘A Taste of Power: A Black Wom-an’s Story’’ in 1982 and returned to her work on the struggle of black liberation and prison reform. In 1996, Brown moved to Atlanta, Georgia, and founded Fields of Flowers, Inc., a non-profit committed to providing edu-cational opportunities for impoverished African American children. Elaine also founded Mothers Advocating Ju-venile Justice and the Michael Lewis Legal Defense Committee, where she spent nearly two decades supporting the legal appeal of Michael ‘‘Little B’’ Lewis, who was wrongly ac-cused of murder and tried as an adult at 13. Elaine wrote The Condemnation of Little B, exposing racism that affects millions of poor African Americans and the barbarity of trying children as adults. In 2003, Brown co-founded the National Alliance for Radical Prison Re-form and has continued her advocacy by fre-quently lecturing at colleges and universities throughout the country. Elaine continues to co-author many books and serves in leadership roles for various committees, and is the CEO of a non-profit or-ganization, Oakland & The World Enterprises, Inc. which is dedicated to launching and sus-taining for-profit businesses for cooperative- ownership by the formerly incarcerated and those facing monumental social barriers. On a personal note, Elaine has been a ‘‘comrade’’ and friend since the early 1970’s, whose friendship, intellect, and life’s work I deeply appreciate and admire. Today, on behalf of California’s 13th Con-gressional District, it is my honor to celebrate Elaine Brown and her accomplishments, advo-cacy and contributions for the underrep-resented. Her work toward the empowerment of women and minorities, especially African Americans, is a true inspiration to many. WHY WE CAN WAIT NO LONGER AND THE FIERCE URGENCY TO ENACT NOW RESPONSIBLE GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION LEGIS-LATION AFTER PARKLAND, FLORIDA MASS SHOOTING 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 5, 2018 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call upon the President and the Con-gress of the United States to act without delay and pass legislation to prevent gun violence and mass casualties from shootings. The community of Parkland, Florida—along with the rest of the country—is still reeling from the horrific tragedy that took place at the Marjorie Stoneman Douglass High School on Valentine’s Day, February 14, 2018. Our hearts still ache with sadness and dis-belief for the families and loved ones of the 17 students—sons and daughters, brothers and sisters—who lost their lives in this senseless, horrific act of domestic terrorism. It is safe to say that America is sick and tired of being sick and tired of gun violence. That is why we must act now to stop gun vi-olence, protect citizens, and save lives. Here are the top 6 actions the President and the Congress can and must take now to protect our communities: Require universal background checks to keep guns out of dangerous hands; Extend the waiting period to purchase or transfer dangerous weapons like the AR–15 pending completion of background checks to 7 days; Raise the minimum age to purchase or transfer dangerous weapons like the AR–15, high-capacity magazines, ammunitions, and si-lencers from 18 to 21 years of age; Ban military-style assault weapons; Limit high-capacity magazines; and Increase access to mental health services. We can take action without infringing on the 2nd Amendment rights of Americans. We need to make it harder for criminals to obtain guns by strengthening the background check system. We need to ensure that mental health pro-fessionals know their options for reporting threats of violence—even as we acknowledge that someone with a mental illness is far more likely to be the victim of a violent crime than the perpetrator. We must also make safe gun storage a pri-ority. As the founder and Co-Chair of the Con-gressional Children’s Caucus, a senior Mem-ber of the Judiciary Committee, and the Rank-ing Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security, I have listened far too often to the testimony of individuals who have survived tragedies or lost loved ones as a result of gun violence. In the words of President Obama after the 2013 Sandy Hook Elementary shooting, ‘‘We’re going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more trage-dies like this, regardless of the politics.’’ While it is certainly true that violent crime and homicide rates in this country have been declining in recent years, they are still far above those in other industrialized nations. There exists a culture of violence in Amer-ica; a subculture that with today’s techno-logically advanced weaponry is far more dan-gerous to public safety than ever before. At no point in our nation’s history has a sin-gle human been more capable of inflicting massive death and misery, and our society is producing more individuals who seek to em-ploy such means to carry out their ill inten-tions. Far too often, the tool of choice for would- be killers are military-style assault weapons with high-capacity magazines. Every day, on average, 92 Americans are victims of gun violence, resulting in more than 33,000 deaths annually. In raising this issue, we recognize and re-spect other cultures that exist in America; law- abiding citizens who are responsible in their ownership of firearms. Many of these citizens are responsible with respect to the lethal capacity of their firearms, opting not to obtain assault weapons or to equip assault weapons with 30, 50, 75, or 100-round magazines. Here is what I think the Congress can and must do to reduce gun violence without abridging the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans. Extend the waiting period to purchase or transfer dangerous weapons like the AR–15 pending completion of background checks to 7 days. That is why I have introduced H.R. 4268, the ‘‘Gun Safety, Not Sorry Act.’’ Raise the minimum age to purchase or transfer dangerous weapons like the AR–15, high-capacity magazines, ammunitions, and si-lencers from 18 to 21 years of age. That is why I have introduced H.R. 5088, the ‘‘No Mass Atrocities with Guns Act’’ (‘No MAGA Act’). Reinstate and strengthen the federal ban on assault weapons. I am an original co-sponsor of H.R. 3947, legislation that will reinstates the assault weapons ban that has been introduced by my colleague, Congressman D
AVID CICILLINE of Rhode Island. Reinstate a federal ban on bump stocks and high-capacity magazines holding more than ten rounds and allowing a shooter to inflict mass damage in a short period of time without reloading will save lives. I will soon be introducing the ‘‘Stop Abuse, Violence, and Ending Lives Act of 2018,’’ leg-islation to ban the sale and possession of bump stocks. Require a background check for every gun sale, while respecting reasonable exceptions for cases such as gifts between family mem-bers and temporary loans for sporting pur-poses. I am an original co-sponsor of H.R. 4240, the ‘‘Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act of 2017,’’ legislation that requires universal background checks and closes the gun show loophole that has been introduced by my colleague, Congressman M
IKETHOMPSON of California. It is estimated that four out of ten gun buy-ers do not go through a background check when purchasing a firearm because federal law only requires these checks when someone buys a gun from a federally licensed dealer. That would be like allowing four out of ten people to choose if they would like to go through airport security. This loophole allows felons, domestic abus-ers, and those prohibited because of mental

illness to easily bypass the criminal back-ground check system and buy firearms at gun shows, through private sellers, over the inter-net or out of the trunks of cars. Strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) database to ensure it is up to date by requiring federal and state agencies to transfer important records to the database expeditiously since without the information, the reliability of a background check is questionable. Pass legislation aimed specifically at crack-ing down on illegal gun trafficking and straw- purchasing which often puts guns in the hands of people who are prohibited from having them. Straw-purchasing is when a prohibited buyer has someone with no criminal history walk into a gun store, pass a background check and purchase a gun with the purpose of giving it to the prohibited buyer. Restore funding for public safety and law enforcement initiatives aimed at reducing gun violence. Congress should fund law enforcement’s ef-forts to reduce gun violence, while supporting federal research into causes of gun violence. There is no reason the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) or the National Institute of Health (NIH) should be prohibited from re-searching the causes of gun violence. That is why I have co-sponsored H.R. 1832, legislation that authorizes the appropriation of funds to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for conducting or supporting re-search on firearms safety or gun violence pre-vention. I have also co-sponsored H.R. 1478, the Gun Violence Research Act, which repeals the provision that in practice prohibits the Depart-ment of Health and Human Services from sponsoring research on gun violence. And there is no reason for the restrictions federal law places on our law enforcement of-ficers’ ability to track and combat the spread of illegal guns. Close the holes in our mental-health system and make sure that care is available for those who need it. Congress must improve prevention, early intervention, and treatment of mental illness while working to eliminate the stigma associ-ated with mental illness. Access to mental health services should be improved, the shortage of mental health pro-fessionals should be addressed, and funding should be made available for those programs that have proven to be effective. That is why I have co-sponsored H.R. 1982, the ’’Mental Health Access and Gun Violence Prevention Act,’’ legislation that authorizes the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Social Security Administration to: (1) increase access to mental health care treatment and services, and (2) promote reporting of mental health in-formation to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Help local communities get unwanted and il-legal guns out of the hands of those who should not have them. Congress should help support and develop local programs that get unwanted guns off our streets, such as gun buy-back programs that proved so effective in Australia. Finally, we must address our culture’s glori-fication of violence seen and heard though our movie screens, television shows, music and video games. Congress should fund scientific research on the relationship between popular culture and gun violence, while ensuring that parents have access to the information they need to make informed decisions about what their families watch, listen to, and play. Here is what I think neither the President, the Congress, nor state and local govern-ments should not do to reduce gun violence. We should not arm teachers because they are not trained to handle weapons; this is not what they signed up for. We must not surrender to NRA even though the gun lobby has long enjoyed tremendous influence over congressional Republicans and some Democrats. Persons who live in fear of gun violence and mass shootings at schools, theaters, places of worship and work, and public spaces are not afraid of the NRA. What they are afraid of is an AR–15 in the hands of a mentally unstable person. Americans are a can-do people; we do not bemoan our problems and accept terrible out-comes. We act to solve them. We have made our cars and trucks and roads safer and reduced traffic fatalities. We have virtually eradicated polio, small pox, and other debilitating and life-threatening diseases. We respond immediately to natural disasters caused by hurricanes, earthquakes, tornados, floods, and man-made disasters caused by acts of terrorism. When it comes to reducing or preventing gun violence, we must summon that same spirit of American resolve and know-how and get the job done. We can do it; after all, we are Americans.

IN HONOR OF TASHA M CKELVEY FOR EARNING THE SPAATZ AWARD AND RANK OF CADET COLONEL IN THE CIVIL AIR PA-TROL 
HON. LIZ CHENEY 
OF WYOMING  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 5, 2018 Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Cadet Colonel Tasha McKelvey on earming the Spaatz award and the rank of cadet colonel in the Civil Air Patrol. The Spaatz Award is the highest cadet honor in the Civil Air Patrol, given to less than one percent of all cadets. It acknowledges those who have demonstrated excellent lead-ership, character, fitness, and aerospace knowledge in the CAP Cadet Program. During her time in the Wyoming Wing of the CAP, Ms. McKelvey has done just that. Among her peers, she is a leader and source of inspira-tion for inspiration during trying times. Her de-termination and grit also resulted in her pass-ing the Spaatz exam on her first try, a rarity across the nation. Ms. McKelvey is the first female and the sixth cadet within the Wyoming Wing to re-ceive the Spaatz Award. I thank her for her commitment to serve our great nation. Her bravery, sacrifice, and resolve are truly admi-rable. Ms. McKelvey has set an excellent ex-ample to her family, friends, and peers. Again, Mr. Speaker, I would like to con-gratulate Cadet Colonel Tasha McKelvey on receiving the Civil Air Patrol’s highest cadet honor, the Spaatz Award and the rank of cadet colonel. She and her family deserve to be extremely proud. f 
COMMEMORATING THE 165TH ANNI-VERSARY OF STEINWAY & SONS 
HON. JOSEPH CROWLEY 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 5, 2018 Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 165th anniversary of a Queens treasure, and one of the world’s most iconic brands—Steinway & Sons. Steinway makes world-renowned pianos, distinguished for their grandness and master-ful craftsmanship. Each piano consists of more than 12,000 individual parts, and is said to have its own musical character as unique as the individual who plays it. These magnificent works of art, I am proud to say, are made in my district. The Steinway legacy dates back to 1853, when Heinrich Engelhard Steinway founded Steinway & Sons in New York, a few years after emigrating from Germany. The high qual-ity and meticulous craftsmanship of Steinway’s pianos led to rapid growth for the business and the opening of a factory in Queens. Along with the factory, the Steinway family estab-lished a company town, Steinway Village, which spurred development in the neighbor-hoods that are today known as Astoria and Long Island City in Queens, and they spread their family values of investing in community. The philanthropic work of the Steinway family endures today throughout Queens and New York City. That same factory, which first opened in the early 1870s, continues to operate today. The historic factory has been producing the world’s finest pianos, virtually uninterrupted, for more than 145 years. Today, the factory employs over 300 union craftspeople, and many more people in management, administrative and sales roles in New York and throughout Amer-ica. Steinway & Sons is an American success story, integral not only to the history of the borough of Queens and New York City, but also to the cultural story of the United States of America. It is a jewel that elevates Amer-ican craftsmanship and innovation throughout the world. As a lifelong musician and a son of Queens, it is with great pride that I celebrate the 165th anniversary of the world’s number one piano, New York’s very own Steinway & Sons.

SPRINGFIELD CLINIC LEADS ILLINOIS IN OPENNOTES 
HON. RODNEY DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 5, 2018 Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today in order to recognize the Springfield Clinic, one of the first multi-spe-cialty clinics in downstate Illinois. With more than 400 physicians and advanced practi-tioners practicing in 80 medical specialties and sub-specialties, Springfield Clinic now proudly stands as one of Illinois’ largest private multi- specialty clinics and serves nearly one million patients throughout the central Illinois region. In 2010, as part of their ‘‘leading the way’’ initiative, all Springfield Clinic offices began working with the OpenNotes movement. This put them among the nation’s leaders in inte-gration of electronic health record technology, which enables clinicians to share their visit notes with patients through fully transparent medical records. This secure system encour-ages patients to become active participants in their health care by providing a convenient way to access and manage personal medical records, communicate directly with medical professionals, schedule appointments and pre-scriptions, receive email and text reminders for preventive care and upcoming appointments, and pay bills online. This dynamic state-of-the-art system pro-vides Springfield Clinic the necessary tools to expand patient services. However, we cannot hope to automate and streamline provider workflow unless more patients sign up for and participate in these portals. I’m proud to rep-resent Springfield Clinic, which is on the fore-front of this innovative approach to the doctor- patient relationship. Nineteen million patients are already taking advantage of their new abil-ity to access medical information online through OpenNotes, and my hope is that this number only continues to grow both in my dis-trict and across the country. More and more medical professionals and citizens should take advantage of this patient-centered program so we can focus on what matters most—patient care. f 
RECOGNIZING AND COMMENDING CASEY JESZENKA 
HON. MADELEINE Z. BORDALLO 
OF GUAM  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 5, 2018 Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and commend Casey Jeszenka for his service to the people of Guam. Casey made Guam his home and joined the Pacific Islands Small Business Development Center in 2000. He has served as the director of the Pacific Islands Small Business Development Center Network for the last 16 years and will retire on March 2, 2018. Throughout his ten-ure, Casey has been an invaluable advocate and resource for many in our community in Guam to develop successful businesses and contribute to the local economy. I have worked closely with Casey throughout my time in Con-gress, and he has been a trusted advisor in the development of small businesses on Guam. As the Network Director, Casey has been responsible for the overall management and implementation of the service functions associ-ated with the University of Guam Pacific Is-lands Small Business Development Center Network (PISBDCN). His leadership at PISBDCN was instrumental to assisting clients and providing information, resources, edu-cation, technical support, and professional counseling and consultant services to local en-trepreneurs and business owners. Casey worked closely with both the public and private sectors and a system of island sub-centers, overseeing their organization, program imple-mentation, management and evaluation proc-esses in order to further develop and enhance a comprehensive network on Guam and throughout Micronesia. Casey nurtured part-nerships between PISBDCN, and the Guam Small Business Administration (SBA), the Guam Economic Development Authority (GEDA), and the University of Guam College of Agriculture’s Extension Programs to make the programs of the Pacific Islands Small Business Development successful. Prior to serving as Network Director, Casey served as Special Projects Director and Coun-selor from 2000 to 2002 for the Pacific Islands Small Business Development Center. Casey was responsible for planning, directing and or-ganizing the establishment and operations of new and established Small Business Develop-ment Center (SBDC) Subcenter and Satellite programs throughout the network. He provided training to new SBDC Subcenter and Satellite personnel in accordance with the PISBDCN Standard Operating Procedures. Casey, addi-tionally directed and supervised the SBDC Subcenter and Satellite counseling services and training programs, and trained SBDC per-sonnel to handle these duties. He assisted in the development and tracking of goals in line with the PISBDCN mission, strategic plan and directives. also provided a comprehensive range of small business based assistance to established and prospective small business owners and other qualified clients including one-to-one client counseling. Casey imple-mented SBDC orientation and training ses-sions and developed and implemented new workshops. In addition to his roles with the Pacific Is-lands Small Business Development Center, Casey has also been actively involved as a member of the Pacific Asia Travel Association Micronesia Chapter’s Executive Committee, a member of the Pacific Asia Travel Association Micronesia Chapter’s Education Committee, as secretary of the Pacific Islands Small Busi-ness Development Center Network’s Advisory Board, and as a member of the Guam Cham-ber of Commerce Small Business Committee. Casey has worked diligently throughout his 18 years of service on Guam. He will be missed as a valued member of the Pacific Is-lands Small Business Development Center, but through his leadership and guidance, he has positioned the PISBDCN to continue its exceptional service to the people of Guam. I extend my sincere congratulations to Casey, and I join the people of Guam in commending him for his service and thanking him for his many contributions to our island community.

RECOGNIZING THE CAPITOL VIS-ITOR CENTER AND STAFF FOR SURPASSING 20 MILLION VISI-TORS TO THE CVC 
HON. GREGG HARPER 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 5, 2018 Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the staff of the U.S. Capitol Vis-itor Center (CVC) and recognize the CVC for surpassing its twenty-millionth visitor. On December 2, 2008, the CVC opened to the public for the first time. By May of the fol-lowing year, the CVC welcomed its one mil-lionth visitor. During this past December, after just nine years in operation, the CVC wel-comed its 20 millionth visitor. Since its opening, the CVC has been guided by four primary goals to better serve the U.S. Congress: Security, Visitor Education, Visitor Comfort, and Functional Improvements to the U.S. Capitol. Today, which traditionally marks the begin-ning of the Spring tourist season, the CVC provides a secure public environment to wel-come and assist a large number of visitors. The CVC creates and presents informative programs on the workings and history of the Congress, the legislative process, and the art and architecture of the Capitol to millions of visitors each year, all while providing the amenities, comfort, convenience, and accessi-bility for visitors appropriate to one of the na-tion’s most visited tourist destinations. The CVC team welcomed 2.4 million visitors in 2017, the highest single-year total since the facility opened. Even more remarkable is that almost half of those visitors came during the Spring season between the months of March and June. As we are about to begin a new Spring tourist season, I am reminded of just how important the CVC is as we welcome our constituents to Washington, D.C. Behind the scenes, the CVC provides modem, efficient facilities for the operational functions of the Capitol, as well as provides important work space for both the House and Senate, and improves connectivity between the Capitol and the Library of Congress.

While the CVC does provide world-class tours for over two million visitors each year, its service to Congress doesn’t stop there. The CVC team has also supported more than 7,000 congressional events in CVC meeting spaces as well as welcoming and assisting guests at Congressional Gold Medal Cere-monies, commemoration ceremonies, annual Memorial Day and Capitol Fourth Concerts, and presidential inaugurations, among many other events. Also, in support of Congress, the CVC team has developed training programs for congres-sional staff to learn about the history of the Capitol and Congress and the artwork that represents their story. Critical safety and emergency evacuation procedures are key elements of this program. To date, more than 31,000 interns and other staff have partici-pated in the training program, enhancing their ability to deliver high-quality tours to constitu-ents. The majority of visitors to the CVC are our constituents, and based on independent sur-veys, 93 percent of visitors to the Capitol said their expectations were met or exceeded and that they were likely to recommend taking a Capitol Tour to their friends. These numbers reflect the passion and knowledge the Visitor Center’s team brings to the Capitol each day, as well as their commitment to inform, involve, and inspire every visitor. The CVC will celebrate its 10th anniversary on December 2, 2018. As the CVC embarks on its second decade serving as the front door to the Capitol and the Congress, I wish to rec-ognize the hard-working CVC staff that remain committed to providing world-class services to our visitors, our constituents, and those of us who work in the Capitol each day.

TERRY VAUGHN, A HURRICANE HARVEY HERO 
HON. TED POE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 5, 2018 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute another of our Harvey Heroes. I want to recognize Terry Vaughn, district manager of pharmacy and retail operations for 14 Walgreens stores in the Lake Houston area where I live. As Hurricane Harvey hovered over the Houston area dropping up to 50 inches of rain in some parts, Terry and his Walgreens partners were watching and waiting like most Houstonians. In the wake of the storm, all but one of Terry’s stores closed due to damage or impassable roads. The only store the Walgreens team could get to was the location on West Lake Houston Parkway and FM 1960—in my neighborhood of Atascocita. Terry lives one mile from the store. As the San Jacinto River rose and Lake Houston came out of its banks, a fellow team member’s house was flooding so quickly she and her family of six had nowhere to turn. They walked through water to the Atascocita Walgreens where Terry and other volunteers met them with kayaks and transported them to Terry’s home where Mitzi, his bride of 19 years, and their two boys provided the food and shelter the family so badly needed. The forecasts said this storm would be here for days. Since he could get to the store, Terry decided to open up the Atascocita location. Terry, three other managers, and Walgreens team members who couldn’t make it to their own stores but still wanted to help, kept our Atascocita location’s doors open through shortages of power and shortages of patience. The one thing they didn’t have a shortage of was dedication to their community. Terry would wake up each morning, check the water level of Lake Houston to make sure it wasn’t coming closer into his own home, then report for service. Mr. Speaker, during Harvey, Terry’s store was the only continually operating Walgreens this side of the Gulf of Mexico. He partnered with the City of Humble to deliver life-saving medications to evacuees at the city’s emer-gency shelter at the Humble Civic Center. He immunized 40 local first responders to protect them from the flood borne diseases of tetanus and Hepatitis A; then took his immunizations on the road setting up first responder clinics at fire and police stations. Terry and his team im-munized more than 1,000 people in two days. Virtually all Lake Houston-area grocery stores were closed due to the flooding. The stores were filled with water. Distribution trucks could not get to the area. As the storm damage continued, Terry led a team of Walgreens managers who with their own trucks (Texas trucks with plenty of lift to get through those waters, Mr. Speaker) went to 13 other Walgreens and gathered household sup-plies, diapers, baby formula, and medical sup-plies to distribute at the operational Atascocita location. For days Terry kept answering the calls and kept serving. One of those calls was from United Airlines who had personnel and dis-placed passengers stuck at George Bush Intercontinental Airport. Terry and his Walgreens team fulfilled an order of more than $30,000 in supplies and delivered it straight to the tarmac. Was there a bright spot in all this for Terry? He told me, ‘‘Seeing people come together and my team working non-stop with-out breaks—with their own families going through the worst times—we showed up to help our community and put our own issues aside.’’ Mr. Speaker, those who know Terry know he has a servant’s heart. He is active with the Lake Houston Chamber of Commerce, Boy Scouts, and Humble Area Assistance Min-istries. Terry started with Walgreens as a cashier more than 21 years ago. He has per-formed every job in the store and worked his way up to be a district manager. On August 18 as Hurricane Harvey ravaged and flooded our area, he was called upon to once again do every job. And he did. And he makes us proud to be Texans.

IN MEMORY OF WALTER J. BUCKERT, JR. 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 5, 2018 Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speak-er, sadly, Walter J. Buckert, Jr., a proven champion for military service-members and their devoted families, passed away last week. He will always be cherished for championing benefits for our military and providing extraor-dinary jobs for military family members. The Office of the Second Congressional District of South Carolina was fortunate to have as staff members two of his talented granddaughters, Elizabeth Grayson and Katherine Grayson, who he influenced for extraordinary service on behalf of constituents. I include in the RECORD  the following thoughtful obituary: 
Walter J. Buckert, Jr., age 85, passed away peacefully on Sunday, February 25th at Inova Fairfax Hospital in Virginia. Walter was born on February 24th, 1933, in Rochester NY, to Walt and Marge Buckert. In 1955, Walter graduated from Georgetown University with a BA in Business. He joined the General Electric Company’s Corporate Financial Program where he was assigned to the Federal Government Department of Electronics Division. From there, he was promoted to General Electric’s Lighting Business Group, its highest division by rev-enue at that time. He took on increasing roles of responsibility with each transfer ac-cepting positions in New York, Cleveland and Richmond. His final assignment from General Electric, before his retirement in 1995, was as Manager of U.S. Government Sales and Marketing for all lighting prod-ucts for government use and resale to mili-tary personnel. In that role, Walter grew government sales and created a division highly valued to this day. After 47 years with General Electric, Walter joined Webco Gen-eral Partnership in 1996 as Director of Gov-ernment and Industry Affairs. A strong advo-cate for military personnel and their fami-lies, he was awarded the American Logistics Association Lifetime Achievement Award, The Department of the Army Outstanding Civil Service medal for his service, and The Exchange. Walter is survived by his beautiful wife of 55 years, Mary Sutton Buckert and loving daughter, Laurie Grayson; son-in-law, Bill Grayson; and granddaughters Katherine, Elizabeth, and Caroline Grayson who fondly referred to their grandfather by his child-hood nickname, Buddy. He is also survived by his older sister, Joanne McDermott, and too many nieces and nephews on both sides of the family to count but to whom he held much love and respect. Walter will be remembered for his loyalty, hard work, and dedication to others. He was a true blooded, American patriot who never took his freedom for granted. He was a hum-ble, stoic man, with strong convictions and beliefs, but underneath it all was a childlike spirit. Walter was a loving and devoted hus-band, father, grandfather, uncle, brother and friend, he will forever be missed. f

ON THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SUMGAIT POGROMS 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 5, 2018 Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise to com-memorate the 30th anniversary of the pogrom against the Armenian residents of the town of Sumgait, Azerbaijan. On February 27, 1988, and for three days following, Azerbaijani mobs assaulted and killed Armenians. The violence left hundreds of Armenian civilians dead and injured, women and girls were raped, and some victims were burned alive. Thousands were forced to flee their homes, leaving be-hind their belonging. The pogroms came about as the result of years of vicious, racist anti-Armenian propa-ganda by Azerbaijani authorities, dehuman-izing Armenians. Azerbaijan authorities made little effort to punish those responsible, instead attempting to cover up the atrocities in Sumgait to this day, and denying the govern-ment role in instigating the killings. Indeed, even today, racist propaganda against Arme-nia and Armenians is prevalent in Azerbaijan. The assault on ethnic Armenian civilians in Sumgait helped touch off what would become a direct conflict between Armenia and Azer-baijan which took thousands of lives and dis-located millions more. The anniversary of Sumgait is a reminder of the consequences when aggression and hatred grow unchecked. Mr. Speaker, this April we will mark the 103rd anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, an event the Turkish government, Azerbaijan’s closest ally, goes to great lengths to deny. We must not let such crimes against humanity go unrecognized, whether they occurred yester-day or 30 years ago or 100 years ago. Today, let us pause to remember the victims of the atrocities of the Sumgait pogroms. Mr. Speak-er, it is our moral obligation to condemn crimes of hatred and to remember the victims, in hope that history will not be repeated.

IN RECOGNITION OF RODNEY T. MITCHELL 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, March 5, 2018 Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Rodney Mitchell, associate dean of students at the University of North Texas in Denton, Texas. He tragically passed away February 26, following almost 30 years of af-filiation to UNT first as a student and then as a cherished staff member. Rodney was a UNT alumnus who earned his BA in Applied Arts and Sciences in 1996 and his MPA in 1999. A proud member of the Mean Green family, he was a life member of the UNT Alumni Association, a Mean Green football season ticket holder, and supporter of various student programs with his gifts to the university. The Residence Hall Association created the ‘‘Rodney T. Mitchell Advocate of the Year’’ award in honor of his service and leadership as the College Inn Hall Director and Residence Hall Association President. After working for the City of Denton as the Assistant to the City Manager, he returned to UNT as a member of staff in 2001. He served as assistant director for academic develop-ment—Upward Bound program and as director of TRIO Upward Bound and student support services before becoming associate dean of students in 2013. Throughout his time at UNT, it was clear that Rodney had an enormous heart for stu-dents. He assisted students through the SOS (Seeking Options and Solutions) Program, opened and grew the UNT Food Pantry, and oversaw various intervention programs to sup-port student success. He made a significant impact as a part of the University and commu-nity he loved, touching thousands of lives as a generous, caring servant. It was at UNT that Rodney met his wife Melanie. Together they served for many years at the Denton Church of Christ at Welch Street on the UNT campus and at the Singing Oaks Church of Christ. Rodney was a kind and generous man, and the world is a lesser place with his departure. His servant heart is a shining example as we seek to treat others as we want to be treated. He is survived by Melanie, a current UNT em-ployee, and his 13-year-old son, Hayden. On behalf of the 26th Congressional District, I wish to extend condolences to Melanie, Hay-den, Rodney’s mother Joyce Mitchell, his fa-ther Marvel Mitchell, his brother Zachary Mac-key and many other family members, as well as the entire UNT and Denton communities. Rodney will be remembered and loved forever by his family and a multitude of friends. I am grateful for the legacy he has left for the UNT and our North Texas community. f
