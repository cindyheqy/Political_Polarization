HONORING THE LIFE OF ROBERT KLANCHER 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 3, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to honor the life of Robert Klancher. Mr. Klancher recently passed away at the age of 57 after battling cancer for al-most two years. He leaves behind an incred-ible legacy as a community leader and friend to so many throughout the Commonwealth. His work over the years has not only helped change his home of Loudoun County, but also the lives of countless other in Virginia’s 10th District. He was a leader in every sense of the word and his immense positive impact on those who knew him will be felt for years to come. Robert served on Loudoun County’s Plan-ning Commission since he was first appointed to the position in January of 2004. Over his twelve years with the commission, Robert served as both Chairman and Vice Chairman, where he helped provide more than 750 rec-ommendations to the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors on issues concerning land de-velopment, comprehensive planning, future land use policies, and the Capital Improve-ments Program. His son, also named Robert, has continued on his father’s legacy of distin-guished government service by working in Prince William County government and now as a Legislative Aide to Supervisor Ron Meyer of the Broad Run District. Mr. Klancher’s tenure on the Loudoun County Planning Commission coincided with one of the county’s largest periods of growth. In 2004, Loudoun had a population of approxi-mately 230,000 residents. Today, that number has grown to an estimated 373,000 residents. His work has contributed to many of the great sites and activities that residents in the com-munity enjoy, such as the Stone Ridge com-munity, Loudoun Valley Estates, Arcola Cen-ter, One Loudoun, Waterside and Lansdowne developments, as well as updates to Broadlands, Brambleton, Kirkpatrick Farms, and many others. Robert truly cared about his community, the depth of which is marked by the incredible legacy of involvement and posi-tive change he has given us all. Robert served as a mentor to both cowork-ers and friends, while colleagues have noted that he ‘‘exemplified the qualities of a commu-nity servant’’. He will be missed by all those who had the pleasure of knowing him, both on a personal and professional level. Robert is survived by his beloved wife Janet, daughter Victoria Hickman, son Bobby and daughters Catherine and Jacqueline. He is also survived by his loving parents Bob and Olga Klancher, and his brother John. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in celebrating the life of Robert Klancher. USMC FIRST SERGEANT EDWARD KRETSCHMER PROMOTED TO SERGEANT MAJOR HON. PAUL COOK 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 3, 2016 Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-ognize First Sergeant Edward Kretschmer, United States Marine Corps, who will be pro-moted to Sergeant Major on June 3, 2016. First Sergeant Kretschmer has served in the Marine Corps since 1993. Over the course of his distinguished military career, First Sergeant Kretschmer has per-formed a number of duties, including Senior Drill Instructor at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego, Instructor at the Marine Corps’ Staff Non-commissioned Officer Academy, Company 1st Sergeant with the Second As-sault Amphibian Battalion, and Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Brigade Advisor Team in Af-ghanistan. Prior to First Sergeant Kretschmer’s promotion, he served as the Headquarters First Sergeant at Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow. His overseas service includes a combat tour in Iraq and two combat tours in Afghanistan. I would like to congratulate First Sergeant Kretschmer on his promotion. First Sergeant Kretschmer is a fine example of the profes-sionalism of non-commissioned officers in the United States Armed Forces. His service re-flects great credit upon the United States Ma-rine Corps and the United States of America.

RECOGNIZING THE ACCOMPLISH-MENTS AND LIFE OF FRAN NITKIN 
HON. MICHAEL G. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 3, 2016 Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the accomplishments and life of Mrs. Fran Nitkin. There is an old proverb that says, ‘‘Better than a thousand days of diligent study is one day with a great teacher.’’ Fortunately for the students of the Pennsbury School District they shared many days with a great teacher, Mrs. Fran Nitkin. Mrs. Nitkin was hired by Pennsbury in 1989 initially as a substitute teacher. She then served for many years as a teacher at Oxford Valley Elementary and had the opportunity to inspire young minds in elementary schools across the Pennsbury School District including Edgewood, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Quarry Hill elementary schools. In 2003, Mrs. Nitkin was appointed principal at Village Park Elementary. She then moved to Oxford Valley in 2006 and remained prin-cipal there until her death. Known by all for her high standards and dedication as a teacher and administrator, she was always ready to ‘‘provide assistance and wise counsel.’’ Oxford Valley Elementary School, a National School of Character, was built on the corner-stones of Cooperation, Respect, Responsi-bility, and Sportsmanship. Principal Fran Nitkin embodied these qualities and passed them along to her students every single day be-cause she was a great teacher.

HONORING DON BATEMAN 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 3, 2016 Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. C. Don Bateman, Corporate Fellow and Chief Engineer-Tech-nologist for Flight Safety Systems and Tech-nology at Honeywell Aerospace. As the man behind the first Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) and the revolutionary En-hanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS), Mr. Bateman is a true champion of safety for the aviation industry. Don has received a long list of accolades, including receiving the U.S. Presidential Medal of Technology and Innovation in 2011. Bate-man also is in the National Inventors Hall of Fame, an Aviation Path Finder in the Museum of Flight, and a Royal Aeronautical Society Fellow. He received Aviation Week’s Laurel for IT/Electronics and its Award for Lifetime Achievement, and in 2014 picked up the Elmer A. Sperry Award for enhancing the art of transportation. Over his 60 year career in the aviation in-dustry, Don’s intense focus on identifying, un-derstanding, and addressing aviation safety risks has led to some of the most successful safety solutions in aviation history. He holds over 50 U.S. and 90 foreign patents related to a wide variety of safety-related avionics includ-ing Terrain Awareness and Warning Systems, Heads-up Display systems, Speed Control/ Auto Throttle Systems, Stall Warning Systems, Automatic Flight Control Systems, Weight and Balance Systems, & Radar. Don is most well- known for his work addressing Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) accidents. For decades, CFIT was one of the leading causes of fatalities in commercial aviation; it is considered a form of spatial disorientation, whereby the pilots cannot discern their posi-tion and orientation in proximity to the earth surface. These incidents were the leading cause of airplane accident loss of life having reportedly caused over 9,000 deaths since 1944. The technologies pioneered by Don Bateman have virtually eliminated what used to be the most common type of airplane dis-aster. Beginning in 1970, Don was instrumental in establishing global recognition of CFIT risk and the need for improved pilot training sup-ported by advanced technologies and tools to prevent pilots in poor visibility from uninten-tionally flying aircraft into terrain or other ob-stacles. This led to the invention and subse-quent introduction of the original Ground Prox-imity Warning System (GPWS) which used ex-isting aircraft sensors such as the downward looking radar altimeter, to provide the pilot with advanced warning of impending impacts with terrain. In 1974, based on recommenda-tions from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, the Federal Aviation Administra-tion (FAA) mandated that all large turbine and turbojet airplanes be required to install GPWS equipment. Over 35,000 GPWS were installed between 1971 and 1998. From its initial development and based on knowledge gained from accident and incident analysis and vigorous flight testing, GPWS was continually improved and new capabilities such as Wind Shear Detection & Annunciation were added. However, it was in 1994 that the GPWS technology took the most substantial leap forward with the integration of GPS tech-nology. What would become the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS), leveraged advancements in digital data stor-age and processing. Don began assembling a worldwide database of terrain, obstacle and runway data and used this data to provide pi-lots with both a forward look and improved sit-uational awareness of any surrounding terrain. With this database and supporting alerting al-gorithms, EGPWS increased the pilot’s warn-ing time from seconds to minutes, a major ad-vancement in the prevention of CFIT acci-dents. In subsequent years, Don evolved EGPWS to accommodate the unique oper-ating characteristics of helicopters. There are now over 55,000 aircraft equipped with EGPWS and the technology is standard equip-ment on all commercial aircraft in production today. Expanding on EGPWS technology, Bateman and his team developed other safety products including Synthetic Vision, that displays EGPWS data in a 3–D format so pilots can lit-erally ‘‘see’’ the hills and surrounding terrain with visual cues that give pilots a sense of how fast they are approaching potential obsta-cles. As Bill Voss, former president and CEO, Flight Safety Foundation, fittingly stated: ‘‘Don Bateman has probably saved more lives than any single person in the history of avia-tion’’. . . and the impact of his work will be felt globally for decades to come. I understand Don Bateman intends to spend his retirement enjoying his family, traveling, and staying involved with the avionics indus-try. I congratulate Don Bateman on his many accomplishments and years of outstanding service to the aviation community on this mile-stone occasion. He is truly an asset to those millions of passengers around the globe who are safe in the skies each year through the use of his technologies. f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF ELSA ANDERS 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 3, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to take a moment to honor the life of one of my constituents, Mrs. Elsa Anders of Purcellville, Virginia. Throughout her life, Mrs. Anders was known as a philanthropic and community lead-er, and friend to so many throughout the Com-monwealth. Her work over the years has posi-tively influenced the lives of countless mem-bers of our community and the 10th District of Virginia. Mrs. Anders was born 1948 in Livermore, California, but grew up in Washington, D.C. She attended Georgetown Visitation Pre-paratory School and George Washington Uni-versity, where she received her Master’s in Education. She was well known for her over twenty years of work in the DC and Loudoun County public schools systems as a teacher and certified speech pathologist. As a community leader, Elsa participated in various school and local activities. Among her countless volunteer hours given to the com-munity, she was passionate about her work with the Alpha–1 Foundation, Waterford Foun-dation, Purcellville Business Association, and All Ages Read Together, of which she was a founding member. The Purcellville Business Association believes that a business organiza-tion is critical to the health and success of a town, city, or county. For many years, the PBA has proven that the community and the busi-nesses therein Purcellville are of the utmost importance to its members. They started such important events as the annual town Christ-mas parade and a trolley tour of town busi-nesses and historic features. Elsa Anders was an integral part of this history of the Purcellville Business Association, where she was elected secretary and ran the Member-ship Committee for many years. She very much exemplified the original charter of the Purcellville Business Association to ‘‘promote the economic, industrial, professional, cultural, and civic welfare of the Town of Purcellville.’’ While Elsa worked tirelessly to advance the cause of the Purcellville Business Association and the Town of Purcellville itself, I would be remiss if I did not impart that her true passion was her family. She cared deeply for her hus-band, her children, and her grandchildren. Elsa leaves behind her loving husband, Robert Lauten, and her three children: Andrew Lauten, Garrett Lauten, and Peter Anders- Lauten, and three grandchildren, Ruth Ella Lauten, and Collum and Chloe Murphy. Elsa will be sincerely missed by her family, friends, and those lucky enough to have met her. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in celebrating the life of Elsa Ragnhilde Ruth Anders.

FRANK R. LAUTENBERG CHEMICAL SAFETY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY ACT 
HON. KEITH ELLISON 
OF MINNESOTA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 3, 2016 Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I support the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act because too many Ameri-cans are getting sick from dangerous, unregu-lated chemicals found in the products we use every day. This bill would protect public health by making long-overdue chemical safety re-forms. Today, industries can release hundreds of chemicals each year into our homes and workplaces without any federal requirement to consider their safety. Research has linked chemicals used in everyday products, such as household cleaners, clothing, and furniture, to serious illnesses like cancer, infertility, diabe-tes and Parkinson’s. But currently, the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)—our broken chemical safety law—gives the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) little power to do anything about these dangers. Under TSCA, only a small fraction of the thousands of chemicals used in our products have ever been reviewed for safety. The law is so weak that the EPA couldn’t even regulate asbestos. In 1989, after 10 years of research and more than 100,000 pages of administrative record supporting ac-tion, the EPA issued a rule under TSCA to ban most uses of asbestos. But two years later, the EPA’s regulation was overturned by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals; while ac-knowledging that ‘‘asbestos is a potential car-cinogen at all levels of exposure,’’ the Court ruled that the agency’s administrative record failed to demonstrate that the regulation was the ‘‘least burdensome alternative,’’ as re-quired under the law. Since the court’s ruling, the burden to regulate most toxic substances under TSCA has been insurmountable. The reforms in the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act would help keep our communities safer by re-quiring reviews for chemicals in use today, mandating greater scrutiny of new chemicals, and removing barriers that have prevented the EPA from regulating highly toxic substances in the past, such as asbestos. This reform is an urgently needed next step, but there are still problems with this bill and more work should be done to protect our com-munities. Provisions in this bill sought by the chemical industry create unprecedented state preemption standards and put limitations on the EPA’s ability to monitor chemicals in im-ported products. Federal policy should be seen as a floor, not a ceiling, when it comes to establishing standards for public health and safety. We must support states, like my home state of Minnesota, that have led the way in creating chemical safety standards that protect their residents. Last year in Minnesota, we took an important step toward protecting chil-dren and firefighters’ health when the legisla-ture passed a law to prohibit four toxic flame retardants (Deca, HBCD, TCEP and TDCPP) from children’s products and upholstered fur-niture. Policies that preempt state action or restrict EPA’s ability to monitor imported products threaten public health and safety. We need to fight back against these bad policies as we continue our efforts to reform TSCA. For my part, I will continue to be an advocate for re-form that protects public health, not the chem-ical industry. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF LOUDOUN COUNTY’S SCHOOLS TO WATCH IN 2016 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 3, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to ac-knowledge several schools in Loudoun County that have been named Schools to Watch in 2016 by the National Forum to Accelerate Middle-Grades Reform. Eagle Ridge, Farmwell Station, J. Lupton Simpson, River Bend, and Sterling Middle Schools have been recognized as five of only 145 schools around the country to receive this honor. This honor requires schools to excel in the following criteria: academic excellence, devel-opmental responsiveness, and social equality. Each of these schools has challenged their students to achieve academic excellence over the course of the school year. They have also shown a unique ability to identify and work with early adolescent developmental chal-lenges, all while providing every student with the highest quality of teachers, resources, and support, regardless of socioeconomic status. Coming from a family of educators, I under-stand how important a strong education is to the future of our nation. It is schools like these that will continue to help shape the United States’ role in the evolving global economy, while at the same time producing many of our nation’s future leaders. Eagle Ridge, Farmwell Station, J. Lupton Simpson, River Bend, and Sterling Middle Schools have clearly shown a dedication to developing and educating our children. The outstanding qualities they have all exemplified are not to be understated; what they have achieved is something of which to be truly proud. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating these 2016 Schools to Watch for their incredible achievements. I wish them all the best in their future endeavors.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE COALI-TION TO SALUTE AMERICA’S HE-ROES 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 3, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a great American organization, the Coalition to Salute America’s Heroes, that recently celebrated 12 years of service this past May. The Coalition, headquartered in my district, is a 501(c)(3), nonprofit, non-partisan organi-zation established in 2004 to provide severely wounded veterans of the wars in Iraq and Af-ghanistan with immediate, invaluable lifelines. The Coalition is distinguished from other vet-eran-focused groups by its direct financial as-sistance to America’s wounded warriors. Its Emergency Financial Aid program has stopped foreclosure proceedings on veterans’ homes, kept their vehicles from being repos-sessed, put food on their tables, provided dia-pers for their babies, and even helped steer

many men and women away from suicide. Its innovative Heroes Thanking Heroes program provides transitional, part-time, flexible em-ployment to more than 40 combat-wounded veterans or their primary caregivers, enabling them to make phone calls from their homes, usually to personally thank donors for their contributions to the Coalition. Other aspects include an emergency financial aid program, a holiday gift program, and road to recovery conferences. The Coalition has done tremendous work in Virginia and across the country such as donat-ing more than $45 million in direct aid to vet-erans. The Coalition has provided tens of thousands of dollars through grants to other notable veterans’ organizations in Virginia and elsewhere. Under the leadership of a con-stituent of mine, President & CEO David Walk-er, the Coalition has further expanded its sup-port of our wounded warriors and become one of the most respected veterans-support groups in the nation. In fact, over two-thirds of the Coalition’s staff are combat-wounded or their spouse or caregiver. Recently, the Coalition made a substantial grant of direct financial aid to HeroHomes, an-other worthy organization, to assist five wounded veterans and their families with new homes that meet their different physical needs. The Coalition has also supported the Boulder Crest Retreat for Military and Veteran Wellness in Bluemont, yet another organiza-tion in my district that is doing tremendous work for veterans who need mental and phys-ical recovery from the suffering of war. I look forward to watching the Coalition to Salute America’s Heroes continue to make a meaningful difference in the lives of so many American heroes. The debt of gratitude owed to the men, women, and their families who have served as part of our nation’s armed forces is impossible to repay. I have been honored to recognize their sacrifice and sup-port efforts to empower members of the mili-tary as they adjust back to civilian life. To that end, I supported the Hire More Heroes Act, a common-sense bipartisan piece of legislation that will help create jobs for veterans transitioning to civilian careers. I am proud that the Coalition to Support America’s Heroes is based in my district in Leesburg and know they will continue to help brave men and women all across our country. The work they do cannot be overstated and I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the important work the Coalition to Salute America’s Heroes continues to do each day to help veterans.

HONORING FOUR SPECIAL WOMEN 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 3, 2016 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the House of Representatives to join me in honoring four special women in the District of Columbia who attend the Zion Baptist Church and will reach the significant milestone of turning 100 years old this summer. All four women are native Washingtonians, have known each other since early childhood and have remained lifelong friends. The Zion Bap-tist Church will officially recognize Ruth Eliza-beth Chatman Hammett (June 14, 1916), Gladys Ware Butler (July 4, 1916), Bernice Grimes Underwood (July 23, 1916) and Leona Costello Barnes (July 18, 1916) on June 18, 2016. As little girls, the four grew up together in Southwest D.C. and could not have predicted, as they reflected on the many years and changes that followed their lives, that they would one day celebrate their 100th birthdays together. As they grew up, got married and had children, they witnessed the shaping of a remarkable century. They had relatives who fought in World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. They felt hope listening to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the despair of the riots that wracked their beloved city after his assassination. As they settled into middle age, they saw their family mem-bers join in the civil rights struggle for equality as they lived out their days in the neighbor-hood, and they never imagined that their friendship would outlast the stoops and store-fronts. But in the 1950s, the area was marked for urban renewal and razed, decimating the com-munity as their church congregation and neighbors were eventually scattered. But de-spite this upheaval, the four women’s friend-ship persisted. They saw each other become grandmothers, great-grandmothers, and ‘‘great-great-greats’’. They still share fond memories of places and people that no one else remembers and by the age of 92, the four women thought that they had seen it all. But then something truly amazing happened that they never would have predicted. A black man became the President of the United States. To each of these four women it was the culmina-tion of a lifelong journey as black people in America, and they only wished that some of their relatives could have lived to witness such a historic event. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to join me in recognizing the full lives of Ruth Elizabeth Chatman Hammett, Gladys Ware Butler, Ber-nice Grimes Underwood, and Leona Costello Barnes, and in celebrating this momentous oc-casion, which they are sharing together as life-long friends. f 
LETTERS FROM NORTH SIDE ELE-MENTARY SCHOOL ON LONG IS-LAND SOUND 
HON. STEVE ISRAEL

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, June 3, 2016 Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share letters written to me by Mrs. Widyn’s 4th Grade Class at North Side Elementary School in East Williston about the importance of pre-serving Long Island Sound. It was a pleasure to visit this class and see how motivated they are to save our environment broadly, and Long Island Sound specifically. I would like to insert letters they wrote to me in the C

GRESSIONAL RECORD . 
DEAR CONGRESSMAN ISRAEL : I am writing to you so you can ask the Congress to set aside some money to keep the Long Island Sound clean. I have many reasons why we need to protect this beautiful body of water. One reason is that it is our greatest natural resource. Also, there are many animal habi-tats that are getting wrecked because of all the dirty garbage. Some of the animals are birds, wildlife and marine life. There is also a bird there that is endangered called the Piping Plover. The Piping Plover might be-come extinct if we keep this up. One last rea-son is that in a few years there would so much garbage and pollution that it will cost even more money to fix than it already does. I am 9 years old and I figured out the im-portance of keeping the Long Island Sound in good shape. I hope the people we elect to represent us gives this problem their consid-eration and that they understand the impor-tance of this big issue, not just for the people who live on the Long Island Sound, but for the environment that everybody shares. Sincerely, BRIANNA JANICEK . 
DEAR CONGRESSMAN ISRAEL : I am writing to you so you can ask Congress to give money to protect the Long Island Sound from being polluted! It is our greatest nat-ural resource! A reason why we need money to protect the Long Island Sound is we eat fish, oysters and clams from the Long Island Sound and nobody wants to eat fish, oysters or clams that have been in polluted water! Another reason is polluted water can cause habitat loss for marine life, and if there are no fish, the birds that eat fish will starve! Finally, many people like swimming in the Long Island Sound and if the water they’re swimming in is polluted, they will not want to swim there anymore! I am 9 years old, and realize how important the Long Island Sound is. I hope Congress sets aside money to protect the Long Island Sound! Thank you for reading my letter. Sincerely, G
RACE WONG. 
DEAR CONGRESSMAN ISRAEL : I am writing to because I think the Congress should set aside money to keep the Long Island Sound beautiful and clean. I think we should protect the Long Island Sound because it is our greatest natural re-source. It gives us five billion dollars in our economy. If the water is not clean, people will not want to come here anymore and we can kiss five billion dollars bye-bye. People who live near the Long Island Sound will want to move if the water is polluted be-cause dirty and filthy water will be washing against their houses. I would not want to live their either. Finally, wildlife and marine life will continue to decrease in population. The piping plover will eventually become ex-tinct if we continue to pollute the Long Is-land Sound. Also, the fish that we eat could be dirty and unhealthy for our body. I know I am only nine years old, but I take this very seriously. Thank you for reading my letter. I hope something is done to pro-tect the Long Island Sound. Sincerely, S
AHAMA DHAMA . 
DEAR CONGRESSMAN ISRAEL : I am writing to you so you can ask Congress to set aside money to keep the Long Island Sound clean and beautiful. There are many reasons why we need to protect this body of water. First of all, the Long Island Sound is one of our greatest resources. Also, if it is polluted many animals may die like birds, wildlife, and marine life. We should also have money for the Long Island Sound because it helps our economy. Fishing, tourism, and recre-ation take place on the Long Island Sound. I am 9 years old and I realize how impor-tant it is to keep the Long Island Sound pro-tected. I hope everyone who loves the Long Island Sound understands its importance for the future of our environment that we all share.

DEARCONGRESSMAN ISRAEL : I am a 9 year old boy who is writing a letter to you to ask Congress to give money to protect the Long Island Sound. Here are the three reasons why we should protect the Long Island Sound. First, the Long Island Sound is one of Long Island’s greatest resources. Second, habitat loss might happen if people keep polluting the Long Island Sound. The piping plover, birds, wildlife, and marine life may be lost. Lastly, water quality needs to be improved. Thank you for reading my letter and I hope you will ask Congress to realize how important it is to protect the Long Island Sound. Sincerely, J

DEAR CONGRESSMAN ISRAEL : I am writing to you so you can ask congress to give money to keep the Long Island Sound safe. There are many good reasons why we need to do this. I am 10 years old and I realize how impor-tant it is to keep this beautiful body of water safe. If we do not do this, it will cause habitat loss for wildlife, marine life and birds such as the piping plover. Also, it will make our waters polluted, so we need to have money to improve our water quality. And I believe the Long Island Sound is our greatest natural resource. I hope the people we elect to represent us understand the im-portance of this issue, not just for the people of Long Island but for the future of the envi-ronment we share. Sincerely, A
NTHONY LOPEZ. 
DEAR CONGRESSMAN ISRAEL , I am writing this letter to you because I want to keep the Long Island Sound clean and beautiful for everyone. I have 3 reasons why we should keep this body of water clean. I am 10 years old and in 4th grade. I know how important it is to keep the Long Island Sound protected. My first reason why we should keep the Long Island Sound clean is . . . It’s not ok for the people that live near the Long Island Sound to have dirty water with garbage in them coming up to their houses. My second reason is that all this gar-bage is hurting the marine life, and if people are fishing they might not get healthy fish. My 3rd reason is that if we do not stop this now, in the future there is going to be more garbage and it will cost more money and it will be harder to fix the Long Island Sound. Thank you for reading my letter and I hope we do something to help the Long Is-land Sound. Thank You for coming to my classroom. Sincerely, K
AYLA ROGAN . 
DEAR CONGRESSMAN ISRAEL : I am writing to you so you can ask Congress to set aside money to keep the Long Island Sound clean and beautiful. There are many reasons why we need to protect this body of water. One reason is that 20 million people live within 50 miles of the Long Island Sound. Also, animals can lose their habitats like the Piping Plover. Finally, it is our greatest nat-ural resource. I am 9 years old and I realize how impor-tant it is to keep the Long Island Sound Pro-tected. I hope that this letter will convince people to keep the Long Island Sound clean and safe. Thank you for reading my letter. Sincerely, C
HANELLE MOZA. DEAR CONGRESSMAN ISRAEL : I am writing to you so you can ask Congress to set money aside to keep the Long Island Sound clean and not polluted. I am 9 years old, and I know how impor-tant it is to keep the Long Island Sound pro-tected. I hope all of Congress understands how important it is to help the environment and the Sound. I think people should stop polluting the Sound so the marine animals under water are safe. People swim in this body of water so we need to make sure it stays clean. Thank you for reading my letter. I hope your ideas about the Long Island Sound are heard in Congress on the Long Island Sound. Sincerely, R
YLAN ROCKFELD . 
DEAR CONGRESSMAN ISRAEL : I am writing to you because I would like you to get money for the Long Island Sound so it will stay beautiful. There are many reasons to protect this water. I am ten years old, and I see how impor-tant it is to protect the Long Island Sound. We need to keep the Long Island Sound clean because there are birds that might take a sip of the water and if it’s polluted it would hurt the birds. There is marine life that needs to be protected. They might eat the trash from the Long Island Sound and die. If you catch a fish and the fish took in some polluted water, it would not be safe to eat. Another reason why we should ask congress for money is so we help clean the Long Island Sound and help marine animals. Sincerely, R
OBYN GARNOCK . 
DEAR CONGRESSMAN ISRAEL : I am writing this to you so you can protect the Long Is-land Sound. Please help protect the Long Is-land Sound and listen to my letter. I am 9 years old and love animals. Lots of people litter and that hurts the animals in the Long Island Sound. I am very worried some animals that live there will become ex-tinct. If Congress gives money, we can help keep the Long Island Sound clean. Also, we do not want the water in the Sound to be polluted. We need money to keep it clean. I would like clean water to drink and swim in. Another reason is the Long Island Sound is one of our greatest natural resources and we don’t want it ruined. Thank you for listening to my letter, and do the best you can do to keep the Long Is-land Sound safe! Sincerely, R
IOMALITO . 
DEAR CONGRESSMAN ISRAEL : I am writing to you so you can ask Congress to set aside money to keep the Long Island Sound clean and a nice place to live next to. There are many reasons why we need to protect this body of water. One reason we need to protect the Long Is-land Sound is to protect the animals that live in or next to it. We eat some of those animals and we don’t want to eat polluted animals. Another reason is we don’t want polluted water in our drinking water. One more reason we need to protect the Long Is-land Sound is it is one of our greatest nat-ural resources. We swim in the Long Island Sound and also play on beaches next to it. I am 9 years old, and I realize how impor-tant it is to keep the Long Island Sound safe. I hope the people we elect to represent us give this matter their consideration and un-derstand the importance of this issue, not only for people who live near the Long Island Sound, but for the future of the environment we all share. Thank you for reading my letter. I hope you are successful in obtaining funds to pro-tect the Long Island Sound. Sincerely, RAYEN KUO. 
DEAR CONGRESSMAN ISRAEL : I am writing to you so you can ask Congress to set aside money to keep the Long Island Sound clean and beautiful. There are many reason why we need to protect this body of water. First, most people come to live in Long Is-land because we have water around it so peo-ple can swim and go fishing. Another reason is all of the fish could be dead because of pol-lution in the Long Island Sound. Over 20 mil-lion people live less than 50 miles from the Long Island Sound. My fourth reason is Long Island Sound is one of our great resources. People like to go banana boating and tubing. How can we do all that if the Long Island Sound is not clean. I am 10 years old and I realize how impor-tant it is to keep the Long Island Sound pro-tected. I hope the people we elect to rep-resent us give this matter their consider-ation and understand the importance of this issue, people who live near the Long Island Sound, but for the future of the environment we all share. Thank you for reading my letter. I hope you are successful in obtaining funds to pro-tect the Long Island Sound. Sincerely, A
USTIN PRINCE . 
DEAR CONGRESSMAN ISRAEL : I am writing to ask Congress to set aside money to keep the Long Island Sound clean and a nice place to swim. There are many reasons why we need to protect the Long Island Sound. One reason to keep the long Island sound clean is because the Long Island Sound brings $5 billion to our economy. For exam-ple, people want to buy clean fish from a fish market and you wouldn’t want to buy fish with plastic in them. Also, if we keep on pol-luting the water, in the future we might have wiped out the piping plover species and a species of fish that might be endangered. Lastly, 20 million people live within 50 miles of the Long Island Sound. You don’t want polluted water and garbage on your beaches. I am 9 years old and I realize how impor-tant it is to keep the Long Island Sound pro-tected. I hope the people we elect to rep-resent us give this matter their consider-ation and understand the importance of the issue. Thank you for reading my letter. I hope you are successful in obtaining funds to pro-tect the Long Island Sound. Sincerely, A

to set aside money to keep the Long Island Sound clean and gorgeous. There are a lot of reasons. I am 10 years old and I wish we can protect the Long Island Sound so it is not polluted. There are more than 20 million people living near the shore of the Long Island Sound. People get fish from the Long Island Sound, so if fish take in polluted water we will eat the fish and we will have the polluted water inside our own body which is bad for us. Lastly, there is a lot of wildlife that live on the Long Island Sound. For example, the Piping Plover is endangered so we need to watch out before they are extinct. There is marine life and will harm the animals. This money is for the future of our lives. Thank you for reading my letter. I hope this will come true. Sincerely, A

DEAR CONGRESSMAN ISRAEL : I am writing to you so you can ask Congress to set aside money to keep the Long Island Sound clean and beautiful. I have some reasons why we need to protect this body of water. One reason is there are endangered animals that really need the Long Island Sound to live. Another reason is people come here to the Long Island Sound to swim and go boat-ing. I am 9 years old, and I realize how impor-tant it is to keep the Long Island Sound pro-tected. I really hope the people we elect to rep-resent us give this matter their consider-ation and understand the importance of the issue, not only for the people who live near the Long Island Sound, but for the future of the environment all of us share. Thank you for reading my letter. I hope you are successful in obtaining funds to pro-tect the Long Island Sound. Sincerely, N
ICOLE DAVIDOFF . DEAR CONGRESSMAN ISRAEL : I am writing this so I can ask you to save the Long Island sound by using money for it because it is really important. Money will help keep it clean and not polluted and animals will be saved. I am ten year old and I found out how im-portant the Long Island Sound is. We have to save the Long Island Sound. Polluted and everybody loves it. They love the Sound because the northern beaches have a lot of people that visit, but if the Long Island Sound gets polluted nobody will come to the beaches. Also, when you clean the water you can fish and sell it, but the water is polluted; fish and marine animals are dying and losing their habitats. If the Long Island Sound is not protected in the fu-ture nobody will go there. Thank you for reading my letter. I hope you will save the Long Island Sound. Sincerely, B
