PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: God of mercy, thank You for giving us another day. May the words of Eze-kiel stir our hearts. ‘‘The nations shall know that I am the Lord, says the Lord God, when in their sight I prove My holiness through you. . . . From all your idols, I will cleanse you. I will give you a new heart and place a new spirit within you, tak-ing from your bodies your stoney hearts and giving you natural hearts.’’ Lord God of prophets and politicians, through the campaigns, surface out fic-tion and malicious thoughts so that Your people may be led to America’s common concerns and the truth upon which to build anew. Deepen convic-tions in all contestants that their hearts may be naturally transformed by the response of the people and Your holy inspirations. We pray for civility in the weeks to come and peaceful resolve across our land, both now and forever. May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory. Amen.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will entertain up to five requests for 1-minute speeches on each side of the aisle. 
f 
RELEASE OLEG SENTSOV (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, in 2015, Russian authorities arrested Oleg Sentsov, Ukrainian filmmaker and human rights activist, for protesting the occupation of Crimea and sen-tenced him to 20 years in prison. On May 14 of this year, he began a hunger strike that has lasted over 130 days. Russia has unjustly imprisoned over 150 individuals. They suffer psy-chiatric confinement, closed trials, and harsh prison conditions. Russia also threatened to strip dissidents and members of religious minorities their parental rights. Oleg is in prison north of the Arctic Circle. He receives IV treatments of sa-line, amino acids, and vitamins. His sister reported in September that he thinks he will die soon. Mr. Speaker, I call upon Russian au-thorities to release Oleg Sentsov, and I call upon them to protect political free speech, religious liberty, and the sov-ereignty of international borders. f 
HONORING THE MEMORY OF THOSE WHO DIED AT THE ROUTE 91 HARVEST FESTIVAL (Ms. ROSEN asked and was given per-mission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. ROSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of the 58 innocent souls who were taken on Oc-tober 1. No words can describe the devasta-tion and heartbreak my community ex-perienced that night. So many families in Las Vegas and across the Nation are still grieving from this unspeakable tragedy, and their lives will never be the same. I am forever grateful to our first re-sponders, medical professionals, hotel and security staff, and the kindness of strangers who helped the wounded to the hospital and stood in line for hours to donate blood. We will never forget the selfless and heroic acts by men and women who risked it all and gave their lives for others that night. As we continue to heal, what we have always known about our community remains true: We are Vegas strong; we are resilient; and even in our darkest hour, we come together united. 
f 
APPLAUDING HURRICANE FLORENCE RECOVERY EFFORTS (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute and to re-vise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud the response to Hurricane Florence, which caused extensive damage in the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH9156 September 28, 2018 
Carolinas earlier this month. The mis-sion is far from over, but the Federal response has been swift, and the Na-tional Guard units from across the country have been working together to help in the recovery efforts. Proudly, members of the Pennsyl-vania National Guard are helping to provide shelter support. The level of professionalism and training shown during this recovery by guardsmen from across the country is commend-able. Mr. Speaker, there are many aspects of the recovery effort, including food assistance. I am pleased that USDA acted quickly to announce Disaster SNAP. Households that may not nor-mally be eligible for SNAP or food stamps may qualify for Disaster SNAP. Providing food assistance to neigh-bors in need is exactly why the SNAP program exists. Food security is an im-portant step toward bringing back nor-malcy and stability for families im-pacted by the disaster. Mr. Speaker, as our fellow Americans begin putting their lives back together, I am pleased to know that they will have help every step of the way. 
f 
PUBLIC CHARGE RULE (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Department of Homeland Security announced a proposed rule change that would increase the number of immigrants considered a public charge. This rule change is a dangerous de-parture from our current immigration policy. The administration is hurting immigrant families, including families that are U.S. citizens, by penalizing those who seek a green card or visa and use programs like SNAP, housing as-sistance, or Medicaid. This rule has the potential to impact about 1.8 million Texas children whose parents may forego critical needs like food and health assistance for their families in fear that, if they use these programs, it will hinder their access to citizenship. This is another step by the Trump administration to restrict im-migration into the country. In Houston, we have a long history of immigrants and newcomers bringing innovation, entrepreneurship, and hard work. It has made Houston what it is today. From the separation of our fam-ilies at the southern border to pun-ishing immigrant families for using programs they legally qualify for, I am deeply saddened by this administra-tion’s constant disregard for the chil-dren and their families. 
f 
THE CRIB ACT (Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute.) Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6, which we are voting on here today. H.R. 6 includes my legislation, the Car-ing Recovery for Infants and Babies Act, known as the CRIB Act. The most innocent victims of the opioid crisis are the precious newborn babies that were exposed to drugs dur-ing pregnancy. It simply breaks your heart. Three years ago, I helped start Lily’s Place in my hometown, a healthcare facility that has provided compas-sionate, loving healthcare to more than 200 newborn babies going through the ravages of withdrawal after birth. Passing the CRIB Act today will allow this one-of-a-kind program to be replicated around the country so every child gets the best possible chance for a healthy start in life. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my fellow Members to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 6, the CRIB Act. f 
FAA REAUTHORIZATION BILL (Mrs. HARTZLER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud the House passage of the FAA reauthorization bill, and I am delighted that the conference agree-ment includes provisions from my bill, the Safeguarding America’s Skies Act. These provisions provide the Depart-ments of Homeland Security and Jus-tice with the authority to use counterdrone technology to detect, monitor, and interdict drones that pose a threat to the safety and security of our country. We must face the reality that drone technology is being exploited to ad-vance crime and threaten our national security. Drones are used to smuggle illegal drugs across borders and contra-band into prisons. On the other side of the globe, terrorist groups are using drones to target U.S. forces and coali-tion partners. Unfortunately, under current law, most Federal agencies are prohibited from engaging with drones due to var-ious outdated laws. This legislation will provide our Federal law enforce-ment agencies with the tools necessary to protect U.S. citizens from criminal and nefarious acts. Our skies will be safer and our families will be safer. 
f 
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute and to re-vise and extend his remarks.) Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, as well as the many advocacy groups, health organizations, and constituents working with our offices, for ensuring an extension of the Violence Against Women Act while a long-term reau-thorization is finalized. This is a cru-cial first step toward ensuring that vic-tims of violence continue to have the resources they rely on and our law en-forcement officers can keep up the fight against domestic violence and sex crimes. VAWA is a landmark piece of legisla-tion enacted over two decades ago. It plays two very important roles: first, to prevent against violent crimes against women; and second, to provide care and assistance to women who were victims of violent crimes. VAWA has enhanced domestic vio-lence and stalking penalties, added protections for abused elderly and dis-abled women, helped to fight against sex trafficking, and addressed the rape kit backlog in many States. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to work-ing with my colleagues toward a long- term reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. f 
HEALTH EQUITY AND ACCESS FOR RETURNING TROOPS AND SERV-ICEMEMBERS ACT OF 2018 Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Energy and Com-merce, the Committee on Ways and Means, and the Committee on Armed Services be discharged from further consideration of the bill (H.R. 6886) to amend title 10, United States Code, to modify the requirement for certain former members of the Armed Forces to enroll in Medicare Part B to be eli-gible for TRICARE for Life, and to amend title XVIII of the Social Secu-rity Act to provide for coverage of cer-tain DNA specimen provenance assay tests under the Medicare program, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Texas? There was no objection. The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6886 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Health Eq-uity and Access for Returning Troops and Servicemembers Act of 2018’’ or the ‘‘HEARTS Act of 2018’’.

GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-bers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their re-marks and include extraneous material on H.R. 6760, currently under consider-ation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Speaker, for far too long, hard-working American taxpayers watched as an entitled Federal Government took a bigger and bigger slice from their family’s budget. But that changed last year. With the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we choose you, the hard-working taxpayers of this country. With our new Tax Code, we were de-termined to let you keep more of what you worked so hard to earn, and, boy, have the results been incredible. Eight months later, we have seen an economic turnaround with more jobs, bigger paychecks, and historic Main Street optimism. We have gone from asking, ‘‘Where are the jobs?’’ to ask-ing, ‘‘Where are the workers?’’ One Main Street small-business owner recently told me that, thanks to the new Tax Code, they are hiring more, giving bonuses, buying more equipment, and, as he said, they are set to have their best year ever. This has meant real change for real people, with nearly 1.7 million new jobs created just since January, and pay-checks rising at their fastest rate in 9 years. While this economic turnaround for America has come as a shock to oppo-nents of the new Tax Code here in Washington, it is no surprise to mil-lions of hardworking families and small businesses across America who were overtaxed and overregulated far too long. Thanks to our new pro-growth Tax Code, there is new hope and a new opti-mism in America that wasn’t here be-fore. To call it a sudden change from the sluggish Obama-era economy would be an understatement. For a decade, it was like America’s economy was going through a 25-mile-per-hour zone. Now that the high taxes and the un-competitive regulations of our Demo-cratic friends are gone, we are on an open highway again. It is critical that we keep this strong momentum going, especially for Americans who were hit hardest by the Great Recession. That is what this bill before us today is all about. By making the new code permanent for our families and small businesses, the Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act will keep America’s economy booming and mid-dle class families growing again. In fact, the nonpartisan Tax Founda-tion estimates that this bill will add 1.5 million new jobs and increase Amer-ica’s economy over 2 percent. That is on top, as I said, of the 1.7 million new jobs we have already seen created since President Trump signed the new Tax Code into law.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH9166 September 28, 2018 
We don’t want to go back to the bad old days of higher taxes, with Wash-ington taking more of what our single moms, our hardworking parents, and our Main Street-owned business owners have worked so hard to earn. We don’t want to go back to the bad old days when Main Street wasn’t hiring, jobs were going overseas, and our economic growth was puttering along. So given the choice between keeping taxes high and allowing families to keep more of their money, Republicans chose, and continue to choose, the American people. I thank Representative R
ODNEY  D
AVIS for introducing this bill, and Representative M
ARK MEADOWS and Representative M
ARK WALKER , along with all of our Republican Ways and Means members, for being the original cosponsors and leaders of this bill. In closing, empowering families to run their own lives is at the heart of the American Dream. It is the key to America’s economic success, and it is the reason that 8 months after tax re-form became law, Americans are more hopeful about their future and the American Dream. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self 3 minutes. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Republican tax sham. It has been 8 months since the Re-publicans passed their massive, unpaid- for tax cut without a single Demo-cratic vote. At that time, Democrats and independent experts warned that their so-called tax reform plan that wasn’t paid for and that was so heavily skewed to the wealthy and big corpora-tions would harm our economy and damage important programs like Medi-care and Social Security. Now we are beginning to see what many of us feared coming true. Health insurance companies in State after State are announcing higher premiums for next year, while health coverage for those living with preexisting condi-tions happens to be on the chopping block. To make matters worse, the Medi-care trustees have cut 3 years off the life of the Medicare trust fund because of the Republican tax bill. Think of it: This vote this morning will add $631 billion to the national debt, on top of the $2.3 trillion that they have already embraced with the recklessness of their tax package. But instead of backing away from this mistake, they are doubling down this morning. Their second round of tax cuts for the wealthy will further compromise the future of Medicare and Social Security, depriving seniors of the benefits that they have earned. Today’s bill will, once again, dem-onstrate that they are hardly the party of fiscal rectitude or conservatism. The original tax bill, as I noted a moment ago, adds $2.3 trillion to the debt. So that people understand, this is all borrowed money that will go to cor-porations and high-income earners, who undoubtedly will receive the bulk of these benefits in the tax cut. Now, Republicans want to give the most well-off and well-connected Americans even more tax cuts with their new proposal, again, emphasizing the following: an additional $3 trillion of debt, all based upon borrowed money. The Republicans are doubling down on this tax law’s attack and, once again, harming the American middle class. There is virtually nothing in here that comes to the aid of the mid-dle class, because they give it to them on one hand and take it away on the other. This proposal would make permanent the $10,000 cap on the State and local tax deduction for individuals, even while corporations will face no limits on their SALT deductions. This, at the same time, we should recognize, elimi-nates many tax incentives and pretty important incentives for middle class families to get ahead. So, once again, this package, like the one before it, is being rushed through with no hearings, with no witnesses, and with no input from stakeholders. A rushed and lopsided process resulted in the disaster that we voted on just weeks ago. In fact, my staff has identi-fied more than 100 problems with this proposal, and we are happy to share those with any who are interested. This provision that we are voting on today is reckless, and it is a cut for the wealthy that leaves behind hard-working families. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 2 minutes to the gen-tleman from Illinois (Mr. D
AVIS), the leader and the original sponsor of this bill. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my bill, H.R. 6760, the Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act of 2018. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman B
RADY , the entire Ways and Means Committee, and the Ways and Means staff for their hard work in getting tax reform 2.0 to the House floor. Last December, this Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. That legis-lation was the first major tax reform in 31 years and delivered on our promise to bring tax relief to middle class fami-lies across the country. In fact, in my district in central Illi-nois, the average family of four mak-ing the median income of $78,500 will see a tax cut of roughly $2,200 this year. That is certainly not crumbs, Mr. Speaker. Since passage of tax reform, we have seen historic growth in our economy. It currently sits at 3.9 percent unemploy-ment, with approximately 6.6 million open jobs, and a GDP last quarter of 4.2 percent. With companies raising wages and increasing benefits, it is no wonder 90 percent of workers are seeing bigger paychecks, thanks to last year’s tax cuts. Unfortunately, last year, the con-straints of the budget reconciliation process in the Senate forced us to sun-set many of the provisions found with-in that act. H.R. 6760 simply makes those sunsetting provisions permanent. These provisions include the ex-panded child tax credit, which we in-creased from $1,000 to $2,000; the new double standard deduction; and the im-proved tax brackets, which have low-ered rates for all taxpayers. As the economy continues to reach new heights, H.R. 6760 represents our continued commitment to the millions of hardworking middle class Americans who have benefited from the tax cuts enacted last year. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support middle class families by voting for this bill. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Cali-fornia (Mr. THOMPSON ), a very valued member of the Ways and Means Com-mittee. Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill. This bill represents a gross disregard for the responsibilities entrusted to us by our constituents. We are the stew-ards of Medicare, a critical support for nearly every American at some point in their lives. This bill will trigger hundreds of millions of dollars in across-the-board cuts to that impor-tant program. We are responsible for the Federal Tax Code, a charge that requires us to consider tax proposals fully and fairly. Yet, we will vote on this unpaid-for tax bill developed behind closed doors without the benefit of a single hearing. Most important, we are the custodians of the Federal budget. With passage of this bill, Republicans will have added more than $3 trillion to our national debt in less than a year. This is a handout for the rich at the ex-pense of our children and our grand-children. It is an excuse for the major-ity party to ransack Medicare and So-cial Security. It is dangerous, and it is reckless. We should vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. W
ALKER ), one of the three original leaders of this bill. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has transformed the economy, delivering economic growth in the form of more jobs, bigger pay-checks, increased investment, and his-torically high small business opti-mism. Today, I rise in support as an origi-nal cosponsor of H.R. 6760, the Pro-tecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act of 2018. I thank Chairman B
RADY for his tire-less work over the last year and a half to make this legislation possible, con-tinuing to build on the success of the

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act by locking in those tax cuts for individuals, families, and small businesses. Today’s bill makes permanent the transformational tax reforms included in the legislation we enacted last De-cember. Mr. Speaker, locking in those impor-tant reforms provides certainty and en-hances growth. In fact, according to the Tax Foundation’s analysis, making these reforms permanent will create 1.5 million new jobs, increase wages by nearly a full percentage point, and in-crease the overall GDP by 2.2 percent. Those are facts. Locking in these important reforms reduces burdensome complexity. Be-cause of this legislation, the vast ma-jority of individuals and families will choose the enhanced standard deduc-tion and will no longer need to do the recordkeeping required for itemizing deductions. The alternative minimum tax, which requires individuals and families to calculate their tax twice each year and pay the higher amount, will be elimi-nated for close to 96 percent of those who have had to pay in 2017. A recent Tax Foundation study shows that a re-duction in time spent on tax compli-ance that is expected to come from the simplification in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will, indeed, translate into savings of $3.1 billion to $5.4 billion for individ-uals and families. Locking in these important reforms will fuel the small businesses that fuel the American economy. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act delivered lower tax rates in a new 20 percent de-duction for pass-through business in-come. Today’s bill locks in those bene-fits. Mr. Speaker, now is the time to keep our economy booming and protect the family and small business tax reforms delivered last December. I urge my col-leagues to support this and help lock in these benefits for all Americans by passing H.R. 6760. b0930 Mr. NEAL. A reminder, Mr. Speaker, that this is $3 trillion of borrowed money to provide for a tax cut for the wealthy. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. L
EVIN), who is a longtime and valuable member of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I ask so- called fiscal conservatives: Why add to the deficit $3 trillion? I guess it is consistency. If you dig a hole, dig it deeper. Oh, it is for workers. Workers? One-half of the top percent get 50 percent of the benefit. It won’t pass the Senate. So why do it? They thought it would be politically helpful. Now it is turning out it won’t be. It is going to be immigration. This is a desperate move. It is desperately wrong. Mr. Speaker, I urge we vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. SMITH), who is one of our key members on the Ways and Means Committee from rural commu-nities on this tax reform bill. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speak-er, I thank the chairman for his time and certainly his leadership on this issue. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill to make permanent the tax cuts for families and small businesses we passed last year through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. I am particularly pleased this bill also makes permanent the grain glitch fix we enacted last spring. This important provision ensures producers and buyers across agri-culture could benefit from tax reform as intended. This bill also continues the treatment of property taxes on ag-ricultural land and property as a fully deductible business expense, which is vital to ag producers in Nebraska’s Third Congressional District as well as across the country. The initial version of tax reform we moved out of the Ways and Means Committee and passed in this House last year provided permanent tax re-lief, and our families, farmers, ranch-ers, and small businesses deserve the certainty of knowing their taxes will not increase. I am disappointed we could not get this permanence through the Senate last year, but I am pleased we have another opportunity to do so. This year our economy is booming with economic growth continuing above 3 percent, and the certainty of permanence will allow our small busi-nesses to make future investments and families to know they can keep more of their paychecks as well as plan for the future. Mr. Speaker, I urge strong support for this bill. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. D
ANNY K. D AVIS), who is a very valuable member of the Ways and Means Committee and the voice of Chi-cago. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to another tax giveaway to the wealthiest in this country who need it the least. The Republicans’ tax cut already has damaged the health of the Medicare trust fund. This bill is more of the same. After decades of wage stagnation, when over 41 million laborers earn less than $12 an hour, when almost none of their employers offer health insurance, when more than one-quarter of Ameri-cans struggle to cover housing costs, this Republican bill helps millionaires giving an average tax cut of over $39,000 to the top 1 percent. The Republican plan will perma-nently double tax over 40 million fami-lies due to the cap on the State and local income tax deduction. The Republican plan permanently takes away critical personal exemp-tions from millions of families with children which we need to help. We need to help hardworking, middle-class citizens. We don’t need to give $39,000 tax breaks to the wealthy. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I’m very proud to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. SMITH), who is a key member of our Ways and Means Committee and who played, again, such a leadership role on tax reform for small businesses and ag-riculture. Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this legisla-tion. Last year, Congress partnered with our President, President Trump, to lower taxes and put more money in the hands of our American people. I heard from the other side how the tax cut was just basically crumbs and scraps. But in my district in southern Mis-souri, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act makes a real difference. In the 9 months that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has passed, I have trav-eled throughout my district, and I have seen small businesses in West Plains, Missouri that told me: Congressman, because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, I can now build a new building. I have spoken to workers in St. James, in Rolla, in Caruthersville, in Cape Girardeau, in Perryville, in Sikeston, in Malden, in Bernie, in Gainesville, in Theodosia, and all the other 29 counties in our congressional district of how their wages have in-creased and how these employees have benefited from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. I have spoken to mothers who, be-cause of their wages being increased, were able to purchase new child seats in their cars. These were real tax breaks. These were real advantages. For people in my congressional dis-trict, the median income is $40,000 a year. It is not scraps. It is not crumbs. It makes a real difference. It is car payments, it is house payments, and it is food on the table. Mr. Speaker, we need to make sure that this is permanent. This bill was not permanent because of some arcane Senate rules that allowed it to just be temporary. I am hoping that the other side will join us today in making sure that we deliver this tax relief perma-nently for families in southeast Mis-souri and families throughout this country. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, a reminder, this is $3 trillion of borrowed money for this tax plan that the Republicans are offering. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. K
IND), who is a very important member of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I rise in op-position to this legislation because this bill today, again, shatters one of the greatest cons ever perpetrated on the American people, that the modern-day national Republican Party is the party of fiscal responsibility.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH9168 September 28, 2018 
The three bills that we have before us this week, coupled with the tax cut version that passed last year, will add over $5 trillion to our national debt at a time when 70 million baby boomers are fully invested in Social Security and Medicare, giving them the excuse later on to come back and say that we have to cut Social Security and Medi-care because we don’t have revenue anymore. If we are entrusted with the majority next year, we will do tax reform the right way. We will simplify it, we will make it more competitive, we will cer-tainly make it fair, and we will do it fiscally responsibly by shutting down extraneous loopholes in the Code to pay for it. We will do it with hearings and with the proper feedback which was lacking here. For all these reasons, Mr. Speaker, we should reject this bill and do tax re-form the right way. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 2 minutes to the gen-tlewoman from South Dakota (Mrs. N
OEM), who is a key member of the Ways and Means Committee. Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to clarify. I firmly disagree with my colleague on the other side of the aisle who just talked about Social Security and Medi-care. In fact, the economic statistics that have recently come back have talked about how the Medicare trust fund and how Social Security are actu-ally doing better since we did this his-toric tax cut bill because more people are working. They are earning more money. They are paying into those pro-grams, and those programs are more secure into the future because we did historic tax reform. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of the Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act—a key compo-nent of tax reform 2.0. I strongly sup-port this legislation, because I worked on it for many years, but also because of the stories I hear across South Da-kota every day. I had, several months ago, a single mom of two kids come up to me. She is a bank teller. She told me that because of tax reform that her check is $80 big-ger every 2 weeks. That meant that her 10-year-old son could get new basket-ball shoes this year instead of going out and trying to find some that were used from another student who had outgrown them. I also had another woman from Platte, South Dakota, contact my of-fice and tell me that because of tax re-form and tax cuts—her family doesn’t usually get much money. They don’t make a lot of money. Their wages aren’t great. But because of that bill, they have more money in their pockets today. It has made a huge difference in paying their day-to-day bills. Mr. Speaker, there are dozens of other stories that I could tell you from folks across the State of South Dakota of the benefits of tax reform. Our en-ergy costs have gone down. Our utility bills have gone down. Companies have paid increasing wages for families. They have also paid out bonuses. The tax cuts have been life changing for many in our State. With that passage and with the pas-sage of this bill today, we will have the opportunity to ensure the upward eco-nomic trajectory we have experienced because of a permanent culture of growth and stability that is rooted in the Tax Code. So tax reform 2.0 is going to make sure that with the benefits families are enjoying today they will still be able to enjoy them long into the future. While no tax plan is perfect in everybody’s eyes, I am optimistic that this package today will have a huge benefit for the people of South Dakota. Our Tax Code should help people, not punish them. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of my legislation today. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, a reminder that this adds $3 trillion of debt that is all borrowed money. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. B
LU-
MENAUER ), who is a champion of all issues related to infrastructure in America. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I heard the gentlewoman from South Da-kota talk about all the stories that she could tell. Sadly, that is what our Re-publican friends have done. They want to tell stories cherry-picked, but they are afraid to have hearings from the people whom this affects. We haven’t heard from the experts, from the aca-demics, and from people in business. They were afraid to have hearings on their tax bill, rushing it through, and they didn’t even know what was in it. Now they are doubling down, adding another trillion dollars of debt without having a foundation factually to let the people know what is going on. Look at their budget. They have de-clared war on Social Security and on Medicare. They understand that it is not sustainable. The tax cuts don’t pay for themselves. They are putting at risk things that America cares about like Social Security and like Medi-care—fundamental issues that matter. I hope that if the American public entrusts us with the control of Con-gress next year that we will go for-ward, listen to them, make it trans-parent, and base it on facts. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, because of tax reform, Main Street businesses are booming. The chairman of the Small Business Committee has played a key role in that. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 2 minutes to the gentlemen from Ohio (Mr. C
HABOT ). Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding and for his leadership on this very important issue. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6760, the Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act. As chairman of the House Small Business Committee, I have closely examined the effects that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that we pre-viously passed has had on America’s small businesses, on startups, and on entrepreneurs. From a Small Business Committee hearing that I chaired in July that re-viewed the impact of that law on Main Street companies to the many small business optimism surveys that are published on a monthly business, the results are in, and they are positive for our Nation’s 30 million small busi-nesses that about half of the workers in this country work for. They work for small businesses. The tax cuts have provided small businesses with the opportunity to in-vest in their workers, invest in their equipment, and invest in their dreams. A small business owner in my district in southern Ohio recently testified: ‘‘The recent tax reduction will have a positive impact on our employees in 2018 and beyond.’’ The shops on Main Street all across America are transforming our commu-nities and neighborhoods with job growth and business expansion, and that means jobs for more Americans. With our economic engines starting to rev, Congress should take the next step in the tax debate, which is making the tax cuts for our Nation’s job cre-ators permanent. That is what we are doing here today. Making section 199A, the small busi-ness pass-through provision, stronger will be a benefit to small businesses from my State of Ohio and to our States all across the country, from coast to coast. I applaud the work of Mr. DAVIS, Mr. B
RADY , and the other members of the Ways and Means Committee on this issue. It has been very important. When our Nation’s small businesses, entrepreneurs, and startups are thriv-ing, so are their employees, the fami-lies of those employees, and America’s consumers. b0945 Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. P
ASCRELL ). Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, this is the sequel to ‘‘Weekend at Bernie’s.’’ But this doesn’t work. The headline yesterday in The Wash-ington Post was: GOP Campaigns Ditch Touting Tax Law in Ads. The first one stunk. This is even worse. Republican economist Douglas Holtz- Eakin, a good, good guy, said this past May: ‘‘There’s just no evidence that the tax cuts actually pay for them-selves.’’ Of course they don’t. That is why you are targeting healthcare. That is why you are targeting Medicare. That is why you are targeting Social Security. You already targeted Medicaid. In New Jersey—we are still a State— the average SALT deduction claimed in 2016 was more than the $10,000 limit. In my district, the average is over $18,000. One of the counties in my dis-trict is $24,000.

What have you done? That means the average taxpaying household—New Jersey, listen up—now has to pay in-come tax on an additional $14,000 worth of income. We may have 12 Democrats by the end of the election. If they are a middle-class family being taxed at 24 percent, that is an extra $3,400 they have to come up with at tax time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from New Jersey an addi-tional 1 minute. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, for hundreds of thousands of New Jersey families, that is a mortgage payment; that is a tuition bill; that is money for unexpected medical bills. Instead, it is going to be moving to pay more bills in Montana and South Dakota. I offered an amendment to restore the full SALT. So every Member who votes for this monstrosity today is vot-ing to make the SALT caps forever and to impose a permanent tax on middle- class families. It is mind-boggling that a Member would want to hammer his constituents like that. I ask my colleagues: How could you vote to punish your middle-class con-stituents to give even more money to the 1 percent? What is even more fascinating, a number of people on the other side, Mr. Speaker, no wonder they are voting for this thing today. They get less than 1 percent of the donations from folks like you and me. So that is why they are tuned in to corporate America. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. A
LLEN ), who started a small business at age 25 and built it up from the ground up. Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership on this important bill. Yes, I came from the small business world. Let me tell you, in my district, the small businesses are back, and I am proud to support tax reform 2.0, legisla-tion that will build upon the tremen-dous success of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law last year. After 31 years under an old, outdated, and burdensome Tax Code that stifled our economy and plagued our job cre-ators, America simply needed a change. I am happy to say that we delivered on our promise of comprehensive tax re-form to the American people, and we are seeing new levels of economic growth and optimism around the coun-try—and we are not done yet. In the month of August alone, Geor-gia added over 12,000 jobs, and the un-employment rate fell below 3.8 percent. We are committed to keeping this mo-mentum going. Tax reform 2.0 will lock in the mid-dle-class and small business tax cuts permanently, allowing families to more easily save their hard-earned money for retirement, helping local businesses promote retirement plans to workers, promoting startup businesses, and much more. As a cosponsor of tax reform 2.0, I en-courage all my colleagues to join me today in supporting this important leg-islation that will unleash the economic engine that is the American family and small business. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-fornia (Ms. SA´NCHEZ ), the vice chair of the Democratic Caucus. Ms. SA´NCHEZ. Mr. Speaker, I stand here today saddened, but, quite frank-ly, not shocked, at the irresponsibility of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I guess their giveaway to the ultrawealthy wasn’t enough last time around, so they have come back for round two: a fake tax reform 2.0. When the bill for this new gimmick eventually comes due, I am terrified Republicans will pay for it by gutting Social Security and Medicare, two earned benefit programs on which my constituents rely. I have heard a lot of rhetoric about how today’s bill will help the middle class, but the only thing that today’s legislation guarantees is adding at least $3 trillion more to the deficit over just a period of 10 years. And who picks up the tab? Middle- class Americans, that is who. They are working families who are being priced out of home ownership, saving for re-tirement, or trying to put their kids through school. I urge my colleagues to vote down this terrible bill and let common sense reign. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. D
OGGETT ). Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, today’s sorry’s sequel is as phony as the origi-nal Republican tax sham. It comes from an administration for whom truth is a stranger, clocked in, by one anal-ysis, at 7
1⁄2lies, on the average, per day. But even for such an administra-tion, this bill is based on a true whop-per. Here we have it from the Executive Office of the President telling us as his official administration policy that for every American family, the average household income will be increased by at least $4,000, annually. Yet today, fewer than 5 percent of American fami-lies have gotten a dime increase in their income as a result of this bill. Truly, a giant whopper. But like the promise that Mexico would pay for the wall, that drug com-panies would bring down their prices, all we have is more misrepresentation today. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Texas an additional 1 minute. Mr. DOGGETT. Corporate giants who got giant tax breaks gave them back to some of their shareholders and their CEOs, but they didn’t increase wages for workers or give more than a hand-ful any compensation as a result of this. Now, here on election eve, we have a proposal where they are telling the American taxpayers: We promise relief in seven years, which is what this bill does. Families can’t put off rising healthcare costs or their other needs for seven years. But there is one American family who does really well out of this bill. It is the family of Donald J. Trump. They got a special provision written into the bill that this proposal freezes into per-manent law that gives them a tax windfall, most likely of millions of dol-lars. That is what this bill was all about: helping Donald Trump, his cronies, and allies, not helping the American peo-ple. The first tax bill was a hit-and-run job. With this second bill, Republicans back up and run over working families again. Democrats need to take the wheel and help Americans get some money in their own wallet. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. Mr. Speaker, let me just fact-check my colleague from Texas. Since the tax reform bill became law on New Year’s Day, 1.7 million jobs have been created in America, with wages rising at the fastest rate in 9 years. Today, following these new policies, the median income for a married cou-ple with two kids has $3,200 more in their take-home pay than it did just 12 months ago. I will remind the voters in Mr. DOG-
GETT ’s district that an average family of four making $60,000 a year sees a tax cut of $1,131 that my Democratic col-leagues want to steal back. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Ala-bama (Ms. S
EWELL ). Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speak-er, less than a year after the first dis-astrous tax bill, here we are voting on another bill that will double down on this betrayal and put hardworking families who are working every day to make ends meet even further into debt. As my constituents remember, the first tax law cost us $2.3 trillion. Those working to reach the middle class will see less investment in their commu-nities; will see their Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid shrink; and will see the costs of healthcare insur-ance rise. It is unconscionable that Republicans are trying to pass another batch of tax cuts that will add another $650 billion to the $2.3 trillion they have already spent through the Tax Code. This will end up costing us $5 trillion over the next 20 years. Vote ‘‘no’’ on this reckless tax cut. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH9170 September 28, 2018 
Arizona (Mr. S CHWEIKERT ), a key leader and member of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, be-fore comments, this was my first term on the Ways and Means Committee. I will tell you that, both on the Demo-cratic side and the Republican side, is a group of very special Members, hav-ing been on other committees, even in moments like this, where we see the world very differently. Everyone is freaky smart, incredibly respectful, and if they could see what goes on in the back where we actually get along, it is a very special committee. But the fact of the matter is we sort of see the world very differently. Have you ever had that moment where you were walking up to the po-dium and you were going to read some-thing? I was going to originally read the comments from a number of Mem-bers, particularly on the other side, who were incredibly critical of the fact that many of these tax cuts expired and now they are complaining that we are extending them. We do have this sort of body where we race to whatever the current argument is. But that would actually be a little hard to do, right after saying such nice things about everyone. So let’s actually have a couple of comments on the reality of what we see in the math. Do you remember when the tax bill passed, the math was that we needed a 0.4 percent growth in GDP over 10 years and the tax reform paid for itself? How are we doing so far? We have had, now, multiple revisions upward. Something is working out there in our society when you see more jobs than workers; when you see, in my community, the populations that have had a really rough decade with the growth recession of the last decade, they have jobs. There are good things happening. You would think there would be al-most this joy on both the left and the right when you see job training in our Arizona prisons. We actually brought one of the three-time convicted felons to testify in the Ways and Means Com-mittee. It is so hard for this body to ac-tually give a little and say: Look at the great societal things that are hap-pening right now. Also, we have the backup on the math. If we do not have substantial economic growth this decade and next, we can’t keep our societal promises. I would like to argue, when we get beyond this, we have the conversation of: What does tax reform do for future economic expansion? Again, yes, we are going to have to talk about a lot of dif-ficult things to keep that economic ex-pansion, but the baseline math—and I know we are only 8, 9 months into the data—it is working. Could we at least have a little sound of joy for what is working? Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-fornia (Ms. P
ELOSI ), the highly effec-tive Democratic leader. Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for his extraordinary leadership in representing the House Democrats as the ranking member on the Ways and Means Committee. He brings to that position the values shared by the American people of fairness, trans-parency, and openness in what goes on here in Congress, and doing so in a way that is accountable to the American people. So I thank him for his leader-ship. b1000 Sadly, I come to the floor again to talk against, yet again, another Repub-lican tax scam. The gentleman who just spoke talked about how we should be filled with joy—filled with joy. Well, if we are talking about emo-tion, let us talk about St. Augustine. St. Augustine, 17 centuries ago—17 cen-turies ago, 1,700 years ago—said: ‘‘A State which is not governed according to justice is just a bunch of thieves.’’ Pope Benedict, who quoted Augus-tine, said: ‘‘The State must inevitably face the question of how justice can be achieved here and now.’’ Benedict cau-tioned against the danger of certain ethical blindness caused by the daz-zling effect of power and special inter-est. That is what they talked about. This is about justice, justice for our country in terms of economic justice, justice in our society in terms of every-one participating in the prosperity of America and not, yet again, the warmed-over stew of trickle-down eco-nomics. If you give 83 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent—glory, alleluia—it may trickle down on you. If it does not, so be it. That is what the former speaker said: So be it. Let me quote some of the Repub-licans, enforcing what I said earlier. Who are these tax scams for? Congressman CHRIS COLLINS said: ‘‘My donors are basically saying, ‘Get it done or don’t ever call me again.’’’ Senator L
INDSEY GRAHAM said the fi-nancial contributions will stop if this— and I say—if this tax scam fails. Here we are again. Here we are again at a time, on this last day of the ses-sion, as this body prepares to pack its bags and return home for the next 6 weeks, the GOP’s priorities have been laid bare, as we waste our final mo-ments debating a new version of the Republicans’ same old tax scam, with no accountability, no transparency, and no fairness for the American peo-ple. The first GOP tax scam for the rich added $2 trillion to the national debt, when you talk about the tax cut plus the interest on the debt, sticking our children with a bill for massive tax breaks for Big Pharma, big banks, big corporations, making it more profit-able for them to ship jobs overseas, and the wealthiest 1 percent. People across America have raised their voices to condemn the Repub-licans’ plan to spend trillions on tax cuts for the wealthy. What is so sad about it is, in their first tax scam, they decided that they would set up a thing where the individual mandate was re-pealed and, therefore, the benefit of preexisting condition no longer barring you from having access to health insur-ance. Their first tax scam was an as-sault on the preexisting condition ben-efit in the Affordable Care Act. Not only that—that was not good enough for them—the President went further in his budget and said: We have increased the debt. Now we have to pay for it, because, contrary to the illusion that our Republicans like to present, these tax breaks do not ever pay for themselves. Don’t take it from me. Those who have worked even with Jack Kemp have said: Anybody who tells you that these tax breaks pay for themselves is telling you something that is not true, is nonsense, and is BS, except he said the whole word in our testimony. So here they are. Now they have to pay for it. Where are they going to get the money? They have just given 83 percent of the benefits to the top 1 per-cent, a big tax break for corporations, enabling them to send jobs overseas. And who is going to pay for it? Well, in the President’s budget, to make up for the $2 billion plus, they cut $500 billion from Medicare; $1.4 tril-lion from Medicaid, legislation that is not just about poor children but mid-dle-income seniors, a benefit for mid-dle-income seniors; $214 billion from food stamps, a benefit needed by our seniors, by our veterans, by our poor children in America. All of this is to pay for tax cuts for the rich. So here we are again. Imagine what the Republicans will try to do after adding trillions more to the deficit. Their intentions are clear. The Presi-dent’s adviser—whatever his title is now—Larry Kudlow, his top economic chief, said: If Republicans control Con-gress, they will immediately move to cut the larger entitlements, probably next year. In budget after budget, Republicans have made their plan perfectly clear: Add trillions to the deficit with their GOP tax scams for the rich, and then use those deficits to justify slashing Medicare, Medicaid, and, actually, dis-ability benefits for people on Social Se-curity. Added $2 trillion to the debt with their first tax scam, putting forward a budget that would, again, claw millions of dollars back from seniors and hard-working Americans, and now they want to do it again. Well, don’t take it from me. AARP wrote a letter to Congress yesterday to warn against the grievous damage that would be done by the second phase of Republicans’ deficit-exploding tax scam. They wrote: ‘‘We have grave concerns about H.R. 6760. AARP is troubled by the further negative effect this bill will have on the Nation’s ability to fund critical priorities.’’ They then said: ‘‘The Joint Com-mittee on Taxation estimates that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H9171 September 28, 2018 
H.R. 6760 will reduce Federal revenue by approximately $631 billion over the 10-year budget window. This is in addi-tion to the $1.5 trillion reduction in revenue over the 10-year budget win-dow resulting from last year’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.’’ Revenue, revenue that can be used for investment. Think of what we could have done with those resources to build the infrastructure of America, a small piece of it to address the pension crisis in America, the recognition that in-vestments in education are the best in-vestments we can make, because noth-ing brings more to the Treasury than investments in education. Instead, we have this. The AARP goes on to say: ‘‘Addi-tional increases of this magnitude in the deficit will inevitably lead to calls for greater spending cuts, which are likely to include cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and other important pro-grams serving older Americans.’’ The letter concludes: ‘‘AARP cannot support H.R. 6760.’’ Again, here we are. They give this big tax break. They say people are going to get raises and bonuses. Some got bonuses. That is good. If you worked there a long time and the rest, you got a bonus. But it didn’t add to your base salary, which would have been the important increase for people to make. One estimate by Goldman Sachs was that there would be, following the former tax bill, $1 trillion in buybacks; in other words, corporations buying back their stock—not investing in their workforce, not recognizing that their success depends on the produc-tivity of the workforce and that any increase in productivity should also in-clude an increase in the wages of the workers, but, instead, an increase in the compensation for the CEO. It is shameful. To conclude on that point, there is a better way to do this. There could have been, instead of as they did with the first tax scam and now this one—the first one in the dark of night and in the speed of light, putting forth a bill that they almost didn’t even know what they were voting for. That did a grave injustice to our Nation for what it de-prives us of by giving these tax breaks at the high end. There is a way to do it. Mr. N
EALhas suggested it over and over again. Let’s see what we have done before. Ronald Reagan, Tip O’Neill, 1986, al-most a year of hearings and trans-parency and openness where the public could see and people could understand what it meant to them in their lives. Instead, they just go into those rooms, and say: How can we, how can we, how can we milk the public? How can we exploit the taxpayer by adding to the wealth of the wealthiest 1 per-cent in our country? It is shameful. As St. Augustine said, unless a gov-ernment is formed to promote justice, it is just a bunch of thieves. We are robbing from our children’s future with this national debt. We are robbing from the participation in the full benefits of our prosperity, of our workers, in our country. We are rob-bing our Nation’s ability to be itself, to make America good again. In doing so, again, to have people have financial stability in their lives, so that they can be entrepreneurial, so that they can take risk, so that they can invest in their children’s future. It is not only good for the individual taxpayer or person in our country; it is good for our country, because it makes us competitive in the world with our values and with our economy. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I note that the average middle class family in the 12th District of California will see a tax cut of $5,508 each year. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. WENSTRUP ), a key member of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I find it interesting that I keep hearing that the tax reforms were for the rich. The only phone calls I got complaining about our tax reform were from the rich. I had one gentleman call me and ac-tually say: For those of us with three or four homes, this is going to kill us. Are you kidding me? And you keep saying this is a tax break for the rich. They are the only ones complaining to me. As a former small-business owner, I can tell you how difficult it is to plan for the future. When you sit down to look at your company’s finances, you may be worried about paying your em-ployees’ salaries or making the rent on time. So many in this body, historically, have never run a business, yet they have historically done a very good job of running some businesses into the ground. The last thing any business owner wants to think about is: I won-der what the Federal Government is going to do to my taxes 5, 10, 15 years from now. Constant uncertainty does not work for the American people. High taxes don’t work for the American people. People want to keep their money. The House of Representatives is pre-pared to remedy these concerns for many years to come. The Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act of 2018 that is on the floor today as part of tax reform 2.0 would make lower tax rates for all income levels permanent. Critically, this bill permanently ex-tends a major deduction for pass- through businesses, which make up most of the small businesses in the U.S. This is significant peace of mind for the barbershop in town, for your neighbor’s lawn care business, for the garage-to-Main Street startups, and for the millions of business dreams that, for now, are still dreams. Mr. Speaker, we now have one of the most competitive tax codes on the globe. Let’s make certain that we keep it that way. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, might I in-quire of the distinguished chairman how many more speakers that he has. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have one. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-pared to close when the chairman deems it appropriate, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. MEADOWS ), one of the three original lead sponsors of this tax bill. Mr. MEADOWS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the pro-growth, pro-family, and pro-small business re-forms in tax reform 2.0 led by my good friend Chairman B
RADY . I want to say a special shout-out to him but also to the Ways and Means staff. Let me just tell you, a lot of times we take credit for things that are done, but it is the staff that has done not only a yeoman’s job but an outstanding job in doing this. And a real shout-out to Representative R
OD-
NEYDAVIS, the bill’s sponsor, who be-lieves that it is a good thing to give more of the taxpayers’ money back to them. You have heard arguments on the floor today, Mr. Speaker, all about rev-enue and about what this needs to do. But the revenue that we are talking about is actually the hardworking wages of men and women on Main Street. It is their money. I have been around this place too long. I can tell you, I would rather trust a mom and dad on Main Street to spend their money more wisely than any spenders here in Washington, D.C. It is time that we give it back. Since we signed the last tax bill, the largest in American history, the econ-omy has been booming. Unemployment is at a 50-year low. b1015 New job openings are setting a record pace. We are increasing wages. Con-sumer confidence, Mr. Speaker, is at its highest level in decades. And while these strong numbers continue to roll in, Congress needs to act to make sure that we are more resolved than ever to make these tax cuts permanent. You know, we talk about a vibrant economy—4.2 GDP growth. According to some sources, it is now at 4.4. When we look at that kind of GDP growth and economic growth, it means in-creased wages, it means job security, and that is what we need to make sure that we put back on the docket today. I ask my colleagues to vote for that. Vote for the men and women on Main Street. Yes, they may call this tax reform 2.0, but what I call this is actually make sure that we are responsible in Washington, D.C., to give the money back to its rightful owner, which is we, the people. Now, this indeed makes the tax cuts for individuals permanent, but it also

gives a whole lot of options for families saving for education and those baby savings accounts. It encourages small business development. It is time, Mr. Speaker, that we act on behalf of those who are doing all the hard work here in America, those small businesses and men and women on Main Street who deserve a break from Washington, D.C. I thank Chairman B
RADY and R ODNEY  D
AVIS for their leadership. I also look forward to working with them to de-liver these tax cuts and make sure they are permanent. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am still trying to sort through the commentary of one of the previous speakers who said that he took a call from somebody who said: I have three or four homes, and I am not getting enough in this tax bill. That is the point of this. He doesn’t need any tax relief. That is the very ex-ample that we have been highlighting throughout this morning. Three or four homes and they are complaining they didn’t get enough? That is a remarkable comment for somebody to pass on in this Chamber. This bill was bad on policy and it was bad on procedure. Not one hearing on this legislation. Not one witness. So two tax bills totaling $3 trillion of debt, all borrowed money with the promise of higher interest rates coming from the Federal Reserve Board, and they are suggesting that that poor fel-low who must be sleeping on the grates with three or four homes needs more tax relief. That is exactly what this ar-gument was about. So the party of fiscal rectitude has now added $3 trillion of borrowed debt to provide a tax cut for that struggling individual who has three or four homes. Now they want to give him enough, or her enough, to maybe get to five or six homes with the tax bill. Only someone who believes, perhaps, in the argument of Bigfoot would then conclude that that individual needs tax relief. Every mainstream economist who has spoken about the debt—and this, by the way, cost $631 billion this morn-ing with what they are about to do, borrowed money, added to the debt, added to our children’s responsibilities and our grandchildren’s responsibil-ities. And to make matters worse, Mr. Speaker, this represents a long-term threat, now, to Social Security and Medicare, because they are going to come back and say: Well, the debt is so high that we have to cut Social Secu-rity and we have to cut Medicare. They should back away from the mis-take that they are making this morn-ing. Go back to some hearings. Go back through some process. Go back to a conversation with both parties. Barack Obama was at 28 percent, the corporate rate. We could have found a common point of agreement on this. This sham is a reckless tax cut for that poor individual who has three or four homes. But at the same time, and, simultaneously, they leave behind the hardworking average men and women of this country. I urge our colleagues to oppose this legislation, and I yield back the bal-ance of my time. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time I have left. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. WEBER of Texas). The gentleman from Texas has 4 minutes remaining. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Speaker, I would note that the average middle-class family in my good friend Mr. N
EAL’s district back home in Massachusetts will see a tax cut of nearly $2,000 each year. So let’s fact-check a couple of these claims today. Let’s fact-check a few things, starting with my friend Mr. N
EAL’s point about Dr. Wenstrup’s call. That gentleman wasn’t complaining he didn’t get enough tax cuts. He said his taxes would go up significantly. And he is correct, because under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, this relief goes to middle-class families and low-in-come families working their way up. In fact, after the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, millionaires of America who used to shoulder 19 percent of the tax bur-den now will shoulder 20 percent of the tax burden. They will carry more be-cause this tax reform was designed for middle-class, working families. Earlier today, we heard our respected Democratic leader say many things, in-cluding that the GOP tax cuts provide at least $1.3 trillion in tax breaks to corporations. FactCheck.org says that claim is misleading. In fact, of the $1
1⁄2 trillion, over $1 trillion is for indi-vidual taxpayers. Leader P
ELOSI said 86 million middle- class families will see a tax increase. The Washington Post gave her 2 Pinocchios, saying most every U.S. taxpayer can expect some kind of tax cut according to just about every anal-ysis. A lawmaker from Wisconsin, Demo-crat: Never let the GOP tell you again they support low taxes. They don’t, un-less you are already a billionaire or massive corporation. PolitiFact gave that Democratic law-maker a pants on fire rating, saying this will provide tax relief for the mid-dle class, and most people in low-in-come households will see cuts as well. Leader C
HUCK SCHUMER said compa-nies are laying off American workers because of tax reform. PolitiFact said that was mostly false. A California assemblyman says GOP tax cuts are nothing more than a mid-dle-class tax increase. PolitiFact just killed them, called that just flat-out false. Senator C
LAIRE MCCASKILL said the tax cuts are not going to be helpful to the vast majority of people. The Wash-ington Post also gave her two Pinocchios, said that is flat wrong, says she ignores the immediate impact of the law, which means noticeable tax cuts for her constituents for a number of years. And, of course, dozens of Democrats continue to state 83 percent of all tax breaks go to the top 1 percent. FactCheck.org—down, misleading, be-cause it cites projections for 2027. In fact, the only way that will be true is if you vote ‘‘no’’ today. If you vote ‘‘yes,’’ these middle-class tax cuts are permanent. We have heard, today, scare tactics about the impact to Social Security and Medicare. Let me cite the Joint Economic Committee that shows the Congressional Budget Office said the Medicare trust fund solvency improved after tax reform. The tax reform strengthened the major funding source for the Medicare trust fund. Americans leaving disability for jobs due to a stronger economy will improve Medi-care solvency, and the number of unin-sured Americans fell—fell—after tax reform in the individual mandate. And the final point, let’s talk about debts and deficits, Mr. Speaker. This is a pleasant surprise to hear our Demo-crats suddenly concerned. They weren’t, under President Obama, when they doubled the national debt. They added $2 trillion in just 1 year. I am not going to talk about sailors who drink. I will just say this. Demo-crats were concerned, didn’t care about deficits when they were spending your money; but now that you are spending your money, all of a sudden, every-thing is changed. The truth of the matter is: Who do you trust, Washington to spend your money, or you and your family? Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-bers are reminded to refrain from en-gaging in personalities toward Mem-bers of the Senate. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 1084, the previous question is ordered on the bill, as amended. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, no provision of this Act (or any amendment made thereby) shall take effect unless and until the Chief Actuaries of the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and of the Old-Age and Survivor Insurance and Disability Insurance Trust Funds have cer-tified that the enactment of this Act will not harm the financial position of any of these trust funds. Such analysis shall be based on widely agreed-upon economic theory, con-ventionally agreed-upon economic metrics of macroeconomic analysis, and accepted mod-els of distribution and growth. 
Mr. BRADY of Texas (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I reserve a point of order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. A point of order is reserved. The Clerk will continue to read. The Clerk continued to read. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to the rule, the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. L
ARSON ) is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I want to say straightforwardly to my colleagues on the other side, this is as straight-forward and it is as simple as it can be: Nothing in this bill can take effect un-less and until the chief actuaries have certified that this bill will do no harm to Medicare and Social Security. Now, unlike Members of Congress who have a pension plan, who have a Thrift Savings Plan, who also have So-cial Security, for one-third of all sen-iors in this country, they rely on So-cial Security alone; and for two-thirds of all seniors—and that is your moth-ers and fathers and aunts and uncles and nieces and nephews and friends and family—90 percent of their income comes from Social Security. Mr. Speaker, 10,000—10,000—baby boomers become eligible for Social Se-curity every single day; and yet, as Mr. N
EALhas pointed out, the lack of hear-ings, the lack of any substantive de-bate on Social Security and Medicare. It has been nonexistent. I include in the R
ECORD a letter from Robert Greenstein from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, and I think it bears listening to so that you get a full understanding and impact of what happens when this so-called tax reform bill takes effect and its burden is thrust squarely on the people who are in most need at the time. 
[From the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Sept. 10, 2018] G
REENSTEIN : HOUSE REPUBLICAN TAX P
ROPOSAL REPEATS FLAWS IN 2017 T AXLAW CBPP released the following statement from Robert Greenstein, president, on House of Republican leaders’ release of their ‘‘2.0’’ tax proposal: Today’s tax proposal from House Repub-lican leaders doubles down on the funda-mental flaws of the 2017 tax law by further expanding deficits and once again favoring people with the highest incomes. The pro-posal calls for making permanent the 2017 law’s individual tax provisions. Those provi-sions benefit households in the top 1 percent twice as much as households in the bottom 60 percent, measured as a share of income. Making these provisions permanent would cost roughly $650 billion over 2019 to 2028, ac-cording to the Joint Tax Committee. Large as it is, this estimate significantly under-states the long-term cost because the bill largely affects only the final three years of the 2019–2028 ‘‘budget window.’’ We estimate that the legislation would cost roughly $2.9 trillion over 2026 to 2035, the first full decade it would be in effect. The revenue loss would come at a time when the baby boom generation will be retir-ing in large numbers and moving into ‘‘old- old age,’’ causing Medicare and Social Secu-rity costs to rise considerably. Indeed, 2026, the year in which most of the new GOP tax legislation would start having effect, is the first year in which all members of the baby boom generation—including the youngest— will be eligible to draw Social Security re-tirement benefits. It’s also the year in which the oldest baby boomers will turn 80; people in their 80s have higher health care costs, on average, than younger seniors do. The nation will need more revenues to help meet these and other challenges, such as a decaying in-frastructure, not fewer revenues, Policymakers should fix the flaws of the 2017 tax law, not extend them and compound the damage. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities is a nonprofit, nonpartisan research organi-zation and policy institute that conducts re-search and analysis on a range of govern-ment policies and programs. It is supported primarily by foundation grants. Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Greenstein says: ‘‘We es-timate that the legislation would cost roughly $2.9 trillion over 2026 to 2035, the first full decade it would be in ef-fect. ‘‘The revenue loss would come at a time when the baby boom generation will be retiring in large numbers . . . causing Medicare and Social Security costs to rise considerably.’’ Indeed, when this bill kicks in in 2026, it is the first year in which all members of the baby boom generation, including the youngest, will be eligible to draw on their Social Security retire-ment funds. It is also the year in which those in that generation will turn 80; and, as we all know, that is the time when they need medical attention the most and a time when the Nation will desperately need these revenues. My Republican colleagues are paying for this tax reform on the backs of American seniors, forcing devastating cuts to Social Security and Medicare. Under the guise of tax reform, the tril-lions they are adding to the deficit is no accident, and cutting Social Secu-rity and Medicare has always been the next step. News flash to my colleagues who refer to Social Security and Medicare as an entitlement: It is not an entitle-ment. It is the insurance that people have paid for, working all their life. And how do we know this? How do we know this, America? Because all they have to do is check their pay stub where it says, ‘‘FICA,’’ Federal Insur-ance Contributions Act. Whose? Theirs, the hardworking peo-ple of America, who understand that this is the insurance that they have paid for. This is what they need in life. And at the very critical time when the full complement of baby boomers are retiring, they get burdened and saddled with this debt. b1030 I would like to hope that our col-leagues would at least listen to Presi-dent Trump, President Trump, who said: We’re not going to hurt the people who are paying into Social Security their whole life, and then, all of a sud-den they’re supposed to get less? I hope our colleagues follow their President’s lead, and understand the vital importance of making sure, not only that we protect Social Security, that we expand it at a time when it is most critical to all of them. It would be great if we ever have a public hearing on it; but I have a pro-found inclination to understand that when Mr. NEAL is chairman of this committee, we will take this bill up. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of a point of order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The res-ervation of a point of order is with-drawn. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to re-commit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, you know Washington. You know Washington. If you don’t have an argu-ment, just scare people; just frighten them to death. That will work. But people are smart. When you calm down all the rhetoric and all the anger and all the outrage, what we know is this: The Congressional Budget Office— it isn’t Republican or Democrat—it found the Medicare Trust Fund sol-vency got better after tax reform. In fact, tax reform strengthened the major funding source for the Medicare Trust Fund and now, because we have more people, especially those disabled, going back to work, getting a job that they had hoped for, it is actually im-proving Medicare solvency. So that great big scare tactic just got fact- checked. In fact, already this year, the Federal Government is receiving $105 billion more, Mr. Speaker, in payroll taxes and individual taxes, and those payroll taxes are what are the foundation of Social Security and Medicare. The truth of the matter is, as we look at this bill, both parties claim to be champions of hardworking tax-payers. Well, let’s check. So, under this bill, a single mom, working her way out of poverty, per-manently will see $1,700 more in her paycheck each year. Democrats who vote ‘‘no’’ will steal that money back from that single mom. Middle-class family of two, two teachers in my district, with two kids, under this bill, permanently will see a tax cut of $2636. A ‘‘no’’ vote steals that money back from that family. That Main Street business, moms and pops working all hours, all week-ends, all year, under this bill, perma-nently they will see a tax cut of $3,000

every year, and they can write off on their taxes that new computer, that new equipment, that new improvement to their store. A ‘‘no’’ vote hammers America’s Main Street businesses. Young parents, struggling to raise kids, where every dollar matters, this bill makes sure that that doubling of the child tax credit is permanent, and millions more Americans, middle-class families, will get help raising their pre-cious children. A ‘‘no’’ vote is to take that money back from those young parents. Oh, by the way, take back their tax-free savings for school and college for that child as well. And, yes, in this bill, we make sure seniors can write off more of their high medical expenses. Some called it the cancer tax. A ‘‘yes’’ vote will help mil-lions of seniors and millions of families with high medical bills more easily write those taxes off. A ‘‘no’’ vote is to deny American seniors, American fam-ilies’ ability to write off those taxes. Now, we know, thanks to ObamaCare, high out-of-pocket costs is now the pre-existing condition. This bill makes sure that we stand on the side of those seniors, whether they are battling can-cer or some other menaces. At the end of the day, while some would say, look, we need to raise the SALT cap, let me just say this: That SALT cap is a $10 tax cut for the mid-dle class and a $146,000 tax cut for mil-lionaires. In other words, Democrats who vote ‘‘no’’ say they just want more tax cuts for the rich. And the fact of the matter is, States are seeing a $20 billion windfall. State governments and Governors, all they need do, don’t pocket that money for their budget, pass it on to hard work-ing taxpayers. At the end of the day, revenues are up. Payroll taxes are up. Social Secu-rity and Medicare are strengthened. So at the end of the day, who do you trust? Who do you trust with your hard-earned money? Is it Washington, so they can take it and spend it on their special interests? Is it you? Is it your family? Is it your American Dream? This bill is about making sure that we choose the American people. We choose you, the middle-class families. We choose you, Main Street America, to better use your money than Wash-ington does. As we conclude, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank our tax team, led by Bar-bara Angus, our Chief Tax Counsel, Aharon Friedman, Randy Gartin, Aaron Junge, Loren Ponds, John Sandell, Donald Schneider, Victoria Glover, John Schoenecker, and Quinton Brady, for doing a remarkable job for us and for the American people. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ on protecting tax cuts for individuals, middle-class families, and small businesses. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is or-dered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.

Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6. This is the SUPPORT for Patients and Commu-nities Act that your Energy and Com-merce Committee has worked on dili-gently for nearly 2 years. In my own case, in 10 roundtables throughout Oregon, I have heard from everyday people on the frontlines of this fight in our communities. They are the victims. They are the families. They are medical providers and treat-ment advocates. They are local law en-forcement, and they are first respond-ers. They are our neighbors. They are our loved ones. Each of these people puts a name and a face to what I would say is the worst drug epidemic we have seen in Amer-ica, the opioid crisis. I have heard from Oregon families, I have heard from Mike and Winnie, from Grants Pass, who have seen their loved one struggle with addiction. Mike’s sister who died, she was a nurse, became addicted, and overdosed. He told me that at a townhall in a commu-nity forum. Their son struggles with his addiction to this day from a sports injury starting with opioids, ending with heroin. We will never know what could have become of the 72,000 Americans who died last year. Every 24 hours, 1,000 people go to emergency rooms overdosing from opioids. Roughly 115 die. I heard it from Paula, whose two sons and stepson struggle with their opioid addiction today. As a parent, I can only imagine what parents of children with opioid addic-tion must feel every time the phone rings. They think it may be that call. For the millions of people currently struggling with addiction, please know, don’t give up. It is never too late to seek help. We stand with you. Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a product of months of bipartisan, bi-cameral work, eight House committees involved, I think probably every Mem-ber of this House, five Senate commit-tees, dozen and dozens of Members of Congress. And the faces that we came to know are the parents and the children whom they lost, Amanda Beatrice Gray being one of them, a beautiful young woman, talented, struggling with her issues, overdosed on heroin heavily laced with fentanyl. We are here for them, Mr. Speaker. We are here for our neighbors, for our

loved ones, who deal with this crisis every day of their life, and in the great joined cause of those who lost. Mr. Speaker, because we are going to hear from a lot of our Members who have put so much work into this, I re-serve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Commu-nities Act. This bill is the product of many months of hard work by several committees in the House and Senate. It is important that we pass this bill today as another step in addressing the opioid crisis that is ravaging every community in our Nation. Last year, a record 72,000 Americans died of drug overdoses; that is about 200 people dying every day, and this is a national crisis that is devastating families and that this Congress must act on. And while this legislation will not solve every problem, I do believe it in-cludes important policies that will help turn the tide of this tragic opioid epi-demic. It will also improve treatment options for those battling other sub-stance-use disorders. I am proud that H.R. 6 builds upon CARA, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, by including a pro-vision championed by my colleague, Congressman T
ONKO , that would allow all advanced practice registered nurses to treat patients with bupe for opioid- use disorder. It also gives nurse practi-tioners and physician assistants the authority to treat patients with bupe permanently, and it codifies the 275 pa-tient physician cap. This is a critical step in expanding access to the treat-ment of these drugs, one of the major challenges that we continue to face in the fight against this epidemic. Mr. Speaker, the legislation also ex-pands access to coverage. It includes an important provision that I worked on with Ways and Means Committee Ranking Member N
EAL that expands Medicare coverage of opioid treatment programs and medication-assisted treatment. In the Medicaid space, I am pleased to see the inclusion of several Demo-cratic priorities. This bill requires State Medicaid programs to cover all forms of medication-assisted treat-ment, which plays a critical and life-saving role in treating opioid use dis-order. It provides grants to State Medicaid programs to help increase the number of substance use disorder providers and services. It increases access to mental health and substance use disorder treatment for children and pregnant women covered by CHIP, and it ensures former foster youth are able to keep their Medicaid coverage across State lines up to the age of 26. And it im-proves the continuity of Medicaid cov-erage for juveniles in the justice sys-tem. I am also pleased that we have been able to improve upon the House-passed IMD policy. This bill adds new safe-guards to ensure that States continue to provide an adequate level of out-patient services and offer medication- assisted treatment. It does this by making clear that this policy does not impact the more comprehensive efforts to provide care in IMDs that is ongoing in many States today. b1045 H.R. 6 also includes provisions from my legislation, the SCREEN Act, that would give the Food and Drug Adminis-tration the ability to take action against illicit controlled substances coming in through international mail facilities across the country. FDA will now be able to prohibit the importation of drugs by people who have repeatedly imported illicit drugs. It also allows the agency to cease dis-tribution of or recall controlled sub-stances, like opioids, if they are endan-gering patients. These provisions also provide FDA expanded authority and capacity need-ed to more effectively combat the in-flux of deadly synthetic opioids, like fentanyl, from reaching our shores through the mail in the first place. It also provides the Federal Trade Commission with stronger enforcement tools to go after bad actors that are taking advantage of the suffering of in-dividuals combating addictions. Mr. Speaker, there is one provision that is concerning and that I do want to mention. It did not go through reg-ular order and was not properly vetted. In fact, it was added at the very last minute. That is a proposal by Senator RUBIO to create a new criminal antikickback statute. I know this proposal is well-inten-tioned in addressing the serious prob-lem of patient brokers who are taking advantage of individuals with opioid use disorders and referring them to substandard or fraudulent providers in exchange for kickbacks. This is an issue, but since the bill was introduced last Tuesday night, multiple stake-holders have raised concerns that the language does not do what we think it does. It may have unintended con-sequences. Mr. Speaker, I hope this is a good les-son to all of us that passing legislation that has not been properly vetted, and that the public has not had an ade-quate chance to review, is unwise. I hope to get a commitment from Chair-man W
ALDEN and Chairman G OODLATTE  to work to address any technical prob-lems with this provision in the upcom-ing months. In closing, Mr. Speaker, these are all policies that have the potential to make a real impact on this epidemic, but our work here is not complete. An epidemic of this size will take a long- term commitment to improving health insurance coverage, treatment, access, and affordability. This bill is an important step, but I want to stress that we have to do a lot more. The opioid crisis continues to get worse. A lot more needs to be done to provide treatment and expand the treatment infrastructure. More re-sources are needed to support the fami-lies and communities impacted by this crisis. So what we are doing today is clearly helpful, but it is not enough. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to yield 1 minute to the gen-tleman from Texas (Mr. BRADY ), the distinguished and talented chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman W
ALDEN and Ranking Member P
ALLONE for their work. The opioid crisis, as you know, has im-pacted every community in America, has robbed countless individuals of their full potential. We all know some-one who lost a loved one because they were exposed to opioids and then quickly addicted, and I know that sometimes, in routine surgery, they didn’t even need it. This can be prevented, and that is why I rise today in support of H.R. 6. This is bicameral and bipartisan. It ad-dresses this crisis by putting in place many commonsense measures to re-duce the unnecessary prescribing of opioids and get people treatment once they become addicted. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. N
EAL; the rank-ing member of the Health Sub-committee, Mr. L
EVIN; as well as lead-ers on our side and Mr. R
OSKAM , Mr. C
URBELO , Mr. P AULSEN , and Mr. B ISHOP  for authorizing key provisions of H.R. 6. They will save lives and heal commu-nities. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Massa-chusetts (Mr. N
EAL), the ranking mem-ber of the Ways and Means Committee who worked so hard on this legislation as well. Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-port of H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Pa-tients and Communities Act, and I want to acknowledge Mr. P
ALLONE , Mr. W
ALDEN , and Mr. B RADY , the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, for the good work that they have offered on this as well. The opioid crisis is not a partisan issue. It is a health, safety, family, community, and economic issue. Ev-erybody in this Chamber today has a family member or knows someone close to them who is connected to the opioid crisis. H.R. 6 represents the best of bipar-tisan and bicameral negotiation. This is, indeed, the way policy can and should be done. The bill includes a number of Demo-cratic priorities to expand treatment options for our neighbors, family mem-bers, and friends suffering from opioid use disorders. It includes my bill, with Member P
ALLONE , that would require Medicare to cover opioid treatment programs so that our Nation’s seniors might have more outpatient options for treatment.

Opioid use disorders are rapidly growing among Medicare beneficiaries. In 13 States, the highest rate of opioid- related inpatient hospital stays is amongst those over 65. This policy would give Medicare beneficiaries in-creased access to a range of medication and behavioral treatment options, leading to more hope for long-term re-covery. I am also pleased that H.R. 6 includes the Securing the International Mail Against Opioids Act, which would help to stop the flow of opioids through the United States. This legislation stems from the STOP Act, a bill that I worked on with Mr. Tiberi before his retirement earlier this year. I want to commend him, in addition to Trade Subcommittee Ranking Member P
AS-
CRELL , for their work on this bipar-tisan legislation. While the bill before us is a step in the right direction, this epidemic is not going to turn around overnight. It needs a thoughtful, long-term, sustain-able approach that requires significant Federal investments. H.R. 6 represents the initial step in addressing this cri-sis, but it cannot be the end. Part of that long-term approach must include protecting and strengthening Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. I want to take a moment to thank the staff on both sides of the aisle for their usual good work in this Chamber, for the weeks of hard effort they put in bringing this bill to fruition. The effort exemplifies bipartisan cooperation, and a particular thanks to House and Sen-ate legislative counsel who worked long nights and weekends to finish the bill. Thanks also to the CMS Office of Legislation and the staff of the Con-gressional Budget Office who played a critical role in finalizing the bill. This is a complicated issue, and H.R. 6 is not going to solve the public health epidemic or its impact on society at the moment, but it certainly is a good step. I encourage all of us here in this Chamber today and in Congress to con-tinue to work together to develop pol-icy solutions for members of our com-munity who are suffering from this ter-rible epidemic. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Indi-ana (Mrs. B
ROOKS ), and concur in my colleague’s comments in praise of the staff that we worked with to get this done. The gentlewoman has been a real leader. Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speak-er, the opioid and heroin crisis con-tinues to hit Hoosiers hard. Sadly, we haven’t turned the tide yet. It is robbing the futures of Ameri-cans in every State in our Nation. We must support those battling addiction. I have met with so many Hoosiers battling addiction. I visited treatment centers and recovery houses like the La Verna Lodge for men and Ohana House Sober Living for women. I have talked with addicts and those battling addiction about what is working and what is not working with different re-covery options. Passing the strong bipartisan bill be-fore us today is critically important. It will help ensure that more people have better access to treatments, and we can try to save more lives across this country. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. CUMMINGS ), the ranking member of the Oversight and Government Re-form Committee. Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. P
ALLONE for yielding, and for his great work on this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of pro-visions in this package reauthorizing and reforming the Office of National Drug Control Policy to improve coordi-nation of our national response to the drug crisis. At my request, the bill creates a de-mand reduction coordinator position, parallel to the existing interdiction co-ordinator, to strengthen demand reduc-tion initiatives, including efforts to ex-pand treatment. Among other critical reforms, this legislation also requires ONDCP to re-port whether drug control program agency budgets are adequate to achieve the goals of the National Drug Control Strategy. It requires the compilation of essential data on overdoses, deaths, and interdiction in a data dashboard, so the American people have a clear, accessible picture of the effectiveness of efforts to combat the drug crisis. I thank Chairman G
OWDY , Chairman M
EADOWS , and Vice Ranking Member C
ONNOLLY for working with me to de-velop legislation that will reform ONDCP. I thank Chairman G
RASSLEY , Ranking Member F
EINSTEIN , and Sen-ator C
ORNYN for their leadership. Let me also give special thanks to the committee staff and, I must say, to the majority and the minority staff. They did a phenomenal job working hard in conference and throughout this effort. Without their extraordinary ef-forts, this legislation would not be in this package today. Mr. Speaker, I close with a simple warning. There are a lot of people suf-fering. Almost 198 people die a day—a day. Those are the people who are dying, but there are a lot of people in the pipeline who are in so much pain, they don’t even know they are in pain. So while the provisions of H.R. 6 are important, without significantly ex-panding access to treatment and wrap-around services through long-term, sustained funding, we continue to nib-ble at the edges of our national crisis, and the crisis will continue to worsen. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, it is my great honor and high privilege to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Wis-consin (Mr. R
YAN), the Speaker of the House and my dear friend and class-mate from the class of ‘98. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about something that is really close to all of our hearts. We have reached a point in this country where opioid overdoses claim more than 100 lives each and every single day. Think about that for a moment, more than 100 lives every day. Mothers and fathers are burying sons and daughters, or in some cases, sons and daughters are burying mothers and fa-thers. I bring this up simply to impart the gravity of the situation, which makes our response all the more urgent. But while the situation is certainly grave, that does not mean that we should ever lose hope. As we have worked on this legisla-tion we will soon send to the President, we all had to go out and gain an under-standing of the facts on this issue. Ev-erybody on both sides of the aisle spent so much time on this bill. In doing that, we have gleaned so much under-standing. And that is, after all, how our Repub-lic works. That is what the people’s House does. We learn from our con-stituents. We hear their stories. We see the suffering, and then we act. This is a fantastic moment of people coming together to solve a problem. I think, in this process, we gained some-thing very special. Many of us heard the stories from in-credible souls who have known un-speakable loneliness and who struggle with drug addiction. They made it through to the other side. We met family members and friends who have known the pain and the fear that accompanies loving someone wres-tling with addiction. Every one of us knows somebody or is related to some-body who has gone through this. We met those who will never again have the chance to see the ones that they love so much. Amid the overwhelming darkness, we have gotten to see their spark, their strength. From this pain has come something more powerful: resolve and a passion to make sure that others have a safe place to turn, that this doesn’t happen to their family. Witnessing this kind of strength, wit-nessing this kind of resilience, that is what helped produce this legislation. Through these bills, we are trying to ensure that anyone who needs help is not too isolated to receive it. We are giving our communities the resources that they need to provide stronger treatment networks and sup-port systems. That is where the heal-ing happens. That is where Americans are at our best. If this legislation can save one life and bring help to one person, that is what matters. It is going to do far more than that. b1100 So I want to thank all of those who were brave enough to share their sto-ries with all of us. I want to thank all of those people who all of us met with

for being brave, for coming here, for meeting us, and for testifying and giv-ing us their stories. And for all of those who are continuing to struggle in si-lence, I want them to know that there is no shame in their trials. In our own ways, we all fall. In our Catholic tradition, we look to St. Jude as the patron saint of lost causes, a keeper of those who some in society may have written off. To me, his guardianship is written in this leg-islation. There are no lost causes. No one is permanently down. It is about offering a helping hand, and it is about opening our hearts. Mr. Speaker, I am very proud of this legislation. I am so thankful to my col-leagues on both sides of the aisle who came together to put these families and to put these communities first. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. T
ONKO ), a member of the committee. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, all across my district, I have encountered stories of individuals and families whose lives have been ir-revocably changed by the scourge of the opioid epidemic: a father who lost his daughter too young and is pouring his grief into advocacy, a former neigh-bor and a dad who left behind two young children, a young man who is walking the hard path of recovery and showing others how to do the same. These are the stories I hear day in and day out. They fill my heart; they fill my voice. And it is because of them that I am so very proud to cast a vote in favor of H.R. 6 today. It is my hope that this legislation will be another small step for our Nation on its road of recovery from this epidemic. I am particularly proud that this bill incorporates legislation that I have in-troduced, along with my good friend Representative B
ENRAYLUJA´Nof New Mexico, which will provide a meaning-ful expansion to high-quality addiction treatment by allowing additional healthcare providers, such as nurse midwives, to prescribe buprenorphine, a medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder. In addition, this provision will make permanent buprenorphine-prescribing authority for nurse practitioners and physician assistants and allow certain providers to treat more patients in the first year of their license. These changes will make a big dif-ference for individuals struggling from addiction across our country, espe-cially in rural areas, and for vulnerable populations like pregnant and postpartum women and the 13,000 ba-bies born each year with neonatal ab-stinence syndrome. I also want to highlight the inclusion of my Medicaid Reentry Act into this bill, which aims to improve care for in-dividuals who are leaving jail or prison and reentering a community setting. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. J
ODYB. H ICEof Georgia). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gen-tleman from New York. Mr. TONKO. These individuals are highly vulnerable to opioid overdose due to lack of effective addiction treat-ment while incarcerated. By passing this legislation, we will allow States to engage in demonstration projects to improve medical care and transition- related services to Medicaid-eligible in-carcerated individuals in the 30 days prior to their release, reducing the risk of overdose as individuals are coming back into the community for a second chance. I truly believe that this provi-sion will transform lives. I thank Ranking Member PALLONE , Chairman W
ALDEN , and their staffs for their continued efforts in this process. Without their dedicated, bipartisan work, we would not be making this progress today. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. B
URGESS ). The country is well served by his chairmanship of the Subcommittee on Health. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6 is by far the most comprehensive legislation to address this national crisis. While more work remains—and I am the first to admit it—it provides meaningful solutions and vital resources for our States and localities. Many of the priorities developed by the Energy and Commerce Committee are included in H.R. 6, like the 21st Century Tools for Pain and Addiction Treatment Act, partially repealing the institutions for mental disease exclu-sion and strengthening interagency co-ordination at our international mail facilities so that, perhaps, once and for all, we can do something about this poison coming into our country from eastern Asia to the detriment of our citizens. I believe H.R. 6 could have been stronger. It could have included lan-guage aligning 42 CFR Part 2 with HIPAA. That stand-alone bill received 357 votes in this House. And I promise you, you will see it again. I am con-cerned about expanding prescriptive authority for nonphysicians, and I hope we will be able to look at that again in the future. But I cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. I urge our Members to support this product today. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. D
INGELL ), also a mem-ber of the committee. Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member P
ALLONE for yielding and Chairman W
ALDEN for his leader-ship in bringing this bill to the floor. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. This is a critical first step in addressing the opioid epi-demic. I have lived on all sides of this. I lived in a home with a father who was an opioid addict before anyone knew what it was. I had a sister who died of a drug overdose. Yet I also live with a man who has very serious chronic pain and needs opioids to live his life com-fortably. We cannot let the pendulum swing too far in either direction, and we can-not be denying medication to those who need it. I am confident that this legislation strikes the right balance. This bill has four provisions which I authored included in it: The ACE Research Act, which I co-sponsored with my friend Mr. UPTON , will spur innovative research into nonopioid pain medications at NIH and will help lead the next big break-through and bring benefits to patients. We need nonaddictive pain drugs. I am also pleased that Jessie’s Law, which I have worked on for years with Mr. W
ALBERG , is in this. This provision, which is named after a young woman we lost far too soon, would require HHS to establish best practices to en-sure that medical professionals have full knowledge of their patient’s opioid history. The Safe Disposal of Unused Medica-tion Act fixes a critical gap in our laws by permitting hospice employees from disposing of unused opioids after a pa-tient has passed away or the medica-tion is no longer needed. Finally, I was pleased to work on lan-guage with Dr. B
UCSHON to ensure that the Welcome to Medicare wellness exam includes a review of the bene-ficiary’s current opioid prescriptions and screening for potential substance use disorder. As we pass this legislation to combat this epidemic which has claimed so many lives, we cannot forget the 25 million people who do live in pain. We cannot let the pendulum go either way. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, it is now my privilege to yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. L
ATTA ), the very effective chairman of our Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection Subcommittee. Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6. This legislation will make a significant difference to tens of thou-sands of Americans who are struggling with addiction. I am pleased that my bill, the INFO Act, is part of the fight against the opioid crisis. The INFO Act is essential to ensuring we are providing behav-ioral health professionals, advocates, physicians, and families with the tools, resources, and funding information they need to prevent, identify, and treat addiction. Furthermore, H.R. 6 is critically im-portant to stop the flow of illegal opioids, prevent the misuse of drugs, and help those who are addicted. With 190 Americans dying every day from overdoses, it is time to act now. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas

(Mr. G ENEGREEN ), the ranking member of our Health Subcommittee. Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding to me. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the SUPPORT for Patients and Commu-nities Act, bipartisan legislation that will help stem the tide against the Na-tion’s opioid crisis and support Ameri-cans overcoming opioid addiction. In 2016 alone, 42,000 Americans died from opioids, including prescription pain relievers and illicit opioids like fentanyl. This is a serious national cri-sis that affects public health and the social and economic welfare of commu-nities throughout our great country. The Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee, which I am proud to serve on as ranking member, held sev-eral hearings on the opioid crisis last spring. I am proud to see our com-mittee and both Chambers of Congress come together and support the package before us today that includes the Com-prehensive Opioid Recovery Centers Act that I introduced, along with my friend Representative B
RETT GUTHRIE  from Kentucky, earlier this year. This legislation would fund des-ignated treatment centers where Amer-icans suffering from opioid abuse can receive comprehensive patient-cen-tered care. The bill would allow des-ignated treatment centers to provide wraparound services, including mental health, counseling, recovery housing, and job training and placement to sup-port reintegration into the workforce. These wraparound services have been shown to help many Americans suc-cessfully overcome opioid addition. The SUPPORT for Patients and Com-munities Act includes several provi-sions to combat this crisis, including strengthening the Federal Govern-ment’s authority to restrict illegal drugs entering our country, and pro-viding Medicaid for at-risk youth and former foster children. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me and support this important leg-islation. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I am privileged to yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. L
ANCE ). Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6, which delivers greater resources, treatment, and miti-gation tools to fight opioid addiction. I am especially pleased that a bill that I sponsored related to infectious diseases is included in the final pack-age. I commend the Congressman from Massachusetts, Mr. J
OEKENNEDY , for being my lead cosponsor on this part of the overall whole. Infectious diseases complicate the lifelong path toward addiction recov-ery. H.R. 6 is one of the most impor-tant measures to pass this Congress. It should be supported unanimously. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time remains on each side. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tleman from New Jersey has 3 minutes remaining. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. BENRAYLUJA´N). Mr. BEN RAY LUJA´N of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. This is an important step forward in the fight against the Nation’s opioid epidemic. However, this Congress must acknowledge that this is not the end. Healthcare is a right, not a privilege. There is much more work to do to en-sure that families get the help that they deserve. I am pleased that this package in-cludes language that I have cham-pioned to address gaps in prevention and gaps in access to treatment. In ad-dition, this bill will create pathways to behavioral healthcare jobs in commu-nities like New Mexico. Still, Congress must do more. As we have heard from Representative C
UM-
MINGS , this is going to take much more money, investment, and comprehensive legislation. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I am privileged to yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. G
UTH-
RIE). Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. One of the main things I hear back home is how our Nation’s ongoing opioid crisis has affected either them-selves, their loved ones, or their com-munity. Mothers, fathers, children, bankers, dentists, bus drivers, or high school athletes, anyone can fall victim to opioid use disorder. That is why I am proud to work with my colleagues in support of the act so that we can help these people who are suffering from this terrible epidemic. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this critical legislation so that we can deliver relief to those commu-nities. b1115 Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. Mr. Speaker, before we conclude de-bate, let me just take a moment to thank everyone for all of their hard work getting this bill across the finish line. This bill represents a collection of Member ideas and policies across the political spectrum. Many people may not know this, but the staff of the House and Senate committees nego-tiated this bill in a matter of weeks, and that is no small feat. It took a lot of effort, long hours and weekend work to pull this off. It is a product we can all be proud of. So let me thank all legislative coun-sel and CBO for their efforts as well. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. B
ILIRAKIS ) to speak about the leg-islation. Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, the SUPPORT for Patients and Commu-nities Act is the product of a year of hearings and investigations into Amer-ica’s opioid crisis. This thoughtful bipartisan legisla-tion will provide more tools to our communities to help them. I am proud that we included my legislative efforts to help Medicare beneficiaries, begin reforms to the sober home industry, and address the problem of patient brokering. We need to pass this bill and give our constituents the help they need. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I con-tinue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JOHNSON ), who is a leader on this issue. Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, today is the culmination of months of tireless work driven by heartbreaking stories of people whose lives were de-stroyed by opioid addiction, and, just as importantly, the powerful stories of hope and recovery. I am grateful for the hard work of my colleagues and our Energy and Com-merce staff. I am proud that my legis-lation to improve how health profes-sional students are taught to recog-nize, prevent, and address addiction, as well as to expand the availability of telehealth and peer support services for those struggling with addiction is in-cluded. Mr. Speaker, I am looking forward to continuing the hard work ahead on this very important issue, and I urge sup-port for the bill. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I con-tinue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. B
UCSHON ), who is a talented physi-cian on our committee. Mr. BUCSHON: Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6, the SUP-PORT for Patients and Communities Act. This bipartisan bill will help our struggling communities to combat the opioid epidemic by increasing access and improving care to those in need and preventing new occurrences of opioid misuse and abuse. Section 2002, which I authored, would provide screening for chronic pain, ad-dress possible non-opioid pain alter-natives, and increase early detection of opioid use disorder in seniors as they enter Medicare. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have worked with my colleagues on solu-tions to this serious epidemic, and I urge support of H.R. 6. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I con-tinue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Michi-gan (Mr. W
ALBERG ) to speak on the measure.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH9248 September 28, 2018 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this bipar-tisan package to address the opioid cri-sis devastating our communities. This legislation includes two provi-sions authored by myself and my good friend from Michigan, Congresswoman D
EBBIE DINGELL . One will help safely dispose of unused drugs and prevent their diversion into the community. The other, Jessie’s Law, honors the memory of Jessie Grubb and will help prevent future overdose tragedies under medical care. Mr. Speaker, this critical legislation will help save and rebuild lives. I urge its passage today, and I look forward to its quickly advancing to the Presi-dent’s desk. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I con-tinue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. C
ARTER ), who is our resident phar-macist on the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-er, I would like to thank Chairmen W
ALDEN and B URGESS for working so hard with our partners across the aisle as well as across the Capitol to come to a consensus on this critical legislation necessary to combat the opioid epi-demic. As the only pharmacist currently serving in Congress, I have seen fami-lies saved by pain medications and have seen families torn apart by the same drugs. Since this body began tackling the opioid epidemic, I have said there are three major components to this crisis: prevention, law enforcement, and treatment. This legislation touches all three prongs of the opioid crisis with a num-ber creative solutions in addition to providing offsets to ensure that solving a public health crisis does not lead to a fiscal one. This package is not a silver bullet, but as legislators we need to do every-thing in our capacity to prevent the addiction and overdoses that occur every day in the United States.

This legislation touches all three prongs of the opioid crisis with a number of creative so-lutions in addition to providing offsets to en-sure that solving a public health crisis does not lead to a fiscal one. I voted for many of these bills when they came before Energy and Commerce for mark-up, and once again I want to offer my full sup-port for this legislation. I am pleased that this package includes three of my own bills, the Special Registration for Telemedicine Clarification Act, the Abuse Deterrent Access Act, and the Empowering Pharmacists in the Fight Against Opioid Abuse Act. This package is not a silver bullet—but as legislators we need to do everything in our ca-pacity to prevent the addiction and overdoses that occur every day in the United States. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I con-tinue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. ROSKAM ). Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, what a joy it is to be on the floor today. What a joy it is to be amongst a group of people who have set aside partisanship and have come together to address a crisis that is crushing our constitu-ents. What a joy it is to be a part of the process and among a group of people who are trying to find common ground. This is a good day, Mr. Speaker. There is good work that is happening. I chair the Health Subcommittee, and it was incredible to see the work that that subcommittee did on the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to strongly endorse this bill, and I urge its passage. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I con-tinue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to yield 30 seconds to the gen-tleman from Minnesota (Mr. P
AULSEN ), who has worked so hard for these issues. Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am ex-cited to support this legislation. It is bipartisan. Minnesotans and those who are on the front lines of the opioid crisis will be helped, and it will aid the millions of American families who are affected by this epidemic. It includes a bipartisan measure that I authored that will help prevent opioid addiction among seniors by educating them on alternative pain management treatments, and the proper, safe dis-posal of prescription painkillers. It will help more than 90,000 at-risk seniors from descending into a deadly spiral of addiction. The end result will be less addiction, fewer overdoses, and safer Minnesota communities. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I con-tinue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. R
ENACCI ) to speak on the measure. Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation which in-cludes my bipartisan bill, the Strengthening Partnerships to Prevent Opioid Abuse Act. The opioid epidemic has hit my home State of Ohio particularly hard, with thousands of Ohioans dying from drug overdoses every year. This bill will make it easier for Medi-care Advantage Part D drug plans, and HHS to combat fraud, waste, and abuse and prevent the overprescribing of opioids to vulnerable seniors. I would like to thank members of this conference committee as well as their staff for including my bill in this package and for their hard work to pass legislation to address the opioid epidemic. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I con-tinue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, may I in-quire as to how much time each side has remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tleman from Oregon has 81⁄2minutes re-maining. The gentleman from New Jer-sey has 1
1⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the distinguished gentleman from Michigan (Mr. B
ISHOP .) Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speak-er, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6 which will make great strides toward ending the opioid crisis once and for all. I am pleased this package includes my bill, the STOP Act, which is tar-geted legislation to help stop synthetic opioids like fentanyl and carfentanil from entering our country through the international mail system. I want to make sure I thank all the parents, educators, law enforcement, emergency response personnel, healthcare professionals, victims, and those suffering from addiction who have been working with me to ensure this legislation gets signed into law. Your hard work has made a real dif-ference. Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank my colleagues for their support, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the underlying bill, H.R. 6. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I con-tinue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, few States have been harder hit than Ken-tucky in this effort on opioids, a ter-rible tragedy. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the distinguished gentleman from Ken-tucky (Mr. B
ARR). Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the families of the Commonwealth of Kentucky which suffers from the third highest opioid overdose mortality rate in the Nation, I rise today in support of H.R. 6, and I thank the chairman for his leadership on this. This legislation marks a critical in-vestment to help individuals and fami-lies struggling with addiction rise above addiction and transition back into the workforce. Specifically, H.R. 6 includes my leg-islation, the CAREER Act, which cre-ates a demonstration program to pro-mote evidence-based transitional hous-ing that pairs recovery support with life skills, workforce training, and job placement. I would like to thank the many non-profits in my home State of Kentucky for inspiring this legislation.

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I con-tinue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Penn-sylvania (Mr. B
ARLETTA ). There is a lot of enthusiasm for this legislation, Mr. Speaker. We want to hear from Mr. B
ARLETTA about his thoughts on it. He has been a real leader on it. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6 which in-cludes my bill, the Treating Barriers to Prosperity Act. The Appalachian region, including much of my home State of Pennsyl-vania, has an overdose death rate 65 percent higher than the rest of the country for people ages 15 to 64. My legislation will allow commu-nities to use Appalachian Regional Commission funding for everything from attracting doctors to putting in broadband for telemedicine. It will spur economic growth in communities hit hardest by the opioid epidemic, while also helping those struggling with addiction by breaking down bar-riers to employment. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I con-tinue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Cali-fornia (Mrs. M
IMIWALTERS ) who is from the West Coast and is a real lead-er on our committee. Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6 and the IMD exclusion repeal probation modeled after my bill, the IMD CARE Act. I fought to ensure the IMD exclusion repeal was part of this final agreement because increasing inpatient treatment options is essential in our fight against the opioid epidemic. The Orange County Board of Super-visors agrees with leading addiction treatment groups: the IMD exclusion repeal and the IMD CARE Act are the most important steps we can take to end drug overdose deaths in Orange County. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to address this public health crisis. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I con-tinue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Indi-ana (Mrs. W
ALORSKI ), who is also a real worker on this legislation, to speak on the measure. Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6, the SUP-PORT for Patients and Communities Act. It includes my bill, named for Dr. Todd Graham, who was senselessly murdered last year over an opioid pre-scription. With this legislation, we build on Dr. Graham’s legacy of treating patients not only for their pain, but for their underlying causes. Today we are tak-ing bipartisan action to expand access to nonopioid alternatives and give our communities better tools to prevent and treat addiction. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I con-tinue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Michi-gan (Mr. MITCHELL ). Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6 as did my colleagues. The opioid crisis has impacted nearly every community across this country, and in order to most effectively com-bat this crisis, we must establish a comprehensive response plan. I am pleased this bill includes a version of my amendment offered in committee to establish a system to track Federal funding for drug control efforts, ensuring the government knows exactly where the money is being spent, how it is being used, and if it is working. Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and I ask my colleagues to do so as well. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I con-tinue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, we have heard from doctors, we heard from pharmacists, and we have heard from many family members. Now we will hear from somebody who has a distin-guished career in law enforcement. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from California (Mr. K
NIGHT ) to speak on this legislation. Mr. KNIGHT. Mr. Speaker, as a po-lice officer and a street cop in L.A., I have seen the problems that the opioid epidemic has done to our communities. It has literally destroyed families and hurt our communities to no end. H.R. 6 is a much-needed display of bipartisan-ship to address the ongoing opioid cri-sis and epidemic. Many of the issues that have come out of this bill spur development of na-tional best practices for substance abuse recovery housing and incor-porates my bill, the Eliminating Kick-backs in Recovery Act, to establish meaningful penalties for profiteering off other people’s pain and addiction through illicit referrals. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I con-tinue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Vir-ginia (Mr. B
RAT) to speak on the meas-ure. Mr. BRAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Chairman B
RADY , Chair-woman F
OXX, and Chairman W ALDEN  for addressing opioid and substance abuse disorders and their work on H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Com-munities Act. I am grateful to my col-leagues for treating the crisis with the urgency it deserves. In my district, this crisis has affected way too many. I am also grateful that my bill, H.R. 5889, the Recognizing Early Childhood Trauma Related to Substance Abuse Act of 2018 was in-cluded in the final package before us today. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I con-tinue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I don’t believe I have any other speakers on my side of the aisle pending, so with that, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I do urge support for this legislation. It is a good bill. It ex-pands access in a number of ways in coverage. But I do also want to point out that there are limitations to the bill. In other words, we do need to do a lot more. b1130 For example, we still haven’t ex-panded Medicaid coverage in many States. Medicaid coverage is crucial, in terms of providing treatment. The bottom line is that the treat-ment infrastructure in our country is very much inadequate. Many people really do not have access to treatment in many parts of the country, including my home State. I want to close by urging everyone to support this bipartisan and bicameral bill, because it does do a lot. At the same time, I remind my colleagues that we have a lot more to do if we are going to address this opioid crisis, which actually is getting worse instead of better. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, before I close, I want to especially thank our staff on both sides of the aisle for their incredible work. They have worked day and night, lit-erally, and all through the weekend— also, the folks at the Congressional Budget Office and Legislative Counsel. But I especially thank our team: Josh Trent, Kristen Shatynski, Caleb Graff, Dan Butler, James Paluskiewicz, Danielle Steele, Adam Buckalew, Me-lissa Froelich, Bijan Koohmaraie, Ryan Long, Peter Keilty, and Jenn Sherman, and the whole team at the Energy and Commerce Committee on both sides of the aisle. We worked through a lot of difficult issues, issues where we didn’t start on the same side, but we ended on the same page as we listened to each other, as we listened to our constituents at home. Seldom are there times when you are legislating that you can say what you are doing will actually save lives. This is one of those times. What we are doing here today is saving lives. We will lift people out of addiction who are trapped there today. We will prevent people from ending up in that emergency room because they overdosed. Maybe they will find a bet-ter path. We will go after those who perpetrated this on the country and after those who try to smuggle in the illicit synthetics and fentanyl that are cut with heroin and kill our people. So today’s effort is about people like Amanda, who left this world tragically

at a very young age through an over-dose. And it is about her parents. It is about Mike and Winnie. It is about Paula, and it is about her sons and sis-ter. It is about a woman I met in Hermiston who had to travel 5 hours to find a physician who could oversee her treatment on Suboxone because nobody was available. We help fix that in this legislation. It is about my friends at Winding Waters in Enterprise, Oregon, who I was with last week, and the sheriff and others, who talked about the con-tinuing problems and challenges they face and who have given me great guid-ance on these and other issues. From one end of my district to an-other, from one end of our country to another, we have all listened. We have heard. Frankly, we have cried as we have heard the stories of parents who help their children through addiction, only to drop them off at college and a matter of days later retrieve a body. That is what brings us together here today, Mr. Speaker. It is their stories that are woven deeply into this legisla-tion. It is because of them that we will make a difference and we will do it right. We will know that, as we pass this today and the Senate after us, that more work does remain to be done. We are on a journey together, though, and we will find solutions. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I thank our staffs. I thank the American people who have reached out to us, counseled us, and helped us. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to strongly support passage of the SUP-PORT Act. For patients and for com-munities, H.R. 6 needs to become law, and it will shortly. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 6, the SUP-PORT for Patients and Communities Act, a bi-partisan bill to address opioid addiction and other forms of substance abuse. A comprehensive, common-sense, and compassionate approach to substance use disorders is long overdue. For far too long, many communities throughout the United States have been devastated by substance use disorders. However, despite the wide-spread suffering that millions of people—par-ticularly African Americans during the crack cocaine epidemic—endured and still endure today, our federal, state, and local govern-ments, in many instances, have pursued puni-tive measures in lieu of effective solutions to ensure that all communities can adequately heal from the devastating impacts of addiction. I am especially pleased that this bill now in-cludes my amendment to the House version of H.R. 6, which requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to conduct a review of the organizations, government agencies, and other entities that receive fed-eral funding to provide substance use disorder treatment services. In addition, the amend-ment directs HHS to develop, and submit to Congress, a plan to direct appropriate re-sources to address the inadequacies in serv-ices or funding identified through the review. I am also pleased that this bill addresses concerns that I raised about the opioid legisla-tion in the House that allowed states to use Medicaid funds to provide treatment to per-sons with opioid use disorders in Institutions for Mental Disease (IMDs), but did not allow similar treatment for persons with other types of substance use disorders. In order to seri-ously address substance use disorders in communities throughout the United States, it is critical that we include persons who suffer from all types of substance use disorders, in-cluding those that involve alcohol, cocaine, and methamphetamine, as well as opioids. I offered an amendment to the legislation in the House aimed at addressing my concern about the exclusion of non-opioid forms of substance use disorders from treatment in IMDs. While my amendment was not accept-ed, I am pleased that efforts were made to ad-dress my concern. The final version of H.R. 6 allows states to provide Medicaid coverage in IMDs for persons with all types of substance use disorders and also includes safeguards to ensure that states do not reduce the avail-ability of community-based treatment for per-sons suffering from substance use disorders. While I appreciate the work that has been done on many components of this bill, I still have some important concerns. As the Rank-ing Member of the House Committee on Fi-nancial Services, which has jurisdiction over housing programs, I am concerned that this bill falls short when it comes to providing housing for people with substance use dis-orders. The bill includes a provision that cre-ates a new grant program to provide tem-porary housing assistance to help people with substance use disorders, but this new funding will only be available in half of the states. This will leave the other half of the states con-tinuing to struggle with the challenges of help-ing people with substance use disorders who are in need of housing. Furthermore, this bill does nothing to address the overly punitive and unfair policies governing our federal hous-ing programs that create unnecessary barriers to housing for people who have criminal back-grounds related to substance use disorders. I am encouraged that there is bipartisan support for addressing the housing needs of persons suffering from substance use dis-orders, but I am disheartened that Congress continues to fall short in its efforts to provide comprehensive solutions that will help people suffering from substance use disorders in every state of the country. As we work to ad-dress the opioid crisis at hand, let’s not forget that Congress still has a lot of work to do in the way of criminal justice reform to address the ongoing harmful and discriminatory im-pacts of the war on drugs era. Despite these concerns, I believe this bill in-cludes some valuable bipartisan solutions that represent a step in the right direction. I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 6, and I look forward to continuing to work with my col-leagues to address the scourge of substance use disorders in communities throughout the United States.

EADER PELOSI AND LEADER SCHUMER : The Corporate Health Care Coalition (CHCC) is writing to commend both the House of Rep-resentatives and the Senate on finalizing the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act (H.R. 6), bipartisan legislation to address the nation’s opioid crisis. CHCC is comprised of companies from varying industries that compete in the global marketplace and spon-sor health plans for the benefit of our em-ployees and other beneficiaries. Collectively, CHCC member companies provide health benefits for nearly 5 million Americans across every state in the nation. The depth and devastation associated with the opioid crisis is being felt by families and communities nationwide. CHCC therefore ap-plauds lawmakers for working on a bipar-tisan basis to reach consensus on H.R. 6, which represents a critical step forward in providing necessary resources for treatment and prevention efforts related to opioids. We urge the House and Senate to pass this important legislation. Sincerely, C

CAMERAL AGREEMENT ON OPIOID LEGISLA -
TION (By Simona Combi) W
ASHINGTON , D.C., S EPT. 27, 2018.—First Focus Campaign for Children is delighted to see bipartisan agreement on tackling the opioid addiction epidemic and helping those affected by it. In June, the House passed H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Commu-nities Act by a vote of 39614. On September 17th, the Senate passed the Opioid Crisis Re-sponse Act of 2018 by a vote of 99–1. ‘‘It is crucial that families and foster youth affected by this devastating crisis get the help they need to overcome opioid addic-tion and put their lives back on track,’’ said Bruce Lesley, First Focus president. ‘‘We are particularly heartened that this bipartisan bill offers substantive help and hope both sides of the aisle will make children a pri-ority going forward.’’ The opioid crisis affects foster children and youth in two ways: First, children enter the child welfare and foster system often as a re-sult of substance abuse by their parents, and secondly, foster youth who age out of care are at an increased risk of substance use dis-orders. We therefore commend Congress for including numerous provisions in the bipar-tisan, bicameral opioid package that will im-prove the lives of foster children and youth impacted by the opioid crisis, including: Continuous Health Insurance for former foster youth: This provision, which corrects a glitch in existing law, allows foster youth who have aged out of care to remain on Med-icaid through age 26, regardless of whether they relocate to other states. This provision recognizes the critical importance of health coverage for former foster youth as they transition into adulthood. Earlier this

month, First Focus, the State Policy and Advocacy Reform Center, and FosterClub held a congressional briefing on the impor-tance of Medicaid to foster children and youth. Family-Focused Residential Treatment: This provision promotes family-based resi-dential treatment for substance use dis-orders by requiring the HHS Secretary to issue guidance to states on how they can support such treatment facilities. Recovery and Reunifying Families: This provision promotes the replication of effec-tive recovery coach programs to improve outcomes for children and families in the child welfare system who are impacted by substance use disorders. Family-Focused Residential Treatment: This provision creates a grant program to promote family-based residential treatment programs, which are critical to helping par-ents and families get the treatment they need to overcome addiction. Plans of Safe Care: This provision provides grants to states to improve and coordinate their response to ensure the safety, perma-nency, and well-being of infants affected by substance use. Trauma-Informed Care: This provision gives the Center for Disease Control (CDC) authority to work with states to collect and report data on adverse childhood experi-ences. It also directs the CDC to form a task force to promote best practices in treating children impacted by trauma and to rec-ommend best practices to federal agencies regarding its coordination and response to substance use disorders and other forms of trauma that affect children and families. At-Risk Youth Medicaid Protection: This legislation would ensure that incarcerated youth are simply suspended, rather than ter-minated, from Medicaid while they are in-carcerated. It would require states to auto-matically restore full eligibility to youth upon release from incarceration, and to take any steps necessary to make sure that youth begin receiving medical assistance benefits immediately. The Fiscal Year 2019 annual spending bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies (H.R. 6157) includes $3.8 billion for combatting the opioid crisis, and the bill should be signed into law soon. Adequate fed-eral funding for these new programs benefit-ting our foster children is critical. Looking ahead to Fiscal Year 2020, though, these gains for our children could be jeopardized if Congress fails to lift the budget cap for non- defense discretionary spending established by the 2011 Budget Control Act. If budget caps are allowed, this type of spending will go down by $55 billion. Congress must prioritize children in our federal budget deci-sions.

MER, SPEAKER RYAN AND LEADER PELOSI : The American Benefits Council (the Council) sup-ports the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treat-ment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Commu-nities Act (H.R. 6). We urge Congress to ap-prove this measure as an important step to-ward addressing the nation’s opioid addic-tion crisis. The Council is a public policy organization representing principally Fortune 500 compa-nies and other organizations that assist em-ployers of all sizes in providing employee benefits. Collectively, the Council’s members sponsor directly or provide services to retire-ment and health plans covering over 100 mil-lion Americans. The opioid epidemic has touched workers and families across the country and employ-ers have been on the front lines of this bat-tle, striving to stem the tide of prescription drug abuse through innovative plan design and outreach. A Kaiser Family Foundation analysis found that the use of prescription opioids among people with employer-based health coverage declined in 2016 to its lowest levels in over a decade. Nevertheless, the annual cost of treating addiction and overdoses has increased more than eight-fold since 2004, from $0.3 billion dollars to $2.6 billion in 2016, and pain-re-lated conditions have resulted in up to $635 billion in medical costs and lost productivity for employers. H.R. 6 makes a number of important im-provements to current law by reducing the use and supply of opioids, encouraging recov-ery, supporting caregivers and families and driving innovation and long-term solutions to the opioid addiction epidemic. The bill also imposes tighter control on opioid pre-scription and treatment under the Medicare and Medicaid programs while also clarifying FDA regulation of nonaddictive pain and ad-diction therapies and allowing for more flexibility with respect to medication-as-sisted treatment. We are particularly pleased that the con-ference committee wisely excluded from the bill a harmful, unrelated provision that would have revised the Medicare secondary payer rules to require private insurers—in-cluding employer plans—to pay for an addi-tional three months of care for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients before Medi-care assumes responsibility for the pay-ments. The Council strongly opposed this provi-sion, as employers already shoulder signifi-cant costs for workers and family members and should not be required to bear unrelated additional costs by expanding the length of time plans must cover ESRD. We applaud Congress for developing legis-lation that will make America healthier, in-cluding many of the 181 million people cov-ered by employer-provided health plans. Sincerely, JAMES A. K LEIN, President.

PPLAUDS CONGRESS FOR REACHING  A
GREEMENT ON OPIOID -RESPONSE PACKAGE  W
ASHINGTON , D.C., S EPT. 26, 2018.—On be-half of more than 1,000 mental health hos-pitals and addiction treatment centers, the National Association for Behavioral Healthcare thanks Congress for reaching an agreement to address America’s deadly opioid crisis. The final package includes many NABH- supported measures and contains the first substantive change to the Medicaid pro-gram’s burdensome Institutions for Mental Diseases (IMD) exclusion since the early 1970s. ‘‘NABH thanks House Energy and Com-merce Chairman Greg Walden (R–Ore.) for his strong leadership in the House, which helped ensure that his colleagues paid close attention to the IMD exclusion, an anti-quated regulation that has denied access to inpatient treatment for those who need it,’’ NABH President and CEO Mark Covall said in a statement. ‘‘We also thank Reps. Mimi Walters (R–Calif.) and Paul Tonko (D–N.Y.) and Sens. Rob Portman (R–Ohio) and Ben Cardin (D–Md.) for their tireless efforts to understand the IMD exclusion—and do all they can to repeal this provision and remove access barriers to behavioral healthcare services for millions of Americans.’’ NABH is also pleased with several other provisions in the final package and urges lawmakers to pass this legislation as soon as possible. Lives depend on it. NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF  C

EARSENATORS MCCONNELL AND SCHUMER  
ANDREPRESENTATIVES RYAN AND PELOSI : The National Association of Community Health Centers (NACHC) appreciates Congress’ on-going efforts and dedication to addressing the opioid crisis, and is pleased to offer our support for H.R. 6, SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, and urge all House and Senate members to pass this important legislation. NACHC is the national membership organi-zation for federally qualified health centers (also known as FQHCs or ‘‘health centers’’). Health centers play a critical role in the health care system, serving as the health home for over 28 million people, the majority of whom live under the Federal Poverty Level. With over 11,000 sites nationwide, FQHCs provide affordable, high quality com-prehensive primary care to medically under-served individuals, regardless of their insur-ance status or ability to pay. Substance use disorder (SUD), including opioid use disorder (OUD), is a top public health concern in the United States, and health centers have firsthand knowledge of the consequences. As opioid use disorder has become more prevalent, health centers are on the frontlines working to address the comprehensive needs of people at risk of de-veloping SUD, as well as assisting those who are in need of treatment for existing SUD/ OUD. From 2010 to 2017, health centers expe-rienced a five-fold increase in patients re-ceiving treatment for opioids or other sub-stance abuse disorders. Since 2010, health centers have more than doubled their behav-ioral health workforce because of the in-creased demand for services, with 3,000 health center providers now authorized to provide Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT.) In fact, in 2017, nearly 65,000 health center patients received MAT from health center providers. Health centers stand ready to serve their patients who are struggling with substance use disorder but there is a clear need for ad-ditional support and policy changes to en-able them to do so more effectively. We appreciate Congress’ consideration of a multitude of critical policy issues in its re-sponse to the opioid epidemic, including sev-eral provisions included in H.R. 6 to: bolster the SUD workforce, including through new loan repayment opportunities for SUD providers

We believe this provision will be of great as-sistance to health centers who are initiating and expanding opioid use disorder treatment programs in underserved areas across the country. Thank you again for all your hard work to bring this bill to fruition. We know there is more work we can do together to turn the tide on this public health crisis and look for-ward to continuing to work with you to ad-dress the needs of communities across the country.

OTHEMEMBERS OF THE U.S. H OUSE OF  R
EPRESENTATIVES : The U.S. Chamber of Commerce strongly supports the bipartisan H.R. 6, the ‘‘Opioid Crisis Response Act of 2018.’’ The Chamber will consider including votes related to this bill in our annual How They Voted scorecard. The opioid epidemic is ravaging families and destroying the lives of thousands each year, and it is crippling communities’ and employers’ efforts to staff workforce needs, create new jobs, and expand commerce. We applaud Congress for crafting com-prehensive legislation to tackle the myriad of causes, such as the flood of illicit drugs into the United States, while removing a lit-any of barriers that inhibit prevention, re-covery, and treatment options. The Chamber is pleased that H.R. 6 does not include the end stage renal disease (ESRD) provision included in an earlier version of the bill. That policy would have burdened employers already struggling to provide robust health benefits with hundreds of millions of dollars in additional health care costs. While H.R. 6 is important, more remains to be done. The Chamber urges Congress to ad-dress the 42 CFR Part 2 statute as hundreds of health care organizations have called for. Congress should align currently conflicting protections and allow providers access to a patient’s entire medical record, including substance use disorder information, at a pa-tient’s request. We urge you to support H.R. 6. Sincerely, S
UZANNE P. C LARK , Senior Executive Vice President, U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
ADVOCATES FOR OPIOID RECOVERY (E-MAIL) Medicare beneficiaries have the highest and fastest growing rate of opioid use dis-order (OUD), with more than 300,000 Medi-care beneficiaries having been diagnosed with OUD. However, Medicare does not cover the most cost effective, evidence-based treat-ment modality—opioid treatment programs (OTPs). OTPs are highly-regulated, highly-effec-tive, comprehensive treatment programs that provide Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT)—the combination of medication with behavioral therapy and support, and the most effective solution to treat OUD. There are roughly 1,500 OTPs across the United States providing treatment to approxi-mately 400,000 patients. These programs are certified by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Studies have shown that people who re-ceive MAT are 75 percent less likely to have an addiction-related death than those who do not receive MAT. Most patients in OTPs are currently treated with methadone, which can only be used for treatment of addiction through a licensed OTP. America’s seniors and people with disabil-ities deserve better. As your constituent, I encourage you to vote for H.R. 6, which would permanently expand Medicare cov-erage of OTPs.

ENATE , Washington, DC. On behalf of the Catholic Health Associa-tion of the United States (CHA), the national leadership organization of more than 2,000 Catholic health care systems, hospitals, long-term care facilities, sponsors, and re-lated organizations, I commend the members of the House and Senate for approving their versions of legislation to address the na-tion’s opioid crisis and to urge your support for the final bill, the Support for Patients and Communities Act (HR 6). Catholic health providers recognize that each human life is sacred and possesses in-alienable worth, and that health care is es-sential to promoting and protecting the in-herent dignity of every individual. We also recognize that supportive and readily avail-able substance use disorder (SUD) treat-ments are essential facets of holistic, person- centered and effective health care. The first principle in our Vision for U.S. Health Care affirms our call to pay special attention to those most likely to lack access to health care, many of whom are in desperate need of SUD services. This commitment is why the Catholic health ministry strongly supports efforts to increase access to these services and ensure that they become fully integrated into our health care system. CHA has supported many of the provisions included in HR 6, particularly those that would increase access to care under Medicaid and care for such vulnerable populations as children and pregnant women, as well as pro-visions to increase the use of telehealth serv-ices. We are particularly pleased that the final version of this legislation includes the IMD Care Act, to provide state Medicaid pro-grams with the option to cover care during FY2019–23 in certain Institutions for Mental Diseases (IMD) that may be otherwise non- federally-reimbursable under the IMD exclu-sion. We are also pleased that the bill in-cludes measures to ensure access to mental health and substance use disorder services for children and pregnant women under the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). However, we are disappointed that legisla-tion introduced in the Senate (S. 1850, the Protecting Jessica Grubb’s Legacy Act) and overwhelmingly approved in the House (HR 6082) to align current regulations for SUD treatment records with existing patient pro-tections under HIPAA for treatment, pay-ment and health care operations was not in-cluded in HR 6. For health providers, the alignment of SUD records with other med-ical records is essential to providing whole- person care. It enables the essential flow of patient information among providers that is critical to the timely and effective delivery of health care and critical to patient safety and quality. Given the broad and bipartisan support for HR 6082, we continue to urge the Senate to approve this bill as well before the end of the 115th Congress. Thank you again for your attention to the urgent matter of opioid and other substance use disorders. We know that you share the goal of our Catholic health ministry in pro-viding the best possible care and treatment for those who need it, and we hope approval of the Support for Patients and Communities Act will provide effective additional re-sources for doing so. Sincerely, SR. CAROL KEEHAN , DC, President and CEO.

PPLAUDS INCLUSION OF KEYPROVISIONS IN  H
ISTORIC OPIOID LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE  
KEY PROVISIONS TO TEACH , STANDARDIZE , AND 
COVER ADDICTION MEDICINE WILL HELP CLOSE  
TREATMENT GAP AND SAVE LIVES , ADDICTION  
MEDICINE EXPERTS SAY  The American Society of Addiction Medi-cine (ASAM) today applauds US House and Senate leaders for announcing a bipartisan agreement on an opioid legislative package that includes key provisions to bolster the country’s addiction treatment workforce, help provide standardized evidence-based treatment for individuals with a substance use disorder (SUD), and help ensure coverage and payment models facilitate comprehen-sive, coordinated care for patients seeking treatment for a SUD. ‘‘On behalf of America’s addiction medi-cine physicians and other clinicians on the frontlines of this crisis, ASAM applauds our Congressional leaders for working together to include key provisions that will help close the current treatment gap, bolster the addic-tion medicine workforce, and save more lives,’’ said Kelly J. Clark, MD, MBA, DFASAM, president of ASAM. ‘‘Reversing course on the deadly opioid overdose crisis requires bold policy solutions that help teach, standardize, and cover addiction med-icine so more patients benefit from evidence- based treatment. The agreement reached last night is an important step toward realizing this critical goal.’’ Key provisions in the legislative package to teach, standardize, and cover evidence- based addiction medicine include: Making permanent buprenorphine pre-scribing authority for physician assistants and nurse practitioners and allowing waivered practitioners to treat immediately up to 100 patients at a time (in lieu of 30) if the practitioner is board certified in addic-tion medicine or addiction psychiatry; or if the practitioner provides medication as-sisted treatment (MAT) in a qualified prac-tice setting. Certain qualified physicians would also be allowed to treat up to 275 pa-tients at a time with buprenorphine, codi-fying an existing rule; Allowing physicians who have recently graduated in good standing from an accred-ited school of allopathic or osteopathic med-icine, and who meet the other training re-quirements during school to prescribe MAT, to obtain a waiver to prescribe MAT;

Providing loan repayment relief to addic-tion treatment professionals who practice in high-need areas; Creating a Medicare demonstration pro-gram to increase access to evidence-based outpatient treatment for beneficiaries with opioid use disorder that includes medication as well as psychosocial supports, care man-agement, and treatment planning; Partially repealing the Institutions for Mental Diseases (IMD) exclusion and allow-ing state Medicaid programs to cover care in certain IMDs that can deliver services con-sistent with certain requirements, including evidence-based assessments and levels of care; Directing the Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services to finalize spe-cial registration regulations concerning the prescribing of medications for addiction via telemedicine within one year of enactment; Expanding Medicare coverage to include payment for Opioid Treatment Programs through bundled payments for wholistic services; Convening a stakeholder group to produce a report of best practices for states to con-sider in health care related transitions for inmates of public correctional facilities; and Requiring the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to provide information to SAMHSA grantees to encourage the implementation and rep-lication of evidence-based practices. ‘‘Substance use disorder is both treatable and preventable—but from where we stand today, delivering high-quality care to the millions of Americans who live with the dis-ease of addiction will require significant in-vestments in our workforce, coverage, and payment models that facilitate coordinated and comprehensive care, and structural changes that incentivize the use of evidence- based approaches,’’ said Clark. ‘‘And while we celebrate this bipartisan announcement today, ASAM knows there is still much more work to be done to ensure all Americans liv-ing with a substance use disorder get the treatment they need. ASAM will continue to advocate for building an addiction treatment system that fully integrates mental health, substance use disorder, and primary care services in order to produce the best patient outcomes. This includes supporting final pas-sage of legislation that would more closely align 42 CFR Part 2 with the Health Insur-ance Portability and Accountability Act.’’ For more information about the American Society of Addiction Medicine, please visit www.ASAM.org.

INORITY LEADER PELOSI : We the under-signed, representing the major groups across all disciplines working on a comprehensive response to address addiction, write in sup-port of the final conference agreement of the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Pro-motes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUP-PORT) for Patients and Communities Act (H.R. 6) and urge for quick passage of this package. As you know, the Centers for Disease Con-trol and Prevention recently reported that more than 72,000 Americans died of a drug overdose in 2017, a staggering increase from 63,600 in 2016. With nearly 200 Americans dying each day as a result of drug overdose, the opioid crisis is an urgent and serious public health and safety issue that needs to be addressed through a comprehensive re-sponse. We are grateful to Congress for addressing this urgent need to improve policies and re-sources to curtail opioid misuse and to help the millions impacted by addiction nation-wide. We thank Members on both sides of the aisle and the 13 congressional committees for their work to construct this thoughtful, evidence-based legislation.

LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM (Mr. M
CCARTHY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. M
CCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of making a scheduling announcement. Members are advised that votes are no longer expected in the House during the weeks of October 1 and October 8, 2018. Now, I would also like to make an-other announcement. I would also like to note that today is the 1-year anni-versary of our friend, the Majority Whip S
TEVE SCALISE , returning to Con-gress after the attempt on his life. I will not forget the day of that shooting. Many of you may know— STEVE did not know at that moment— but K
EVIN BRADY , Patrick, and I were sitting with the doctor waiting for Jen-nifer to arrive. We celebrate him com-ing back, but we didn’t know that he was even going to make it. S
TEVE and I have been friends for more than 20 years, long before we ever entered this floor. S
TEVE had always had the strength and the courage, and he is an example for a public servant and for all of us to impart. I am just so glad that Steve is back with us. Mr. HOYER. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. M
CCARTHY. I yield to the gen-tleman from Maryland. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I will ask the majority leader a question, just to make sure we all understand the sched-ule. But before I do that, I want to join the majority leader in saying how pleased we are that S
TEVE SCALISE not only came back, but is making such a positive contribution to the Congress of the United States. I say to S
TEVE that, when he came back, he gave one of those talks that I will always remember: his gratitude for the care of so many people around the world for a Member of our body. I thank him for his friendship and working together. Hopefully we will continue to do so, hopefully in a very constructive way for the American peo-ple. Welcome back, and God bless him, and we wish him a full, full recovery. We don’t want him to be too strong on this side, but we want him strong. And with that, we were talking on this side, and it appeared that the ma-jority leader said we weren’t going to be here next week. Mr. M
CCARTHY. Or the week after. Mr. HOYER. Or the week after. Is there a possibility, from that, that we may be here during the month of October? Mr. M
CCARTHY. No. I thank the gentleman for his ques-tion. November 13, if I am correct, is the first time we will come back, and hope-fully we will come back in the same order we leave. Mr. HOYER. Thank you. We look forward to being back on No-vember 13. I thank the majority leader.

FY 2019 Project Summary 
The General Services Administration (GSA) proposes the reconfigutation and renovation of 
space within Government-owned and leased buildings during fiscal year (FY) 2019 to support 
GSA's ongoing consolidation efforts to improve space utilization, optimize inventory, decrease reliance on leased space, and reduce the Government's environmental footprint. 
Since inception of the Consolidation Activities Program in FY 2014, GSA has received $263 million in 
supp01i of the program. Through FY 2017, the Consolidation Activities Program has funded 
78 projects. Wben complete, the 78 projects will result in more than a 1.67 million usable square foot 
(USF) reduction, reduce agency rental payments to GSA by $66 million annually, and generate $132 million 
in annual Government lease cost avoidance. 
FY 2019 Committee Approval and Appropriation Requested ............................... $70,000,000 
Program Summarv 
As part of its ongoing effort to improve space utilization, optimize inventory, decrease reliance 
on leased space, and reduce the Government's environmental footprint, GSA is identifying consolidation opportunities within its inventory 
of real property assets. These opportunities are presented through surveys and studies, partnering with customer agencies, and through agency 
initiatives. Projects -vvill vary in size by location and agency mission and operations; however, no single project will exceed 
$20 million in GSA costs. Funds will support consolidation of 
customer agencies and -vvill not be available for GSA internal consolidations. Preference will be 
given to projects that result in an office utilizatioh rate of 130 USF per person or less and a total project payback period 
of 10 years or less. Typical projects include the 
follmving: • 
Reconfiguration and alteration of existing Federal space to accommodate incoming agency relocation/consolidation. (Note: may include reconfigurations 
of existing occupied Federal tenant space); and 
• Incidental alterations and system upgrades, such as fire sprinklers or heating, ventilation, and air conditioning, needed as part 
of relocation and consolidation. Projects will be evaluated using the following criteria: 
• Preference will be gi-i;·en to projects that are identified as a reduction oppmiunity by both 
GSA and the subject agency, and that meet the other criteria. 
• Proposed consolidation projects will result in a reduction in atmual rent paid by the impacted customer agency.

Prospectus Number: PCA-0001-MU19 • Preference 
is given to consolidations vvithin or into owned buildings over consolidations 
within or into leased space. 
• Consolidation of expiring leases into owned buildings will be given preference over those business cases for lease cancellations that include a cancellation cost. 
• Co-location with other agencies with shared resources and special space will be given preference. 
• Links to other consolidation projects will be given preference. 
Justification 
GSA continually analyzes opportunities to improve space utilization and realize long-term cost savings for the Government. Funding for space consolidations 
is essential so that GSA can execute those opportunities. 
Projects funded under this authorization will enable agencies to consolidate within Government­controlled leased space or relocate from either Govemment-controlled leased or federally owned space 
to federally owned space that more efficiently meets mission needs. These consolidations will result in improved space utilization, cost savings for the 
.A..merican taxpayers, and a reduced enviromnental impact.

This prospectus proposes alterations to upgrade, replace, and improve fire protection systems and life safety features in Government-owned buildings during 
fiscal year (FY) 2019. 
Since FY 2010, the General Services Administration (GSA) has received $94,000,000 iu support 
of this program. These funds supported 87 projects in over 72 Government-owned buildings. 
FY 2019 Committee Approval and Appropriation Reguested ............................. $30,000,000 
Program Summarv 
As part of its fire protection and life safety efforts, GSA currently is identifying projects in 
Federal buildings throughout the country through surveys and studies. These projects will vary 
in size, location, and delivery method. The approval and appropriation requested in this prospectus is for a diverse set 
of retrofit projects with engineering solutions to reduce fire and life safety hazards. Typical projects include: 
• Replacing antiquated fire alann and detection systems that are in need of repair or for which parts 
are no longer available. 
• Installing emergency voice communication systems to facilitate occupant notification and evacuation 
in Federal buildings during an emergency. 
• Installing or expanding, as necessary, fire sprinkler systems to provide a reasonable degree 
of protection for life and property from fire in Federal buildings. 
• Constructing additional exit stairs or enclosing existing exit stairs to facilitate the safe and timely evacuation 
of building occupants in the event of an emergency. 
Justification 
GSA periodically assesses all facilities using tecmiical professionals to identifY hazards and initiate 
correction or risk-reduction protection strategies so that its buildings do not present an unreasonable risk 
to GSA personnel, occupant agencies, or the general public. Completion of 
these proposed projects will improve the overall level of safety from frre and situilar risks in 
federally owned buildings in GSA's portfolio nationwide.

FY 2019 Project Summary 
This prospectus proposes alterations to improve physical security in Government-owned buildings occupied 
by the Judiciary and the Department of Justice---U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) 
during fiscal year (FY) 2019. Since 
FY 2012, GSA has received $106,700,000 in support of this program. These funds supported 
11 projects. 
FY 2019 Committee Approval and Appropriation Requested .............................. $11,500,000 Pro2:ram Summarv 
The Judiciary Capital Security Program is dedicated to improving physical security in buildings occupied 
by the Judiciary and USMS. In most cases, these projects are in lieu of constructing new facilities, thereby providing cost savings and expedited delivery. 
These projects will vary in size, locatiori, 
and delivery method and are designed to·improve the separation of circulation for 
the public, judges, and prisoners. Funding provided for the security improvement projects will address elements such 
as adding doors, recon:figuring or adding corridors, reconfiguring or adding elevators and sallyports, and constructing physical 
or visual ban1ers. 
Justification 
This program provides a vehicle for addressing security deficiencies in a tin1ely and less costly manner when construcfu1g a 
new courthouse is unlikely in the foreseeable future. The projects in this program are based 
on studies undertaken by the Judiciary. This prospectus requests separate funding to 
address security conditions at existing Federal courthouses. The Judiciary's asset 
management planning process helps in the compilation of a preliminary assessment of potential 
projects that involve courthouses with poor security ratings nationwide.

48 is part of the DFC's main campus and contains 154,422 gross square feet. The first section 
of the building was originally constructed in 1941 as part of the Denver Ordinance 
Plant, with additions made in the 1950s, 1960s, and in 1971. The building is predominantly warehouse space that was formerly occupied 
by theN ational Archives and Records Administration (NARA), which moved to a new-location in 2013.

Proposed Project 
The project proposes a full modernization of Building 48 to renovate approximately 
149,000 RSF of space, including the addition of a main entrance with an atrium to provide for daylighting. A below-grade courtyard will provide access and natural light 
for the basement-level office space with new windows and landscaping. This project will allow for a higher density open office environment and the relocation 
of the IBC from leased space. Exterior walls will 
be insulated, repaired, and re-caulked, and the masonry will be 
repainted. All exterior windows will be replaced with efficient insulated glazing. Additional windows 
will be added to increase natural light. The entire roof and roof drain system will 
be replaced with skylights and solar tubes to provide top lighting, thereby increasing daylight penetration into the building's interior spaces. 
The project also vvill 
replace exterior stairs, railings, ramps, and sidewalks. A parking lot to accommodate approximately 
500 parking spaces ·will be constructed. Site utilities will be replaced and relocated. The basement 
vvill be built out and used for office space. To accommodate the use of the basement, a passenger elevator will 
be installed. \Valls that do not provide structural support will 
be removed to create an open office area. Some loading docks will be removed, and the remaining docks will have new levelers, seal enclosures 
on doors, and electric vehicle charging stations installed. There also will 
be structural repairs and upgrades to provide sufficient support to 
the existing structure and additions. The plumbing systems for hot water, chilled water, 
and sanitary sewer piping will be 
replaced, along with two domestic hot water heaters and gas piping. The project also includes an energy-efficient cooling and 
hea6ng system with appropriate air distribution and building automation system, ·new electrical system, emergency

The project proposes to renovate and reconfigure floors 4, 6, and 7 of the existing building, resulting 
in an open office enviromnent with sufficient work and meeting space to meet Education's programmatic requirements in a much more efficient manner while consolidating personnel from leased space. The majority 
of the building system capacities will meet the forecast demand after consolidation, but a few system upgrades are 
needed~ These upgrades include the HV AC controls, new power distribution circuits and breaker ties, open mobile workspace construction, and a new generator. The proposed project also includes life safety items, such as 
ne\V alann annunciators and replacement 
of equipment in fire control rooms, and items to improve energy efficiency. Additionally, the switchgear replacement project will replace the medium and low 
. voltage switchgear and network transfonners and protectors, and upgrade the 
monitoring devices within the switchgears to be compatible with GSA requirements for the advanced metering systems.

7 The garage is over 
40 years old and is in urgent need of a major renovation. The .garage is suffering from multiple concrete-related failures including: delamination on the floor slabs and beams, and slab reinforcement 
with extensive section loss; concrete spalling and delamination at some column facades; water leakage on the underside 
of the supported level; and 
deteriorated expansion joints. The current electrical infrastructure 
will be upgraded/replaced to meet current codes. The installation ofbollards on both the entrance and exit ramps 
of the garage-will enhance security. Interim short-tenn repairs have been undertaken with minor repair and alteration program funds over the past decade in an attempt to address immediate safety measures. The corrosion, spalling, and delamination 
of the structure are threatening tenant and property safety. 
Sections of the garage have been closed due to the risk. Currently, two parking spaces 
in. the lower level are closed due to falling concrete. Ten additional parking spaces 
.in the lower level are closed due to water leaks from the upper deck that have damaged several vehicles. Until a major repair is completed, tenant safety 
will continue to be 
threatened, closures of sections of the garage will need to be continued and expanded, and degradation 
of the garage deck will continue. 
Summary of Enenzy Compliance 
This project will be designed to confonn to requirements of the Facilities Standards for 
the Public Buildings Service. GSA encourages design opportunities to increase energy 
and water efficiency above the minimum performance criteria.

P.roposed Project 
The project proposes to repair the plaza at the Stokes Courthouse to eliminate water leaks and infiltration 
into the lower levels of the building. The scope includes refmishing and reinforcing the structural steel that supports the plaza, along with repairs to fireproofing and upgrading the surface parking lot. 
The project also proposes to extend the cunently incomplete plaza toward Superior 
A venue as was envisioned in the original design. Due to a funding shortage when the building was originally constructed, a 
portion of the plaza was left unfinished.

Justification $16.515,000 
$16,515,000 
The stmctural steel that supports the plaza is exposed to the elements and has been sin<;;e 
the original constmction. The steel has considerable mst damage, and the structural beams that support the plaza and connect 
into the parking garage are heavily conoded. 
Part of the unfinished plaza includes the base of the structural steel columns that are at with the Cleveland Regional Transit Authority 
train tracks beams that 
run above and across the train tracks. If the steel continues to be left unattended, it will 
become difficult to repair and will result in structural issues. The conoded steel is also very unsightly 
a11d detracts from the appearance of the courthouse. 
The plaza has experienced excessive water infiltration in many areas that will 1-vorsen 
until repairs are completed. The leaks have been causing damage to the strucnu·e, interior finishes, and the :fireproofmg in the lower levels 
of the building.

The plaza surrounding the Stokes Courthouse remains incomplete from the time of the original construction in 
2002. The sidewalk on the northwest side 
of the site is built on a portion 
of the city-owued and controlled Huron Road. This sidewalk is the only way to access the building from the southeast intersection 
of Huron Road and Superior A venue. 
Once the plaza is completed, the sidewalk will be returned to the city, and this will restore a lane 
of traffic on Huron Road. Completion of the plaza will protect the structural steel 
from future damage, improve pedestrian access to the building, incorporate the building into the surrounding urban environment, and significantly improve the appearance 
of the Stokes Courthouse. The building's location w1thin the city acts 
as a prominent gateway for those entering into the city from the west Unfortunately, this impression is lost when visitors reach the intersection 
of Huron Road and Superior 
A venue, where the steel installed for the completion of the plaza is rusting and the appearance 
of the facility at street level is that of a public building that is difficult to approach.

Proposed Project 
The building is suffering :liom recurrent flooding caused by the aged domestic water piping system and significant temperature and indoor 
air quality issues caused by the insufficient and outdated 
HV AC system. Electrical system components will be replaced to support 
the· HVAC systems. Mitigation of hazardous materials and associated sprinkler modifications will be accomplished 
in disturbed areas as part of the project. To repair the building's domestic water system, the piping 
will need to be exposed, 
abated of asbestos, inspected, and repaired. Concurrently, the building's induction unit 
system will be removed, 
abated of asbestos, and upgraded to a four-pipe fan coil system. Due to the invasive nature 
of this vvork and the presence of hazardous materials, the majority 
of building tenants will be moved into intemal s>ving space. The less invasive aspects 
of the project include repairing the storm water system, replacing the building automation system, replacing the 
all: handling units, partial conversion to variable 
air volume serving interior zones, replacing the heating and chilled water systems, and replacing the boilers. As noted above, this renovation 
is in an occupied building so the proposed project includes allowances for internal swing space. The project 
minimizes tenant impact by 
using internal svving space and hazardous materials enclosmes, as well as by completing the scope items together.

The project will address the failing domestic. water piping system that has flooded the building three times 
in the past 4 years, creating millions of dollars in damage to the building and personal property. 
TI1e damage has displaced tenants for months at a time and interfered with their ability 
to carry out their missions. The threat of another major flood 
is imminent, and there is a serious 1isk that additional flooding could potentially damage the historic rotunda, which would be enormously costly. to repair. 
If left unaddressed, the building could potentially become uninhabitable and would need to be considered for disposal. Due 
to the major disruption caused by the repair of the plumbing system, GSA 
determined that this project will provide the opportunity to upgrade the deficient HVAC systems. The HV AC systems the building are approximately 
20 years past their useful lives and are vulnerable to a large-scale failure 
in both the air handling units and the branch piping leading to the perimeter induction units. There have been longstanding temperature and indoor air quality issues caused 
by a system that was not designed for office space. 
In addition to affecting occupant comfmt, poor dehumidification has caused the paint, plaster, 
ai1d wall materials to peel at numerous locations in the building, including in the historic rotunda and in areas with lead-based paint. 
T.he two pipe induction system is highly inefficient, 
forcing building switchover betweenl1eating 
and cooling to address unseasonal temperatures 
(e.g,, cooling in the winter and heating in the summer). Simultaneously completing these projects 
will save the Government 
approximately $13 million in duplicative costs, while minimizing disruption to building tenants.

· Prospectus Number: 
CongTessional District: PTX-1618-AU19 25 The 48-year-old building has undergone various renovation projects over the years, but never a complete modernization, including upgrades. The space, converted from light 
industlial to office use, does not include the appropriate lighting, HV AC, ceilings, or 
finishes for office space. Window replacement vvill provide energy efficiency and costs savings. The building systems are outdated and have reached the 
end of their useful lives. Tbe old main switchboard needs Teplacement 
to comply with the National Electric 
Code. The control system and related electronic components need frequent repairs, and parts are no longer available. The original power distribution system is inadequate for the 
elecmcal loads that aTe now required. The HV AC equipment has reached or surpassed its life expectancy. The storm water 
and sanitary lines do not meet cunent code and need 
to be separated. Runoff from heav;r rains often floods the loading dock's storm drain, causing flooding in the building when floor drains back up. All the domestic water lines are old and corroded and need to be replaced. 
Summary of Energy Compliance 
This project will be designed to conf01m to requirements of the Facilities Standards for 
the Public Buildings Service. GSA encourages design opportunities to increase energy and water efficiency above the 
minimum performance criteria.

will provide FDA a state-of-the-art laboratory facility with ancillary office space to support laboratory functions. The facility will be built to meet biosafety level 
2 
specifications. Laboratory layout will be modular and designed to create higher 
efficiency of workflow while maintaining agency chain-of-custody regulations. The office 
space will primarily consist of open workstations and a collaborative enviromnent.

Justification 
FDA is currently housed in laboratory and laboratory support space at the DFC in 
Building 20, a converted ammunitions plant building that also houses multiple Federal operations and offices. Building 
20 is well past its useful life and experiencing major building system deficiencies. 
Due to current conditions, failing building systems are projected to cause a 
shutdmvn of its current space within 1 to 5 years. 
The building uses excessive amounts of energy and struggles to maintain proper humidity and pressurization levels due to inadequacies 
in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system and building enclosure, which are 
ctitical components to prevent 
contamination within laboratories. FDA processes evidence 
in court cases that must be tested and stored appropriately; some 
samples must be stored for up to 8 years. These samples are irreplaceable and failing infrastructure could place them at 
risk for contamination and spoilage. Costly laboratory equipment is 
at risk of being damaged due to severe roofleaks. The current space 
is compartmentalized with hard wall offices and no capability of 
changing space to accommodate workflow or to facilitate collaboration. FDA has storage spaces and conference rooms that were built to accommodate program areas that no longer exist, and later built laboratory space around those areas. As its space has changed and evolved, the result is pockets 
Of unused space sprinkled throughout the area. This 
situation has resulted in inefficient use of space that does not meet regulatory requirements 
to isolate laboratory space from office work areas. This location is the regional regulatory arm 
of FDA and a critical part of its mission. Various departments include laboratories 
that analyze food, drugs, and cosri1etics; a compliance department; investigators; and an administration team. 
For sections of the country west 
of the Mississippi River and east of Nevada, this facility is responsible for managing foodbome 
illness outbreaks. FDA uses this facility to analyze food samples to determine the source 
of the illness so the food can be immediately recalled to prevent further illness or death. This laboratory analyzes foods crossing 
State boundaries, as well as foods that are flown in from other countries to ensure it is safe for consumption.

The current h~ase at 300 S'h Avenue expires October 31, 2020. DOL is scheduled to 
consolidate this office and relocate to the Federal Office Building (FOB) at 909 
Avenue in Seattle, by October 1, 2021. DOL requires continued housing at its current location until the new 
space is readied for occupancy. DOL will backfill vacant space made 
available from a recent Depart.ment of the Interior-National Park Service (NPS) consolidation project 
in the FOB, and a Department of Housing and Urban Development 
(HUD) relocation and consolidation from the FOB to the Jackson Federal Building (JFB) 
at 915 Second Avenue in Seattle. The consolidation will reduce DOL's all-in utilization rate from 250 
to 166 per person with a reduction in usable square footage from 
74,832 to 49,637. The 
DOL move to the FOB is dependent on the completion of the NPS consolidation and HUD's relocation to 
the JFB. The 3-year terrn is to cover any potential delays 
in the coordination ofthese projects.

Estimated Total Annual Cost3: $10,050,000 
Acouisition Strate1!V 
In order to !Jlaximize the flexibility and competition in acquiring space for CSOSA, PSA, 
and PDS, GSA may issue a single, multiple-award solicitation that will allow offerors to provide blocks 
of space able to meet requirements in whole or in part. All offers must 
provide space consistent with the delineated area defined by this prospectus. 
Background 
The National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act first established 
CSOSA in 1997 to provide community supervision for adult offenders on 
probation, parole, and supervised release in the District of Columbia. CSOSA's mission is 
to enhance public safety, prevent crime, and reduce recidivism among those supervised and to support the fair administration 
of justice in close collaboration with the 
community. 
PSA's mission is to promote pretrial justice and enhance community safety. It assists judicial officers 
in both the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and the United States 
District Court for the District of Columbia by conducting a risk assessment for 
every arrested person who will be presented in court and fonnulating release or detention recommendations. 
PDS' mission is to promote and provide quality court-appointed counsel in criminal and 
juvenile delinquency cases pending before the Superior Court of 
the District of Columbia. 
Justification 
Due to the nature of their functions, CSOSA, PSA, and PDS need to be housed within close proximity to the courts 
to address mission-based matters that may arise with the 
sentencing and/or supervision of their clients. CSOSA staff supervises approximately I 
4,000 offenders on any given day. The court often directs probationers to report promptly to 
CSOSA for a variety of reasons that may require immediate attention before 
judicial decisions can be made. For the defendants who are placed on conditional release 
pending trial, PSA provides supervision and treatment services that reasonably assure that 
they return to court and do not engage in criminal activity pending their trial and/or 
sentencing. PDS staff makes frequent trips to the DC Superior Court daily in support of 
3 New leases may contain an escabticn clause to provicle for annual in n:J! eslnte taxes and opcmiing cnsts.

PDS's \Vork, and the court relies heavily on the immediate availability of PDS staff to 
attend to the many matters that may arise. These agencies have housed their offices m close proximity to the courts since their creation. They anticipate 
continued housing needs beyond the proposed term of this lease 
(20 years). 
CSOSA's goal is to reduce its real estate footprint through consolidation and vacating some 
of its existing locations. CSOSA \Vill reduce its real estate footprint and operational costs through open space plans and office sharing, where feasible. 
While neither PDS nor 
PSA have published reduction goals, the proposed project reflects reductions from their current 
footprint Summarv 
of Energv Compliance 
GSA will incorporate energy efficiency requirements into the Request for Lease 
Proposals and other documents related to tfie procurement of space based on the approved prospectus. 
GSA encourages offerors to exceed minimum requirements set 
forth in the procurement and to achieve an Energy Star performance rating of 75 or 
higher. 
Resolutions of Approval 
Resolutions adopted by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and the 
Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works approving this prospectus will constitute approval 
to make appropriations to lease space in a facility that will yield the 
required rentable area. 
Interim Leasing GSA 
will execute such interim leasing actions as are necessarj to ensure continued 
housing of the tenant agency prior to the effective date of the new lease. It is in the best 
interest of the Government to avert the financial risk ofholdover tenancy.

(2) The harms caused by child pornography begin, but do not end, with child sex abuse because child pornography is a permanent record of that abuse and trafficking in those images compounds the harm to the child. (3) In Paroline v. United States (2014), the Supreme Court recognized that ‘‘every view-ing of child pornography is a repetition of the victim’s abuse’’. (4) The American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children has stated that for vic-tims of child pornography, ‘‘the sexual abuse of the child, the memorialization of that abuse which becomes child pornography, and its subsequent distribution and viewing be-come psychologically intertwined and each compound the harm suffered by the child- victim’’. (5) Victims suffer continuing and grievous harm as a result of knowing that a large, in-determinate number of individuals have viewed and will in the future view images of their childhood sexual abuse. Harms of this sort are a major reason that child pornog-raphy is outlawed. (6) The unlawful collective conduct of every individual who reproduces, distributes, or possesses the images of a victim’s child-hood sexual abuse plays a part in sustaining and aggravating the harms to that indi-vidual victim. Multiple actors independently commit intentional crimes that combine to produce an indivisible injury to a victim. (7) It is the intent of Congress that victims of child pornography be fully compensated for all the harms resulting from every perpe-trator who contributes to their anguish. Such an aggregate causation standard re-flects the nature of child pornography and the unique ways that it actually harms vic-tims. SEC. 3. DETERMINING RESTITUTION.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress finds the fol-lowing: (1) The crime of human trafficking in-volves the exploitation of adults through force, fraud, or coercion, and children for such purposes as forced labor or commercial sex. (2) Reliable data on the prevalence of human trafficking in the United States is not available, but cases have been reported in all 50 States, the territories of the United States, and the District of Columbia. (3) Each year, thousands of individuals may be trafficked within the United States, according to recent estimates from victim advocates. (4) More accurate and comprehensive data on the prevalence of human trafficking is needed to properly combat this form of mod-ern slavery in the United States. (5) Victims of human trafficking can in-clude men, women, and children who are di-verse with respect to race, ethnicity, and na-tionality, among other factors. (6) Since the enactment of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (Public Law 106–386; 114 Stat. 1464), human traffickers have launched increasingly sophisticated schemes to increase the scope of their activi-ties and the number of their victims.

ADJOURNMENT FROM FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 2018, TO TUES-DAY, OCTOBER 2, 2018 Mr. MARINO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 12:30 p.m. on Tuesday, October 2, 2018. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

NATIONAL RECOVERY MONTH (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to celebrate September being National Recovery Month. Sponsored by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Adminis-tration, SAMHSA, I encourage every-one to take time this month to reach out to those who they know are suf-fering or have suffered from mental and substance abuse disorders. Currently, 115 people die every day from opioid abuse. Clearly, that is way too many, and, sadly, only one example of numerous types of mental and sub-stance abuse disorders in the United States. If you or anyone you know is strug-gling, there are resources available, in-cluding a Suicide Prevention Lifeline, SAMHSA’s National Helpline, and more. SAMHSA’s website, www.samhsa.gov, has these phone numbers, treatment center locations, grant applications for local govern-ments, and general health information. With hard work, smart policy deci-sions, and a dedicated American public, we can turn these numbers around.

RECOGNIZING STAFF MEMBER AUDRA WILSON (Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank a longtime staff member, my deputy chief of staff, Audra Wilson. After more than 5 years of service to the people of Illinois’ Second Congres-sional District, Audra is leaving my of-fice to serve as the new executive di-rector of the League of Women Voters of Illinois. I first met Audra in 2003 while serv-ing as a State representative. Audra has been with my congressional staff from day one. As my deputy chief of staff and district director, she has played an important role in organizing essential district programming like our jobs and health fairs, our local Black Women & Girls programming, and has skillfully maintained our local district task forces. Audra is also my constant plus one whenever I want to grab a bite of In-dian food. I congratulate Audra and her family, especially her beautiful and brilliant daughter, Ava, my future district di-rector in the year 2038. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to have had the privilege to work with Audra, and on behalf of the people she served for over 5 years, I commend her and say: Job well done. f 
VICTIMS OF CONGRESSIONAL DELAY (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, one in four women will experience domestic violence during their life. Nearly three women are murdered by their spouses every day. This is violent America in our time. Violence in the family unit. These crimes affect the spouse, the children, and the quality of life of our community. The Violence Against Women Act, or VAWA, has helped women throughout our Nation. Lifesaving programs and resources have given victims of domestic vio-lence, sexual assault, stalking, and dat-ing violence a chance for a better life. My legislation to reauthorize the full funding of VAWA through 2019 will help victims of violence and support groups that work with battered fami-lies. But Congress has only extended VAWA for 3 months. Women affected by domestic violence deserve better than more delay. Stand-ing up for victims is not a partisan issue. Congress needs to fully fund and reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act because domestic violence victims are people too. And that is just the way it is.

JUDGE THOMAS-ANITA HILL V. JUDGE KAVANAUGH-CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD (Ms. D
ELAURO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Ms. D
ELAURO. Mr. Speaker, the United States Senate is about to em-bark on a misguided journey. How can there be a vote to place Judge Kavanaugh in a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court under this cloud? To be sure, a person is innocent until proven guilty, but without a full and public hearing about the veracity of these very serious charges of sexual harassment, a decision today to elevate Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court casts doubt on the entire proc-ess. Allegations of sexual harassment are serious charges which deserve serious consideration. The Justices of the Su-preme Court must demonstrate respect for the law and for individual rights. To impugn the integrity of Professor Christine Blasey Ford, to elevate that of Judge Kavanaugh, is not appropriate

nor is it a credible tactic. The Amer-ican people deserve more than a dis-missal of Professor Ford’s charges. They deserve to know the truth. Mr. Speaker, let us take time to un-cover the truth. I gave this same exact speech on October 8, 1991. The only dif-ference was the substitution of Clar-ence Thomas’ name for Brett Kavanaugh’s and Anita Hill’s for Chris-tine Blasey Ford’s. Republicans attempted to censure me for that speech. History is repeating itself before our eyes, and women are once again being ignored instead of being believed. We must do better than that in the United States of America and in the United States Congress.

URGING THE SENATE TO CONFIRM JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH (Mr. BYRNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge the Senate to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Judge Kavanaugh has a clear record as a thoughtful jurist who respects and will defend our Constitution. Those who have worked with him over the years and know him best strongly defend his record as a good man who loves his family and our country. I am ashamed we find ourselves where we are today. It is shameful the way that Judge Kavanaugh has had his name smeared, just as it is shameful that Dr. Ford has been used as a pawn in a political game. Frankly, my heart hurts for both of them. Our government is only as good as the people who serve in it, and I am deeply concerned that this whole series of events will encourage fewer good men and women to take up the call of government service. Mr. Speaker, this circus must end. The Senate should vote on Judge Kavanaugh, approve him to serve on the Supreme Court, and allow our great country to move forward. 
f 
b1245 THE RULE OF LAW AND THE CONSTITUTION MUST PREVAIL (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to join my friend from Texas, as the author of the Vio-lence Against Women Act. In 2018, I encouraged my colleagues to step up and pass this vital legisla-tion that now protects all who have been abused in some way from sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking, and, yes, domestic violence. I am saddened that the House has not seen fit to join this bill that I have au-thored with over 35 national non-partisan groups and, as well, with over 150-plus Members of the United States Congress. It is time now. Finally, sitting in the United States Senate, listening to the hearings re-garding Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford, let me say that I hope our col-leagues will yield not to politics but to the rule of law, adhere to the American Bar Association that says pause, to the Jesuits who have taken away their en-dorsement, and realize that we are not the important factor, but it was the weight of the Supreme Court that re-quires better. Finally, I am delighted to note that we are moving forward on juvenile jus-tice, as we have done today—legisla-tion that I have authored—and that we are working on behalf of the people. But again, Mr. Speaker, it is impor-tant in the United States Senate that the rule of law and the Constitution prevail. Advice and consent must be given with knowledge. f 
NATIONAL URBAN WILDLIFE REFUGE DAY (Mr. WITTMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support my resolution, H. Res. 1088, a resolution recognizing this Sat-urday, September 29, as National Urban Wildlife Refuge Day. Across the country, urban wildlife refuges are places for families to gath-er and enjoy the outdoors. Urban ref-uges are places where communities can come together to preserve nature, and places to inspire the next generation of hunters and anglers. I encourage all generations, whether old or young, to go visit one of the 101 national urban wildlife refuges throughout the United States. I thank Representative H
AKEEM  J
EFFRIES for partnering with me on this legislation to help further empha-size the value of our Nation’s urban wildlife refuges. 
f 
WOOD-PAWCATUCK WATERSHED (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the 50th anniver-sary of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, signed into law on October 2, 1968. This landmark conservation bill launched a movement. It helped us rec-ognize and protect the free-flowing riv-ers with ‘‘outstandingly remarkable’’ characteristics. In Rhode Island and Connecticut, we have just such waterways, including the branches of the Wood and Pawcatuck Rivers. Just this week, in cooperation with Senator J
ACKREED, I introduced legis-lation to designate the 110 miles of this river system as a Wild and Scenic River. After 3 years of intense study, the National Park Service has found it to have areas of pristine beauty, rec-reational importance, and untouched wilderness. I applaud the work of Denise Poyer, the study coordinator at the Wood- Pawcatuck Watershed Association, and all of those who have volunteered their time to protect this river. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to work-ing with my colleagues on the Natural Resources Committee to complete this designation. f 
CONGRATULATING JIM PAXTON (Mr. COMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mr. Jim Paxton of the First District of Kentucky on his retirement from the Paducah Sun newspaper. Within the first year of his career, he quickly rose through the ranks to serve as the Paducah Sun’s editor and publisher. As he and his brothers joined the generations of Paxton family mem-bers who have led and managed Paxton Media Group, they began to expand their operations into local television broadcasting with WPSD-TV and radio broadcasts, eventually owning and managing more than 35 daily and week-ly newspapers throughout the South-eastern United States. The Paducah Sun’s continued success is a testament to Jim’s belief that local newspapers should focus on prominently featuring news from the community, while also striking the ap-propriate balance of State and national coverage. Throughout his career, Jim Paxton has established an outstanding legacy as a revered public servant and titan of western Kentucky media. He is widely respected for his pursuit of meaningful, insightful journalism, and I am thank-ful for his friendship and guidance throughout the years. As he begins the next phase of his life, I join with his family and friends, as well as those he has impacted during his career, to express our dedication and gratitude for his contributions to western Kentucky.

NATIONAL URBAN WILDLIFE REFUGE DAY (Mr. JEFFRIES asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H. Res. 1088, a resolu-tion recognizing September 29 as Na-tional Urban Wildlife Refuge Day, au-thored by Representative W
ITTMAN . Earlier this year, my bill, Keep America’s Refuges Operational Act, be-came law. That bipartisan bill reau-thorized a volunteer, community part-nership, and education program for our National Wildlife Refuge System.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H9395 September 28, 2018 
We believe in the importance of maintaining a system of wildlands throughout this great country. That is why I am proud to join my colleague, Representative W
ITTMAN , in sponsoring this resolution to recognize our Na-tion’s 101 national urban wildlife ref-uges. People visit refuges to experience America’s natural beauty. They help to mold the next generation of conserva-tionists and outdoor enthusiasts by providing learning experiences and cherished memories for America’s fam-ilies. Refuges have a tremendous impact for communities all over America, even in my hometown of Brooklyn. We must remain vigilant in protecting the breathtaking wildlife and beautiful en-vironment God has given America. Urban refuges are essential in achiev-ing that goal.

HONORING COLONEL ALFRED ASCH (Mr. MOOLENAAR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. MOOLENAAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the members of the Michigan delegation and the House of Representatives for their support and unanimous passage of my legislation earlier this month to rename the Bea-verton Post Office in honor of the late Colonel Alfred Asch. Alfred was born and raised in Bea-verton, and, as a young boy, he was fas-cinated by aviation. In September of 1941, after graduating high school, he entered the Army Corps. He flew more than 70 missions over north Africa and Europe, earning numerous decorations, while documenting his experiences in letters to Naomi, his girlfriend and wife-to-be. He continued to serve in the Air Force until 1968, and he made con-tributions to military and civilian flight. His work took him away from Michi-gan, but he always kept his hometown in his heart. He funded a scholarship at Central Michigan University for stu-dents from Gladwin County, and pro-ceeds from his memoir helped fund the Beaverton Activity Center. I am proud to have the support of Colonel Asch’s family and his two sons, David and Peter, who have said their father’s childhood in Beaverton helped him face life’s early challenges before taking on the world. Alfred Asch was a great American and a hometown hero for Beaverton, Michigan.

REMEMBERING LOUISE M CINTOSH SLAUGHTER (Mr. TONKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, during this 115th session of Congress, the House lost one of its most passionate souls, the late Representative Louise McIntosh Slaughter. She worked day in and day out with great passion and with great integrity. She understood that it was about trust that was placed into a Member of Con-gress by the people who have chosen you to be their voice here in Congress. To Louise Slaughter it was impor-tant to make certain that government was transparent and accountable, so she drove the Stop Trading On Con-gressional Knowledge Act, which was dubbed the STOCK Act. I am so proud to have sponsored legislation today that has renamed, in her honor, the STOCK Act. Louise Slaughter worked for trans-parency in this House. She knew that it was about making lives of the con-stituents that we represent all the stronger and all the fuller and not en-riching our own lives by the trust placed in us. It is an honor to rename the STOCK Act because of her hard work and be-cause of her integrity. f 
HONORING L AGRANGE FIRE DEPARTMENT (Mr. FERGUSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the bravery of the La-Grange Fire Department. In the early hours on the morning of Labor Day, the department received a call for a house fire. As firefighters battled the blaze, the flames were so hot that their fire hose melted in two. Firefighters were trapped in the house. Luckily, everyone made it out. But six of those firefighters suffered se-vere burns and injuries: Pete Trujillo, Jordan Avera, Jonathan Williamson, Josh Williams, Jim Ormsby, and Sean Guerrero. All are on the mend, but they suffered very, very severe injuries. These brave men and women put their lives on the line every single day to keep our loved ones safe in an emer-gency with no expectation of recogni-tion for their heroism. But today, I would like us all to pause and think about the tough work that they do and the danger that they put their lives in. I would like us all to thank them and extend our deepest gratitude to these firefighters and all of those around the Nation. 
f 
TARIFF IMPACTS (Mr. CLEAVER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, re-cently, I spent time listening to farm-ers, large manufacturers, and leaders of smaller companies in my district ex-press their frustrations on how tariffs are affecting their bottom line. I visited a steel fabrication company, an architectural aluminum design company, and a brewery. Although these companies vary in product, they all shared one common fear: wondering what would be their fate in the pres-ence of these ill-advised tariffs. I listened to farmers offer feedback on how they are affected. Agriculture is one of Missouri’s top industries, bringing in about $88 billion a year. Most farmers tell me that the recently announced USDA payments are help-ful, but that, ultimately, in their words, ‘‘we want trade, not aid.’’ I met with local chambers of com-merce and business councils, and, for those I didn’t even have a chance to visit, I created a survey on my website. What I learned is this: These tariffs are deeply damaging to these businesses in ways that those who promoted them perhaps never even contemplated. Hundreds of thousands of jobs may be in jeopardy because of these tariffs. For example, Harley-Davidson, a com-pany that I was able to bring to Kansas City during my term as mayor, sud-denly announced that they were clos-ing the plant and moving overseas. They left nearly 1,000 workers unem-ployed overnight. Now, just imagine, if you multiply that around the country, what kind of instability has been cre-ated. Mr. Speaker, I hope that this admin-istration will recognize that these tar-iffs are unstable to the community and then move to end this trade war today. f 
ANGELS IN ADOPTION (Mr. RUTHERFORD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Brian Kelly from Jacksonville, Florida, who has been named a 2018 Angels in Adoption honoree. This Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute award recognizes and honors outstanding individuals who have made contributions to the adoption community. For more than 25 years, Brian Kelly has worked as an adoption attorney. Through his work at his law firm and at Jacksonville Legal Aid, Brian has touched, literally, thousands of lives promoting adoption in northeast Flor-ida. He has also worked with the Flor-ida bar to encourage the practice of adoption laws across the State. In addition to his professional work, Brian has devoted his life to serving his community, whether it be serving his church or chairing the board of direc-tors at Angelwood, a center in Jack-sonville that provides services to peo-ple with developmental disabilities. Brian has dedicated countless hours in service to others. I have had the opportunity to get to know Brian throughout his work, and I am pleased to honor him today on be-half of the many grateful families of northeast Florida. I commend Brian Kelly for this much-deserved honor of being named a 2018 Angels in Adoption honoree.

b1300 YWCA (Ms. JUDY CHU of California asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the YWCA USA as they celebrate their 160th anniversary. With a mission that is dedicated to eliminating racism, empowering women, and promoting peace, justice, freedom, and dignity for all, the YWCA is exactly the kind of organization we need today. It provides leadership de-velopment programs for young women in topics ranging from economic em-powerment to engaging young girls in STEM fields. From its humble beginnings, the YWCA now operates 1,300 program sites across 47 States and the District of Co-lumbia, serving over 2 million women, girls, and their families. It has been at the forefront of social progress, from civil rights to voting rights, to equal pay, to healthcare reform. It is currently the largest network of providers to help victims of domestic violence or sexual assault. In my dis-trict, the YWCA in San Gabriel Valley serves nearly 4,000 people, annually, through its domestic violence program called WINGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the YWCA for 160 years of great work.

RECOGNIZING CARL WEATHERS (Mr. ARRINGTON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of a remark-able man and a fellow west Texan, re-tired Texas Ranger Captain Carl A. Weathers, who passed away recently. Captain Weathers devoted his life’s work to serving his country and my home State of Texas first as a soldier in the United States Army, and then with an over 40-year career in Texas law enforcement, beginning as a State trooper and rising to the rank of cap-tain in the Texas Rangers. Throughout their long and storied history, the Rangers have remained the best of the best in Texas law enforce-ment. Captain Weathers carried out the Texas Rangers’ legacy in true west Texas fashion: with integrity, courage, and service to his fellow man. Along with his dedication to the Texas Rangers, Carl was a devoted hus-band and family man. To Carl’s family, I join you in cele-brating a life well-lived and trusting that he has heard those beautiful and powerful words from our glorious cre-ator: ‘‘Well done, good and faithful servant.’’ RECOGNIZING FORMER U.N. HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCE ZEID RA’AD AL HUSSEIN (Mr. COFFMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary work of the former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Prince Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, who left his post on September 1. His tireless ef-forts enabled him to become a voice for those who found themselves defenseless against those who abuse the human rights of others in order to gain and maintain power. High Commissioner Zeid was very helpful during the debate over the pas-sage of H. Res. 128, supporting respect for human rights and encouraging in-clusive governance in Ethiopia. He not only publicly endorsed the resolution, but sent a representative during the critical negotiations to bring H. Res. 128 to the floor of the United States House of Representatives for a vote. Mr. Speaker, former United Nations High Commissioner Prince Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein will forever be remembered by the Ethiopian people for his role in the passage of H. Res. 128. f 
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT (Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, as I travel through my district, the women of Orange County have expressed their support for poli-cies that safeguard women and chil-dren, including the Violence Against Women Act. As the mother of two daughters, I share their support for this legislation and care deeply about ensuring the safety of all women. For 24 years, the Violence Against Women Act has provided lifesaving services for survivors of domestic and dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. While I am pleased we passed a short- term extension of the Violence Against Women Act, we must work together to-wards a long-term reauthorization that will allow us to continue to protect and support survivors. We owe it to sur-vivors to ensure this law remains in place, and I will continue to work to make this happen.

RECOGNIZING INDUCTEES OF THE ARKANSAS BLACK HALL OF FAME (Mr. HILL asked and was given per-mission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today to congratulate the six Arkansans in the 2018 class of inductees of the Arkansas Black Hall of Fame. This year’s inductees include: Kevin Cole, a celebrated painter, printmaker, and sculptor; Brent Jennings, a prolific award-win-ning actor and director; Lieutenant General Aundre Piggee, U.S. Army deputy chief of staff for lo-gistics at the Pentagon; Darrell Walker, a former NBA player and current men’s basketball coach at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock; Mary Louise Williams, a legendary educator and political leader; and Florence Price, the first African American woman recognized as a sym-phonic composer and to have a com-position played by a major orchestra. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize these six Arkansans who will join the Hall of Fame’s more than 140 members for their lasting contributions to our communities and our State. I con-gratulate these inductees who exem-plify the spirit and dedication behind this fine honor. f 
THANKING ARMY SPECIALIST RYAN WILCOX AND HOMES FOR OUR TROOPS (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, Army Specialist Ryan Wilcox heroically served our Nation in two combat tours. Specialist Wilcox first deployed to Iraq as a combat engineer with the 479th Engineer Battalion. In 2007, he suffered a gunshot wound to his leg at that time. In 2012, he returned to Active Duty in Afghanistan with the 444th Engineer Battalion. During this tour, he suffered chronic pain resulting, ultimately, in the amputation of his right leg. Now retired, Specialist Wilcox is looking to start a new life in upstate New York with his fiancee, Sara, and their two children, Nicholas and Juli-ana. This Saturday, a terrific organiza-tion known as Homes for Our Troops will donate a specially adapted home in Mexico, New York, for Specialist Wilcox and his family. This home will allow him to navigate easily through-out his home so he can focus more on his family, finishing college, and con-tinuing his work to help fellow vet-erans in need. Mr. Speaker, please join me in thank-ing Specialist Wilcox for his heroic service to our Nation, as well as hon-oring, congratulating, and thanking Homes for Our Troops for helping transform the lives of our Nation’s he-roes like Ryan Wilcox and his family.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H9397 September 28, 2018 
Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Murray Watson, Jr., of Mart, Texas, who passed away on July 24, 2018. Murray was born in 1932 in Mart, Texas, to Murray Watson, Sr., and Ethel Bryson Watson. He graduated from Mart High School in 1949, from Baylor University with a bachelor’s de-gree in 1952, and a juris doctorate from Baylor in 1954. In 1957, he was elected to the Texas House of Representatives. In 1963, he was elected to the Texas Senate, where he served for 10 years. During his lifetime in elected office, Murray was involved in crafting and passing many pieces of influential leg-islation, including the establishment of what is now known as Texas State Technical College, a vocational school based in Waco, with campuses all across our State. Murray served as the school’s general counsel, and the Wat-son family’s contributions to the school are significant. Both Murray and his wife have buildings named in their honor on the TSTC campus in Waco. His passion for education extended long after his retirement from politics. He took a leading role in founding the Brazos Higher Education Authority and Brazos Higher Education Service Corporation, Inc., to help students fund their education. He also served as a trustee of the McLennan Community College Foundation. In 2017, he was named Baylor Lawyer of the Year for his commitment to education and his philanthropic spirit. Murray was a member of the Rotary Club of Waco, the Austin Avenue Meth-odist Church, the Baylor Masonic Lodge, the Waco Scottish Rite Consis-tory, the Order of the Eastern Star, the Baylor Law Alumni Association, the Baylor Bear Foundation, and the Baylor Founders Club. While Murray was committed to serving others, his role as a family man was the pride of his life. He allowed nothing to come between him and his family, including Greta, his wife of nearly 59 years, two children, a daugh-ter-in-law, and two grandchildren. Murray also owned and operated the family’s ranch and historic feed store in Mart, Texas. Mr. Speaker, Murray’s life was de-fined by his service to those all around him. He worked tirelessly to better our community and families all across America. He will be forever remem-bered as a selfless servant, a husband, a father, a grandfather, and a friend to hundreds. My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to the Wat-son family. We also lift up the family and friends of Murray Watson, Jr., in our prayers. I have requested that a United States flag be flown over the Capitol to honor the life and legacy of Murray Watson, Jr. As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our country, for our military men and women, and for our first responders. HONORING SHERIFF DAVID GREENE  
Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Milam County Sheriff David Greene of Cameron, Texas, who passed away on July 20, 2018. Sheriff Greene was born in 1952 in Sherman, Texas, to Oscar and Mar-guerite Greene. In 1996, he married Janell Rene Morin. He had three sons and was blessed with three grandsons. Sheriff Greene dedicated his life to public service in Texas. He served as a game warden for the Texas Park and Wildlife Service for almost 30 years be-fore becoming a Milam County con-stable. In 2008, David was elected Milam County sheriff and was re-elected for two additional 4-year terms. Sheriff Greene went well beyond the call of duty in 2010 by establishing the Milam County Sheriff’s Office Brown Santa program to raise money to buy Christmas gifts for underprivileged children in Milam County. This year’s fundraiser was held just 8 days after Sheriff Greene’s passing and was the largest in the event’s history, a testa-ment to Sheriff Greene’s character and his impact on Milam County. Mr. Speaker, Sheriff Greene’s life was defined by his service to those around him. He worked tirelessly to better our community. He will be forever remem-bered as a selfless public servant, a husband, a father, a grandfather, and a friend. My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to the Greene family. We also lift up the fam-ily and friends of Sheriff David Greene in our prayers. I requested that a United States flag be flown over the Capitol to honor the life and legacy of Sheriff David Greene. As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our country, for our military men and women who protect us from external threats, and for our first responders who protect us here at home. 
HONORING OLIVE DELUCIA  
Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Olive DeLucia of Bryan, Texas, who passed away on August 12, 2018. Olive was born on June 16, 1924, in Audubon, New Jersey. As a young woman during World War II, she served in the United States Naval Reserve in the Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service, more commonly known as the WAVES program. In 1958, she moved with her husband and two sons to Bryan-College Station, Texas. Once in Texas, Olive made a ca-reer working for Texas A&M Univer-sity for 30 years. While working for The Association of Former Students, our alumni association, she served as the director of class programs and later oversaw the Traveling Aggies program, which gave her the ability to visit all seven continents. She was thanked for her service to the university with the President’s Distinguished Service Award and was named as a Fish Camp namesake. Even though she was only about 5 feet tall, she had immense wisdom. I remember the days that she would give me that look and tell me what I had done wrong or how to do things better, and I always paid attention to what Olive DeLucia told me to do. Mr. Speaker, Olive’s life was defined by her service to those around her. Her life enriched the lives of many. She will be forever remembered as a selfless servant, an Aggie, a mother, a grand-mother, and a dear friend. My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to the entire DeLucia family. We also lift up the family and friends of Olive DeLucia in our prayers. I have requested that a United States flag be flown over the Capitol to honor the life and legacy of Olive DeLucia. As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our country, for our military men and women who protect us overseas, and for our first responders who keep us safe at home. HONORING GEORGE BOYETT  
Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor George Boyett of Col-lege Station, Texas, who passed away on September 7, 2018. George was born in 1935 and was a na-tive of the Brazos Valley. He graduated from Stephen F. Austin High School in 1953 and attended Texas A&M Univer-sity. At Texas A&M, he was a member of the Corps of Cadets, the Ross Volun-teers, and the swim team. In 1957, he married his wife, Gaytha, at the Texas A&M All Faiths Chapel. Upon graduation in 1958, he served our country in the United States Army for 6 years before returning to College Station while continuing to serve in the Army Reserve. George was a successful businessman, forming local firms and companies be-fore he was elected as a Brazos County justice of the peace in 1988. His pre-cincts were redistricted and renum-bered many times throughout his ten-ure, but he most recently served as the justice of the peace in precinct 3, which included much of the Texas A&M cam-pus, before retiring in 2015. b1315 During his career as a judge, George taught at the National Judicial College and the Texas Department of Public Safety. He also served as a reserve sheriff’s deputy for the Burleson Coun-ty Sheriff’s Office and as an associate judge for the city of College Station. His dedication to public service went far beyond law enforcement and the ju-diciary system. George was a dedicated volunteer within the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints and the Boy Scouts of America. After becoming an Eagle Scout as a young man, George continued his in-volvement in the Boy Scouts, serving at the troop, district, and council lev-els. He was awarded the Silver Buffalo by the Sam Houston Area Council and the National Outstanding Eagle Scout Award for his work in Boy Scouts.

HONORING MARY FAY LUCAS ARNOLD  
Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mary Fay Lucas Arnold of Bryan, Texas, who passed away on November 29, 2017. Mary was born in east Texas on No-vember 17, 1920, to William and Cora Terrell. In 1943, in the midst of World War II, Mary decided to serve her Na-tion by joining the Women’s Army Corps. A few months later, she met William Everett ‘‘Bill’’ Lucas, and they married in January of 1944. After the war, Bill’s work took him, Mary, and their family to live in Haiti, Venezuela, and College Station, Texas. Upon retirement, Bill and Mary moved to Bryan, Texas. Bill passed away in 1972, and Mary later married T.H. ‘‘John’’ Arnold. Mary was active in serving the Bryan-College Station community. She was the assistant credit manager at Sears in Bryan and was one of the two oldest living members of the First Bap-tist Church in College Station. She was a member of the Order of the Eastern Star and belonged to the American Le-gion and the VFW Auxiliary. Mr. Speaker, Mary’s life was defined by her selfless service to those around her. She was loved by her community and, certainly, left an enduring legacy. She will be forever remembered as a veteran, community leader, wife, mother, grandmother, great-grand-mother, great-great-grandmother, and a dear friend. My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to the Lucas and Arnold families. We also lift up the family and friends of Mary Fay Lucas Arnold in our prayers. I have requested that a United States flag be flown over the Capitol to honor the life and legacy of Mary Arnold. As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our country, for our military men and women who serve us, and for our first responders who keep us safe at home. 
HONORING BOB BEAMON ’S 100TH BIRTHDAY  
Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor James Robert Beamon of Edge, Texas, who turned 100 years old on September 15, 2018. Mr. Beamon, who is known as Bob to his friends, was born in Eufala, Ala-bama. His family moved to Goliad, Texas, when he was 2 years old. In true Texas style, he would ride his horse to school with his younger brother. As a young man in the 1930s, he at-tended a house dance, where he met Annie Juanita Clifton. Annie and Bob were married on December 13, 1937, and were married for 74 years. At the outbreak of World War II, Bob was drafted into military service. Al-though he could have opted to defer, Bob went on to serve in the United States Navy as a gunner for the PB4Y– 2 Privateer patrol plane in the 106th Squadron, the Fighting Wolverines. Bob flew 17 missions for the Navy in the war’s Pacific theater before return-ing to the United States. After his service, he came home and raised five children with Annie, four sons and one daughter. He worked for more than 60 years in the painting business and eventually owned his own company. Now retired, Bob enjoys making Wahoo game boards for his family, vis-iting military museums, and, until re-cently, enjoyed hunting and fishing. Recently, Bob celebrated his 100th birthday with dozens of friends and several generations of his family. He recounted many stories from his mili-tary service days and played with his great-grandson, Rage, who turned 1 year old also on September 15. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize Bob on this joyous occasion, and I know that his family and friends love him and are proud of him. I wish him many more years of health and happi-ness. I have requested that a United States flag be flown over the United States Capitol to honor Bob Beamon’s 100th birthday. As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our country, for our military men and women who serve us, and for our first responders who keep us safe at home. HONORING AIR MED 12  
Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize CHI St. Joseph’s Hospital Air Med 12 team for their out-standing achievements in providing lifesaving services for residents of the Brazos Valley. In May of 2005, PHI Air Medical formed Air Med 12, the first air medical program to serve the Brazos Valley. Prior to this time, the only air medical support was available from Houston, with response times of more than an hour. For patients in the Brazos Valley, such wait times made air medical sup-port an unrealistic solution to their health emergencies. PHI partnered with St. Joseph’s Hospital, which was looking to expand services within their trauma center. Just a few months later, in August 2005, Air Med 12 would lead a group of four helicopters into New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. These would be the first civilian medical helicopters in the city after the storm passed. Subse-quent hurricane response teams have used Air Med 12’s leadership and exam-ple to improve medical care for storm survivors. Disaster response is not the only way Air Med 12 has revolutionized air med-ical support. In 2008, three members of the Air Med 12 team were tragically lost in an accident outside of Hunts-ville. Since that loss, the Air Med 12 team has become involved in improv-ing safety standards for all air medical support that include increased weather minimums, the use of night vision gog-gles on every flight, and national col-laboration amongst air medical pro-viders. Air Med 12 has shaped more than just air medical support in the Brazos Val-ley. Their group values development of clinical education and collaboration with the Texas A&M College of Medi-cine’s School of Rural Public Health and College of Nursing have brought a high standard of healthcare across cen-tral Texas and the Brazos Valley. The impact of Air Med 12 cannot be understated. In 2018 alone, they have transported 23 critical pediatric pa-tients to specialty hospitals, adminis-tered 27 units of blood to patients ei-ther directly at the scene or at rural hospitals, and, in August, completed a record number of 48 flights in one month. Mr. Speaker, I would like to honor Air Med 12 and CHI St. Joseph’s Hos-pital for the work they have done to provide the Brazos Valley with im-proved emergency medical care. I have requested that a United States flag be flown over the United States Capitol to honor Air Med 12. As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our country, for our military men and woman who serve us, and for our first responders who keep us safe at home. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. f 
D.C. STATEHOOD The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-uary 3, 2017, the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. N
ORTON ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the des-ignee of the minority leader. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, it is probably appropriate that you will be hearing on this last full day before the midterms about statehood for the Dis-trict of Columbia. I am going to speak about why that is the appropriate way for us to go into midterms, as I rep-resent 700,000 Americans who are num-ber one—please remember this num-ber—number one in taxes paid to sup-port the Federal Government, but also have the distinction of having no final vote on this House floor and having no representation in the Senate of the United States. It is very clear—if you want a history lesson, I am not going to offer that les-son in the time allotted to me this afternoon—but it is absolutely clear

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H9399 September 28, 2018 
that the Framers and the Founders of our country did not go to war with the slogan of ‘‘Taxation Without Represen-tation’’ in order to allow that slogan to apply everywhere but in their Nation’s Capital. For that reason, we want to thank the Democrats, almost the full caucus, who have already become cosponsors of the D.C. statehood bill. I hasten to add that I do not yet have my Republican friends. I believe that will occur. Meanwhile, Democrats have to plow ahead. I must thank my colleagues for the support they have given me, because we are very close to 100 percent here in the House on our DC statehood bill. I have to offer my thanks as well to Senator T
OMCARPER , because he is the lead sponsor in the Senate, and he has gotten more than 60 percent of the Democrats in the Senate to support D.C. statehood. If I could mention the last Democrat before we go home—and there will still be time before the end of this session for the few who remain off the bill—I do want to thank E
RICSWALWELL , be-cause he is the last one before we go home. I had sent out a message: Don’t go home without signing for D.C. state-hood. He heard that message. There will be a few stragglers. I men-tion stragglers because when I meet people who aren’t on the bill, they say: Oh, my goodness, I thought I was on the bill. So that doesn’t mean that because we don’t have 100 percent, we can’t get 100 percent. It just means Members overlook it and haven’t yet come onto the bill. So we will get to you before the end of the 115th Congress. I also want to explain, particularly since we don’t have Republican cospon-sors yet, that signing onto the bill is going to help the District of Columbia, in any case, because we are the first to concede, with no Republican sponsors yet, that D.C. statehood is an uphill climb. I am here today to say we are pre-pared to make that climb. I think we are showing that, as I so indicate. Getting cosponsors is going to help us in the next Congress. We are almost sure it is going to help us to get what the Congress can give us now, even without statehood, as more people awaken to the injustice of Americans who don’t have democratic representa-tion—a small ‘‘d’’—in their Congress. b1330 It is going to help us get incremen-tally to statehood. For example, the District’s local laws, even its final budget raised entirely in the District of Columbia, have to come here and be signed off by the Congress. That is an insult to us, frankly. Most Members aren’t interested, don’t know anything about DC’s local laws or budgets. A waste of time. That is the kind of thing that, even without statehood, I think we can get in the short run and getting more co-sponsors for statehood can only help us get that. I do want to mention what my col-leagues already know. There is not a poll, not a single poll, that does not show that Democrats will, in fact, be in the majority in the next Congress. That means, at the very least, the up-hill climb will begin, even if statehood is not around the corner. If ever there was an incentive for Dis-trict residents to keep going in the streets, going around the Congress to get statehood co-sponsors, this chart shows it. This chart illustrates what I have just said about the District of Co-lumbia’s paying the highest Federal taxes in the United States. If you live in California, to name a big State, if you live in New York—and I can go down the line—we do have a chart that shows where each State ranks. They are all beneath the Dis-trict of Columbia. What am I talking about? Almost $12,000 per resident in taxes paid by the people I represent to support the gov-ernment that does not give them full representation. I don’t have all the States listed here, but you can see how the line goes down until it gets to Mississippi, which has the lowest Federal taxes, whose citizens pay the lowest Federal taxes in the United States. Yet Mississippi has two Senators, I don’t remember how many Representatives, paying far lower taxes to support the Federal Government than the Americans I rep-resent, yet they have full representa-tion in the House and the Senate. So, some may say, well, you’ve got 700,000 residents. Is that a lot of peo-ple? It is more residents than two of the States. Vermont and Wyoming each has one Representative, just like D.C., except that Representative can vote on this floor, and two Senators. But Vermont and Wyoming are rep-resentative of about seven States in the United States that have about the same number of residents as the Dis-trict of Columbia. I picked these two out only because they rank below DC. We are equal in population or near equal in population to seven States. Perhaps it can be understood when you see that ranking, not to mention the ranking on per capita taxes, why we seek statehood for the District of Columbia. This is not the first time I have sought statehood. I did so when I first came to the Congress. In 1993, I got the first and only vote on statehood. Let me tell you the results of that vote and why it is important that that threshold has been laid. I was new to the House, and even the most fervent advocates for statehood did not predict that the vote would be 153 for statehood, 277 against. So I come, candidly, to tell you that we have gone on the floor for statehood before, and we didn’t get it. Indeed, only 40 percent of the Demo-crats supported us. How could that be when you say, Congresswoman NORTON , that you have almost all of the Demo-crats now on the bill? The difference, of course, is that it was a very different Congress. For 40 years, the Democrats had con-trol of the Congress, and that was in no small part because of Southern Demo-crats. By the way, Southern Democrats voted with the District on many, many bills. And in many ways, I would wel-come them back. But, of course, they were more conservative Democrats than the Democrats now in the House. Democrats fully recognize that when we get the majority—and I say ‘‘when’’ and not ‘‘if,’’ because I fully expect we will have the majority in the next Con-gress—that there will be some Demo-crats who are more conservative than I am and perhaps than the average Mem-ber of the House, and that is to be ex-pected, if you want to be in the major-ity. So I am not lamenting that we got only 40 percent in that first and only statehood vote. I am trying to make the case how votes come and why they come. We were very proud of that vote, because it was many more than had been predicted. There was dancing in the House galleries up there because the vote came far above what the press was predicting the District was going to get and what even the District and its residents were predicting. I hasten to add that, as I have al-ready shown, the District is already a State in all but name and representa-tion in this Congress. For example, when time comes for appropriation, un-like the territories—and I do want to distinguish us from the territories— they are our sisters in many ways, but Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and the rest don’t pay Federal income taxes, so note that difference. Some of them—in fact, almost none of them have come forward to request state-hood. There is now some interest in state-hood by Puerto Rico. But the reason that most of the territories don’t come forward and ask for statehood is very clear. There is a quid pro quo for them. In exchange for not paying Federal taxes, they don’t have the votes in Congress. We pay Federal taxes, and we have no vote in Congress, making us unique in the union. So, my friends, or at least virtually all my friends, in the territories don’t even ask for statehood. Sometimes they say, yes, we want statehood, but they understand that, for them, it is more difficult. It is certainly true that, this late in the history of the United States, one has to wonder why the word ‘‘terri-tory’’ is there and to hope for equality for the residents of the territories. That has to be up to them, so I don’t come here to speak for them. I only want for them to be treated equally with other Americans. When I say the District is already a State in ways that many count as

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH9400 September 28, 2018 
States, I even point to how the House does its appropriation. The District gets a per capita appropriation, in other words, based on our population. So if our population is 700,000, we will get the same as others who have that population. It is not true for the territories. Their basic complaint is that they do get Federal funding, but they don’t get the per capita funding that States get. There is a reason D.C. gets that per capita funding. It is because of tax funding we give to support our govern-ment. So the government has recognized the District’s contributions in some ways. It simply has not given us the representation that a democratic coun-try owes all its citizens. Some may believe that the reason the District does not have statehood is that it needs help from the Federal Government. Far from it. It is the Dis-trict that helps the Federal Govern-ment because of the strength of the city’s local economy. That local econ-omy outstrips in its strength many of the local economies of the States. For example, the District’s own local budget is more than $12 billion. That is larger than the budget of 12 States that already have full representation in this Congress. These days it is hard to find a sizable surplus in the States, but the District’s surplus is almost $200 billion. That is money that the District puts away in taxes and other revenue it gets, mostly from its own citizens. That would make it, just that surplus, the envy of the country. The District’s per capita income is higher than the per capita income of any State. This is not a poor city ask-ing for help from the Federal Govern-ment. This is a city that helps the Fed-eral Government with taxes paid with-out representation. That taxation without representa-tion is, of course, the largest grievance. But it is also true that Republicans, who fancy themselves the local control party in the Congress, try their very best here in the House and in the Sen-ate to take away what home rule or self-government that the District now has. The District, in 1974, after almost 100 years, got the right to elect its own Mayor and city council. The last time it had that right, Republicans were in charge right after the Civil War when the Republicans gave the District what we call home rule. It is Democrats who took away that local self-government. It is the Demo-crats, my party, who were in charge most of the years we were without local government, that took it away. Many of them were more conservative or Southern Democrats. But there is no escaping that they were Democrats, and they were often in control of this House. So, Republicans who come to this floor on both sides to argue even against Federal intervention even that is authorized by the Constitution and by Federal law. Isn’t it amazing that the party of local control would per-sistently interfere with the local con-trol that the District of Columbia has had since 1973, but that is what we see. I just want to cite not all but to give examples of some of this interference and to indicate why I think this inter-ference takes place, because it doesn’t take place as to the laws of the Dis-trict of Columbia. What this does mean is that the Congress uses the fact that the District does not have statehood to intrude itself to try to overturn some laws in the District of Columbia that they happen to disagree with. b1345 Now, the District of Columbia is a big city. Like most big cities, even within the States, it is more progres-sive than other parts of our country. So, although they have nothing to gain, Republicans try to make political points back home by intruding and try-ing to take away laws passed by the D.C. Council. I want to give examples of some of those laws and even to indi-cate some of the Members who helped me get rid of the attempts to overturn our laws. For example, our laws that have le-galized recreational marijuana, that makes D.C. one of nine jurisdictions. Now, that is controversial, but the Congress has done nothing about those States that have departed from Federal law and legalized marijuana. The Re-publican Congress has done nothing about it. But each and every Congress, the Congress keeps the District of Colum-bia from commercializing marijuana. I say ‘‘commercializing’’ because those States are now taxing marijuana. Mari-juana is consumed everywhere in the United States. Nobody gets arrested for it anymore. So these States have simply said, ‘‘What is pro forma law shall be law, and we will tax marijuana.’’ Well, the District of Columbia passed a law to le-galize marijuana, and Republicans made an attempt to undermine that law, simply erase it. They were not very smart in the way they did it, and, thus, 2 ounces of marijuana is still legal to possess in the District of Co-lumbia. And it is interesting that, as mari-juana laws have become more wide-spread in the United States, Repub-licans have not come back and at-tempted, yet again, to overturn our marijuana law. The reason that the District was ada-mant about our marijuana law is the enormous disparities between who got arrested for marijuana offenses, which are misdemeanors but give you a record. They turned out to be largely African Americans. So we did not have the usual recreational marijuana rea-son for wanting to legalize marijuana. We had an additional reason of great importance to our city. Republicans failed to overturn the law, but they left us without the abil-ity to commercialize marijuana, and look what that has done. That means that as The Washington Post re-ported—and we call them ‘‘riders.’’ ‘‘This amendment is a ‘‘license,’’ quoting a drug dealer, for me to print money.’’ Some call it the ‘‘Drug Dealer Protection Act’’ because, with no abil-ity to commercialize marijuana, the drug dealers have not gone out of busi-ness here as they have in the States that have legalized and commercialized marijuana. I want to name just a few other ex-amples. We have a bill. Only one State—and two other localities have similar bills. It is called the ‘‘Repro-ductive Health Nondiscrimination Act.’’ It says that you can’t discrimi-nate against one of your own employ-ees or families based on the reproduc-tive health decisions they make. The Republicans are deep into the business of individuals by looking at such matters. For example, firing or declining to hire a woman for having had an abortion, even if it was due to rape—and maybe that is why they knew about it in the first place because I don’t understand how you could even know about such private business—or declining to hire a woman for using in vitro fertilization. Now, the reason that you have the District of Columbia and two other cit-ies with similar laws is there have been some matters brought to the attention of their local legislature. This is an amendment, unlike the marijuana commercialization law, that I have been able to get removed, but it is an example of one that continues to come back. One of the most troubling is the Dis-trict’s abortion law. Mr. Speaker, 17 States use their own local funds on abortion for poor women. Federal funds for abortions have long been barred by the Congress, so these 17 States spend their own funds, except for the District of Columbia, which to this day cannot do so. There is a local nonprofit organi-zation which helps women because of this amendment, but you can see what I mean about intruding in the most pri-vate of affairs. I am not asking people to support the choices made by the District of Colum-bia. I am certainly not asking the Con-gress to do that. I am asking Congress to get out of our lives, to give us equal-ity by our own citizens in choosing our laws, however controversial. Another example that is controver-sial—and I point this out because our laws sometimes are controversial and because other States have passed simi-larly controversial laws. It is called, ‘‘D.C.’s Death with Dignity Act.’’ The Congress has tried to bar, unsuc-cessfully, the District law that is law in six other States that allows self-ad-ministered lethal medication for people who have 6 months to live and who doc-tors have said are in such terrible pain or misery that these people, not the doctors, should be allowed to give themselves a lethal medication.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H9401 September 28, 2018 
Talking about a private matter. I don’t know where most Americans stand on this. I am told that most ap-prove it, by the way. But I know where the people I represent stand, and I know it is up to them and only them, and it offers another reason why we fight for statehood. Look, I have been able to keep this attempt to take away our law, our D.C. Death with Dignity Law from, in fact, becoming law. But it does give you an indication of the kind of continual fight that has to be made here for the District of Columbia, and this is in ad-dition for all the work that I, like other Members, have to do on the na-tional bills, the bills that are legiti-mately introduced in this House. I suppose at least one more ought to be mentioned. How could I not? That is, the District has a local budget au-tonomy law. Republicans tried to abol-ish it. It gives the District the ability to have its local law go into effect without coming here to the Congress where they do nothing about it except try to use it as a bill allowing them to attach what we call ‘‘riders.’’ If you want to do an amendment, there has to be a bill. So they want our budget over here so that they can do amendments like the one I just dis-cussed on marijuana. Well, we want to get rid of that by giving the District budget autonomy so that its local laws will not have to come here in the first place. The Congress has tried to overturn the budget autonomy law and has been unsuccessful. The District went to court. The court said our local budget autonomy law was, in fact, constitu-tional and legal. Although the Con-gress has not overturned it—and we are grateful for that—the Congress does pass a law saying the District’s local budget is now law anyway. So you see how redundant that is? They don’t do anything about it, but they pass a provision and say, ‘‘We made it law. DC says it is already law.’’ But, you see, until we get to the point where they don’t have anything to say about our local budget, we will not be the equal of the States. What makes all of this interference particularly painful to the District of Columbia is how the District is viewed by those who have no axe to grind, and the best examples of those would be the rating agencies. For example, Moody’s has given the District a AAA rating. I would like to quote what Moody’s says about the District of Columbia and its economy and how its government is run. ‘‘The dynamism of the District’s economy has led to the largest popu-lation in 40 years and strong growth in the tax base. Financial governance’’—I repeat the words—‘‘Financial govern-ance is exemplary. Reserves are ro-bust.’’ Talking about people who have noth-ing to gain except seeing it as the data reports it. That was Moody’s speaking about how the District’s financial gov-ernance rates. Let me quote Standard & Poor’s. Here is what Standard & Poor’s has to say. This is very important because it is a critique, in effect, of this Congress. By the way, they have given DC a AAA rating. ‘‘We continue to have concerns about the role of the Federal Government in future District budgets. We view this as an ongoing factor that has a nega-tive effect on the District’s finances and as a slight offset to the District’s otherwise very strong management practices.’’ In effect, what Standard & Poor’s is saying is it costs the District money— money in how the District pays—and I use that word advisedly—the District pays in dollars and cents because of congressional interference. And how the Congress interferes affects how in-vestors view the District’s economy. b1400 It is a price to be paid, literally, in dollars and cents by the residents of the District of Columbia. Now, I do not want to be misunder-stood. I do not stand here and say, if you don’t give us statehood, there is nothing we can do. But I do want to il-lustrate what we have to do. Yes, we have been successful sometimes in being treated equally with the States. For example, just look at last year. We had to defeat 15 attempts to over-turn the District’s local laws. There were three attempts that we had to de-feat to eliminate the District’s gun safety laws. This is the District of Co-lumbia, where there are Members of the House and Senate, like Senator M
ARCO RUBIO, who continues to put in a bill that would eliminate every single gun law in the District of Columbia. Imagine what that would mean in the Nation’s Capital here, where some of the most controversial figures in the country and the world are seen on our streets, in our restaurants, and public places, if anybody can come in with a gun. Well, we have tight gun laws in this town. I have had to fight very hard, and, yes, we have succeeded even with-out statehood. That is no argument against statehood. That reinforces the notion that we need statehood because those things should not have happened, should not have taken my time on the floor or the time of residents to come here to say, please, don’t do this to us. There is another favorite of the Re-publicans: to put private school vouch-ers on the District of Columbia. Let me indicate why that is particularly out-rageous. The District of Columbia does, in fact, have its public school system, and it has an almost equal number of students in what are called charter schools, which are not a part of the D.C. public schools. DC has done that on their own. When the education bill comes before the Congress, and a national charter school bill is, in fact, on the floor, some Members of Congress vote against charter schools while others favor them, except there are Members who don’t have charter schools. We have charter schools. We have im-proved our public schools as well, but they are our public schools. They are paid for by our tax dollars. However, there is always an edu-cation bill that has private school vouchers in it that we very much op-pose private school vouchers because the jurisdiction has no control on how well the children are even doing in those schools. We do have that kind of control over how well children are doing in charter schools and in public schools. But if they go to any private schools—and some of these private schools are fly-by-night schools, but even those that are not are private and, therefore, not subject to regula-tion and oversight. So, when vouchers are a part of the education bill that comes before us every few years, vouchers for schools in the United States, that bill is voted down every time. So that makes the District of Columbia the only jurisdic-tion that does have private school vouchers; and we do have school vouch-ers, but they are for a very small num-ber of students because most students choose our charter schools and our public schools. As I speak, I hope I will be successful. I believe I will be successful again in getting D.C. tuition access grants. Now, DC is unusual because the Dis-trict does not have a university sys-tem. It simply has one public univer-sity. I have been able to get tuition as-sistance grants so that our youngsters go to universities and colleges in every State, all 50 States. And it is inter-esting, I do have a lot of support for this bill because there is not a Member that doesn’t have D.C. students going to college in their States. The Federal Government pays for the difference between what the student pays and the higher cost that would otherwise be charged as out-of-state tuition, DC students pay the same in- state tuition, and that has been a help. And it is help from the Federal Govern-ment, and it is supported by many Members in this Congress who know that their own public universities have benefited from it. I don’t maintain that we don’t get anything from the Federal Govern-ment. I have already indicated that we get the same per capita as the states, and I don’t indicate that if I don’t have statehood I can’t get any bills passed. People will come to the District of Co-lumbia today and they will find, on both waterfronts, the Southeast water-front, the Southwest waterfront—the Southeast waterfront is called Capital Riverfront; the Southwest waterfront, The Wharf. There are, essentially, whole new neighborhoods on those wa-terfronts. And, yes, I got those without statehood. But I dare Republicans to say, well, since you can get things like that for your District without statehood, what are you crying about? I am crying

about taxes without representation is what I am crying about. Yes, I know we can get funds, for ex-ample, for things my legislation for the Arlington Memorial Bridge, which brings people from the south to the Na-tion’s Capital. Yes, I am grateful that, even in a Re-publican Congress, I have been able to get the Wharf bill passed. I have been able to get the Southeast waterfront bill, or Capital Riverfront as it is called, passed, that we got money for the Arlington Memorial Bridge. And I bring those up because I don’t want to hear, well, if you are able to get things done, what is your problem? My problem is what I have been dis-cussing here. It is undoing what our city has done, undemocratically, and it is failure to give us the same represen-tation in the Congress of the United States as every other taxpaying Amer-ican. Yes, sometimes I have to do the very unusual. There is a tax bill, for exam-ple, that just went through here. It is interesting to note it is not very pop-ular with the American people, and I certainly was against it. I couldn’t vote for it or against it. But if there is a bill going through here and I can find a way to get my District in it, I am going to try and get in it. So there are parts of this bill that promote incentives and investment in some of our low-income parts of the city, that promote private and afford-able housing in the District of Colum-bia, so I am in the tax bill. But I opposed the tax bill. In that way, I am like many other Democrats who voted ‘‘no’’ on this floor but, yet, tried to get in the bill and did get in the bill. That is how the Congress works. Finally, nothing makes the case for D.C. statehood better than this chart showing the District war casualties in the 20th century when we fought our major wars: in World War I, more cas-ualties than three States. Korean War, by that time it had gone up to more casualties than 8 States. By World War II, we were seeing more casualties than four States. Remember, the District is smaller than most States. And the Vietnam War, perhaps the very worst, more casualties than 10 States. Since then, we have eliminated the draft, but this chart and these tomb-stones make the best case for equal treatment for the residents of the Dis-trict of Columbia. Even as I speak, the residents of this city have volunteered and serve in a volunteer army. These statistics illustrate the United States when we had a draft. So we don’t have a draft now, and, yet, Dis-trict residents are found in every part of the country—forgive me—every part of the world where our troops are. It is time that our country recog-nized our city and its residents and, particularly, those who now serve, those who served before them, and those who have died in service of their country. We are now in the 21st century. It seems impossible we have gotten here: 217 years since the District of Columbia has been the Nation’s Capital; 217 years of inequality in your own country; 217 years of paying taxes without represen-tation; 217 years of going to war with-out benefit of equal treatment even by those who served. This is why, for those reasons, the residents, the American citizens I rep-resent, cannot possibly give up on seeking equal treatment: first, by per-fecting what is called home rule, or self-government; but certainly, by be-coming a State like every other State, by no longer being treated, as Fred-erick Douglass said, as aliens, not citi-zens, but subjects. We are Americans. That is why we insist that the American citizens in the District of Columbia become citizens of the 51st State of the United States of America. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

PRAYER The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-fered the following prayer: Let us pray. Infinite Spirit, Creator of Heaven and Earth, the sea, and all that lives in it, thank You for the gift of another day. We praise You that You are the same yesterday, today, and forever. Remind us of the foolishness of seeking secu-rity apart from You. Bless our lawmakers. Protect them in their work as You give them Your peace. Be for them a light in the dark-ness and a shelter from life’s storms. Lord, give them the wisdom to make decisions that will bring glory and honor to Your Name. We pray in Your great Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The Presiding Officer led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
APPOINTMENT OF ACTING PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will please read a communication to the Senate from the President pro tempore (Mr. H
ATCH ). The senior assistant legislative clerk read the following letter: 
U.S. S ENATE , P
RESIDENT PRO TEMPORE , Washington, DC, September 28, 2018. To the Senate: Under the provisions of rule I, paragraph 3, of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby appoint the Honorable J

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. Without objection, it is so or-dered. 
f 
NOMINATION OF BRETT KAVANAUGH Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, like millions of people across the country, I watched the hearing yesterday with a mix of so many strong emotions. First, I watched Dr. Ford with tears in my eyes. She was so brave, so com-pelling, so real. The memories that she recounted—the memories that she will never forget—were heartbreaking: the living room, the stairs, the bedroom, the music turned up loud, the bed, Brett Kavanaugh drunk and on top of her, the feeling she had when he cov-ered her mouth to stop her from screaming, the raucous laughter be-tween Brett Kavanaugh and Mark Judge. She remembered the way she felt it then and told it now: two boys laugh-ing and having a good time while a scared 15-year-old girl lay pinned down on a bed, worried that she may die; the bathroom, listening for Brett and Mark to leave, hearing them bounce off the walls as they went back downstairs; leaving the house; the sense of relief that she escaped; and something any-one who has been a 15-year-old girl can understand, not wanting to tell her parents that she had been at a house with no adults, older boys, and beer. It was gutting. Dr. Ford spoke for herself, but she was channeling the voice of millions of women and survivors across the coun-try who are too often ignored, inter-rupted, bullied, or swept aside. She was an inspiration, and I hope every one of my colleagues watched her speak and answer questions. She made it clear she was not there because she wanted to be but because she felt she had to be. She shared her story not be-cause she wanted to create a spectacle or embarrass anyone but because she felt it was her civic duty to share what she knew about Judge Kavanaugh with the people making the decision about whether or not he should be on our Na-tion’s highest Court. The Republicans on that committee were too afraid to ask her anything themselves, but she did an amazing job keeping her composure under cross-ex-amination by the prosecutor Repub-licans hired to question Dr. Ford on their behalf, and Dr. Ford made it clear over and over, politely but firmly, that she welcomed an investigation. She opened up herself to questions and scrutiny. She took a polygraph. She remembered some details that further investigation could help expand

on, like seeing Mark Judge at the su-permarket a few weeks later, and she seemed not to be able to understand why nobody was digging into these de-tails that could help uncover even more. She said she came to be helpful. She wants to be more helpful. She did her job as a U.S. citizen, and she was sim-ply asking for Senators to do theirs. Then, I watched Judge Kavanaugh, and, frankly, I was appalled and dis-mayed by the rage on his face; the sense of entitlement he displayed; re-fusing to answer questions, sneering at Senators while he demanded they an-swer his questions; the outrage that he was even being questioned about an issue like this after all he has done for his country; not an ounce of contrition; not a modicum of shame; the attempts over and over to turn this away from the substance, the allegations from women against him, and the facts that could shine a light on them, and to-ward attacks on the process and a po-litical party; the continued falsehoods and evasions and things he said that just are not credible, from his claims that he never got blackout drunk and had memory lapses during a night of drinking, despite everything we have heard from people who know him and everything we have heard from him and about him in the past about his younger days, to his claim that he and Dr. Ford didn’t ‘‘travel in the same so-cial circles,’’ when we know that is just not true—he has said before that he was good friends with Holton-Arms girls, and we know Dr. Ford dated a good friend of Judge Kavanaugh, who introduced the two of them—to his ab-solutely false claims that the com-mittee had already received all the evi-dence it needs, which as a judge, he knows is simply not the case, and on and on. But the most striking thing to me was this—and this is something I hope every Senator pays close attention to because I know it is what people across the country saw vividly and repeat-edly—and that is the fact that Judge Kavanaugh so clearly does not want an investigation. He does not want the facts to come out. He doesn’t want other witnesses to be brought in who, if he is telling the truth, could corrobo-rate his story and help clear his name. He certainly doesn’t want anyone to hear from the other two women who have come forward with their experi-ences regarding him and sexual assault and who are willing to come and testify under oath. He wants to rush through this as quickly as he can with as little infor-mation as possible coming out. Is that how someone acts if they truly have nothing to hide? Is this how someone behaves if they truly want to clear their good name? Is this what someone truly innocent of everything he is being accused of would do? I want to close by setting aside what I thought of the hearing yesterday for just a minute. I believe Dr. Ford. I thought she was telling the truth. But I want to set that aside to make one more point because maybe some of my colleagues watched that hearing yes-terday and didn’t see it the same way I did. Maybe they saw that hearing and thought Dr. Ford was credible, and they also thought Judge Kavanaugh was credible. Maybe they thought: This is a he said, she said, and I just don’t know whom or what to believe. Here is my message to those col-leagues of mine. Yesterday’s hearing does not have to be the final word. There is absolutely no rush—none, zero. We have an opportunity to take a breath and slow down and let this proc-ess work the way it is supposed to. The 11 Republicans on the Judiciary Committee may have scrambled to rush this through their phase, but we do not have to follow suit here in the Senate. We can have the FBI investiga-tion. We can continue our own inves-tigations. We can bring in additional, relevant witnesses in the most appro-priate ways or hold additional hear-ings. I know we all want this to be over. Trust me, I wish we didn’t have to go through this, but we simply cannot allow a Supreme Court Justice to be jammed through like this right now. It would be a disgrace. It would damage the integrity of the Supreme Court, and it would shred whatever integrity we have left here in the Senate. So I say to those colleagues: Even if you hate how this process has gone so far, even if you wish this had been done differently and that the information had come out about these allegations sooner, even if you think this was bun-gled completely, even if you want to point fingers and blame Democrats for that—fine, but we are right here, right now. We are facing one of our most im-portant jobs as Senators, laid out in ar-ticle II, section 2 of our Constitution, to provide advice and consent on Su-preme Court nominations. We can litigate how this went later. I am sure there are ways it could have gone better. We can figure that out. We should figure that out so we can do bet-ter next time, but we should not—we cannot—let anger and pique over proc-ess and politics cloud what is clearly the right thing to do here. I hear there are conversations going on in the Judiciary Committee right now about slowing down and starting investigations. I am hopeful that those end up leading us to being able to do our jobs. No one should want those al-legations hanging out there or should want the investigations to happen and information to come out while he is on the Court. Let’s slow down. Let’s learn more. Let’s not put a man on the Supreme Court with these allegations swirling around him while we still have the op-portunity to clear this up and get it right. Finally, I want to say one more thing right now to women and survivors who are angry, who are dispirited, who have reached out to me and told me they are shocked; they are crying; they are in disbelief. To them, I say we all have a right to these tears, but we all have a duty not to give up. I am not giving up. I am not going to give up this fight of making sure that women who bravely come forward are not ignored, swept under the rug, or silenced by powerful men. I know that I stand with millions and millions of women and men across the country who are watching the U.S. Senate very closely right now and that they are not going to give up either. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. E

NOMINATION OF BRETT KAVANAUGH Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, these are the remarks I would have given at this morning’s Judiciary Com-mittee markup after the perfunctory and dismissive way the chairman treat-ed the minority members of the Judici-ary Committee. I walked out in pro-test. Here are the remarks I would have given at the committee markup. I am in disbelief that we are here today voting on Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court. Out-rageous does not begin to describe the present circumstances. Yesterday we heard from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who spoke with genuine and raw emo-tional power about being sexually as-saulted by Brett Kavanaugh. Even though it was more than 30 years ago, her memory of the assault was clear and vivid. This kind of recall is typical of sexual assault survivors. She was sincere and authentic. She was 100 per-cent credible, and I believe her. By contrast, Brett Kavanaugh came to this committee and refused to give us straight answers. He would not call for an FBI investigation. He repeatedly stated that the other people who were at the gathering where Dr. Ford was attacked had ‘‘rebutted her testi-mony.’’ That is not true. His alleged accomplice in the attack, Mark Judge, claimed he didn’t remember—a far cry from rebutting her statement. He claimed he didn’t remember, refused to testify, and then went into hiding. Pat-rick Smyth and Leland Keyser said they simply don’t remember—again, hardly a rebuttal. Dr. Ford said yesterday: 
I don’t expect that P.J. and Leland would remember this evening. It was a very unremarkable party. It was not one of their more notorious parties, because nothing re-markable happened to them that evening. 
In fact, even though she doesn’t re-member, Leland Keyser said she be-lieves Dr. Ford’s account.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6369 September 28, 2018 
In addition to making misleading statements—which is a pattern with Judge Kavanaugh—he accused Demo-cratic Senators of coordinating a plot to sabotage his nomination. Clearly, he was speaking to an audience of one: President Trump. A nominee for the Supreme Court so rattled that he would buy into a vast conspiracy the-ory is astounding and dangerous. Let’s not forget his exact words. Judge Kavanaugh said: 
This whole two-week effort has been a cal-culated and orchestrated political hit fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election, fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record, revenge on behalf of the Clintons, and millions of dollars in money from out-side left-wing opposition groups. 
With that nakedly political screed, Brett Kavanaugh showed us who he really is: a partisan political operative with an agenda—the very worry that kept him from confirmation to the DC Circuit for 3 years. His own words rein-forced a concern that I and many of us here have that he cannot be a fair and impartial judge. Setting aside the unvarnished polit-ical view—from a potential Supreme Court Justice, no less—the crux of the matter before us today is whether Dr. Ford was credible when she said that she is 100 percent sure that Brett Kavanaugh is the person who sexually assaulted her. On that issue, Brett Kavanaugh admitted, even without watching her testimony, that Dr. Ford did not play a part and was not part of any imagined partisan plot. So what we are left with is his own recognition that Dr. Ford has no political motive and no reason to lie. I challenge any-one who watched her testimony to claim that she did not tell us the truth. Dr. Ford wasn’t the only woman to come forward with an account of sex-ual misconduct against the nominee. Two other women have provided cred-ible accounts that deserve real inves-tigation. But whether it is one woman or three women, my Republican col-leagues are letting nothing stop them from plowing through to get Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court as soon as possible. Even before the com-mittee had a chance to hear from Dr. Ford, Chairman G
RASSLEY had already scheduled today’s vote. By voting to support this nominee, Republican colleagues are sending a message loud and clear: Sexual assault survivors should not come forward be-cause we are not going to listen to you. They will not be believed, and their lives will be up-ended in the process. That is exactly what happened to Dr. Ford. As far as I am concerned, there was never a serious effort by the committee to get to the truth. Today’s vote sig-nals to the men and boys in America that you can demean and assault women—especially if you are in a posi-tion of power and influence. There will be no consequences. It won’t even pre-vent you from becoming a Supreme Court Justice. Yesterday, accusations flew from the other side of the aisle about deliberate efforts to make up accusations and un-dermine Judge Kavanaugh’s nomina-tion, but Democrats didn’t need to manufacture additional reasons to op-pose Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination. As I have maintained before, his record demonstrates a pattern of misstating the facts. He wasn’t candid yesterday. He wasn’t candid in his testimony to the committee when he testified at his 2004 and 2006 confirmation hearings or when he testified at his confirmation hearing for this nomination in 2018. I also found his candor lacking in the judicial opinions and legal arguments he authored. For example, as my col-leagues have talked about in the past, Judge Kavanaugh was not honest with the committee in 2004 and 2006 when asked about matters that he worked on, and his emails from the White House show that he was not honest about his awareness of receiving stolen documents from Manny Miranda. In a case I am familiar with—Rice v. Cayetano—he demonstrated what could only be called a deliberate misstatement of the facts that he pre-sented to the U.S. Supreme Court. He had to have known that what he wrote about the politics and culture of Native Hawaiians was not true. He filed an amicus brief in that case, and at his hearing a few weeks ago, Judge Kavanaugh misstated the holdings of Rice and refused to correct his misstatement when I gave him a chance to clarify. I will say that I am one of the few people in the Senate who attended the oral argument in Rice. I know what the Supreme Court based its decision on, and he totally misstated the Supreme Court’s decision. Advocates for our Native commu-nities are stepping up and taking no-tice. The Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement and the Alaska Federa-tion of Natives issued statements that strongly urge the Senate to reject the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh. They and other groups representing indige-nous peoples have come forward to ex-plain how Judge Kavanaugh’s views of the rights of indigenous peoples are deeply flawed. These are the kinds of attitudes that he expressed in his ami-cus brief in Rice v. Cayetano. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the following statements in opposition of Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination or that criticize his views of indigenous people be printed in the R

LOHA CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY AND RANKING  M
EMBER FEINSTEIN : Having reviewed his writings and his statements in public pro-ceedings, we find that Judge Kavanaugh ne-glected to recognize the history of actions by the United States government that has clearly established a trust responsibility not only on the part of the United States, but also the State of Hawaii for the lands that were set aside under Federal law in 1921 to provide for a permanent homeland for native Hawaiians (Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920) and for the betterment of the condi-tions of native Hawaiians (Hawaii Admis-sions Act of 1959). The Hawaiian Homes Commission Act set aside approximately 203,500 acres of land in what was then a Territory of the United States, the Territory of Hawaii, to assure that the indigenous, native people of Hawaii could be returned to their lands. In the ensuing years, in the exercise of its constitutional authority, the U.S. Congress enacted more than 160 Federal laws designed to address the conditions of native Hawai-ians. Additionally, upon its admission into the Union of States in 1959, the United States and the State of Hawaii agreed that the provisions of the Constitution of the State of Hawaii should reflect their respec-tive responsibilities, including trust respon-sibilities, for the lands and resources des-ignated to provide for the betterment of the conditions of native Hawaiians. The lands and resources authorized under Federal law to be reserved for native Hawai-ians in 1921 are today administered by the Hawaiian Homes Commission and the De-partment of Hawaiian Home Lands. Our fiduciary duties and responsibilities to the beneficiaries of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act are of paramount impor-tance to existing and future generations of the indigenous, native people of Hawaii, to the State of Hawaii, and to the United States. We cannot embrace nor endorse the views of those, like Judge Kavanaugh, who would deny our history, the Federal and State laws which have been enacted on the foundation of that history, including the right of the in-digenous, native people of Hawaii to exercise self-determination under Federal law and policy.

EMBER FEINSTEIN : The Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) greatly appreciates this oppor-tunity to provide comments regarding the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to be an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. In particular, given that Su-preme Court precedent pertaining to OHA has become the subject of questions during Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination hearing, our agency is compelled to clarify the record as it pertains to our organization, our work to better the conditions of Native Hawaiians, and the rights and status of our beneficiaries as Indigenous people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6370 September 28, 2018 
least a thousand years prior to recorded con-tact with the Western world. Congress has acknowledged that ‘‘. . . . prior to the ar-rival of the first Europeans in 1778, the Na-tive Hawaiian people lived in a highly orga-nized, self-sufficient, subsistent social sys-tem based on communal land tenure with a sophisticated language, culture, and reli-gion.’’ The Native Hawaiian people estab-lished and maintained the Kingdom of Hawai‘i, first as a united monarchical gov-ernment, and later as a constitutional mon-archy, at all times under the leadership of a Native Hawaiian head of state. Judge Kavanaugh’s description of the Rice decision may have left some Committee Members and observers with another impres-sion. Senator Hirono asked the nominee about an amicus brief he submitted in Rice, as well as an op-ed he wrote for The Wall Street Journal, in which he argued that OHA’s very purpose was inconsistent with the principles and language of the U.S. Con-stitution. When asked to explain these views, Judge Kavanaugh stated that by a vote of 7– 2, the majority of the U.S. Supreme Court had agreed with him, and that the Court found violations of both the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. This is erroneous. As stated earlier, the majority’s decision was limited to the manner in which OHA’s trustees were elected under the Fifteenth Amendment. To quote U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Roberts, then an attorney rep-resenting the State of Hawai‘i in the Rice case, ‘‘. . . the majority’s opinion was very narrowly written and expressly did not call into question the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, the public trust for the benefit of Hawaiians and native Hawaiians, but only the par-ticular voting mechanism by which the trustees are selected.’’ In limiting its hold-ing to OHA’s means of electing trustees, the majority chose not to adopt arguments and conclusions made by then-practicing attor-ney Brett Kavanaugh, with respect to OHA’s purpose and mission. The extreme nature of Judge Kavanaugh’s arguments, both his examples and his con-clusions, may have played a role in the ma-jority’s failure to incorporate them in Rice. For example, he compared OHA’s mission of serving Hawaii’s Indigenous people to an interracial marriage ban to maintain white supremacy. He argued that allowing Native Hawaiians to elect their own trustees to manage their trust ‘‘. . . could usher in an extraordinary racial patronage and spoils system’’ of national consequence. Little ex-planation is given as to why treatment of the Indigenous people of Hawai‘i in a manner similar to the treatment of other Indigenous people in the United States would have such dramatic consequences. At the time of his writing, Judge Kavanaugh may not have been familiar with Congress’s clear legisla-tive understanding that its relationship with Native Hawaiians is based on its recognition of Native Hawaiians as an Indigenous people and not based on race. Through the process of the Committee’s re-view of a portion of Judge Kavanaugh’s writings during his time with the Bush Ad-ministration, we learned that he continued to hold and advance extreme views against Native Hawaiian rights after Rice. Dis-regarding the Court’s decision not to adopt his arguments against the constitutionality of Native Hawaiian programs, Judge Kavanaugh offered the same arguments as legal advice when reviewing administration testimony on legislation. Given his reported acknowledgement of his lack of exposure to Indigenous people’s law, it is concerning that he has held so tightly to arguments hostile to Native Hawaiians. His past actions and the recent nomination hearing leave OHA with many doubts. We sincerely hope that if a case concerning Na-tive Hawaiian rights comes before Judge Kavanaugh’s court, be it the D.C. Circuit or the U.S. Supreme Court, he will look more closely at the facts before the court. Facts that include the actions that Congress, the Executive, and the State of Hawai‘i have all taken, within the framework of the U.S. Constitution, in recognizing the unique sta-tus of Native Hawaiians. During his hearing, Judge Kavanaugh acknowledged Congress’s ‘‘substantial’’ authority to deal with matters concerning Native people, though he offered few specifics beyond that statement. Judge Kavanaugh may find it interesting that in the years following Rice, Congress and the Executive have continued to pass legislation and establish programs to benefit Native Ha-waiians, regularly with the acknowledge-ment of the legal and political relationship OHA has articulated throughout this letter. In closing, OHA hopes that this letter has brought some clarity to questions raised as part of the process of considering Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination. OHA hopes that the Committee understands the need we feel to clarify the record about Rice, and to ad-dress certain arguments espoused by Judge Kavanaugh prior to his taking the bench, which are not only inaccurate, but threaten the rights and resources of the beneficiaries that OHA exists to serve. Until and unless Judge Kavanaugh is able to correct the aforementioned misunderstandings and mis-conceptions, should a case involving the rights or political status of Native Hawai-ians come before him, perhaps a recusal would be in order. Finally, OHA wishes to bring to the Committee’s attention concerns voiced by American Indian and Alaska Na-tive groups, who share our concerns with Judge Kavanaugh’s record on Native law. Sincerely, C
OLETTE Y. M ACHADO , OHA Board of Trustees Chair. 
[From the Alaska Federation of Natives] AFN O
PPOSES KAVANAUGH APPOINTMENT  The Alaska Federation of Natives is the oldest and largest Native organization in Alaska. Our membership includes 186 feder-ally recognized Indian tribes, 177 for-profit village corporations, 12 for-profit regional corporations, 12 not-for-profit regional orga-nizations, and a number of tribal consortia that compact and contract to run federal and state programs. For over 50 years, AFN has been the principal forum and voice for Alas-ka Natives in addressing critical issues of law and policy, including the nomination of U S. Supreme Court justices. The federal judicial appointment and con-firmation process is designed to thoroughly vet nominees. As such, we did not imme-diately weigh in on President Trump’s choice to replace retiring Justice Anthony Ken-nedy. However, the questions and colloquies that came out of Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s Senate Judiciary hearings last week has ne-cessitated us taking a position. AFN joins our colleagues and friends across Indian country in strongly opposing Judge Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court because of, among other things, his views on the rights of Native peoples. Judge Kavanaugh’s Position on the Indian Commerce Clause is Erroneous. Congress’ plenary power over Indian affairs is grounded in the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Con-stitution. The clause gives the Congress the power to ‘‘regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes.’’ Judge Kavanaugh concedes this point. However, like Justice Clarence Thomas—the most senior justice on the Supreme Court, he challenges the clause’s application to affairs beyond trade. This impacts Alaska Native tribes, corpora-tions, organizations and consortia because their dealings with Congress presently ex-tends to a host of federal programs con-cerning their members, resources and gov-ernments. In the 2013 Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl decision, Justice Thomas contested Con-gress’ authority to enact the Indian Child Welfare Act, reasoning the Indian Commerce Clause only provides federal authority over Indian trade. Because most federal laws con-cerning Indians lack a nexus to Justice Thomas’s narrow definition of trade, they would unlikely survive the scrutiny he urges. The result would be a wholesale re-shaping of the body of law and policy that has governed Indian affairs for the past cen-tury and a half. Legal observers tracking Judge Kavanaugh believe he is further to the right than Chief Justice John Roberts. Thus, he may agree with Justice Thomas that Congress only has plenary power to regulate direct commerce with Indian tribes, nothing more. Confirming a nominee with this viewpoint would be dis-astrous for Alaska, and would roll back the gains of self-determination and usher back in the losses of termination. Judge Kavanaugh’s View of the Special Trust Responsibility is Misguided. The fed-eral government has a special trust relation-ship with federally recognized Indian tribes. The relationship commands the highest moral and legal obligations, and is rooted in early federal-tribal treaties, the U.S. Con-stitution, federal statutes, and opinions of the U.S. Supreme Court. Judge Kavanaugh’s writings demonstrate a limited view of the federal government’s power to deal with Na-tive peoples under this relationship. Specifi-cally, he would only extend the special trust relationship to Indian tribes that have with his preferred history of federal dealings, in-cluding territorial removal and isolation. This, too, impacts Alaska since Alaska Na-tive have a unique federal experience and few reservations were established. During his Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Judge Cavanaugh questioned the le-gitimacy of Native Hawaiian recognition, citing their different treatment by the fed-eral government, and the fact that they do not live on reservations or enclaves. If he re-mains of the view that the special trust rela-tionship only extends to Indian tribes with his brand of federal history, including terri-torial removal and isolation, he could very well rule that Congress lacks the authority to deal with Alaska Natives. This thinking could overturn much, if not all, of the Alas-ka Native Claims Settlement Act, as well as all other federal legislation and regulations addressing Alaska Natives, tribes, corpora-tions and organizations. To confirm a nomi-nee who does not understand or appreciate the position of Native Hawaiians, and who could weaken the special trust relationship Alaska Natives share with the federal gov-ernment, would be imprudent. Judge Kavanaugh’s Assessment of the Po-litical Classification Doctrine is Troubling. The political classification doctrine an-nounced in the 1974 Morton v. Mancari deci-sion, that focusses on and Indian person’s membership in a federally recognized tribe rather than his or her ancestry to avoid strict scrutiny review of federal legislation and regulation that benefits Indians, would be extremely vulnerable if Judge Kavanaugh were to ascend to the Court. For the reasons outlined above, he would likely align himself with Justice Thomas on the issue, and the two of them would likely work to persuade their fellow justices that the relationship be-tween an Indian person’s status politically and their race is open for interpretation. Judge Kavanaugh does not accept this well-

established legal doctrine. Confirming a nominee who is unable to grasp the necessity of federal programs based on the political classification doctrine, and articulate why they must be protected, would be unwise. AFN strongly urges the U.S. Senate to vote against Judge Kavanaugh. The docu-ments that have been released so far in rela-tion to his nomination demonstrate how troubling his confirmation would be for Na-tive peoples, particularly Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians. 
Ms. HIRONO. It is deeply troubling to have a Supreme Court nominee for a lifetime position who isn’t candid with us about the facts or straight with us about the law. In Garza v. Hargan, he did it again. In that 2017 case, he wrote a dissent in which he misapplied the law and treat-ed the case as if it were about parental consent. It was not. The case, which was about whether a 17-year-old un-documented young woman could be re-leased from immigration custody to have an abortion, did not involve the question of parental consent. But he sat there at his nomination hearing, and when I asked him about it, he said that was a case involving parental con-sent—a total misstatement of the issue in the case. In that case, this young woman had already received a proper judicial bypass from a Texas judge that allowed her to make her own decisions. So that had nothing to do with having to require parental consent; she had al-ready overcome that. But that wasn’t good enough for Judge Kavanaugh. He inserted his own views about legal issues not even present in the case. This is just one example of his out-come-driven approach to important cases before him. At the hearing, I also asked him about the pattern that was revealed in his numerous dissents. In several of those cases, his own colleagues called him out for misrepresenting the facts and the law. Just last year, in United States v. Anthem, the majority said that Judge Kavanaugh ‘‘applies the law as he wishes it were, not as it currently is.’’ In a 2008 case, Agri Processor v. NLRB, the majority wrote that Judge Kavanaugh’s dissent ‘‘creates its own rule.’’ Instead of following Supreme Court rules, they said that Judge Kavanaugh’s dissent abandons the text of the applicable law altogether. It is pretty telling when your own col-leagues on the court feel so strongly about your dissent that they will actu-ally call you out on it. When this nomination first came to the Senate, I was skeptical. I said that if the President’s nominee to the Su-preme Court is anything like the nomi-nees he has been sending to the lower Federal courts, I expect we will see a nominee handpicked by the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation intent on carrying out their rightwing ideology supported by the President. It turned out to be much worse than I imagined. Not only was the nominee someone who fit that description; it be-came clear that he was someone who lacked candor, credibility, and char-acter. This has been displayed at every turn. After hearing from Dr. Ford and Brett Kavanaugh yesterday, the edi-tors of America Magazine—a well-re-spected Jesuit weekly—withdrew. They originally endorsed Judge Kavanaugh. This group withdrew their endorsement of Judge Kavanaugh. They said: While we previously endorsed the nomina-tion of Judge Kavanaugh on the basis of his legal credentials and his reputation as a committed textualist, it is now clear that the nomination should be withdrawn. If Senate Republicans proceed with his nomination, they will be prioritizing policy aims over a woman’s report of an assault. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a portion of a copy of this article be printed in the R
ECORD . There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R

[From America Magazine, Sept. 27, 2018] T
HEEDITORS : ITISTIME FOR THE KAVANAUGH  N
OMINATION TOBEWITHDRAWN  (By The Editors) Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony be-fore the Senate Judiciary Committee today clearly demonstrated both the seriousness of her allegation of assault by Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh and the stakes of this question for the whole country. Judge Kavanaugh de-nied the accusation and emphasized in his testimony that the opposition of Democratic senators to his nomination and their con-sequent willingness to attack him was estab-lished long before Dr. Blasey’s allegation was known. Evaluating the credibility of these com-peting accounts is a question about which people of good will can and do disagree. The editors of this review have no special insight into who is telling the truth. If Dr. Blasey’s allegation is true, the assault and Judge Kavanaugh’s denial of it mean that he should not be seated on the U.S. Supreme Court. But even if the credibility of the alle-gation has not been established beyond a reasonable doubt and even if further inves-tigation is warranted to determine its valid-ity or clear Judge Kavanaugh’s name, we recognize that this nomination is no longer in the best interests of the country. While we previously endorsed the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh on the basis of his legal creden-tials and his reputation as a committed textualist, it is now clear that the nomina-tion should be withdrawn. 
Ms. HIRONO. In addition, Robert Carlson, president of the American Bar Association, the ABA, issued a letter urging the Judiciary Committee of the Senate to not vote on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination until there is an FBI investigation into Dr. Ford’s account of sexual assault. The ABA ex-plained that ‘‘deciding to proceed with-out conducting an additional investiga-tion would not only have a lasting im-pact on the Senate’s reputation, but it will also negatively affect the great trust necessary for the American peo-ple to have in the Supreme Court.’’ I agree. Brett Kavanaugh does not have the credibility, candor, character, or, I would say, as we saw yesterday, the temperament to be on the Supreme Court. His presence on the Court under this kind of cloud will weaken the Court. I cannot support this nomina-tion. I would like to end the remarks I would have given at the markup but am giving on the floor now. I would like to say that my colleague Senator JEFFFLAKE has said that he would not be able to vote on the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh without an FBI in-vestigation into the current allega-tions. I support that. I have no idea whether the Republican leadership is going to allow a timeout for that kind of investigation to occur—an investiga-tion that I and other Democratic mem-bers of the Judiciary Committee have been calling for, for what seems like months. Of course, I would want an FBI inves-tigation to be thorough. I do not want some kind of a peripheral investigation to give cover to Senators who are wa-vering. I would want an investigation by the FBI to be thorough, to be real, to provide us with the kind of informa-tion that we need to make a deter-mination as to the credibility, candor, and character of Judge Kavanaugh. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Connecticut. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-dent, the Judiciary Committee had an extraordinary meeting this morning, and each of us spoke at some length about our reservations or support for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to be a U.S. Supreme Court Justice. At the end of that meeting, as we were about to take a vote, Senator J
EFF F
LAKE , our colleague, announced his decision that he would request and seek a 1-week extension of the vote so there could be an FBI investigation of some of the unanswered questions that still very seriously and urgently de-mand responses in fact and evidence. That is a very promising and impor-tant step. It has to be a real investiga-tion, not a sham or show. It has to be penetrating and impartial, which the trained professionals of the FBI can do. I have a lot of confidence that the FBI will do its job and answer those very serious and urgent questions. The answers are all the more press-ing after the extraordinary hearing we held yesterday at the Judiciary Com-mittee. The entire Nation watched as two people told their stories; two very, very different stories and also told in very, very different ways, but let’s be very clear. The roles of these individ-uals and their responsibilities were also very different. Judge Brett Kavanaugh came before us for a job interview. He has no right to be on the U.S. Supreme Court. It is a privilege of extraordinary magnitude and significance. The position is one of the most important in our country—a lifetime appointment to the highest Court in the land. Our responsibility in the Judiciary Committee is not to approve just any-one for that job. We should be seeking the best person, a person of intellect and integrity and temperament who will be fair and impartial, objective, and considerate.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6372 September 28, 2018 
I concluded well before the hearing yesterday—it is no secret—that I would oppose Judge Brett Kavanaugh for the U.S. Supreme Court. My opposition was based on his ex-treme ideological views and judicial philosophy which were amply dem-onstrated at the previous hearing we had with him. My concern is, he would be a fifth vote to cut back or even over-turn Roe v. Wade and stop women from making decisions about when they will become pregnant or have children; stop people from marrying and exercising their right to do so with the person they love; cutting back on consumer rights and workers’ rights and environ-mental objectives; and permitting an imperial Presidency—a President who could decide unilaterally that he be-lieves the law is unconstitutional, and therefore it should not be enforced, meaning that laws protecting millions of Americans who suffer from pre-existing conditions like diabetes and heart disease, cancer, mental illness, and, yes, pregnancy would go unpro-tected, and other rights under the Af-fordable Care Act. An imperial Presi-dency giving the power of that kind of unilateral authority is an anathema. What we saw yesterday went beyond views on substantive issues, and I will be very blunt. What we saw was a man filled with anger, even rage, and self- pity, someone of arrogance, highly in-tensely partisan, and someone, in my view, temperamentally unfit for the U.S. Supreme Court. In fact, I fear his rancor and animus, his partisan bitter-ness, which came across so clearly and explicitly in his reference to a leftwing conspiracy; Democrats organized to fight him and dredge dirt to destroy his family, a conspiratorial view of the world that is not only factually totally false but also deeply dangerous and un-precedented in anything we have ever heard from any nominee for any judi-cial position as long as I have been here and I believe unprecedented also in the Senate’s consideration of Su-preme Court nominees. He indicated a partisanship that was disrespectful and dangerous. We saw also a woman who came be-fore us as a sexual assault survivor who was temperamentally almost exactly the opposite. Instead of hostile, she was helpful. Instead of angry, she was calm. Instead of rancorous and arro-gant, she was modest and humble. Like Judge Kavanaugh, her family has been harmed by death threats and other vile, vicious behavior that has no tolerance in a democratic society, and my heart goes out to both families. We should reject threats to both of those families, as we do to anyone else in our society, and I have sympathy for the children and the families on both sides and others who may have been affected in coming forth with truth that relates to this nomination. The demeanor of Professor-Dr. Chris-tine Blasey Ford was completely dis-tinct and different. She was mesmer-izing. Even now, her visage haunts me in her profound honesty. She was cred-ible and powerful in recounting events that caused her untold terror and an-guish; events she hid because of the trauma she experienced then and be-cause of many of the fears that cause other survivors of sexual assault to hide the same kinds of assault, the fears of blame and public shaming and character assassination and threats of retaliation and sometimes self-blame or stigma or embarrassment. In her case, coming forward has made many of those fears a reality, trag-ically and unfortunately. She has en-dured the nightmare befallen her and her family simply to serve the public with facts and evidence she believes we should know—we in the Senate, we in America—should take into account be-fore we make a decision on Brett Kavanaugh as the nominee. So there are profound questions raised by her powerful testimony that need to be answered in the FBI inter-view. That is the reason the American Bar Association Thursday evening called for postponing a vote on Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Su-preme Court until sexual assault and misconduct allegations made by Dr. Blasey Ford and others are fully inves-tigated and why separately the maga-zine of the Jesuit Order in the United States, America, withdrew its endorse-ment of Judge Kavanaugh. He was edu-cated by Jesuits at Georgetown Pre-paratory School in Maryland, and on Thursday, the editors said the nomina-tion was no longer in the best interest of the country. I want to quote further the magazine, which said: 
If Senate Republicans proceed with his nomination, they will be prioritizing policy aims over a woman’s report of assault. Were he to be confirmed without this allegation being firmly disproved, it would hang over future decisions on the Supreme Court for decades and further divide the country. 
Approval of Brett Kavanaugh for the U.S. Supreme Court would be a cloud, it would be a stain on the U.S. Su-preme Court for generations to come. We do that damage to the Nation’s highest Court at our peril whether we are in agreement or disagreement with Brett Kavanaugh on his policy aims, as the magazine said. We are talking about the funda-mental integrity of an institution and our responsibility to uphold that integ-rity. In her testimony yesterday, she was convincing not only because of what she knew and recalled in such precise, vivid detail—indeed, highlighting the laughter of Brett Kavanaugh as he groped her and held her down, as he lay on top of her, the laughter from both him and from Mark Judge—but after we heard her compelling and powerful story, in Judge Kavanaugh, we heard several statements that clearly con-tradict the facts in evidence. They are untruths. He claimed the FBI had already in-vestigated him because they did a background check six times. The FBI never investigated Dr. Blasey Ford’s allegations. It never investigated Debo-rah Ramirez’s allegations. It never in-vestigated Julie Swetnick’s allega-tions. In fact, the ABA highlights this point. Senator GRASSLEY said that com-mittee investigators were willing to talk to the witnesses about their alle-gations, but committee investigators are no substitute for the FBI. The FBI must send those trained professionals to talk to these brave survivors who have come forward, and it must talk to Mark Judge. I offered a motion to subpoena Mark Judge this morning before our com-mittee. The motion was voted down. The FBI must talk to Mark Judge, who was allegedly in that room with Brett Kavanaugh when he assaulted Dr. Blasey Ford. We asked Judge Kavanaugh to call for an investigation by the FBI. A per-son who is innocent would want the FBI to investigate their claims and clear their name. That is what Dr. Blasey Ford wanted. She said so pub-licly. When Brett Kavanaugh was asked, he refused to make that same call. The question is, Why? What is he hiding? What is the administration concealing in refusing to disclose more than a mil-lion pages of documents that relate to Brett Kavanaugh’s service in the Bush White House as Staff Secretary? They bear on his credibility, maybe not on these specific allegations, but on his credibility. Judge Kavanaugh claimed that poly-graphs are not reliable; that the poly-graph Dr. Blasey Ford took and passed was meaningless. Yet, on the DC Cir-cuit as a judge, Brett Kavanaugh ruled otherwise. He wrote ‘‘law enforcement agencies use polygraphs to test the credibility of witnesses and criminal defendants.’’ As a former U.S. attorney, I know how polygraphs are used to test credi-bility of witnesses and criminal defend-ants. They may sometimes be inadmis-sible. They may be inadmissible gen-erally, but they have a use. Judge Kavanaugh claimed that all four wit-nesses Dr. Ford identified as being present at the party have said that the sexual assault ‘‘didn’t happen,’’ but in fact, only one person has said the sex-ual assault didn’t happen. That one person is Brett Kavanaugh. The other three parties identified by Dr. Blasey Ford said they do not remember. There is a big difference between ‘‘do not re-member’’ and ‘‘it didn’t happen.’’ The other woman Dr. Blasey Ford named who was there has since pub-licly stated that she believes Dr. Ford’s account. She believes Dr. Ford, and I do too. Judge Kavanaugh tried to give himself an alibi by making it sound like he never drank on weeknights. His own high school calendar, which he provided the committee as evidence, disputes that statement. During the hearing, he admitted that one of the entries on his calendar from

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6373 September 28, 2018 
a Thursday signified that he went to a friend’s house to drink. Judge Kavanaugh repeatedly said that he had never in his life had so much to drink that he couldn’t remem-ber everything that happened, but nu-merous people who spent time with him during his high school, college, and law school years confirmed that he frequently drank to excess and some-times became belligerent. Judge Kavanaugh claimed that he al-ways treated women ‘‘with dignity and respect’’—his words—and yet he and his football friends from high school named one of my constituents, Renate Dolphin, in their yearbook pages, say-ing they were her ‘‘alumnius,’’ in ef-fect, boasting of sexual conquests and objectifying her, demeaning her. That is hardly treating a woman with dig-nity and respect. Judge Kavanaugh said this reference meant nothing sex-ual, but Renate Dolphin disagrees. In a quote to the New York Times, she said: 
The insinuation is horrible, hurtful, and simply untrue. I pray their daughters are never treated that way. 
He said the allegations against him were ‘‘a calculated and orchestrated political hit fueled with apparent pent- up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election.’’ He called it ‘‘re-venge on behalf of the Clintons.’’ He issued a warning—more like a threat— that ‘‘what goes around comes around.’’ That threat to the Judiciary Committee of the U.S. Senate is a threat to America. It is profoundly and deeply dangerous to think that liti-gants will come before his court with the threat that their political views will determine how he decides their cases. That is antithetical to the basic fundamental principles of this country. It contravenes the entire concept of an independent judiciary. President Trump has demonstrated his contempt for the rule of law and an independent judiciary, but a member of one of the highest courts in the country doing so is chilling. It is stunning. It is stag-gering. My Republican colleagues, unfortu-nately, followed that example. They said we leaked her letters to the press at the last minute to derail Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination. They called the allegation against Judge Kavanaugh a coordinated smear cam-paign. That contention is false. It im-plies that these courageous survivors of sexual assault are puppets or pawns orchestrated by politicians. Anybody who heard and saw Dr. Blasey Ford yesterday knows that is blatantly false. She came forward on her own ini-tiative. She did it reluctantly, foresee-ing the nightmare that would befall her and her family. She did it without encouragement from any Member of the U.S. Senate or any other political figure. That contention is an insult to her and all survivors of this horrific crime. Is Deborah Ramirez’s story, too, a fabricated allegation to take down Judge Kavanaugh? When Senator H
ARRIS asked Judge Kavanaugh if he had listened to Dr. Ford’s testimony, he said: ‘‘I did not.’’ He should have. He should have lis-tened to her testimony. He should have heard and heeded what Deborah Rami-rez said about his sexual misconduct toward her and, likewise, Julie Swetnick, about the chilling acts that she alleged that he was involved in per-forming. Judge Kavanaugh and my Republican colleagues say they don’t dispute that Dr. Blasey Ford may have been sexu-ally assaulted at some point but by some other person, just not Brett Kavanaugh. Maybe she was mixed up. Maybe she was confused. Those kinds of words used to describe her and other sexual assault victims demonstrate the disrespect and disregard that has shamed and silenced so many sexual assault survivors from coming forward to tell their truth, seek prosecution, and consult their parents or loved ones and seek healing. It is the reason that sexual assault is one of the most under-reported crimes in our country. One out of every three women is a survivor, but so very few come forward because of the public shaming, character assas-sination, and threats and rejections they fear and, in fact, they rightly foresee. To my friends on the other side of the aisle, you cannot have it both ways. You either believe Dr. Blasey Ford or you reject her testimony. Ei-ther you accept her veracity or you don’t. Dr. Blasey Ford was asked whether it was possible that she con-fused her attacker, whether there was mistaken identity, or whether there was maybe someone else other than Brett Kavanaugh. Firmly, unequivo-cally, repeatedly, she said no. Before us and the entire country, she said she was ‘‘100 percent’’ sure that Brett Kavanaugh was her attacker. This detail is seared in her memory. There is no mistaken identity here. A person so brutally attacked at the age of 15 who admits to these details and also the details that she doesn’t re-member and insists on the details she does remember doesn’t make some-thing like that up out of whole cloth. She came forward at great personal sacrifice. I believe her. I think America believes her. She testified that she was terrified— that is her word, ‘‘terrified’’—to come forward. She was very nearly silenced by her fear. She worried if she told her story that she would be shouted down or vilified by Judge Kavanaugh’s de-fenders and that he would never be held accountable. That fear silences too many survivors. We must prove them wrong. We must hold him accountable. As I said at the very start, a lifetime appointment and promotion to the Su-preme Court is not an entitlement. It is a privilege for the person who is best for that position. Last Friday, President Trump said about Dr. Blasey Ford’s story on Twit-ter: I have no doubt that, if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed by local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents. I ask that she bring those fil-ings forward so we can learn the date, time, and place! President Trump knows better. I hope he knows better. Psychologists have noted, and it is widely known, that there are a number of reasons why survivors opt for silence, such as fear of retaliation and repercussions in the workplace or at home, feelings of self- blame. They are told to dismiss it. They are told by their parents they will be blamed, not the perpetrators. They fear they will not be believed, and they want to forget. They want to put this trauma somewhere deep and dark where it will be a source of less pain. So Dr. Ford did not share the details of her abuse until a therapy session in 2012. She told her husband early in their relationship, but even he did not know the details of this incident until that therapy session. That is not uncommon for people who have experienced trauma. In the last few weeks, numerous survivors of sexual assault have stepped forward with their stories to explain why they hid their own trauma. I want to take this opportunity to express my admira-tion for the survivors who are coming forward now with stories of terrible crimes, of impulses to stay silent, and of fears that they have conquered in coming forward. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that these stories be printed in the R
ECORD . I will not read them all now, but I wish for the statements of Lindsey Jones of Connecticut; Tara, who asked that her last name not be used, also of Connecticut; and survivors from other parts of the country who have con-tacted me just over the past few days be printed in the R
ECORD . There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows: 
LINDSEY JONES FROMCONNECTICUT  Pain, sadness, shame, self-doubt, loyalty, guilt, fear. These are some of the reasons I decided not to file a police report when I was assaulted at a house party in my teens. The main reason, however, was that as a teenage girl I had spent my life in a culture that told me I was the least important char-acter in the story of my life. My pain, my truth, my future were all less important than the futures and reputations of the peo-ple who assaulted me. I believed that I must bear at least some of the responsibility for the assault because I had been drinking underage. And a brief visit to the victim services of-fice of my college only confirmed that belief. I believed that the symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress following the as-sault was my own personal failings. I told myself I was being dramatic, that my inability to just get on with things shouldn’t negatively impact the futures of my formers friends. I even, in a desperate attempt to convince myself that nothing truly terrible had hap-pened, apologized for inconveniencing them and privately accusing them of assault. You see, I could deal with what happened to me if I was at fault. If it was my fault, I

could change my behavior to make sure it never happened again. If I stayed silent, I could pretend every-thing was fine and deal with my emotions in private. If I was silent, people wouldn’t look at me and see either a victim or a liar. No one would have to choose sides, every-one I knew would be spared of what side to take, my side, or the side of my rapist. If I stayed silent and accepted all the blame, I spared myself the additional trauma of watching friends and loved ones choose the sides of the person who assaulted me. Most importantly, if I convinced myself that nothing illegal had taken place, that it was more of a misunderstanding than an as-sault, if I convinced myself that it didn’t matter anyway, that I didn’t really care, then I wouldn’t have to face my biggest fear—that no one else would really care, that I didn’t really matter. I was convinced that I could find safety in my silence, but to paraphrase the poet and activist Audre Lorde, my silence did not pro-tect me. It’s been 15 years, and I’m still in pain. And the people who assaulted me have not faced a single consequence. And meanwhile, especially over the last two years, I continued to find evidence that my teenage self was right—no one cares about the victims of sexual assault. No one seems to care to the point that in 2018, men who have been credibly accused of sexual assault are leading this nation and their accusers are publicly doubted and ver-bally eviscerated by the media, the presi-dent, and members of the senate judiciary committee. I am here today because I want all the un-heard teenagers girls in this country, past, present, and future, including my two daugh-ters, one of whom is here with me today, every time you speak the truth, you do your part to dismantle a toxic, victim-blaming culture, and the world is better for it. Make them hear you. Thank you Senator Blumenthal, and thank you Dr. Blasey Ford. T
ARAFROMCONNECTICUT  Between the ages of 13 and 14, I was raped by a man whose children I used to babysit for. He used the fact that I loved his children and wanted them in my life against me as he raped me while the children were around us. I didn’t tell—I thought that if I got out of the situation that it would be okay because it was my fault—especially after the first time. I didn’t tell, like he said, nobody would be-lieve me. They would think that I wanted it. So I continued on and didn’t tell till I got a phone call that he had possibly raped the babysitter after me. And that was the only thing that got me to come forward and speak up. I had already not been in the children’s life and I needed to stop him from doing it again. And so we went through and I pressed charges and he ended up getting five years. And he got out of prison and there were no safeguards to protect anybody and he is back on the streets and I don’t know today if I would have spoken up back then until re-cently. If I hadn’t gotten that phone call, this may still be a secret I keep. And, you know, because of the more people coming forward—Dr. Ford, we believe you. We all need to stick together and do what’s right because 1 out of 4 girls and 1 out of 6 boys—it’s in everybody’s family. And I just ask the Senators to think about if it was your mother or your sister or your daughter, what would you want for them? And nobody who is falsely accusing some-body would ask for an FBI investigation—in my opinion. I just—I really think we all need to stick together and demand what she deserves. EMILY MALLOY FROMNORTH CAROLINA  I remember what I was wearing like it was yesterday. Like a broken record on repeat. I’ll never forget that outfit and what hap-pened to me in those clothes that unforget-table night. Blue jeans and a bright blue t-shirt. Noth-ing revealing. Nothing slutty. Just regular clothes you wear to a high school football game. It was senior year. I was with one of my high school friends and we had just gotten invited to a after game party. I wish I would have listened to my gut that night, but I ignored that voice in my head like the plague. I was pressured into going to this party by my friend and I was staying at her house that night . . . little did I know I’d never get to her house. There we were. Beer and loud rap music. I was surrounded by people I knew. Yes I drank. Yes I got drunk. What hap-pened later that night ISN’T my fault and it took me 11 years so believe that. Three guys I knew. Three guys I trusted. Three guys lured me into a dark room. One of those guys took my innocence without my consent that night on the cold floor. I froze. I panicked. I gave in and just let it happened. What I was left with in the wee hours of the morning, was bruises and a tattered spir-it that I’m still healing to this day. I’m now 31. I finally told my mom this past fall. I re-member mom saying ‘‘I wish you would have told me we could have prosecuted those guys.’’ I just hugged her and cried . . . I knew that my chances of justices were slim to none. A
NONYMOUS FROM NEWJERSEY  A decorative emerald green bird in a nest, embellished with gold glitter An orange shag carpet and a plaid bed-spread An ugly brown wallpaper with golden swirls A rough wood wall in a darkened hallway between two office buildings Look at this list. See any connections? I’m guessing that most wouldn’t—even an expe-rienced HGTV designer would have difficulty coordinating them or even using them as in-spiration for a room makeover. But I can connect them without hesi-tation: they’re all objects—things I remem-ber—from the times I was violated, molested, or fought through attempted sexual assaults. They are objects from four specific points in time: A night when I was 6 An afternoon when I was 12 A night when I was newly-16 An afternoon when I was 16 It’s bizarre—even to me—to see this list of things together. I’ve never written it before. I’ve never spoken openly about the incidents before. But I remember them, each of them. The incidents and the objects. Some viola-tions play like movies in my head from time to time, even 40+ years later. Certain ob-jects, smells, hairdos, and foods can bring a flood of memories—of the teen boys and grown men who attacked me. And each time it happens, it’s like a punch to the gut. Still. Decades later. When that happens, I want to hold the 6- year-old me and tell her that the pedophile teen was a crafty opportunist that night— and it was not her fault. I didn’t report it be-cause I didn’t have the words. I want to comfort the 12-year-old me and tell her that the 17-year-old who physically manifested his interest in her prepubescent body should have been nowhere near her— and it was not her fault. I didn’t report it because I was told by him that it would ruin his life. I want to tell the newly-16-year-old me that the drunken upperclassman who fol-lowed her into the bathroom at a party to was an insecure, aggressive guy who was in-capable of handling rejection—and it was not her fault. I didn’t report it because I had been drink-ing and didn’t want to get in trouble. I want to tell the 16-year-old me that the 40–something-year-old man who pinned her against the wall, shoved his tongue down her throat, and groped her was a sick indi-vidual—and it was not her fault. I didn’t report it because I was told by the adult I confided in that the man would go to jail; and since he was a husband and a father of young children, it would ruin his life. This is the first time I’ve written it all out—the things that happened and why I didn’t report them. And I know there are millions of un-written stories and unspoken memories just like mine—from all over the world. We haven’t been heard, but we exist. And since the #metoo movement we’ve realized that we’re not alone. We’re not voiceless. We’re not powerless. We’re finally learning to say ‘‘me too.’’ Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-dent, let me conclude with this thought. Dr. Blasey Ford is a profile in courage. Her name will be remembered long after many of ours are forgotten. She will be in the history books as a teacher—she is a teacher by profes-sion—for this teaching moment for America. It is a teaching moment for all of us—for women who need perhaps that inspiration and role model to come forward and to know that they will be embraced, not rejected. They will be believed, not shunned. They will be bolstered and heeded, and their per-petrator will be held accountable. It is a teaching moment for men—all of us— that we need to do better. It is also a teaching moment for young men—high school juniors and seniors, like Brett Kavanaugh was. When he put into his yearbook that hurtful, horrible phrase about Renate Dolphin—in effect, laugh-ing at her and ridiculing that young woman, just as he laughed and ridi-culed Dr. Blasey Ford, then 15 years old, as he allegedly was on top of her, groping and trying to undress her— that laughter was the detail that con-tinued to ring in the ears of Dr. Blasey Ford. It was the most identifiable fact about that incident, as she said yester-day: That laughter is what I hear when I see that entry in the yearbook. So to all of us men and women in America, her profile in courage should send a message. We should be proud of her, and no one should be prouder than her two sons. I say to Dr. Blasey Ford’s sons, as I did this morning in the Judi-ciary Committee meeting: You should be proud of your mom. She is an Amer-ican woman who stood strong and spoke out and fearlessly and relent-lessly insisted on America hearing her story—well, maybe not fearlessly. She had fear, but she conquered it. That is the definition of courage—not to be without fear but to act courageously in

NOMINATION OF BRETT KAVANAUGH Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here for my customary ‘‘Time to Wake Up’’ speech, but before I get into it, given the events of the day, I just want to express my satisfaction with the turn of events in the Judiciary Committee. As the Acting President pro tempore may know, yesterday was a rather bit-ter day in the Judiciary Committee, with there being a lot of anger and tribal belligerence and a nominee who was full of partisanship and conspiracy theory and invective. It really was not a good day. Yet this is a funny place, and sometimes, right after we have been at our worst, something breaks that turns things in the right direc-tion. Something happened in the Judiciary Committee today, much due to the concerns and the fortitude of Senator FLAKE , so I want to give him primary credit. I understand the Republican leadership has agreed there will be a weeklong delay in the Kavanaugh vote on the floor and that the FBI will be given a chance to do its job and take a look at the allegations that are out there about his conduct. This is not only a good thing for the Senate—because I think it releases a lot of pent-up pressure and anxiety and hostility—but it is also a really good thing for the process because the worst possible outcome would be that we would push this candidate through, that he would then get on the Supreme Court, and it would be subsequently shown that these allegations would have been, in fact, true and that he would not have been truthful with us about it and would have lied to the Senate. To clear as much of that cloud off of him as possible, I think, is good for us, good for the Court, good for the country—good for all. So, after a grim and battering day yesterday, I think we had a productive day today. I feel I earned my pay in the Senate over in the Judiciary Committee.

MISINFORMATION Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, what I want to talk about is a new form of political weapon that has emerged onto the political battlefield in America, and it is a political weapon for which the American system is not very well prepared yet. The new polit-ical weapon we see is systematic and deliberate misinformation, what you might call weaponized fake news. Vladimir Putin’s regime, in Russia, uses weaponized fake news all the time for political influence in the former So-viet Union and the modern European Union. Our intelligence agencies caught them using misinformation to help Trump win the 2016 American election. Some also is homegrown. In America, the original weaponized fake news was climate denial, spun up by the fossil fuel industry. The fossil fuel industry used systematic, deliberate disinformation to propagandize our politics and fend off accountability for its pollution of our atmosphere and oceans. So, for both national security and po-litical integrity reasons, we need to better understand this misinformation weaponry. Guess what. Science is on the case. A comprehensive array of peer-reviewed articles appeared last year in the Journal of Applied Re-search in Memory and Cognition and, I am sure, is on the Acting President pro tempore’s bedside table for light read-ing. Dozens of scientists contributed to this report, and I list their names in an appendix to the speech. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent that my appendix be added at the end of my speech. What they found is interesting. One piece—tellingly subtitled ‘‘Under-standing and Coping with the ‘Post- Truth’ Era’’—describes how ‘‘the World Economic Forum ranked the spread of misinformation online as one of the 10 most significant issues facing the world’’—the top 10. ‘‘An obvious hallmark of a post-truth world is that it empowers people to choose their own reality, where facts and objective evidence are trumped by existing beliefs and prejudices,’’ con-cludes one article—not a good thing. This is not your grandfather’s misin-formation. This is not ‘‘JFK and Marilyn Monroe’s Love Child Found in Utah Salt Mine.’’ This is not ‘‘Aliens Abducted My Cat.’’ This is not fun and entertainment. This is also not people just being wrong. Indeed, ‘‘misinforma-tion in the post-truth era can no longer be considered solely an isolated failure of individual cognition that can be cor-rected with appropriate communica-tions tools,’’ they write. In plain English, this isn’t just er-rors; there is something bigger going on. Scientists from Duke University agreed. ‘‘Rather than a series of isolated falsehoods, we are confronted with a growing ecosystem of misinformation.’’ In this ecosystem, misinformation is put to use by determined factions. ‘‘The melange of anti-intellectual ap-peals, conspiratorial thinking, pseudo-scientific claims, and sheer propaganda circulating within American society seems unrelenting,’’ write Aaron M. McCright of Michigan State and Riley E. Dunlap of Oklahoma State. They note: ‘‘Those who seek to pro-mote systemic lies’’ are ‘‘backed by in-fluential economic interests or power-ful state actors, both domestic and for-eign.’’ Let me highlight those key phrases—‘‘systemic lies . . . backed by influential economic interests.’’ Like I said, it is not your grandfather’s misin-formation. An author from Ohio State writes that this creates artificial polarization in our politics that is not explained by our tribal social media habits. His sub-title, too, is telling: ‘‘Disinformation Campaigns are the Problem, Not Audi-ence Fragmentation.’’ He notes these disinformation campaigns ‘‘are used by political strategists, private interests, and foreign powers to manipulate peo-ple for political gain.’’ ‘‘Strategically deployed falsehoods have played an important role in shap-ing Americans’ attitudes toward a vari-ety of high-profile political issues,’’ reads another article. In a nutshell, Americans are the sub-jects of propaganda warfare by power-ful economic interests. So how is all of this misinformation deployed? ‘‘The insidious fallouts from misin-formation are particularly pronounced when the misinformation is packaged as a conspiracy theory,’’ they tell us— insidious, indeed. By wrapping delib-erate misinformation in conspiracy theory, the propagandist degrades the target’s defenses against correction by

legitimate information. Conspiracy theories, the articles notes, ‘‘tend to be particularly prevalent in times of eco-nomic and political crises.’’ Pulling emotional strings is another technique. Emotionally weaponized fake news is reflected in ‘‘the preva-lence of outraged discourse on political blogs, talk radio, and cable news.’’ These powerful interests also take advantage of ‘‘the institutionalization of ‘false equivalence’ in so-called main-stream media.’’ They sophisticatedly leverage media conventions to their private advantage. Another tactical observation: To be effective, the misinformation campaign does not have to convince you. It can simply barrage, confuse, and stun you. One of these articles related the Ban-gor Daily News assessment of false-hoods coming from the Trump White House: ‘‘The idea isn’t to convince peo-ple of untrue things, it is to fatigue them, so that they will stay out of the political province entirely, regarding the truth as just too difficult to deter-mine.’’ This, of course, is a well-known polit-ical propaganda strategy. What the Bangor Daily News saw, the research-ers note, is ‘‘mirrored by analysts of Russian propaganda and disinformation campaigns.’’ McCright and Dunlap describe how weaponized fake news—what they call ‘‘the intentional promotion of misin-formation’’—is made into systematic propaganda by amplification of what they call the ‘‘powerful conservative echo chamber.’’ It is systematic, it is deliberate, and it is supported by a pur-poseful private apparatus. This brings us back to what the au-thors call the ‘‘utility of misinforma-tion . . . to powerful political and eco-nomic interests.’’ What they conclude, basically, is that the weaponization of fake news is done for profit and with purpose. It has an apparatus of amplifi-cation. It needn’t convince but simply stun or confuse. Like an insidious virus, it can carry its own conspiracy theory and emotional payload counter-measures against the ordinary anti-bodies that ordinarily protect us from being misled. The scientists urge that we must ex-amine these systematic campaigns of false misinformation ‘‘through the lens of political drivers that have created an alternative epistemology that does not conform to conventional standards of evidentiary support.’’ Let’s unpack that language for a minute. Let’s begin with the fact that it is ‘‘political drivers’’ that are behind the scheme. This is a tool in a larger battle for political supremacy. To help win this battle, political ac-tors have ‘‘created an alternative epis-temology,’’ a separate way of looking at the world; obviously, a way of look-ing at the world that aligns with their economic interests. That ‘‘alternative epistemology’’ is untethered from the truth. It ‘‘does not conform to conventional standards of evidentiary support.’’ It stands on falsehood, on prejudice, and on emo-tion, not on fact. What the authors call ‘‘post-truth politics’’ has motive and purpose. They write: It is ‘‘a rational strategy that is deployed in pursuit of political objec-tives.’’ In these propaganda campaigns by powerful economic interests, some stuff right now happens a lot more on one political side. Scientists track an uneven distribution of emotion-ridden fake news and misinformation. They say: ‘‘The prevalence of outraged dis-course on political blogs, talk radio, and cable news is 50% greater on the political right than the political left.’’ Other authors write ‘‘if the political context were to change, we might ex-pect the distribution of misperceptions across the political spectrum to change as well,’’ but for now, the weaponized fake news virus predominantly infects the political rightwing and modern conservative politics. McCright and Dunlap writes: ‘‘The Right seems especially adept at using Orwellian language to promote their ideological and material interests via what we would argue are systemic lies.’’ So who does this? Weaponized fake news is not cheap. It is not cheap to test. It is not cheap to manufacture, and it is not cheap to distribute. It is also not cheap to maintain a network to put weaponized fake news out there in a way that masks the identity of the economic forces behind the network. This takes money, motive, and persist-ence, and that means big industrial players. What authors call the ‘‘800-pound go-rilla in the room’’ is ‘‘a political sys-tem that is driven by the interests of economic elites rather than the peo-ple.’’ That is big economic elites play-ing a game of masquerade and manipu-lation in our politics. The scheme may look like populism. Indeed, part of the masquerade is, it is designed to look like populism, but that is what is going on. The disinformation campaign is ‘‘largely independent of the public’s wishes but serves the interests of eco-nomic elites.’’ The populist mas-querade is part of the disinformation exercise. These economic elites take methods developed decades ago by one industry to use for another industry today. We see this in the fossil fuel industry- weaponized fake news about climate change—climate denial we call it. The stakes are very high, with the International Monetary Fund calcu-lating that fossil fuel exacts a subsidy from the American people of $700 bil-lion per year. To protect an annual subsidy of $700 billion per year, you can cook up a lot of mischief. Where did the fossil fuel climate de-nial mischief begin? It began in the to-bacco industry’s fraudulent schemes to deny the health risks of tobacco. Did Big Oil shy away from those tobacco tactics, knowing those tactics were ac-tually found in court to be fraud? No. Indeed, to quote an article: ‘‘The oil industry has worked to promote doubt about climate change science using tactics pioneered by cigarette manu-facturers in the 1960s.’’ To protect a $700 billion annual sub-sidy, you can build a bigger denial scheme even than Big Tobacco, and they did. McCright and Dunlap call this the ‘‘climate change denial countermovement.’’ They say its mes-sage ‘‘may be the most successful sys-temic lies of the last few decades.’’ They continue: 
Briefly, this countermovement uses money and resources from industry and conserv-ative foundations to mobilize an array of conservative think tanks, lobbying organiza-tions, media outlets, front groups, and Re-publican politicians to ignore, suppress, ob-fuscate, and cherry-pick scientists and their research to deny the reality and seriousness of climate change. 
Other authors write that ‘‘the cur-rent polarization of the climate debate is the result of a decades-long con-certed effort by conservative political operatives and think tanks to cast doubt on the overwhelming scientific consensus that the earth is warming from human greenhouse gas emis-sions.’’ ‘‘To cast doubt’’ is the key phrase in that last quote. The authors emphasize that ‘‘climate science denial does not present a coherent alternative expla-nation of climate change. On the con-trary, the arguments offered by cli-mate denial are intrinsically incoher-ent. Climate-science denial is therefore best understood not as an alternative knowledge claim but as a political op-eration aimed at generating uncer-tainty in the public’s mind in order to preserve the status quo.’’ How did that play out in Republican policymaking? ‘‘[W]hile climate change used to be a bipartisan issue in the 1980s, the Republican party has argu-ably moved from evidence-based con-cern to industry-funded denial.’’ Let’s be clear. Climate denial is not a search for truth. As the evidence piled up that early climate change warnings were accurate, the climate denial cam-paign did not relent in the face of those facts. Indeed, the scientists relate, ‘‘the amount of misinformation on cli-mate change has increased in propor-tion to the strength of scientific evi-dence that human greenhouse gas emissions are altering the Earth’s cli-mate.’’ It is a fossil fuel upgrade of the fraudulent Big Tobacco strategy. One example is the so-called Oregon Peti-tion, a bogus petition urging the U.S. Government to reject the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on global warming. One arti-cle points out that ‘‘the Oregon Peti-tion is an example of the so-called ‘fake-experts’ strategy that was pio-neered by the tobacco industry in the 1970s and 1980s.’’ Of course, since this scheme isn’t real science, it doesn’t use real scientific outlets. ‘‘[M]uch of the opposition to

mainstream climate science, like any other form of science denial, involves non-scientific outlets such as blogs.’’ Another article notes that this is done on ‘‘websites that obfuscate their sponsor by mimicking the trappings of nonprofits and other more trusted sites.’’ Again, masquerade—even cam-ouflage—is part of the problem. I think it goes without saying that in real science it is not necessary to mask the real proponent. Another signal of the scheme is rep-etition of falsehood. ‘‘Dozens of studies document an illusory truth effect whereby repeated statements are judged truer than new ones.’’ In real science, when someone real-izes what they are saying is wrong, they stop saying it. In the weaponized disinformation scheme, you just keep saying it. You maybe even say it more to capitalize on this ‘‘illusory truth ef-fect.’’ This, of course, recalls the infamous Big Tobacco declaration: ‘‘Doubt is our product.’’ That is a quote from a to-bacco memo. The heart of the fossil fuel industry’s scheme is to undermine legitimate science with false doubts. To chip away at the scientific consensus on climate change, they chip away at the founda-tions of truth itself. One author sees this as ‘‘the willing-ness of political actors to promote doubt as to whether truth is ultimately knowable’’—think of the President’s lawyer, Giuliani, saying ‘‘truth isn’t truth’’—or ‘‘whether empirical evi-dence is important’’—think of climate denial trying to drown out the truth through repetition of false state-ments—third, ‘‘and whether the fourth estate has value’’—think of the Presi-dent attacking the legitimate media as ‘‘fake news’’ and the ‘‘enemy of the people.’’ The scientific paper concludes: ‘‘Un-dermining public confidence in the in-stitutions that produce and dissemi-nate knowledge is a threat to which scientists must respond.’’ Sadly, real science is poorly adapted to defending itself against weaponized disinformation in the public arena. Let me conclude with what one arti-cle calls a case study in the spread of misinformation. Last year’s ‘‘Unite the Right’’ rally in Charlottesville, VA, which led to the murder of Heather Heyer, killed by a White supremacist speeding into a crowd, a witness re-corded on film the car plowing into that crowd of people. The authors wrote: ‘‘Within hours, conspiracy theo-ries began floating around the internet among people associated with the alt- right,’’ attempting to undermine and discredit the witness. Social media posts then appeared ‘‘suggesting [the driver] staged the attack, was trained by the CIA, and funded by either George Soros, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama or the global Jewish mafia. . . . [T]hose conspiracy theories migrated into more mainstream media. Vari-ations appeared on info wars and Shawn Hannity’s show on Fox.’’ FOX News, by the way, is a common venue for fake news. Here is what the scientists chronicle as the ‘‘Fox News effect’’: 
It has repeatedly been shown that people who report that they source their news from public broadcasters become better informed the more attention they report paying to the news, whereas, the reverse is true for self-re-ported consumers of FOX News. . . . [F]or self-reporting viewers of Fox News . . . in-creasing frequency of news consumption is often associated with an increased likelihood that they are misinformed about various issues. 
In a nutshell, the more you watch real news, the more you know; the more you watch FOX News, the less you know—great for the elite mer-chants of doubt. The effects of misinformation be-come measurable by looking at prov-able falsehoods that people are made to believe. 
[A] 2011 poll showed that 51 percent of Re-publican primary voters thought that then- president Obama had been born abroad. . . . [Twenty percent] of respondents in a rep-resentative U.S. sample have been found to endorse the proposition that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by corrupt scientists. The idea that the Democratic Party was run-ning a child sex ring was at one point be-lieved or accepted as being possibly true by nearly one-third of Americans and nearly one-half of Trump voters. 
All provably false. All propagated until significant numbers of people be-lieved. So how do we fight back? The re-searchers offer an array of approaches. ‘‘Russian propaganda can be ‘digitally contained’ by supporting media lit-eracy and source criticism,’’ says one. ‘‘Our recommendation,’’ wrote an-other, ‘‘is to begin by generating a list of the skills required to be a critical consumer of information.’’ In essence, we have to adapt new citizenship skills to protect ourselves from weaponized fake news. Another recommendation is to teach people about the tactic of sewing doubt through disinformation. Where ‘‘typ-ical cues for credibility have been hi-jacked,’’ understanding the tactics will help inoculate people against being taken in by the scheme. The researchers reported: 
Participants read about how the tobacco industry in the 1970s used ‘‘fake experts’’— people with no scientific background, or doc-tors and scientists with beliefs unrepresenta-tive of the rest of the scientific community— to create the illusion of an ongoing debate about smoking’s negative health con-sequences. Participants who read about the ‘‘fake experts’’ type of argument were less affected when later reading a passage on cli-mate change that quoted a scientist who re-ferred to ‘‘climate change . . . [as] still hotly debated among scientists.’’ 
Other authors argued that a com-prehensive approach will be needed to debunk climate denial. They note that ‘‘climate denial typically masquerades as ‘pro-science’ skepticism and paints the actual science of climate change as being ‘corrupt’ or ‘post-moderate.’ It is possible that those carefully crafted forms of misinformation will require continued human debunking as well as increased media literacy.’’ Last, there is a role for the media. ‘‘At present,’’ authors point out, ‘‘many representatives of think tanks and corporate front groups appear in the media without revealing their af-filiations and conflicts of interest. This practice must be tightened, and rig-orous disclosure of all affiliations and interests must take center stage in media reporting.’’ Again, once you out the participants and show the scheme, people can figure it out for themselves. Recommended media reforms include a ‘‘counter fake news editor [to] high-light disinformation’’ or a ‘‘[r]ating system for disinformation’’ or ‘‘a Disinformation Charter.’’ Science itself is beginning to exam-ine the growing threat of misinforma-tion in American society, which is ap-propriate since science is so often the target of weaponized misinformation campaigns. More and more, real science must face up to the fact that a new predator roams its territory and adapt new defenses against this pred-ator. The predators may not want to defeat all science. They probably still wants to use their iPhones and drive cars and live in safe buildings and enjoy products and services that science gives us. But they do seek to defeat whatever science challenges the economic interests that fund them. As I said at the start, the Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cog-nition is not exactly grocery-store checkout-line reading. Few Americans have read this volume. I am probably the only one in Congress. But its mes-sage is important, and that is why I came to the floor to share it today. Campaigns of lies are dangerous things, like an evil virus in the body politic, and if we want to be a healthy country, we will have to defeat the weaponized disinformation virus. Cur-ing our body politic of the ongoing fraud of climate denial would be a very good start. I note the deputy majority leader is here on the floor. I apologize for con-tinuing my speech while he is here. I appreciate his productive role in the happy events that I described at the be-ginning of these remarks. Before the Senator from Texas takes the floor, I ask unanimous consent that the appendix I referenced be print-ed in the RECORD .

Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
f 
NOMINATION OF BRETT KAVANAUGH Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as the world knows by now, yesterday we had another hearing on the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to be a mem-ber of the U.S. Supreme Court. It was necessary to do so because an allega-tion had been made by Dr. Christine Ford to the ranking member, our friend Senator F
EINSTEIN from Cali-fornia, dated July 30, but because Dr. Ford requested confidentiality and she wanted to remain anonymous, none of this was brought to anybody’s atten-tion until some time after the judge’s original confirmation hearing oc-curred. The judge visited with 60-plus Members of the Senate, including the ranking member, and it was never mentioned to him. No questions were asked about it. Contrary to her wishes, Dr. Ford was thrust into the national spotlight. She said she didn’t agree to have her letter released to the press. She did not con-sent to having her identity revealed. She did not want to be part of what has turned into a three-ring circus. But, once there, when she asked to tell her story, we consented to doing that, and yesterday we heard from Dr. Ford as well as Judge Kavanaugh. Judge Kavanaugh asked to be heard to clear his good name and speak di-rectly to the American people, and he did so forcefully yesterday. Now we have heard Dr. Ford’s story, and we have heard Judge Kavanaugh’s rebuttal. What we have learned is that there is no evidence to corroborate Dr. Ford’s allegation. All of the people she said were there on the occasion in question said they have no memory of it or it didn’t happen—no corrobora-tion. As we all watched Judge Kavanaugh defend his personal integrity in front of the Nation, we saw his righteous indig-nation. He choked back his tears and aimed his fury not at Dr. Ford—none of us did that—but, rather, at this unfair confirmation process, which, frankly, is an embarrassment to me and should be an embarrassment to the U.S. Sen-ate. To take somebody who has re-quested confidentiality and leak that information to the press and then to thrust her into the national spotlight under these circumstances, I think, is an abuse of power. But having made that request, once she was in the spot-light, we felt it was very important to treat her respectfully and to listen to her story. I told anybody who would listen that I wanted to treat Dr. Ford the same way I would expect that my mother or my sister or my daughters would be treated under similar circumstances. Conversely, I thought that we should treat Judge Kavanaugh fairly, too, just as we would our father, our brother, or our son. In other words, this is more than just about Dr. Ford; this is about Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh. We heard the judge respond with quite a bit of righteous indignation, as I said, talking about his family having been exposed to the vilest sorts of threats, including his two young daughters. I know it was a hard pill for many of our Democratic colleagues to swallow to hear the truth of what this terrible process has resulted in, both for Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford, but too much was on the line for Judge Kavanaugh to withhold his defense of his good name. After all, his reputation is on the line, his family is on the line, and his family, including his wife and his two daughters, are all caught up in what must be a miserable experience. Still, I am glad we held the hearing, and I am grateful to Rachel Mitchell for participating and asking her prob-ing questions. Some have questioned: Why would a Senator yield to a professional in the sexual abuse field to ask questions of Dr. Ford? Well, it was simply because we wanted to depoliticize that process and to treat Dr. Ford with respect and gently, recognizing that somehow, somewhere, she has been exposed to some terrible trauma. But it was im-portant for Ms. Mitchell to ask ques-tions and to get answers to those ques-tions so we could do our job. I appreciate Chairman G
RASSLEY for doing his best to keep order in running the committee efficiently, as much as that is possible. At the first hearing, after Senators would speak over each other and would endlessly make mo-tions that were out of order—when one Senator said, ‘‘I am breaking the con-fidentiality rules,’’ I said, ‘‘This seems like a hearing by mob rule,’’ not with the kind of demeanor and civility that you would expect from the U.S. Senate. I think Chairman G
RASSLEY has done the best anybody could do under dif-ficult circumstances. As I said, this hearing was not easy for either Dr. Ford or for Judge Kavanaugh. It has been painful for ev-erybody involved. Thankfully, we are much closer to a resolution on this nomination. Today, there was a markup in the Judiciary Committee, and I am glad we were able to pass that nomination out of the committee to the Senate floor. Some are saying that we are moving too fast. To them, I would say that it is pretty clear what the objective of the opponents of the nomination is. Their objective is delay, delay, delay. Some have said that their goal is to delay this confirmation past the mid-term election, hope that the election turns out well for them, and essen-tially defeat the nomination and keep the Supreme Court vacancy open until President Trump leaves office. First, there was the paper chase; they needed more documents or, per-haps, they said there were too many. But the question I always had is this: If you have already announced your oppo-sition to the nominee, why do you need more information? Unless, of course, you are open to changing your mind— but it is clear that is not the game that they are engaging in here. Now there are those who demand that the background investigation be opened into two new allegations that appeared following Dr. Ford’s. Today, the majority leader and some of our colleagues have announced an agree-ment to extend the background inves-tigation for up to another week for these witnesses to be interviewed by the FBI. But I would note that the most recent allegations are so absurd, are so fantastic that not even the New York Times would run a story about Judge Kavanaugh’s time in college as reported by Ms. Ramirez. They worked hard to try to corroborate her story by interviewing dozens of potential wit-nesses. None of them would confirm or corroborate Ms. Ramirez’s story, but they did find, as Ms. Ramirez was talk-ing to one of those individuals who was interviewed, where she admitted that she may have misidentified Judge Kavanaugh. In other words, she admit-ted that she may have the wrong guy— not credible, not serious, but dan-gerous. It is dangerous in the sense that some of our colleagues take the posi-tion that all you need to do is listen to an accusation, and that is enough to make up your mind. You don’t need to listen to the other side. As Judge Kavanaugh said, in Dr. Ford’s case, it didn’t happen; he wasn’t there. If you listen to just one side of the argument, I guess it does make making up your mind a lot easier because you don’t ac-tually have to think about it and you don’t have to think about what a fair process is in order to decide whose ar-guments you believe or whether some-body has met the burden of showing evidence that their claim is actually true. This has become so ridiculous that the newest claims made by a young woman named Julie Swetnick, who is represented by Stormy Daniels’ lawyer, are riddled with holes. Why would a

woman continue to go to parties with high schoolers when she was in college, and why in the world would she go to not 1, not 2, but 10 of these alleged drug- and alcohol-infused parties where gang rape occurred? It is just out-rageous—incredible. We have encouraged all of these indi-viduals, no matter how incredible the allegation may be, to work with the Judiciary Committee and submit to an interview with the bipartisan represen-tation of the Judiciary Committee there. This is standard operating proce-dure for the Judiciary Committee. The basic background investigation is done by the FBI. But they are not inves-tigating a crime; it is a background in-vestigation in which they take notes on their conversations with witnesses. They don’t tell you which witness to believe or what conclusions to draw from that. They send that to the Judi-ciary Committee, and the Judiciary Committee follows up with additional questions, if necessary. Lying to the FBI—just like lying to the com-mittee—is actually a crime punishable by a felony, so both carry serious con-sequences and a serious warning to those who might try to lie their way into a background check. What is so ridiculous about where we find ourselves is that in addition to Dr. Ford’s confidential letter to the rank-ing member being released against her wishes and without her consent, con-tributing to this circus atmosphere as we continue to try to investigate some of these claims, the Democratic profes-sional staff have been refusing to co-operate or participate, even as they continue to make more and more de-mands. It is clear that their appetite for delay is insatiable, and delay is their ultimate goal. For those who continue to say that they want the FBI involved, I will tell them that the FBI has been and is in-volved. It has conducted its back-ground investigations just as it did on the six previous occasions when Judge Kavanaugh was being vetted for other positions within the Federal Govern-ment. You heard that right: Judge Kavanaugh has been through six FBI background checks, and none of these matters have come up previously. What we were doing yesterday with the hearing was part of our job, which is to continue the investigation. I think people have a very narrow idea of what an investigation entails. It is not just a background check by the FBI. It is the interviews by the professional staff on the Judiciary Committee, and those are the hearings like the one we had yesterday, all day, hearing from Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford. That is our job; that is our constitutional role, to provide advice and consent. Plus, if our colleagues across the aisle were really interested in a back-ground investigation of Dr. Ford’s com-plaints in a confidential manner, as she requested, they could have requested that be done and the results reported to us in a closed setting. What hap-pened to Dr. Ford is inexcusable. To have a Senator sit on this allegation and refuse to turn it in to the com-mittee so it could be investigated in a confidential way that would have pro-tected her anonymity and would have allowed the committee to question both Judge Kavanaugh and her—that didn’t happen, by design, perhaps be-cause the goal really wasn’t about giv-ing Judge Kavanaugh or Dr. Ford a fair hearing. It was about delaying this confirmation vote. When Judge Kavanaugh was inter-viewed about a week or so ago and again yesterday, he talked about a fair process—in other words, hearing from both sides of an argument. But under our constitutional system, if you are accused of a crime—and, believe me, Judge Kavanaugh has been accused of multiple crimes—you are entitled to the presumption of innocence. In other words, there is a burden to come for-ward with evidence to justify and sup-port an accusation, and if you don’t do that, your accusation is not enough to meet that burden. Usually what we have are corrobo-rating witnesses—other people present at the time who can corroborate what the allegation is. But all of the wit-nesses who have been identified by Dr. Ford cannot corroborate or confirm her allegation. They say that they have no memory of that or it simply didn’t hap-pen. Even the Bible talks about the im-portance of corroborating witnesses. I didn’t find this, but I vaguely remem-bered it, and someone on my staff pointed out Deuteronomy 19:15: 
One witness is not enough to convict any-one accused of any crime or offense they may have committed. A matter must be es-tablished by the testimony of two or three witnesses. 
So this is a rule of ancient origin dat-ing back to the Old Testament. That is what we are talking about today. When Dr. Ford comes with an accusation 35 or 36 years after the fact, and no one else can confirm her story, it is not enough to carry the day. The other thing we need to be wary of is false choices. This is not a matter of he said, she said. Someone said this is a matter of he said, she said, they said: Dr. Ford said one thing; Judge Kavanaugh said another; the so-called corroborating witnesses said another. But what they said did not corroborate Dr. Ford’s story. Just the contrary, they confirmed Judge Kavanaugh’s de-nial of any participation in anything remotely like that which Dr. Ford al-leges. So after 36 years, as Ms. Mitchell was able to develop, we know, for perhaps obvious reasons, that Dr. Ford’s ac-count has some inconsistencies and some gaps regarding the timing, loca-tion, and details regarding these events. I think we need to listen to her. We need to take her story into ac-count. As I said, I want to treat her the same way I would want my mother, sis-ter, or daughters treated under similar circumstances. But we can’t ignore the inconsistencies and the gap in her story and the fact that she has tried to tell it 36 years after the fact. We also can’t ignore the full-throated defense and the heartfelt denial of Judge Kavanaugh or the testimony that none of this is in the character of Judge Kavanaugh. We have heard that from people dating all the way back to 1982. Indeed, Ms. Mitchell—a profes-sional prosecutor, prosecuting sex crimes in Arizona—told us last night that with her more than two decades of experience and the kind of case brought forward by Ms. Ford, she would not file those charges against a defendant because there simply is not enough evidence. In fact, the only wit-nesses identified by Dr. Ford denied the event actually occurred. As a matter of fact, she said that she couldn’t even get a search warrant or arrest warrant in a case like this. If you can’t identify the time or the place, you are not even going to be able to get a search war-rant. You certainly can’t show prob-able cause, which is required by law. So here is where we are. If the allega-tions we discussed during yesterday’s hearing remain uncorroborated and unproven, if it never came up in the context of six Federal background checks, if it has been explicitly denied by the nominee, if the three alleged eyewitnesses have no recollection of it or say that it didn’t happen, if it con-flicts with the account of some 65 women who knew the nominee to be-have honorably in high school and countless more women who have known and interacted with Judge Kavanaugh since—the timing seems unusual, perhaps even politically moti-vated. And if our colleagues across the aisle chose not to act on this informa-tion once presented but rather to spring it on us and Judge Kavanaugh after the fact, there is no reason, in my mind, that we should not move forward with the nomination because we have seen what happens. This is not just about Dr. Ford; it is about the subsequent allegations by Ms. Ramirez and additional allegations by Ms. Swetnick, each more salacious, each more incredible, and each more out of character with what we know about Brett Kavanaugh. And it is going to continue. The longer this nomina-tion is unresolved, there are going to be more and more people coming out of the woodwork to make accusations that are uncorroborated and unprovable. You can imagine what this does to Judge Kavanaugh and his fam-ily as he is left hanging like a pinata, where people just come by and take an-other whack at him and his family. We have to move forward. We can’t establish a precedent by which a nomi-nee can be derailed by a mere accusa-tion that is unproven. We are never going to get good people to agree to serve in these important offices, and we can’t allow the nomination process to be a drive-by character assassina-tion that is unproven.

need in order to shoot down any figure at any time would be innuendo—innu-endo, speculation, suspicion, unproven allegations, nothing more. We are not going to let that happen. We are not going to establish that precedent. It would be bad for the Senate. It would be bad for the United States of Amer-ica. Please don’t misunderstand me. I am glad Dr. Ford had a chance to have her say. We owed her that much. I know it took some courage, and it is a re-minder to all Americans that victims can and should be heard. As I said, I myself have two daughters. We all have a mother. Some are fortunate to have sisters or a spouse. This can be a very personal matter to every one of us. Yet we all know that all of us have fathers, and many of us have brothers. Some have husbands and sons. In other words, my point is, if this kind of uncorroborated allegation would seem so manipulated in exploiting vulner-able people who made accusations like this and we tolerate that, I think it will forever poison the confirmation process and discourage good people from coming forward. We must always be fair to both the victims and those who stand accused. It has to be a two-way street. I have supported Judge Kavanaugh’s nomina-tion because I have known him since the year 2000. In my experience, he has always been an upstanding and cer-tainly he is an incredibly well-qualified individual. We have heard everybody—from his fellow lawyers to his law clerks, to women he has worked with, to former Presidents of the United States—say that. We know he has an incredible record on the DC Circuit Court of Ap-peals, where many of his decisions have been affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court. I know he will judge fairly and carefully. I believe he belongs on the Nation’s highest bench. In a few more days, after a few more delays, we will finally vote to put him there and say enough with the games. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-pore. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. M

DARK MONEY RULE Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am sub-mitting two letters into the C
ONGRES -
SIONAL RECORD in order to clarify the application of the Congressional Re-view Act, CRA, to the recent rule Rev. Proc. 2018–38, issued by the Treasury Department and the IRS, to dramati-cally weaken the disclosure rules for large contributions to certain tax-ex-empt organizations, including many that engage in political activity, what I and others call the dark money rule. In doing so, I also want to take the op-portunity to comment on the rule itself and on the inappropriate and ir-responsible approach that the adminis-tration is taking to the application of the CRA to the dark money rule. By way of background, in 1971, as part of a general effort to improve the ability of the IRS to assure that tax- exempt organizations are complying with the tax and election laws, the Treasury Department promulgated a legislative regulation requiring certain tax-exempt organizations to disclose to the IRS, as part of their annual filing, the identity of those who contribute $5,000 or more to the organization. This information is not made available to the public, except in certain cases, but it is can be used by the IRS, State tax administrators, and other Federal agencies. In recent years, this disclosure re-quirement has become controversial. Some, particularly conservative groups, have called for the rule to be repealed in an attempt to keep donor information out of the hands of State tax administrators and law enforce-ment. Others have urged that the dis-closure rules be strengthened. I am one of them. Following the 2010 Citizens United decision, more and more dark money has flooded into secretive tax- exempt organizations and into election campaigns in the form of such things as anonymous ‘‘issue ads.’’ I have urged that the contributor information be made available to the public and, further, that the IRS improve its appli-cation of the rules designed to prevent tax-exempt organizations from engag-ing in excessive political campaign ac-tivity under false pretenses of ‘‘social welfare.’’ For example, I have been par-ticularly concerned about reports that a group that is tax exempt under Tax Code section 501(c)(4) that is associated with the National Rifle Association, which has engaged in extensive polit-ical activity, may have received large contributions from foreign sources. In the midst of all of this con-troversy, on July 16, without any pub-lic notice and comment or any con-sultation with me as ranking Demo-cratic member of the Finance Com-mittee, the Treasury Department and the IRS issued Rev. Proc. 2018–38, which invokes a narrow provision that allows the Treasury Secretary to waive particular reporting requirements in appropriate situations, to effectively repeal the entire 1971 regulation requir-ing the disclosure of large contribu-tions. Perhaps coincidentally and cer-tainly ironically, this was done late in the evening of the day in which the Justice Department arrested an alleged Russian agent, Maria Butina, for at-tempting to influence American polit-ical discourse through a ‘‘gun rights organization,’’ later revealed to be the National Rifle Association, a 501(c)(4) dark money political organization. This was an outrage. It was terrible policy and a terrible process. As I said at the time, the political brazenness of this action shocks the conscience. At a time when the U.S. intelligence com-munity is warning that foreign actors are actively working to interfere in American elections, the Trump admin-istration has decided to tie the hands of the only Federal agency with visi-bility into financial flows of foreign funds into dark money political organi-zations. When the administration proposed the dark money rule, it submitted the rule to Congress for review under the CRA, which allows Congress to dis-approve rules after they have been issued. The administration’s submis-sion to Congress explicitly states it was a ‘‘Submission of Federal Rules under the Congressional Review Act.’’ Senator TESTER and I were determined to invoke this process in order to over-turn the dark money rule. There was, however, a procedural problem. The CRA includes a ‘‘clock,’’ limiting the period for challenging a new rule, and, under the terms of the CRA, that clock begins on the later of the date the rule is submitted to Con-gress, and the date it is published in the Federal Register, ‘‘if so published.’’ In this case, apparently for the first time, we were dealing with a rule that had been submitted to Congress for re-view under the CRA but not published in the Federal Register because this is the sort of material that the IRS pub-lishes in the Internal Revenue Bulletin IRB, rather than in the Federal Reg-ister. This created a technical question about how to apply the CRA time clock to the IRS rule. To be clear, the ques-tion was not whether the CRA applied to the dark money rule, but rather, when the clock for congressional re-view began. After consulting with the Parliamen-tarian, who advised that the CRA proc-ess would be clarified if the IRS would confirm, in writing, that the rule would not be published in the Federal Register, I sent Acting IRS Commis-sioner David Kautter a brief letter ask-ing him to do so. This seemed to me to be a very straightforward request. The IRS’s own internal procedure manual makes clear that matters that are issued as ‘‘revenue procedures’’ are published in the IRB rather than the Federal Register. Further, an IRS offi-cial had informally confirmed by email that would be the case here. On top of that, the dark money rule was in fact published in the IRB on July 30. I ask unanimous consent that my Au-gust 21, 2018, letter be printed in the R

under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), Rev. Proc. 2018–38, which modifies the infor-mation to be reported to the IRS by certain organizations exempt from tax under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the CRA, the period for potential Congressional review begins on the later of the date of submission to Congress or publi-cation in the Federal Register, ‘‘if so pub-lished.’’ My understanding is that revenue procedures are not published in the Federal Register but instead are published in the In-ternal Revenue Bulletin. In light of this, it would facilitate the Con-gressional review process if the IRS would confirm in writing that the IRS will not sub-mit Rev. Proc. 2018–39 for publication in the Federal Register. I would appreciate it if you would do so. Please call me or have a member of your staff contact Tiffany Smith or Mike Evans of the Finance Committee Democratic staff if you have any questions.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, my let-ter went unanswered for almost 5 weeks. Eventually, the Parliamen-tarian indicated to both Democratic and Republican staff that she was pre-pared to allow Senator T
ESTER and me to move forward with a disapproval resolution under the CRA without an IRS response to my letter, so that we would not lose our right to challenge the rule on a timely basis. Based on this, on Monday, September 24, Sen-ator T
ESTER and I submitted our dis-approval resolution, S.J. Res. 64. That same day, I finally received a reply from Acting Commissioner Kautter. In it, he confirmed, at long last, the ele-mentary proposition that the dark money rule would not be published in the Federal Register. In addition, he went on to discuss an issue I had not raised in my original letter. He stated that, despite the fact that the adminis-tration had formally submitted the rule to the House and Senate for review under the CRA, understanding now that Senator T
ESTER and I intended to challenge the rule under the CRA, the Treasury Department intended to re-verse its previous decision and argue that Rev. Proc. 2018–38 was somehow not subject to congressional review. There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows: 
DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY , I
NTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE , Washington, DC, September 24, 2018. Hon. R
ONWYDEN , Ranking Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. D
EARSENATOR WYDEN : Thank you for your inquiry regarding whether the IRS will sub-mit Revenue Procedure 2018–38 for publica-tion in the Federal Register. Revenue procedures are not published in the Federal Register; rather, they are pub-lished in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (IRB). Revenue Procedure 2018–38 was pub-lished in IRB 2018–34 and will not be pub-lished in the Federal Register. Not all revenue procedures, including many transmitted to Congress using the form prescribed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), meet the definition of a rule under the Congressional Review Act (CRA). We define a revenue procedure as ‘‘an official statement of a procedure by the Service that affects the rights or duties of taxpayers or other members of the public under the Internal Revenue Code, related statutes, tax treaties, and regulations, or in-formation that, although not necessarily af-fecting the rights and duties of the public, should be a matter of public knowledge.’’ Chief Counsel Directives Manual (CCDM) section 32.2.2.3.2 (emphasis added). Proce-dural rules that do not substantially affect the rights or obligations of the public are not subject to the CRA. See 5 U.S.C. Section 804(3)(C). We generally submit revenue procedures to Congress and to the Government Account-ability Office (GAO) out of an abundance of caution and in the interest of keeping Con-gress fully informed. This longstanding prac-tice serves two goals. First, it allows Con-gress to consider whether a revenue proce-dure is subject to the CRA by requesting ad-vice from GAO. Second, if a revenue proce-dure meets the definition of a rule under the CRA, the consequences of failing to submit it when required are significant. Because rules are effective only after submission to Con-gress, a revenue procedure that is later deemed to be a rule would not be effective if it had not been submitted following the CRA. Consequently, our submission of a rev-enue procedure using the standard CRA form prescribed by OMB does not necessarily indi-cate that we have determined the revenue procedure is subject to the CRA. We do not believe Revenue Procedure 2018– 38 is a ‘‘rule’’ within the meaning of the CRA, and we are consulting with GAO on this matter. See 5 U.S.C. Section 804(3)(C). In this revenue procedure, we exercised our dis-cretion under existing regulations to limit our receipt of personally identifiable donor information that is not necessary for effi-cient tax administration. The revenue proce-dure did not alter the substantive standards or criteria that apply to tax exempt organi-zations, nor did it alter the requirement that organizations maintain donor information and submit the information to the IRS upon request. The revenue procedure imposed no new substantive burdens and in no way lim-ited public access to return information that was previously open to public inspection. For these reasons, we believe Revenue Procedure 2018–38 is exempt from the CRA. I hope this information is helpful. If you have questions, please contact me, or a mem-ber of your staff may contact Leonard Oursler, Director, Legislative Affairs. Sincerely, DAVID J. K AUTTER , Acting Commissioner. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, acting Commissioner Kautter’s response is deeply troubling, for several reasons. First, why did it take so long? Every bureaucracy has its problems, but al-most 5 weeks, on a time-sensitive mat-ter, the answer to which should be clear in 5 minutes? As I said on the Senate floor last week: ‘‘It looks to me like the administration has a policy on their hands that they know is cor-rupt—that they know is undemocratic. And so they’re playing hide the ball. Because the more the public hears about this dark money rule, the less they like it.’’ Further, the argument Acting Com-missioner Kautter makes in the letter is utter nonsense. In the first place, he mischaracterizes the CRA, in a way that would render the entire law un-workable. For over 20 years, here is how the CRA has worked: If the admin-istration submits something to Con-gress under the CRA, that is that; it is subject to congressional review under the terms of the CRA. In the Senate, that means the clock starts, and the period for the consideration of a dis-approval resolution begins. If, on the other hand, the administration does not submit a matter under the CRA, but a Senator or Representative be-lieves that the matter nevertheless should be subject to the CRA, that Sen-ator or Congressman can ask the Gov-ernment Accountability Office to re-view whether the CRA applies. This has happened about 20 times since 1996. Congress has never required the GAO to opine on the applicability of the CRA to a rule formally submitted by an agency to the Congress for review under the CRA. In Acting Commis-sioner Kautter’s letter, he fabricates out of whole cloth a new requirement for congressional review, which runs counter to precedent established over the past two decades. Acting Commissioner Kautter takes the position that the administration’s submission of the rule under the CRA is not dispositive. It is, instead, just a starting point, to, as he writes, ‘‘allow[] Congress to consider whether a revenue procedure is subject to the CRA by requesting advice from GAO.’’ This is unprecedented because all pre-vious requests to GAO related to mat-ters that had not been submitted under the CRA. It is inconsistent with the plain text of the CRA and with long-standing practice, in which we only re-sort to a GAO opinion for matters that have not already been submitted under the CRA. It also is completely unwork-able because it would require GAO to review every rule submitted under the CRA, to confirm that it is indeed sub-ject to the CRA. Said another way, it would require the Senate to look be-hind all 4,271 rules submitted by agen-cies to the Senate in this Congress under the CRA to determine if the CRA, in fact, applied. We cannot have ‘‘do-overs’’ here. Second, Acting Commissioner Kautter’s position is inconsistent with administration practice. In submitting the dark money rule to the Senate, the administration was not simply trying to be courteous and transparent, mak-ing sure the Senate was aware of the latest developments at the IRS. It was, instead, complying with the CRA, based on a determination that the rule was subject to the CRA. This is reflected in the process estab-lished in the Internal Revenue Manual, IRM. One section of the IRM relates to ‘‘Congressional Review of Rules.’’ After describing the CRA general rule and three exceptions, the IRM says, ‘‘Rev-enue rulings, revenue procedures, no-tices, and announcements that are rules under the [CRA] must be sub-mitted for congressional review before they can become effective. Whether a revenue ruling, revenue procedure, no-tice, or announcement is considered a

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6382 September 28, 2018 
rule subject to reporting is determined on a case-by-case basis. Ministerial revenue rulings and revenue proce-dures; notices and announcements re-lating to error corrections, personnel matters, or proposed rules; and press releases generally will not be consid-ered rules under [the CRA].’’ Thus, the IRS’s own process requires the agency to determine, on a case-by- case basis, whether a document issued by the IRS constitutes a rule for pur-pose of the CRA. The IRS in fact exer-cises judgment about whether to sub-mit a revenue procedure as a rule under the CRA: As of September 10, the IRS had issued 45 revenue procedures in 2018, only 27 of which were sub-mitted to the Senate. Specifically, in this case, on July 26, over the signature of the Chief of the IRS Publications and Regulations Branch, the IRS and the Treasury Department submitted, to Vice President Pence, as President of the Senate, a copy of Rev. Proc. 2018–38, entitled a Submission of Fed-eral Rules under the Congressional Re-view Act. The submission was docketed in the Senate as EC–6097, and it was re-ferred to the Finance Committee. Finally, even if the administration had not submitted the dark money rule under the CRA, there is no question the rule is subject to the CRA. The CRA applies to rules as defined under the Administrative Procedure Act, which states in relevant part that a rule is ‘‘the whole or part of an agency state-ment of general . . . applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy,’’ with three exceptions: rules of par-ticular applicability; rules relating to agency management or personnel; and rules of agency organization, proce-dure, or practice that does not substan-tially affect the rights or obligations of nonagency parties. The dark money rule is clearly a statement of general applicability and future effect. The only real question, then, is whether it is subject to one of the exceptions, particularly the excep-tion for ‘‘rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice that [do] not substantially affect the rights or obli-gations of non-agency parties.’’ Here, it is clear that the rule has a substantial effect on nonagency par-ties. Under the provisions of IRC sec-tion 6103, State tax administrators may obtain from IRS tax-exempt donor information for State tax administra-tion purposes. As a result of Rev. Proc. 2018–38, State tax administrators will no longer have the right to obtain donor information from the IRS, un-dermining States’ ability to enforce tax-exempt rules on organizations op-erating within their borders. Further, as the Treasury Department clearly stated in a July 16 press release, Rev. Proc. 2018–38 will reduce the burden of disclosure and filing obligations of tax- exempt organizations because they no longer will be required to disclose the identifies of large donors. This is a big deal. It will significantly inhibit IRS enforcement efforts, and it will make it easier for dark money to continue to flood in. Indeed, that is why so many groups have been urging that the dis-closure requirement be repealed. As a final note, the IRS may argue that repeal of the disclosure rule is in-significant because the IRS doesn’t systematically cross-check this data against other sources of tax informa-tion. This is a large part of the problem of IRS failing to enforce existing laws relating to political activity of tax-ex-empt organizations. To my mind, the IRS should be using this information in order to maintain the integrity of our tax-exempt rules and election laws. If, for example, an organization named Russian Oligarchs, LLC made large contributions to a tax-exempt organi-zation, it seems to me that this is something the IRS should want to know. At a time when foreign actors are actively attempting to interfere in American elections, law enforcement, the IRS, and State tax administrators need to have visibility into the finan-cial flows of political nonprofits. The argument that we should no longer col-lect this information because the IRS is failing to use the information to en-force the law gets things precisely backward. I urge my colleagues to support Sen-ator T
ESTER and me as we work to overturn this outrageous dark money rule.

MALNUTRITION AWARENESS WEEK Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of this week as Malnutrition Awareness Week. Malnutrition Awareness Week is a multi-organizational, multipronged campaign that aims to educate healthcare professionals on how to identify and treat malnutrition, en-courage patients to discuss their nutri-tion status with their healthcare pro-viders, and increase awareness of nutri-tion’s role in patient recovery. While we know malnutrition can se-verely impact patients’ health out-comes, we do not currently know the full extent of malnutrition plaguing our senior population. This is because national health surveys and indicators do not include screening measures for malnutrition. National surveys and in-dicators are crucial not only for identi-fying key issues, such as malnutrition, but also for shaping public health pro-grams and guiding healthcare profes-sionals. By fully understanding the health problem, we can refine these tools to better address health issues af-fecting older adults. Similarly, older adults and their families need guidance on how to meet seniors’ unique nutrition needs. Na-tional dietary guidelines, developed every 5 years by the Departments of Health and Human Services and of Ag-riculture, provide valuable information to the public in regard to a healthy diet. These guidelines are examples of Federal resources that could be tai-lored to reflect the nutritional needs of specific populations, such as older adults. Since malnutrition can lead to great-er risk of chronic disease, frailty, dis-ability, and increases in health care costs, it is important to properly iden-tify cases and provide adequate inter-ventions, even as people transition across care settings. To strive toward this goal, we must consider options within the healthcare system and our Federal programs to improve care and nutritional support for older adults. This week is an important oppor-tunity to remember that the nutri-tional challenges facing people of all ages, and I hope my colleagues will join me in working to understand and ad-dress these challenges. f 
NATIONAL RICE MONTH Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to honor the more than 125,000 hard-working men and women who work in America’s rice in-dustry. September is National Rice Month, and it is also the start of our domestic rice harvest. This year, roughly 23 billion pounds of rice will be grown on 3 million acres of farmland. 85 percent of the rice eaten in America comes from just 6 States: Arkansas, California, Mississippi, Missouri, Texas, and my home State of Lou-isiana. Rice isn’t just delicious in jambalaya or seafood gumbo; it is an indispen-sable part of Louisiana’s economy. The 4,500 members of the Louisiana rice in-dustry generate more than $700 million in economic benefits for the State. These small businesses not only put food on the table of America’s families, but they also employ tens of thousands of workers. Altogether, America’s rice crop has a $34 billion impact on our na-tional economy. Rice farmers are also careful stew-ards of our Nation’s precious natural resources. Over the past 20 years, rice farmers have been able to increase their yields by as much as 50 percent. They have achieved this while using less land, less water, and less energy. American rice shines as a bright exam-ple of sustainable agriculture and the benefits of effective agricultural re-search. America was born on a farm. The im-portance of farming to the U.S. econ-omy cannot be overstated; agriculture provides jobs for nearly 1 in 7 Ameri-cans. While rice is a valuable export, I am pleased to say that nearly all of our domestic rice crop is consumed right here. For these and many other rea-sons, I am proud to celebrate National Rice Month and the world’s most pop-ular grain. I also want to extend my heartfelt support and gratitude to all American rice farmers, particularly those in the great State of Louisiana. Keep up the good work.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING THE ANCIENT AND HONORABLE ARTILLERY COM-PANY OF MASSACHUSETTS ∑Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, today I would like to honor the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Mas-sachusetts—the oldest chartered mili-tary organization in the Western Hemi-sphere—on its 381st Fall Field Day Tour of Duty. Its charter was signed in 1638 by John Winthrop, then-Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The Ancient and Honorables continue to serve the Commonwealth as a vital part of its militia, subject to the direc-tion of the adjutant general of the Mas-sachusetts National Guard. Although the Ancient and Honorables have long served as the honor guard for the Governor of the Commonwealth, they continue to play an integral role in the State’s civic rit-uals. Among their responsibilities, they participate in the inaugurals of State constitutional officers, the an-nual State of the Commonwealth ad-dress, and the yearly celebration of the Constitution of the United States from the historic State house in the heart of old Boston, but most importantly, they stand ready to assist in times of peril or emergency. May the Ancient and Honorable Ar-tillery Company of Massachusetts long continue its role in fostering, sup-porting, and preserving the civic life of the city of Boston, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the United States of America. The Ancients serve as world ambassadors of the United States, where, on their Fall Field Day Tour of Duty, they pay their respects to fallen soldiers of all nations who have paid the ultimate sacrifice in de-fense of freedom. Today I would like to recognize the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Com-pany of Massachusetts for their civic responsibilities, patriotic duties, and community service. May they continue their proud traditions for many years to come.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. REED (for himself, Ms. C

ASEY ): S. 3530. A bill to reauthorize the Mu-seum and Library Services Act; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by a group of mem-bers on both sides of the aisle and in both bodies in introducing legislation today to renew the law that expands the reach of libraries and museums and enables them to better serve their com-munities. These vital institutions edu-cate, inform, engage, and connect peo-ple from all walks of life. Our legislation, the Museum and Li-brary Services Act of 2018, is similar to legislation I also introduced on a bipar-tisan basis in December. That legisla-tion was developed with input and in-sights from the library and museum communities. Since that time, it be-came apparent in the library commu-nity that a vital change was needed to ensure that funding increases for the State formula grant program would be more broadly shared by States around the Nation. Under the current formula, smaller States have seen little in the way of new funding even as funding sig-nificantly increased over the last few years. The last time we addressed this issue was in 2003, and an update, while ensuring no State would lose funding, is needed today so that more commu-nities can benefit from increased in-vestments in our Federal library pro-gram. I am grateful our revised bill has the support of the American Library Asso-ciation, the American Alliance of Mu-seums, and many of their affiliated as-sociations. I thank Senators COLLINS , G
ILLIBRAND , MURKOWSKI , and our many colleagues who are joining us in intro-ducing this bill today. I look forward to working with them and the entire Senate on moving this bill swiftly to passage.

SENATE RESOLUTION 662—DESIG-NATING SEPTEMBER 2018 AS ‘‘CAMPUS FIRE SAFETY MONTH’’ Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. C
ARPER ) submitted the following reso-lution; which was considered and agreed to: 
S. R ES. 662 Whereas campus-related housing fires at colleges in Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Penn-sylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, D.C., and other States have tragically cut short the lives of several young people; Whereas, since January 2000, at least 175 people, including students, parents, and chil-dren, have died in campus-related fires; Whereas approximately 87 percent of those deaths occurred in off-campus residences; Whereas a majority of college students in the United States live in an off-campus resi-dence; Whereas many fatal fires have occurred in a building in which the occupants had com-promised or disabled the fire safety systems; Whereas automatic fire alarm systems and smoke alarms provide the early warning of a fire that is necessary for occupants of a building and the fire department to take ap-propriate action; Whereas automatic fire sprinkler systems are a highly effective method of controlling or extinguishing a fire in its early stages, thus protecting the lives of the building oc-cupants; Whereas many college students live in an off-campus residence, fraternity or sorority housing, or a residence hall that is not ade-quately protected by an automatic fire sprin-kler system and an automatic fire alarm sys-tem or adequate smoke alarm; Whereas fire safety education is an effec-tive method of reducing the occurrence of fires and the resulting loss of life and prop-erty damage; Whereas college students do not routinely receive effective fire safety education while in college; Whereas educating young people in the United States about the importance of fire safety is vital to help ensure that young peo-ple engage in fire-safe behavior during col-lege and after college; and Whereas developing a generation of adults who practice fire safety may significantly reduce future loss of life from fires: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate— (1) designates September 2018 as ‘‘Campus Fire Safety Month’’; and (2) encourages administrators of institu-tions of higher education and municipalities across the United States— (A) to provide educational programs about fire safety to all college students in Sep-tember and throughout the school year; (B) to evaluate the level of fire safety being provided in both on-campus and off- campus student housing; and (C) to ensure fire-safe living environments through fire safety education, installation of fire suppression and detection systems and smoke alarms, and the development and en-forcement of applicable codes relating to fire safety. f SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLU-TION 49—PROVIDING FOR A COR-RECTION IN THE ENROLLMENT OF S. 2553 Ms. STABENOW submitted the fol-lowing concurrent resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

NOMINATION OF BRETT KAVANAUGH Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, for the information of all of our col-leagues, there were two very signifi-cant developments today. This morning, the Judiciary Com-mittee reported out Judge Kavanaugh favorably. All 11 Republican members of the Judiciary Committee voted in favor of reporting him out with a fa-vorable recommendation. No. 2, we will shortly move to proceed to the Kavanaugh nomination, and I am pleased to announce that all 51 Repub-lican Members of the Senate support the motion to proceed to the nomina-tion. One hundred percent of the Re-publican conference supports pro-ceeding to the Kavanaugh nomination. Now, in committee, they reviewed the most pages of documents ever pro-duced pertaining to any Supreme Court nomination—literally, hundreds of ju-dicial opinions from his tenure on the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit and 5 days of hearings during which Judge Kavanaugh testified for nearly 40 hours. Judge Kavanaugh testified on every topic, from complicated legal subjects to sensitive personal matters, and there were statements and testi-mony from countless personal friends, classmates, coworkers, former clerks, and other associates. So the picture that has emerged from all of this is clear: Judge Kavanaugh is one of the most qualified and most im-pressive Supreme Court nominees in the history of our country. He has excelled at the highest levels of legal scholarship. He holds two de-grees from Yale and, for years, has lec-tured at Harvard Law School. He has issued more than 300 legal opinions from what is widely considered the sec-ond highest court in the Nation. Sev-eral have subsequently been cited in the Supreme Court’s own majority opinions. Along the way, he has built an outstanding reputation within the legal community for his clear and thoughtful writing and his exemplary, fairminded judicial temperament. Judge Kavanaugh’s qualifications have been affirmed by his peers and by renowned legal scholars from across the ideological spectrum. One self-de-scribed liberal Democrat who advised him at Yale Law School said that Judge Kavanaugh ‘‘commands wide and deep respect among scholars, lawyers, and jurists.’’ This praise has been echoed by hun-dreds of character witnesses who have testified before the Senate or written us letters to praise Judge Kavanaugh’s personal character and his integrity in the strongest terms. The committee has also thoroughly investigated the last-minute allega-tions that have been brought forward. The evidence that has been produced either fails to corroborate these accu-sations or, in fact, support Judge Kavanaugh’s unequivocal denial, and, in some cases, the accusers have even recanted their baseless allegations. All in all, this is a nominee who has received what many have considered the gold standard of judicial qualifica-tion—a rating of unanimously ‘‘well qualified’’ from the American Bar As-sociation. So this is a nomination that deserves to move forward, and that is precisely what is happening. I commend our colleagues on the committee for sending this impressive nominee here to the floor with a favor-able recommendation. Now we will keep the process moving. The full Senate will begin consider-ation of Judge Kavanaugh’s nomina-tion today.

RECOGNIZING EAGLE SCOUT TROOP 121 ON ITS 50TH ANNIVER-SARY 
HON. TOM McCLINTOCK 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, congratula-tions to Scoutmaster Mitch Gorsen and all the leaders and young people of Eagle Scout Troop 121 on its 50th anniversary. It has been 50 years of amazing success, culminating in the 300th young man from the troop being re-cently awarded an Eagle. Troop 121 is known for its adventurous spirit, sending Scouts to New Mexico, to the wilds of northern Min-nesota and to Sea Base in Florida to experi-ence a range of physical and mental chal-lenges that mold Eagles. A major force in the success of Troop 121 was the presence of John Hooten who passed away in March. John served as Scoutmaster for more than 20 years, motivating many to at-tain the highest rank of Eagle Scout. His con-tributions will never be forgotten. Troop 121 is well positioned to continue its mission of providing a quality Scouting pro-gram for the young men and women in the Granite Bay/South Placer area. I wish them continued success in helping create America’s future leaders.

HONORING JONATHAN GOLD 
HON. JUDY CHU 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Jonathan Gold, award- winning food critic and longtime Pasadena resident, who passed away in July from pan-creatic cancer at the age of 57. Mr. Gold was the first food writer to be awarded a Pulitzer Prize, in 2007, and was also the recipient of five James Beard Awards for his reviews and criticism. Jonathan Gold was born in South Los Ange-les on July 28, 1960, and remained a true Angeleno for his whole life, attending high school in Beverly Hills and college at my alma mater, the University of California, Los Ange-les. While he is best known for his passion for food, Mr. Gold is credited for introducing Los Angeles and its visitors to new foods, culture and experiences. Mr. Gold began his writing career as a copy editor for the LA Weekly while he was still a student at UCLA. After receiving his bachelor’s degree in the history of music, he went on to serve as a music editor for the Weekly, until he began writing his now-famous food column, Counter Intelligence, in 1986. At a time when most food critics were focused on haute cui-sine and high-end dining, Mr. Gold was an avid pursuer of local establishments, pub-lishing rave reviews of street food, hole-in-the- wall joints, and neighborhood spots. His poetic prose, vivid descriptions of taste and texture, and eclectic references to everything from pop culture to historical ephemera earned his writ-ing many devoted followers. It was no surprise that he won the Pulitzer Prize in 2007. I have personally followed Mr. Gold’s work for years, as he moved from the LA Weekly, to Gourmet, to the Los Angeles Times, shining a light on neighborhoods and establishments all around Los Angeles and the San Gabriel Valley. Mr. Gold’s reviews became an essen-tial guide to Los Angeles, giving a window into the way in which food can bring communities together, writing about both the food itself and the people who prepared it. He frequently wrote about ethnic food and Los Angeles’ many immigrant communities, in an effort he described as ‘‘celebrating the glorious mosaic of the city.’’ His deep love of Los Angeles showed in the rich map he created of the city and its people, crisscrossing the San Gabriel Valley in his pickup truck, always in search of new and exciting places to eat and new peo-ple with whom to share a meal. Mr. Gold is survived by his wife, Laurie Ochoa, and their two children, Isabel and Leon. It is my distinct honor to commemorate the life and writing of Jonathan Gold and his lasting impact on Los Angeles and the San Gabriel Valley. f 
RECOGNIZING THE 20TH ANNIVER-SARY OF THE SHEPHERD’S CEN-TER OF OAKTON-VIENNA 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-ognize the Shepherd’s Center of Oakton-Vi-enna on the occasion of their 20th anniver-sary. I also wish to thank them for their many contributions to the Northern Virginia commu-nity. Organized in 1997, the Shepherd’s Cen-ter of Oakton-Vienna (SCOV) is a non-profit that provides services to help older adults con-tinue living independently, and it offers pro-grams that supply opportunities for enrich-ment, learning, and socialization. Every year, approximately 200 volunteers provide invaluable services in support of older residents who want to age in place in their homes and stay engaged in social activities. Services are available free of charge to any-one age 50 or older who resides in the local community. Last year, volunteers provided 9,922 hours of service to the Northern Virginia community. Volunteer drivers provided more than 900 round-trip rides for medical reasons and other errands. Volunteers also made regular contact with individuals who may have limited inter-action and may feel isolated in their homes. ‘‘Handy Helpers’’ made minor home repairs to help older adults keep their homes safe and livable. The Health Team provided individual health counseling, referral to community resources, and blood pressure readings. Volunteers also run programs such as Lunch n’ Life, Adven-tures in Learning, trips and outings, special events, and caregivers’ support groups. In 2014, SCOV was recognized for these efforts as an Outstanding Volunteer Caregiving Pro-gram by the National Volunteer Caregiving Network. The services and programs offered by this extraordinary organization help to ensure that our seniors stay connected to the community through the promotion of active lifestyles, on-going social integration, and availability of re-sources for older residents to use and share their experience, training, and skills. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating the Shepherd’s Center of Oakton-Vienna on its 20th anniversary and for its work to enable older adults in our commu-nity to age in place and enjoy their golden years with dignity and independence. I thank the many volunteers who generously dedicate their time and efforts to the welfare of our neighbors. The value of their contributions cannot be overstated and are truly deserving of our highest praise. f 
CHINA’S WAR ON CHRISTIANITY AND OTHER RELIGIOUS FAITHS 
HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, yesterday we held a hearing on the lack of re-ligious freedom in China today. Several years ago during a visit to the United States, Xi Jinping chose to be inter-viewed by a Chinese reporter living in the U.S. After the interview, President Xi asked a single question of this reporter—not about his family and not about whether he enjoyed living in America—the one question he asked was ‘‘Why do so many Chinese students and fac-ulty living in the United States become Chris-tians?’’ Whatever was behind that question, reli-gious freedom conditions in China have not improved because of it. Quite the opposite, in fact, as Xi has personally launched efforts to ‘‘sinacize religion’’ and the central government has issued commands to each provincial Party Secretary, making them responsible to bring religion in line with Communist Party ideology. The Chinese government is an equal oppor-tunity abuser of religious freedom. As U.S. Commission on International Religious Free-dom Chair Tenzin Dorjee testified, Xi Jinping’s stated goal of ‘‘sincacization’’ affects all reli-gious communities in China—Tibetan Bud-dhists, Falun Gong practitioners, Daoists, Muslims, and Christians. Over the past year, the Chinese government has intensified the most severe crackdown on religious activities since the Cultural Revolu-tion. Regulations on religious affairs issued in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1330 September 28, 2018 
February tightened existing restriction and new draft regulations are being circulated to clamp down on religious expression online. Church-es, mosques, and temples have been demol-ished, crosses destroyed, children have been prohibited from attending services, and surveil-lance cameras are being installed in churches. Xi Jinping talks about realizing the ‘‘China Dream’’—but when Bibles are burned, when a simple prayer over a meal in public may be an illegal religious gathering, and when over a million Uyghur and Kazakh Muslims are in-terned in ‘‘reeducation camps’’ and forced to renounce their faith—that dream is a night-mare. Much in the news lately has been the Chi-nese government’s targeting of Christians. The ‘‘sinacization campaign’’ has affected both state-controlled and unregistered churches— Protestant and Catholic. Clergy remain in pris-on and the human rights lawyers who defend religious believers have been jailed, dis-appeared, or tortured into silence. Xi Jinping views the fast-growing Christian churches, particularly the Protestant ‘‘house church’’ movement that does not belong to the state- sanctioned Protestant entities, as a threat to the dominance of the Chinese Communist Party. One of our witnesses yesterday, my good friend the Rev. Dr. Bob Fu, has detailed on countless occasions the Communist Party’s vicious war on independent house churches. Underground Catholics—meaning those who do not belong to the state-sanctioned Pa-triotic Association—have faced tremendous persecution for decades, including Bishop Su Zhimin who I met with in 1994. Bishop Su’s body bore witness to the bru-tality of China’s Communist Party. He was beaten, starved, and tortured for his faith and spent some 40 years in prison. Yet, he prayed not just for the persecuted church, but for the conversion of those who hate, torture and kill. Unfortunately, only a couple of years later Bishop Su was arrested again and dis-appeared. He has not been heard from since. Today, efforts to forcibly close underground parishes expanded this year. China’s Ethnic and Religion Bureau told the state propaganda arm Global Times in April that ‘‘activities in il-legally-built parishes will be prohibited’’ and underground Catholic churches were being shuttered this very summer. Recent reports indicate that a deal has been struck by the Holy See and the Chinese gov-ernment whereby the Pope will have veto power over Chinese government-approved candidates to be ordained as bishops. In ex-change, seven previously excommunicated bishops, ordained without papal mandate and appointed by the Chinese government, will be welcomed back into full communion with Rome. Already, the Vatican has asked two validly ordained bishops to step aside to make way for two formerly excommunicated bishops. Cardinal Joseph Zen, bishop emer-itus of Hong Kong, has questioned whether Vatican officials making these decisions ‘‘know what true suffering is.’’ The reports are that this deal is provisional and full details are yet unknown. The devil will be in the details—including the fate of under-ground churches and relations with Taiwan. But with all the efforts underway to forcibly sinacize religion, it certainly seems an odd time to strike a deal with Xi Jinping’s China. I hope and pray this agreement will bring true religious freedom for Catholics in China—who have suffered so much to maintain their faith. We will continue to monitor the situation close-ly to see if force is used by the Chinese gov-ernment to close all ‘‘underground’’ or unregis-tered Catholic churches as a result of this deal. We heard from Dr. Tom Farr on what the implications of this deal would be and his rec-ommendations for U.S. religious freedom di-plomacy. U.S.-China tensions are high at the moment on many fronts and the Chinese government presumably is searching for ways to reduce— not escalate—them. Taking a hammer and sickle to the cross or jailing a million Uyghur Muslims will only ensure a tougher China pol-icy, one with widespread, bipartisan and even global support.

HONORING REP. H.M. ‘‘MICKEY’’ MICHAUX 
HON. DAVID E. PRICE 
OF NORTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the leadership and serv-ice of Representative Henry McKinley ‘‘Mick-ey’’ Michaux, who is retiring from the North Carolina General Assembly after nearly five decades of distinguished and impactful public service. For many residents of Durham and the State of North Carolina, Mickey Michaux’s life of service has been synonymous with our growth and progress as a region as well as the challenges we have faced as a state and nation. A native of Durham, Michaux spent his childhood in segregated schools and public establishments, attending the prestigious boarding school, Palmer Memorial Institute, and graduating from North Carolina Central University (NCCU) in 1952. He went on to serve his country in the United States Medical Corps and Army Reserves from 1952 until 1960. As a young business and civic leader, Michaux was at the forefront of the civil rights movement as it swept through the South. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s first visit to Durham in 1956 came at Michaux’s invitation, building on a friendship that would extend until King’s un-timely death. His early involvement in local civil rights struggles led him to pursue a ca-reer in law; he earned his Juris Doctor from N.C. Central in 1964 and was appointed as the Chief Assistant District Attorney for Dur-ham County in 1969. In 1972, Michaux was elected to the North Carolina House of Representatives, becoming just the third African American to hold a seat in the 20th century. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed him to serve as the first Afri-can American U.S. Attorney in the Middle Dis-trict of North Carolina: after a distinguished term of service, he returned to the North Caro-lina House representing Durham’s 31st Dis-trict. He has served continuously since then, making him the longest-serving member of the North Carolina General Assembly. Throughout his more than four decades in the legislature, Michaux has been a visionary and effective advocate for equal rights, social justice, and shared prosperity. Nearly every progressive accomplishment of the last few decades—investments in education and work-er training, support for Historically Black Col-leges and Universities, expansions of voting rights and ballot access reforms—have bene-fited from his guidance and persistence. He served as the Senior Chair of the Appropria-tions Committee, overseeing numerous vital investments to create opportunities for North Carolina families. He has been a tireless am-bassador for his community of Durham, for ex-ample by shepherding legislation unifying the city and county school districts through the state House. And he has led efforts to ensure that North Carolina honors its history as an epicenter of the civil rights movement, for ex-ample by establishing the Hawkins Brown Mu-seum at Historic Palmer Memorial Institute. Mickey Michaux has not hesitated to take on difficult causes. My wife Lisa greatly ad-mired his introduction in the early 1990s of legislation designed to keep guns out of the wrong hands; her hope in founding North Carolinians Against Gun Violence was to make his cause a less lonely one. Lisa and I have known Mickey for the 45 years we have been back in North Carolina. I worked with him as state Democratic chairman and then benefitted from his counsel and en-couragement when I decided to seek office myself. He was especially welcoming and helpful when my district was redrawn to in-clude Durham in 1997. I had a lot to learn, and I will always be grateful for Mickey’s gen-erosity in easing my way. Mickey has received countless awards and recognitions for his service, including the Order of the Long Leaf Pine earlier this year. He has been a mainstay of numerous bar and real estate associations, the Durham Com-mittee on the Affairs of Black People, and St. Joseph’s AME Church. He is a member of the Black College Alumni Hall of Fame, served as an NCCU Trustee, and was National President of the N.C. Central Alumni Association for three terms. The H. M. Michaux, Jr. School of Education Building at NCCU was dedicated in his honor in 2007. On behalf of North Carolina’s Congressional delegation and my constituents in the Fourth District, I join Mickey’s many friends, col-leagues, and constituents in thanking him for his commitment and service to the city of Dur-ham and the State of North Carolina. He leaves his community stronger than he found it, better equipped to nurture future genera-tions of conscientious and effective leaders. All North Carolinians are in his debt. We wish him, his wife June, and their family well as he begins the next chapter in his life.

fixing, and problem solving by this incredible family. Frank Rewold passed the legacy onto his apprentice and son Roy Rewold. Over the last 100 years, generations of Rewolds have designed and built countless structures in our community—everything from higher education buildings to manufacturing facilities. I’m proud of the heritage and reputa-tion this company has maintained since 1918—their integrity, relationship focused, and honest outlook have resulted in historical con-nections that span generations. In their 4th generation of leadership, Frank Rewold and Son has continued to be family owned and operated business. I’m grateful to have the incredible Frank Rewold and Son team investing and thriving in our community for the last 100 years. Again—congratulations to Frank Rewold and Son on achieving this enormous mile-stone. I wish them continued success in the future.

HONORING THE 125TH ANNIVER-SARY OF WHEELER MISSION MINISTRIES 
HON. TODD ROKITA 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and salute an exceptional ministry in the State of Indiana. This year Wheeler Mis-sion Ministries is celebrating its 125th anniver-sary. In 1893, a small group of women from the Women’s Christian Temperance Union recog-nized a tragedy in their city: ‘‘friendless women’’ in Indianapolis were regularly aban-doned at Union Station, having no place to go and no one to care for them. As a response, these pioneering women opened a small ref-uge and residence for women in need, a ref-uge known today as Wheeler Mission. One hundred twenty-five years later, Wheeler Mis-sion has expanded to become the oldest con-tinuously operating ministry of its kind in the state of Indiana. Offering the Indianapolis and Bloomington communities homeless shelters, residential programming, addiction recovery services, and social enterprises, Wheeler has expanded to 9 locations and dozens of min-istries. While its programs and services have adapted to meet the ever-changing needs of the community, Wheeler remains focused and unwavering in its commitment to Christ and the transformation that is possible through the Gospel.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. STEVE KING 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, on Sep-tember 25, 2018, I voted against H.R. 6369, the Expanding Contracting Opportunities for Small Business Act of 2018, as amended (Roll Call No. 401). H.R. 6369 was brought to the floor for a vote under suspension of the Rules of the House of Representatives. H.R. 6369 increases the dollar cap of sole-source awards under the HUBZone Program, Service-Dis-abled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) Program, and Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) Program. Although I support increasing the dollar cap of sole- source awards for our nation’s service-dis-abled veterans, I reject the equivocation be-tween service-disabled veterans and women. When it comes to being a small business owner, it is easy to understand that our na-tion’s service-disabled veterans may need and definitely deserve an assist. However, women are just as qualified and able to succeed as anyone. We should not equivocate between those who served our nation and suffered a disability on account of it, and those who are biologically female , and fully capable of suc-ceeding as a small business owner, just as much as any other American. f

Saint Ambrose was founded in 1868 as a ministry to recently emancipated persons of African ancestry. At its founding, Saint Am-brose Church was the worshiping community associated with Saint Augustine’s College. Reverend Jacob Brinton Smith was the first pastor, and the first building was placed on a tract authorized by the North Carolina legisla-ture in downtown Raleigh. In 1896, under the leadership of Rev. James E. King, St. Ambrose became a free- standing congregation. Shortly thereafter, pa-rishioners moved the entire building one mile, to the corner of South Wilmington and Cabarrus Streets, and renovated the church to include education rooms and a rectory. In the 1950’s, under the leadership of Rev. George A. Fisher, the church attained parish status, becoming the first historically African American mission in the Episcopal Diocese of North Carolina to do so. My own ties to St. Ambrose date to the long tenure (1959–98) of a wonderful pastor, Rev. Arthur Calloway, who also served three terms on the Raleigh City Council. Father Calloway oversaw the construction of the church’s present facility on Darby Street in 1965 and the addition of an education wing in 1987. He was a civil rights leader, a prophetic voice in the community, and a mentor to many— among whom I am privileged to count myself. Today, Saint Ambrose continues in this strong tradition of ministry and service, led by an inspiring young pastor, Rev. Robert Jermonde Taylor. He was preceded by Rev. Kimberly Lucas, the first female rector and the first African American woman ordained priest in the diocese. As we look back at the legacy of Saint Am-brose, we give thanks for the church’s positive impact on the lives of countless citizens in Ra-leigh and the surrounding communities. The congregation has set a powerful example by proclaiming the gospel faithfully and minis-tering to the community in multiple ways— ranging from tutoring at-risk youth to partnering with Raleigh Urban Ministries, Alco-holics and Narcotics Anonymous, and Part-ners for Environmental Justice. On behalf of North Carolina’s congressional delegation and my constituents in the Fourth District, I am pleased to offer my congratulations to the leaders, congregants, and friends of Saint Am-brose Episcopal Church as they celebrate their 150th Anniversary and look forward to the decades of ministry and service to come. f 
RECOGNIZING SEPTEMBER AS DYSTONIA AWARENESS MONTH 
HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join those who have participated in public activities and forums this month to mark September as Dystonia Awareness Month. Public awareness events and cam-paigns help raise funds for improved research and treatment to one day find a cure. Dystonia is a neurological movement dis-order that causes muscles to contract and spasm involuntarily. It affects men, women, and children. Dystonia can be generalized, af-fecting all major muscle groups, and resulting in twisting, repetitive movements and abnor-mal postures. It can also be focal, affecting a specific part of the body such as legs, arms, hands, neck, face, mouth, eyelids, or vocal cords. Dystonia is a chronic disorder producing symptoms that vary in degrees of frequency, intensity, disability, and pain depending on the type of dystonia. The inability to predict or control the movements of body parts vital to mobility and communication has a profound impact on an individual’s life, and the lives of their loved ones. I am proud to represent the Nachbar Family of Freehold, New Jersey. Janice and Len Nachbar are the incredibly devoted parents of Joanna—a beautiful, smart woman who is af-flicted with dystonia. In their role as leaders of the Central New Jersey Dystonia Support and Action Group, they are active advocates on behalf of their daughter and the dystonia com-munity. The Nachbars are just one of the thousands of families nationwide who are part of the Dystonia Medical Research Foundation which raises awareness for dystonia and pro-vides support to patients, families, and care-givers. Since I first met the Nachbars and learned of dystonia, I have repeatedly requested ade-quate appropriations for important research funded by the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense, and in 2015 I hosted a Congressional briefing where the Nachbars and other members of the dystonia community testified to the importance of fund-ing and awareness for this terrible disorder. Despite the prevalence of dystonia, aware-ness and proper diagnosis of this disorder is extremely limited. Many patients report that it took visits to numerous physicians over the course of years to get a correct diagnosis. Currently there is no single test to confirm the diagnosis of dystonia. Instead, the diagnosis

rests in a physician’s ability to observe symp-toms of dystonia and obtain a thorough patient history. In order to correctly diagnose dystonia, doc-tors must be able to recognize the physical signs and be familiar with the symptoms. In certain instances, tests may be ordered to rule out other conditions or disorders. The kind of specialist who typically has the training to di-agnose and treat dystonia is a movement dis-order neurologist. Awareness and recognition of dystonia is crucial. I encourage my colleagues to learn more about dystonia, how it impacts the livelihood of their constituents, and honor the important work the Dystonia Medical Research Founda-tion, and families like the Nachbars, do to raise awareness and give hope to patients across the country.

HONORING CONNOR FRANTZ FOR HIS WORK WITH VETERANS 
HON. BRAD R. WENSTRUP 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I rise in rec-ognition of Connor Frantz, a remarkable young man from Cincinnati. Connor has a heart for serving our veterans. As early as the age of 9, he was thinking up ways to make a difference in the lives of those who served our great nation. He recently created his own nonprofit, called ‘‘Heroes Are Never Alone.’’ Connor’s organiza-tion partners with the Cincinnati Department of Veterans Affairs to most efficiently connect community support to veterans in need. Con-nor has helped raise more than $8,000 so far. Just this past winter, Heroes Are Never Alone had a tangible impact on Cincinnati’s homeless population. Connor’s donations were used to purchase winter clothing for veterans on the streets, in shelters, and temporary housing. His donations were also used to pur-chase hundreds of bus passes that allowed veterans to secure employment, access to housing, and services at food pantries. Con-nor’s organization even donated a storage unit that is now used to store furniture that can be provided to veterans moving into permanent housing. Mr. Speaker, we cannot end veteran home-lessness on our own from Washington. We all benefit from initiatives by private citizens like Connor, who have a passion for helping vet-erans transition out of this condition. I hope you’ll join me in thanking Connor for his ef-forts. We look forward to following young Con-nor Frantz’s continued good work.

APPRECIATION FOR THE WORK OF CONGRESSIONAL STAFFER MATT POWELL 
HON. TOM MARINO 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. MARINO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge and thank a longtime staffer of mine, Matt Powell, who recently left my office to pursue a Master’s Degree in Public Health. Matt is a constituent of the district I represent, Pennsylvania’s 10th Congressional District, growing up in Susquehanna County. He at-tended Forest City High School and earned his Bachelor’s Degree from Keystone College in Lackawanna County. Matt is a born and bred Northeastern Pennsylvanian who decided to serve his neighbors and his area by becom-ing an intern in one of my district offices. Matt immediately excelled in his role, and once we had an opening in my Washington, D.C. office we brought him on board right away. Matt worked in my Washington, D.C. office for over 5 years where he eventually became my Sen-ior Legislative Assistant handling an array of important policy issues. Matt’s passion has al-ways been in healthcare policy, and I am pleased to see he is pursuing higher edu-cation in this field. I thank Matt for his dedi-cated and hard work for the constituents of PA–10, and I wish him the best of luck in any of his future endeavors. f 
RECOGNIZING THE 2018 BEST OF BRADDOCK AWARD RECIPIENTS 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-ognize the recipients of the annual Best of Braddock Awards. These awards are the re-sult of collaboration between the Braddock District Council and Braddock District Super-visor and are presented to individuals and or-ganizations whose extraordinary efforts make our community a better place. I have been proud to represent this commu-nity since my days as Chairman of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors. The level of civic engagement celebrated by these awards is a testament to the community spirit of the Braddock District. I have often said that civic engagement is a key indicator of a healthy community and tonight’s event proves that Braddock District continues to be one of the healthiest communities in all of Northern Vir-ginia. That is due in no small part to the ac-tions of those honored here this evening. I ex-tend my congratulations to all of tonight’s hon-orees and commend them for their efforts on behalf of others and in making our community one of the best places in the country in which to live, work and raise a family. It is my honor to include in the R
ECORD the following recipients of the 2018 Best of Brad-dock Awards: Marilynn Sitts—Olde Forge/Surrey Square Civic Association, Hospitality Chairperson Donna Fricas—Olde Forge/Surrey Square Civic Association, Little Free Library Project Coordinator Sarah Lennon—Kings Park West Civic As-sociation, Parks and Lake Chairperson, Lead-er of the Road Raiders Cleanup Team Cathy DeLoach and Mary Hovland—Long and Foster Mary and Cathy Team, Kings Park West Tour of Homes Coordinators Judy Nitsche—Friends of Kings Park Li-brary, Book Sale Chair Evan Braff and Paul Woods—Fairfax Coun-ty Neighborhood and Community Services, Neighborhood College Coordinators Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the 2018 Best of Braddock honorees for their tremendous contributions to Fairfax County and Northern Virginia. I thank them for their service to our community and wish them great success in all their future en-deavors. f 
CELEBRATING THE YEAR OF THE BIRD 
HON. JOHN J. FASO 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-ognize and celebrate the Year of the Bird, rec-ognizing the tremendous value of our coun-try’s migratory birds to my constituents and all Americans and our natural world, and one hundred years of migratory bird conservation. Within my own district in Upstate New York, birds contribute to the rich and beautiful sce-nery of the region, including globally recog-nized Important Bird Areas like the Catskills and the Upper Delaware River Basin, home to iconic species such as the Bald Eagle and Os-prey. Areas like the Delaware River Basin not only provide a home for wildlife, they also serve as crucial economic drivers. The Basin contributes $21 billion annually in ecosystems goods and services and provides water for millions of people in the region. Greater than one-third of North American bird species continue to be in need of con-servation action. That means that our action is key to their survival, through supporting the Land and Water Conservation Fund and Dela-ware River Basin Restoration Program, pro-grams that conserve public lands which are important to both birds and people. The best way we can honor the past cen-tury of successfully conserving our birds and their habitat is to continue to do so. We owe our children and grandchildren the joy of expe-riencing the rich bird life in this great country. Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my colleagues to join me in celebrating this monumental year marking a century of protecting birds. My hope is that we continue to advance sound policies and proper funding on behalf of the nation’s migratory birds and all Americans, so that our proud conservation legacy will live on.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 25th anniversary of St. Mary’s Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church located in my home town of Aurora, Colorado. This landmark anniversary is a significant milestone as St. Mary’s is not only an important religious institution, it is an important part of our com-munity.

community. St. Mary’s is an important founda-tion in the lives of these Ethiopian-Americans where they can to come together, as promised in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitu-tion, to practice their shared faith and help those within their community in times of need. St. Mary’s became the first Ethiopian Ortho-dox Church in Colorado when it was estab-lished in 1993. The church has experienced both triumphs and setbacks, but it has never-theless always maintained its commitment to the community and willingness to serve. This is why St. Mary’s continues to grow and thrive as its members celebrate their successes, their sorrow, and support in time of distress. I offer my warmest and best wishes to the people and the leadership of St. Mary’s Ethio-pian Orthodox Tewahedo Church on their 25th anniversary. I know St. Mary’s will continue to grow, to thrive, to serve its members, and to be a part of our community that is both a wel-coming and diverse place.

CLARITY ON SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION IN CATEGORY MANAGEMENT ACT OF 2018 
SPEECH OF  
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, September 25, 2018 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speak-er, I rise in support of H.R. 6382, the ‘‘Clarity on Small Business Participation in Category Management Act,’’ a bill which seeks to im-prove participation in federal contracting by small businesses. The ‘‘Clarity on Small Business Participation in Category Management Act,’’ requires that the Small Business Administration report to Congress on the total amount of government- wide spending under the Category Manage-ment approach, and more importantly, the number of small businesses awarded con-tracts under Category Management and the dollar amount of such contracts. This information will allow Congress to de-termine whether Category Management is negatively impacting the participation of small businesses—including, minority-owned, women-owned, and veteran-owned compa-nies—in the federal marketplace. While I appreciate that the rationale behind Category Management is to save taxpayer dollars by reducing contract redundancies and costs and shrink administrative burdens, I share the concerns of many that the expanded use of Category Management, as proposed by the Trump Administration, will result in less opportunities for small businesses to secure federal contracts. Research published in a Federal News Radio article has shown that past contract consolidation efforts by the federal govern-ment have decreased the amount of small prime contractors obtaining federal work. As such, we must exercise vigilance to guard against the diminution of small business par-ticipation in the federal marketplace under Category Management. As a longtime advocate for small busi-nesses, I am pleased to be an original co-sponsor on this legislation, and I thank the gentlelady from North Carolina, Ms. A
DAMS , for bringing the bill forward. With that, I urge my House colleagues to support small businesses by voting in favor of this legislation. f 
IN REMEMBRANCE OF MARGARET BRADFORD-MATTHEWS 
HON. ROBERT A. BRADY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today in re-membrance of Margaret Bradford-Matthews. Margaret was born in Philadelphia on Sep-tember 26, 1949. She spent much of her youth in service to the A.M.E. Union Church. Shortly after graduating from William Penn High School in 1967, Margaret became one of the first African-American Pathology Techni-cians at the former Metropolitan Hospital in Philadelphia. She met her soon-to-be husband Herman J . Matthews, Jr., known to friends as Pete, that same year. Pete and Margaret mar-ried in the spring of 1970, at which point Mar-garet left her job at the hospital to raise their family. Pete and Margaret were blessed with four children: Peter, Mark, Allan, and Heather. Of course, the challenges of raising four young children didn’t keep Margaret from staying in-volved in the community. She was a Boy Scouts Den Mother, community organizer, vol-unteer school advisor, and more. She loved animals, most of all her dogs Bo and Squirt, and would often volunteer at the Camden County Animal Shelter. Margaret also had a renowned eye for fashion. Pete’s reputation as one of the sharpest-dressed men in Philadel-phia stems from Margaret’s influence. While Pete may hold the title of President, Margaret’s input played a vital role in shaping the contracts AFSCME District Council 33 reached with the City of Philadelphia. Her im-portance was recognized when she was se-lected from PA AFL-CIO Women’s Committee as a delegate to the 2000 Democratic National Convention. Margaret leaves behind a legacy that will live on in the countless lives she touched. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distin-guished colleagues join me in honoring the life and memory of Margaret Bradford-Matthews.

AMERICANS WHO DIED FROM GUN VIOLENCE 
HON. ROBIN L. KELLY 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because Americans continue to die from gun violence while this White House and this Congressional majority does nothing to stop it. Instead of working to pass commonsense, lifesaving legislation that keeps guns out of the hands of people who should never have them, Republican Congressional leadership is already eyeing the door to campaign before the November election. We are already hearing rumors that the next two weeks could be cancelled. Instead of run-ning off to campaign, we should remain in Washington to debate any number of bipar-tisan commonsense gun safety proposals that will save American lives. Sadly, this Republican majority is too be-holden to the NRA and gun lobby to do the right thing. Speaker R
YAN and Congressional Repub-licans will head out to hit the campaign trail while Americans will continue to die because of their criminal inaction. These are the names of 156 Americans that this Republican majority has failed by their in-action on gun violence:

CELEBRATING THE MOUNTAIN LAKES JUNIOR FIRE DEPART-MENT’S 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. RODNEY P. FRELINGHUYSEN 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the Mountain Lakes Junior Fire Department located in the Borough of Mountain Lakes, New Jersey, on the occasion of its 50th anniversary. The Mountain Lakes Junior Fire Department (MLJFD) was first established in 1941 to sup-plement manpower during World War II. It was disbanded in 1945 and reestablished in 1968 and has been a strong force in the community ever since. The department is made up of high school students ranging from 16–18 years in age. Currently there are 22 members serving in the junior department, with an active waiting list. The juniors receive much of the same train-ing as the senior members. The juniors drill two to three Sundays a month and they also attend monthly senior drills and meetings. The junior department currently has four officers: chief, deputy chief, and two captains. The offi-cers are appointed by the senior advisors for a one year term. The junior officers are re-sponsible for the supervision of the other jun-ior members at drills, fires and other emer-gencies. The department presents an annual service award to three graduating seniors who have served in the junior fire department. The award is named in memory of two long time Mountain Lakes Volunteer Fire Department members, James Bott Sr. and his son, Robert. The criterion for the award is based on attend-ance at drills, fire calls and other department activities. The awards are presented annually at the Mountain Lakes High School moving up day ceremony. The department also voted to name a spe-cial award in memory of Firefighter Thomas Taylor. Tom was a long time resident of Mountain Lakes and served in the department for 53 years. The recipient of the award will be a member of the junior department and se-lected by the junior board of officers. On March 25, 2003, a ceremony was held for the Mountain Lakes Junior Fire Department for placing first in the 2002 Junior Emergency Service Excellence Award sponsored by Vol-unteer Fire Insurance Service. Hundreds of applications were received from junior fire de-partments and junior ambulance squads from across the country. The juniors received a $1,000 check, a plaque and were listed as the recipient of the award in national fire publica-tions. The Mountain Lakes Junior Fire Department serves as a model for other departments. The department has been integral in establishing other junior fire departments in Morris, Pas-saic, Essex, and Sussex counties. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and our col-leagues join me in congratulating the Mountain Lakes Junior Fire Department, on the occa-sion of its 50th Anniversary. f

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1335 September 28, 2018 
Tragically, among teenagers and young adults, the suicide rate is particularly alarming, with suicide the second-leading cause of death for people between the ages of 10 and 24. For people experiencing suicidal thoughts or emotional distress, the National Suicide Pre-vention Lifeline and Crisis Text Line provide free and confidential round-the-clock support. Many colleges and universities also offer men-tal health resources on campus. To raise awareness of these available re-sources, my legislation simply requires col-leges and universities to provide the contact information for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline; Crisis Text Line; and a campus men-tal health center, if applicable, on student identification cards. For colleges and univer-sities that do not provide identification cards to their students, schools must ensure that the information is available on their website. Suicide is a major public health problem. Providing information on existing suicide pre-vention resources can help students experi-encing suicidal thoughts or emotional distress and potentially save lives.

IN RECOGNITION OF DR. RANDALL L. O’DONNELL 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Dr. Randall L. O’Donnell as a champion of pediatric health and wellness in the greater Kansas City community for his work in improving the quality of care for chil-dren both in the Kansas City region and be-yond. In 1897 two sisters, Dr. Alice Berry Gra-ham and Dr. Katharine Berry Richardson, began treating children at no cost to families and without public assistance or donations. What began with the treatment of one little girl soon grew to a dozen children and then to hundreds more. Over 120 years later, Chil-dren’s Mercy Hospital is a pillar in Missouri’s Fifth Congressional District, treating 500,000 children annually and offering exceptional fam-ily and childcare services. In 1993, Dr. O’Donnell became the Chief Executive Officer of Children’s Mercy, the re-gion’s only pediatric hospital, marking the be-ginning of a long streak of innovative leader-ship and remarkable pediatric healthcare serv-ices. His desire to help children has signifi-cantly contributed to the expansion of the hos-pital’s scope of services. In the last twenty-five years since its inception, Children’s Mercy has extended their facilities to Overland Park, nearly doubled the size of their available beds, and expanded the downtown branch. Throughout his tenure with Children’s Mercy, Dr. O’Donnell has been an advocate for research and education. Under his leader-ship, the nonprofit secured necessary dona-tions to launch the construction of a new nine- story research tower to further study pediatric medicine. It is no surprise that the hospital is recognized as one of the largest employers in the Fifth Congressional District and has be-come a renowned teaching hospital for stu-dents. Moreover, the hospital has earned countless honors and top-rankings such as the 2012, 2013, and 2015 Healthiest Employers Program and fifth in the Top Area Acute-Care General Hospital List. Most importantly, the hospital has a standing reputation locally and nationally for putting children first. Sticking to his personal mantra that ‘‘Children aren’t little adults,’’ Dr. O’Donnell spearheaded a com-plete remodel of the hospital’s interior design to create a fun, colorful, and welcoming envi-ronment for children. Unsurprisingly, from 2014 to 2017, Dr. O’Donnell was named one of the most influential people in the Kansas City community by the Kansas City Business Journal’s Power 100. Furthermore, it is my belief that the dedica-tion and altruism Dr. O’Donnell has given the children and the Kansas City community is worthy of appreciation. His outstanding direc-tion to lead Children’s Mercy has solidified the preparedness of the nonprofit for future med-ical care. His devotion, passion, and hard work are demonstrative of the legacy the Berry sisters had when they founded the hos-pital. The entire district, myself included, is grateful to have such a distinguished doctor assisting the needs of children and families. Mr. Speaker, please join me and all of Mis-souri’s Fifth Congressional District in honoring Dr. Randall O’Donnell for twenty-five years of remarkable service as a leader of pediatric medical care. I encourage my fellow citizens across the country and my colleagues in this chamber to join me in showing appreciation to the service Dr. O’Donnell has given our chil-dren.

STANDING UP FOR THE PEOPLE 
HON. JOYCE BEATTY 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, Americans want a government ‘‘For The People.’’ They want Congress and a president that listens, speaks, and works for them. My Democratic colleagues and I are fo-cused on precisely that here in Washington and back home. To list just a few highlights from the past few weeks for me: Fighting to keep Central Ohio families to-gether, including members of our vibrant Mauritanian, Somali, Latin American, and Cen-tral American communities; Families like those of Edith Espinal, who has been forced to take sanctuary. in Colum-bus Mennonite Church or face deportation. In the nearly 365 days that have passed since Edith took refuge, my staff and I have been working diligently to try to help reunite Edith and her family. We have met Edith’s family, her advocates, legal representation and will do so again in the coming days, as well as with other stake-holders. I have spoken directly with Edith. My District staff just last month met with an-other group of Edith’s advocates, and we con-tacted USCIS and ICE officials requesting as-sistance. Our efforts continue to keep her from being deported. Her story and the countless like it are a di-rect result of our broken immigration system that no wall will ever fix. In addition to standing up for Central Ohio families, I also hosted a Community Conversa-tion with hundreds of my constituents at St. Stephens Community House—in conjunction with their 100th year of service. Held a Healthcare Listening Session and Roundtable with hospital executives and local stakeholders on the future of healthcare; As well as my Money, Wealth and Dispari-ties Issues Forum during the 48th Congres-sional Black Caucus Foundation’s Annual Leg-islative Conference. Walked in the National African-American Male Wellness Walk in Columbus, packed care packages with the USO for military fami-lies, and spoke at the Welcome Ohio event to recognize our newest neighbors. Toured several Central Ohio businesses, in-cluding the new AmeriSource Bergen Lockborne facility, Core Molding Technologies, the Ohio Media School, Heidelberg Distrib-uting, and Home Depot, to name a few. Visited first time homeowner, 75 years young Mrs. Joyce Mayne and the amazing people at Homeport, who helped Mrs. Mayne and many other Central Ohioans realize the American Dream of homeownership. Met with the AFL–CIO, Moms2B, the Ohio Credit Union League, YWCA Columbus, Ohio Dominican University President Robert Gervasi, the Ohio Automotive Dealers Asso-ciation, and countless other constituents and community leaders. Last but not least, I continue to emphasize the importance of civility and the need to tone down the heated rhetoric, to treat each other with respect and dignity, and to be able to dis-agree without being disagreeable. It certainly has been a hectic month and a half, but I look forward to continuing to listen, speak, and work ‘‘For The People’’ who en-trusted me to be their voice in Congress. Central Ohioans and Americans are clam-oring for better jobs, better wages, better op-portunities, and a better future. That is why Congressional Democrats are working tirelessly—whether that be in the Halls of Congress and in neighborhoods all across America, like the East Side of Colum-bus to Franklinton, and Westerville to Groveport—to: increase take home pay; prepare American workers for the jobs of to-morrow; lower prescription drug prices and healthcare costs; clean up the Culture of Corruption, and make Washington work better for ALL Ameri-cans. These coming weeks are critical, and I urge all Americans to make sure to vote. I also must chide Republican Leadership for leaving much work left undone in this Con-gress that impacts hardworking families, in-cluding equal pay for equal work, comprehen-sive immigration reform, the FARM Bill, flood insurance reauthorization, and fully draining the swamp by getting dark money out of poli-tics. Our work certainly will continue through the November elections and into the 116th Con-gress.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1336 September 28, 2018 
Lewinsky and other sex scandals years ago, I was speaking to an assembly program at Fort Loudon Middle School telling the students about my job. During the question-answer session, in front of the approximately 1,000 students, one girl asked me if I had ever had an affair. I told them no, I had not and that I bet that almost none of their fathers had either. I have found over the years that the men who cannot be satisfied with and loyal to one woman are almost always repeat offenders with many women—such as President Clinton. I have become concerned during all the publicity and controversy about Judge Kavanaugh that some young women may think all men are sexual predators in the worst meaning of those two words. I really believe that the great majority—the overwhelming majority—of men are good and kind people who have no desire to force them-selves on anyone. I believe that most women are good and kind people who do not want to be in an ad-versarial relationship with most men. Men and women are different, and that does not imply that women should be held back in some way. My wife and I have two daughters and two sons and now five granddaughters and four grandsons. My biggest desire is for all of them to be wonderful at whatever they want to do. But we all need to get along. We certainly don’t need to be enemies. In thinking about this relationhip between men and women, I include in the R
ECORD the following column by Suzanne Fields which was published in the September 27th edition of the Washington Times. 
THEDISAPPEARING ‘MAN’SMANBLUES ’ BY S
UZANNE FIELDS  My father was not very tall. But no man ever stood taller in my eyes than this par-ticular Big Daddy. He was warm and playful, a man of character and the model for the men I would admire as I grew up. Daddy wasn’t formally educated, having dropped out of school in the sixth grade after his mother and father, Jewish immigrants from Pinsk, told him he had to wear his older sis-ter’s hand-me-down shoes because they didn’t have the money to buy him a pair of his own. He took a certain pride later in hav-ing graduated from the ‘‘school of hard knocks.’’ He was a man of his times, describing him-self as a ‘‘man’s man.’’ He became a sports-man of his era, hanging out with the sports-writers of the considerable number of news-papers in the Washington of those days. He promoted a world heavyweight championship at Griffith Stadium in 1942 between Joe Louis and Buddy Baer. According to contem-porary feminist thinking, he was a male chauvinist who believed that men should earn the bread and women should bake it. I wrote a book years ago about a father’s influence on his daughter, titled ‘‘Like Fa-ther, Like Daughter.’’ He was the person of integrity I wanted to imitate as an adult, even if I didn’t agree with all of his ideas. I further saw my parents in a loving marriage, reinforcing the idea that has lasted for many thousands of years, that men and women are different and that the difference, at its best, is what gives spice to life. The French fa-mously celebrate it as ‘‘Vive Ia difference.’’ But now it’s not fashionable to think of that difference as anything but a negative, to re-gard the male as an aggressor, and in the worst way. My father would be described as ‘‘bad’’ because he was not only a man, but a white man of privilege. I’ve been thinking about my father a lot, with the newspapers and television screens awash in breaking stories about the evil that men do. Accusations from universities and now from high schools, some true and some not, tell of men who have wronged women. There’s so much hatred manufactured against specific ‘‘bad’’ men that it’s become fashionable, if not mandatory, to think of all men as evil. The presumption of decency for men like my father and those of his times are lost in a chaos of angry assumptions about men who have resisted feminine pacification. Women from many different places in life, different experiences, are eager to show contempt for men as if they are guilty simply for having been born male. An unproven accusation of sexual aggression is considered ‘‘credible’’ merely for having been made, and men are told to stand up and shut up. Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii told men exactly that, that ‘‘they have to shut up.’’ (We still don’t know what her male constituents think about that.) The editor of a gender studies journal asks in an op-ed in The Washington Post, ‘‘in this land of legislatively legitimated toxic mas-culinity, is it really so illogical to hate men?’’ After cataloguing global realities where women are treated badly, from low pay to gun violence, Suzanna Danuta Wal-ters, a professor at Northeastern University, says American men can only be #WithUs if they follow a rigorous prescription for pas-sivity. Men must not run for office, decline opportunities to be in charge of anything, step away from power, and vote feminist. If they don’t, ‘‘we have every right to hate you.’’ Her stunted attitude obviously doesn’t re-flect the attitudes of all women—there’s still a lot of fraternizing with the enemy in the war between the sexes—but reflects the thinking of a large swath of vocal feminism. The turnaround of cultural assumptions is poisoning the relationships of a generation of men and women. Fox News interviewer Martha MacCallum struck a poignant note when she asked Brett Kavanaugh’s wife, Ash-ley, how their daughters were dealing with the dreadful noise raised against their fa-ther. ‘‘It’s very difficult,’’ she replied. ‘‘But they know Brett.’’ Many women know their fathers, their brothers, their husbands, lovers and friends, who live beyond the malicious male stereo-types, but find it ever more intimidating to speak out in defense of men unjustly ac-cused. Men are presumed guilty when ac-cused by a woman. Even asking for due proc-ess and fair play for men is asking for trou-ble. I closed my book a generation ago with Lo-retta Lynn’s country hymn to the fate of our fathers: ‘‘They don’t make ’em like my daddy anymore.’’ But her message has been drowned by Helen Reddy’s ‘‘I am woman, hear me roar.’’ When anger trumps love and hatred trumps reason, we all, female no less than male, pay for it.

SPEECH OF  
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, September 26, 2018 Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 302 the FAA Reau-thorization Act of 2018. This is a good piece of legislation that will improve transportation and move our country’s aeronautics and space industries forward. I am particularly thrilled that the conferees have included a provision in this bill to create the Office of Spaceports inside the FAA’s Of-fice of Commercial Space Transportation. Camden County, in my home state of Georgia, is currently working with the FAA to obtain a launch site operator’s license to become the first purely commercial spaceport on the East Coast. I have no doubt this new Office of Spaceports will help the Camden County Board of County Commissioners navigate the complex process of obtaining FAA approval. As this conference report clearly states, making more commercial spaceports available for use by the burgeoning commercial launch industry is an important policy objective. Com-mercial spaceports, like the future Spaceport Camden in Georgia, play an important role in encouraging space innovation and STEM ca-reers. Commercial spaceports attract signifi-cant capital investment in rural areas and pro-vide good, high paying jobs to these commu-nities. And most importantly, commercial spaceports are the cornerstone of National Space Council’s mission to ensure American leadership in space. Mr. Speaker, encourage my colleagues to support this conference report and I encour-age the Federal Aviation Administration to act swiftly to increase America’s launch capacity and approve new launch sites like Spaceport Camden.

RECOGNIZING TAIWAN’S DOUBLE TEN DAY 
HON. DAVE BRAT 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. BRAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on be-half of Congress and the people of Virginia’s 7th Congressional District, to recognize Dou-ble Ten Day. Double Ten Day, which takes place each year on October 10th, is cele-brated by Taiwan and Taiwanese Americans as the national day of the Republic of China (ROC). Double Ten Day led to the collapse of the Qing Dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China in 1912. In recognition of this historic event, the United States should build on the efforts of the Taiwan Travel Act and strengthen diplomatic relations with Tai-pei. Taiwan is a strong ally of the United States. In 2017, this island of 23 million people was our 11th largest trading partner. They are rated highly on the Heritage Foundation’s 2018 Index of Economic Freedom. They share our values of freedom of speech, freedom of

the press, and freedom of religion. And they are a bulwark against Chinese aggression in East Asia. In December 2016, then President-elect Trump spoke on the telephone with Tai-wanese President Tsai Ing-wen. This marked the first time a U.S. President or President- elect had spoken with an ROC President since 1979. It was the right thing to do then, and it’s the right thing to do now. I urge both Con-gress and the Trump Administration to con-tinue its efforts to advance ties between Tai-wan and the United States. America must not give in to Chinese pressure to distance our-selves from Taiwan. We have much more work to do. I would like to thank the government and the people of Taiwan for their friendship, and I wish them a very Happy Double Ten Day.

CONGRATULATING THE YWCA FOR 160 YEARS OF DEDICATED SERV-ICE 
HON. RYAN A. COSTELLO 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my heartiest con-gratulations to the YWCA for 160 years of dedicated service and steadfast advocacy on behalf of women, girls, and their families in communities throughout the country. Throughout its distinguished history, YWCA has been a catalyst for expanding economic and educational opportunities, promoting civil rights and social justice, and preventing vio-lence against women and girls. Each year YWCA faithfully serves over 2 million women, girls and their families through 210 local asso-ciations throughout 46 states and the District of Columbia. One of those local associations has been serving communities in Pennsylvania’s Sixth District for 110 years. YWCA Tri-County Area in Pottstown is a tremendous community asset, providing childcare, adult education and career counseling, health and wellness pro-grams, and a variety of community events such as the Color Run to Eliminate Racism. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the significant con-tributions of YWCA in empowering women, aiding families, advancing equality and strengthening communities as well as extend-ing sincere congratulations as YWCA com-memorates this most memorable milestone.

RECOGNIZING THE 107TH NATIONAL DAY OF TAIWAN 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 107th national day of Taiwan. The United States and Taiwan have enjoyed a fruitful partnership for dec-ades, and I would like to wish the people of Taiwan a very Happy National Day. Taiwan has been a strong partner of the United States. Over the last decade, Taiwan has shown that true democracy can be suc-cessful even in the face of challenging cir-cumstances. Taiwan embodies strong eco-nomic growth and a respect for its people. Our partnership has flourished thanks to a mutual commitment to democratic values and constitutional government. Through its commit-ment to a peaceful election process, Taiwan serves as a strong example of democracy for not only the Indo-Pacific region, but also the world. We have also made great progress in trade and economic policies. In 2017, Taiwan was ranked as the 11th largest trading partner of the United States, the 11th largest U.S. ex-port market overall and the 7th largest market for U.S. agricultural products. Last year, trade missions culminated in the signing of letters of intent to purchase approxi-mately $2.8 billion in U.S.-produced grains be-tween 2018 and 2019. In September, another trade mission from Taiwan visited the United States to purchase even more agricultural goods. In fact, Taiwan is Georgia’s 6th largest export market in Asia, with over $420 million in trade. With such a long history, we look for-ward to continuing a positive relationship. It is my privilege to congratulate the cele-brants of the ‘‘Double Tenth Day.’’ I am proud of our cooperation and wish Taiwan the best on this notable day. f 
HONORING SAVE THE REDWOODS LEAGUE 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues M
IKETHOMPSON , JACKIE  S
PEIER , SALUD CARBAJAL , ANNA ESHOO , JIMMY  P
ANETTA , BARBARA LEE, ROKHANNA , and Z OE L
OFGREN , in recognition of the Save the Red-woods League’s centennial anniversary. Ful-filling its ongoing mission to protect and re-store California redwoods and connect people to the peace and beauty of redwood forests, the League’s work ensures these iconic sym-bols of our great state can be treasured for generations to come. Founded in March of 1918, the Save the Redwoods League was started by a small group of conservationists disturbed by the ac-celerating rate of destruction of the primeval redwood forests in northern California that held the tallest trees on earth. In response, the League committed to protecting the coast redwood and giant sequoia forests by pur-chasing multiple ancient groves and estab-lishing a state or national park to protect them. Following its incorporation as a nonprofit orga-nization in 1920, the League established a memorial redwood grove on the South Fork Eel River in 1921, the first of more than 1,000 memorial groves in California. In addition to raising millions of dollars to establish redwood preserves, the Save the Redwoods League was a leader in the grass-roots movement to create a California state parks system, lobbying for legislation and campaigning for funding of the acquisition of park land. Fifty years after the League’s incep-tion, Redwood National Park was created in 1968, in part due to the tireless advocacy of the League and its partners to protect some of the last remaining stands of uncut redwoods. Over the last century, the Save the Red-woods League has protected more than 200,000 acres of redwood forests and helped create 66 redwood parks and reserves that in-spire millions of annual visitors from around the world. Today, the League is a respected voice in science-based research and a pioneer of innovative forest-restoration work that is ac-celerating the transformation of young, har-vested stands into the old-growth forests of the future. Through its Redwoods and Climate Change Initiative, the League’s research es-tablished that old-growth redwoods store more carbon per acre than any other ecosystem in the world and play a critical role in the fight against climate change. Save the Redwoods League, now cele-brating its hundredth anniversary, has played a critical role in protecting the majestic red-wood forests of California that fill us with won-der and provide a living link to the past. Throughout its next century, the League will build upon this legacy by advancing its efforts to protect the remaining old-growth redwood forests, restore younger forests to a healthier state, and connect more people to the beauty and uniqueness of California’s redwoods. Mr. Speaker, after a century of achievement and operational stability, the continuing suc-cess of the Save the Redwoods League has preserved a part of California’s heritage and touched the lives of millions around the world. It is therefore appropriate that we stand to-gether in recognition of this momentous occa-sion. f 
AMERICANS BLAME MEDIA BIAS 
HON. LAMAR SMITH 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, several Rasmussen Reports recently polled Americans on perceptions of bias in the media on specific subjects. Their surveys found the following: The majority (52 percent) of U.S. Voters be-lieve reporters are trying to block the president from passing his agenda, up from 44 percent a year ago. Voters also say politics, not issues, are driv-ing the Kavanaugh opposition. Forty-five per-cent, a plurality, think the opposition to Kavanaugh is ‘‘mostly due to partisan politics.’’ ‘‘Half of voters (47 percent) say reporters aim to defeat the Kavanaugh confirma-tion....  Just eight percent think most report-ers are trying to help Kavanaugh win the Sen-ate confirmation....  The polls’ figures speak for themselves. The American people feel strongly that the media is biased. And that is not good for our country.

TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM (BILL) HILL, PIONEER RADIO DISC JOCKEY AND BLUES PROMOTER 
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 
OFILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speak-er, when I came to Chicago in 1961, one of the first radio shows that I listened to was the Big Bill Hill’s Shopping Bag Show on WOPA Radio. Being a native Arkansan, anything or anybody connected to Arkansas gets my at-tention and perks me up. Such has been the cause with Big Bill Hill, born in England, Ar-kansas. True to form, Big Bill Hill was a big man, 250 lbs, and over 6 feet tall. He was born in England, Arkansas in 1914 and rolled into Chi-cago in 1932 looking for work. He found work at a steel mill, but he wanted to be on the radio. Nobody would hire him so he saved his money and bought air time on brokered sta-tions. He started on WLDY–AM in Elmwood, and later WCRW–AM. He had his shtick down by the time he started his program ‘‘Shopping Bag Show’’ in 1995 on WOPA–AM in Oak Park. WOPA–AM signed on in 1950. It’s call let-ters the Oak Park Arms, a hotel on Oak Park Avenue, where their studio was originally in-stalled. Their 250 watt signal was strongest on the west side of Chicago, and William Klein’s Village Broadcasting Company wisely targeted those black demographics so the schedule was full of blues, jazz, R&B, and gospel. Most of their day was brokered time so it was also peppered with ethnic programming of every stripe. But 1490 was short spaced between WXRT–AM and WMOR–AM, so it was never going to have much juice. The solution in 1953 was 102.3 WOPA–AM. WMOR had gone bankrupt and they bought the license at 3,600 watts. This signal had solid Chicago coverage. Though FM listenership was low in the 50s, it grew steadily. Initially, the stations just simulcast all programming. But in 1966, the FCC mandated that FM simulcasts carry 50 percent originating programming. The bro-kered ethnic moved to the FM side, but Big Bill Hill remained simulcast in the evening, even after the station bumped the wattage up to 6,000 watts. His career changed forever in 1963. He al-ready owned a booking agency, a dry cleaner, a management company and he owned his own club, the Copa Cabana. Supposedly, he did remotes from all locations, even the dry cleaner. In 1967, it looked like it was all going to fall apart. WOPA was born again as a free form FM station full of underground music and hippies. His already floundering club, the Copa Cabana, closed. However, Bill defied all odds and started a R&B TV dance show on WCIU– TV. The ‘‘Red Hot and Blues’’ show ran until 1971. It was overtaken by another R&B dance program . . . Soul Train. f 
MALNUTRITION AWARENESS WEEK 
HON. SUZANNE BONAMICI 
OF OREGON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, this week is Malnutrition Awareness Week, a week when advocates, healthcare professionals, and com-munities around the country will focus on the issue of malnutrition and hunger. As the co-founder of the Elder Justice Caucus, and as a caregiver, I know how important proper nutri-tion is for aging Americans to stay healthy. Malnutrition can lead to greater risk of chronic disease, frailty, and increases in healthcare costs. Unfortunately, malnutrition often goes undiagnosed in seniors because healthcare providers and family members do not know how to identify and treat it. We can, and must, do more to protect vulnerable populations who suffer from malnutrition, and I am committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support efforts to reduce hunger and malnutrition. I also encourage the federal agencies tasked with combating hunger to do all they can to reduce malnutrition. I urge the Department of Health and Human Services to include malnutrition screening measures in their national health surveys of older adults, and to include malnutrition among the national key health indicators for older adults. Addition-ally, I am calling on the Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture to work together to include dietary guidance for the prevention and treatment of older adult mal-nutrition in the 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. I applaud the work of the advocates at De-feat Malnutrition Today, a coalition of eighty organizations and stakeholders who are com-mitted to ending malnutrition through rigorous screening and intervention initiatives, and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, an organi-zation of food and nutrition professionals who are spearheading efforts to reduce hunger worldwide. Together, we can reduce malnutri-tion and strengthen outcomes for our senior population.

is one of the oldest neighborhood improve-ment associations in the City of Los Angeles. The GPIA is committed to safeguarding and enhancing the quality of life for those who live, work, and play in Glassell Park. Members of the GPIA serve their community by contrib-uting their time and energy into planting trees, hosting community clean-ups, and leading beautification projects year-round . One of the GPIA’s most noteworthy projects is the plant-ing of a small pine. Since 1968, this pine has become a centerpiece of the community. To that end, I ask all Members to join with me in commending the Glassell Park Improve-ment Association for their unwavering commit-ment to improving this wonderful community over the past 50 years.

HON. LOU BARLETTA 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the Valley Chiefs Mini-Football League as the organization celebrates its 50th Anniversary. The Valley Chiefs Mini-Football League is an integral part of the Sugarloaf Valley com-munity. Throughout the years, thousands of lives have been changed through participation in this program.

Today, as we recognize the founders, alumni, and current participants of the Valley Chiefs Mini-Football League, I am honored to represent such an organization in Congress. I know this program will continue to grow and be successful for many years to come. Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing the Valley Chiefs Mini-Football League and congratulate this organization on an incredible 50 years of service to the community.

CELEBRATING THE BETHEL CHURCH OF MORRISTOWN’S 175TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. RODNEY P. FRELINGHUYSEN 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the Bethel Church of Mor-ristown located in the Town of Morristown, New Jersey, on the occasion of its 175th Anni-versary. In 1841, several families left the Pres-byterian Church of Morristown to form the Bethel Mite Society, which was later incor-porated as Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church of Morristown in 1843. Bethel’s first Pastor was Bishop Willis Nazery, who was born a slave in 1803 in Isle of Wight County in Virginia. For eight years the congregation met in each other’s homes until funds were raised to construct the Carpenter Gothic church on Spring Street in 1849. Bethel’s first building was dedicated with Bishop Paul Quinn officiating, assisted by Pastor Thomas Oliver. Bethel served as the only school for Colored and Native American children in Morris County and needed to expand its facilities. In 1874, a new lot on Spring Street was purchased from John R. and Cornelia Piper for the sum of $2,000. A new church was constructed at an estimated cost of $3,000. Gifts from Mrs. Mary Anne Cobb of pews, doors and windows from the old Methodist Church, on the Morristown Green, helped in this great work. The existing house on the lot was moved next door and used as a parsonage. The church remained in that building for nearly 100 years. Under the leadership of Pastor A. Lewis Wil-liams, a ground breaking ceremony was held for a new church on August 12, 1967. The congregation worshipped in the Lafayette School auditorium for two and one half years until the construction of the church was com-pleted. After numerous setbacks and financial difficulties, the present church was completed and dedicated November 8, 1970. Rev. A. Lewis Williams subsequently served as the Editor of the Christian Recorder from 1973 to 1976. In 2010, Pastor Sidney Williams became the 51st pastor in the church’s history. Prior to that, he served as a missionary with his family in Cape Town, South Africa. The church was not having the impact on the community that its members desired. To increase the impact on the community, Pastor Sidney Williams, with his wife Teresa, and the leadership team of Bethel discerned a new vision for commu-nity outreach, spiritual growth and evangelism. The church became more ‘‘community ori-ented’’ to serve both believers and unbe-lievers. Bethel Church was also working to transition from a small family church to a growing church with decentralized ministries, focusing on newcomers, small groups, and discipleship. The goal was to give people bib-lical truths that helped them Live the Mission. In 2014, Bethel Church introduced a set of core values: prayer, love, and respect. These ideals serve to inspire Bethel Members to make its congregation the most loving and spirit filled congregation in the world. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and our col-leagues join me in congratulating the Bethel Church of Morristown, on the occasion of its 175th Anniversary. f 
HONORING PASTOR BOYD AND THE ZION UNITY BAPTIST CHURCH 
HON. TODD ROKITA 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a dear friend and Pastor for his work with the Zion Unity Baptist Church in Indianap-olis. Zion was started in 1972 upon the merger of two churches in Indianapolis, Indiana. The first pastor was Reverend Roy W. Beverly, Sr., who, in his senior years of life, selected Fredrick Boyd, Jr., to serve as associate pas-tor. In 1984 when Pastor Beverly died, the church called Fredrick Boyd, Jr. to be the pas-tor. Under Pastor Boyd’s leadership, Zion Unity began serving the community through out-reach programs to the destitute and prison bound, focusing mainly on Good News Mis-sion and the Indiana Women’s Prison. Also, the church paid off its first mortgage on East 30th Street within nine months of Pastor Boyd’s pastorate. In 2004, Zion Unity Baptist Church moved to 3855–59 East 10th Street, purchasing two buildings. Pastor Boyd was instrumental in bringing some of the area churches together with the intent of unifying efforts to reach the community for Christ. The church continued its services through the Mission and prison, ex-panded its outreach to support over 20 mis-sionaries throughout the world, and began evangelistic efforts in the local community. In 2005 , Zion Unity began a ministry to ex-pose the fallacies connected to the Darwinian theory of evolution which undermines God’s creation and the Holy Bible. Conferences which permitted scientists and ministers to ex-amine this subject were organized and made available free to the public, as ‘‘Creation Evi-dence Expo’’. These conferences have been conducted annually in Indianapolis, in many cities throughout Indiana, ten other states, and in six countries. This work continues to be ac-complished with a small congregation, other committed volunteers, and with limited re-sources. Zion Unity Baptist Church achieved another milestone when on July 29, 2018, the mort-gage for its current location was burned in a celebration attended by many friends from a variety of backgrounds: business, social agen-cies, Christian media, education, and govern-ment, as well as churches and ministerial service organizations. The first and final word from Pastor Fredrick Boyd, Jr. and the members of Zion Unity Bap-tist Church, in full belief in the power of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, a commitment to His Word and the promises therein, is: ‘‘The best is yet to come!’’ f 
RECOGNIZING THE 150TH ANNIVER-SARY OF BETHEL GILEAD COM-MUNITY CHURCH 
HON. TIM WALBERG 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 150th anniversary of Bethel Gilead Community Church in Bronson, Michi-gan. After the end of the Civil War, Jacob Patch was commissioned to organize a church in Branch County, and in 1868, the Union Con-gregational Church of Gilead and Bethel began meeting in homes and schools. In 1874, Luman Rose was commissioned as its first full-time minister, and in 1882, the church’s first building was completed. Over the years, many faithful pastors have served and led the church through a number of transformative events, including name changes, mergers with other congregations, a devasting fire, building expansions and im-provements, and the development of local and worldwide ministries. In 1996, Pastor Jim Erwin accepted Bethel Gilead’s invitation to serve as pastor and is still faithfully shepherding the congregation.

Under his leadership, the church has grown exponentially, expanding their vision, attend-ance, facilities, staff, and outreach. The congregation supports missionaries across the globe, hosts annual community events, and focuses on developing programs for all age groups within the congregation. As Bethel Gilead Community Church cele-brates 150 years of history, I pray it continues to be a faithful witness of God’s love in the Bronson community and beyond.

H.R. 6886, HEALTH EQUITY AND AC-CESS FOR RETURNING TROOPS AND SERVICEMEMBERS ACT OF 2018 (HEARTS ACT) 
HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I want to state my concerns regarding H.R. 6886 and the process for considering this bill, and the po-tential unintended consequences for the Medi-care program. The bill seeks to address the unfortunate circumstances under which a servicemember who becomes eligible for Medicare by reason of disability cannot easily return to the TRICARE program if and when the service-member becomes able to work again. I am concerned because this bill did not go through regular order, and was not marked up or considered in any committee of the House of Representatives. It represents a significant change to current law and has impacts on both our healthcare system for active and re-tired service members, and on the Medicare program. To pass such legislation without an open, transparent, and measured process is disservice to the institution of the House of Representatives and to the American people. The problem with a failure to adhere to reg-ular order is not just a philosophical one but a practical one. Legislation that has not been vetted properly often has unforeseen or unex-pected consequences. We have seen that time and time again. I am concerned that this will also be the case with H.R. 6886. I am concerned about disabled servicemembers moving in and out of the Medicare program, and whether they will be fulling informed about the implications of their decision not to enroll in Medicare when they become eligible. I am concerned about the precedent for the Medi-care program of folks being able to decline Medicare coverage for other coverage, and how that may undermine the universality of the Medicare program. I might have been able to be convinced that these concerns could be addressed if we had had a full process with a legislative hearing and a markup, but unfortunately, that is not the case. For these reasons, I must state my concerns regarding this bill and the process we undertook for considering it.

CCAUL. Mr. Speaker, the following cost estimate for H.R. 6742, the Secure Bor-der Communications Act prepared by the Con-gressional Budget Office was not available to the Committee at the time of filing of the legis-lative report. 
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY LEGISLATION  As passed by the House of Representatives on September 25, 2018 On September 25, the House of Representa-tives passed the following three pieces of leg-islation: H.R. 6620, the Protecting Critical Infra-structure Against Drones and Emerging Threats Act, which would require the De-partment of Homeland Security (DHS) to prepare assessments of the threats presented by unmanned aircraft systems (often called drones) and other emerging threats associ-ated with such new technologies; H.R. 6735, the Public-Private Cybersecurity Cooperation Act, which would require DHS to establish procedures for people or organi-zations to report vulnerabilities in the de-partment’s information systems; and H.R. 6740, the Border Tunnel Task Force Act, which would direct DHS to establish task forces to combat threats from cross- border tunnels; the task forces could include personnel from federal, state, local, and trib-al agencies. CBO estimates that enacting the legisla-tion would not significantly affect spending by DHS in any fiscal year because the de-partment could largely implement each act with existing personnel. Enacting the legislation would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay- as-you-go procedures do not apply. CBO estimates that enacting the legisla-tion would not increase net direct spending or on-budget deficits in any of the four con-secutive 10-year periods beginning in 2029. None of the acts contain intergovern-mental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Mark Grabowicz. The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis. U.S. C

EITH HALL. Enclosure. IN RECOGNITION OF AN EXTRAOR-DINARY PUBLIC SERVANT, SERENA R. ‘‘RENNY’’ MANUEL 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize an extraordinary public servant, Serena R. ‘‘Renny’’ Manuel, whose manage-ment of the Winchester Regional Airport in the northern Shenandoah Valley, has established the airport as a critically important asset of the region’s dynamic economy. This region of the 10th Congressional District, that includes Frederick County, the City of Winchester and Clarke County, is growing rapidly and the Win-chester Regional Airport has become a cata-lyst for this growth by supporting business aviation, law enforcement, agricultural and life-saving services, air ambulance operations and organ transports, freight and package delivery, as well as recreational activities. All of these benefits were developed, im-proved upon and managed by Executive Di-rector Renny Manuel, with the able guidance of the board of directors of the Winchester Re-gional Airport Authority. Starting as an Office Assistant at the airport in 1991, Renny Manuel’s extraordinary conscientiousness and reliability, coupled with her humility, humor, and cooperative spirit, caused her to be given progressively greater responsibilities and, in 1999, the Authority officially appointed her Air-port Director, in which role she served with distinction until her retirement on July 30th of this year. In addition to skillfully overseeing the day to day operations of the airport and com-plying with numerous federal and state regula-tions and orders, Mrs. Manuel’s excellence as a team leader was most apparent as she managed numerous complicated capital and airport redevelopment projects, such as the runway rehabilitation design and construction project, the general aviation terminal building renovation, the airfield lighting upgrade, airport perimeter security fencing, the T-hangar apron rehabilitation, land acquisition, relocation and rehabilitation of Taxiway ‘‘A’’, the snow re-moval plan and equipment project, the wetland mitigation project, and oversight of construc-tion of a second corporate hangar facility. Airport Director Manuel’s reputation for ef-fectiveness and reliability was acknowledged by her colleagues throughout the Common-wealth of Virginia when they asked her to serve as Secretary of the Virginia Airport Op-erators Council. And in further recognition of the high regard that those in the aviation in-dustry have for her, she was recently pre-sented with the prestigious Lifetime Achieve-ment Award by the Virginia Department of Aviation. Mr. Speaker, I take great pride in recog-nizing and thanking Winchester Regional Air-port Director Renny Manuel for her extraor-dinarily dedicated service to the people of the northern Shenandoah Valley and ask you and our colleagues to join me in wishing her and her husband much happiness, as they spend more time with family and have more time to travel, in their retirement years.

H.R. 68, TIFFANY JOSLYN JUVE-NILE ACCOUNTABILITY BLOCK GRANT REAUTHORIZATION AND BULLYING PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION ACT 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the House of Representatives l has passed my bill H.R. 68, the Tiffany Joslyn Juvenile Accountability Block Grant Reauthor-ization and the Bullying Prevention and Inter-vention Act. Passage of H.R. 68 came about as a result of hard and great teamwork amongst our amazing staff on both sides of the aisle. I am heartened by the work done on this bill along with the other four bills up for unanimous con-sent. I commend Chairman G
OODLATTE ’s lead- ership on this effort to help pass H.R. 68. And after 5 years of this bill not being reauthorized, I am pleased that the fight I waged on behalf of Juvenile Justice Reform has been brought to House passage with the support of my Judi-ciary and House Colleagues. This bill was named for Tiffany May Joslyn, a champion for criminal justice reform, who served as my Deputy Chief Counsel of the Crime Subcommittee and whose life tragically was cut short on March 5, 2016, in a car acci-dent that sadly also claimed the life of her brother, Derrick. She was just 33 years old. So today’s passage of H.R. 68 is both bitter and sweet. She would have been proud, as she championed these causes. This moment is for both her and for all the countless juve-niles that will be helped by this bill. H.R. 68 will help to stem this epidemic of Juvenile incarceration by reauthorizing the Ju-venile Accountability Block Grant program (JABG) and providing funding to state and local governments for the creation of bullying and gang prevention programs. It will authorize such appropriations as may be necessary, which is anticipated to be at least $30 million per year. In addition to reauthorizing juvenile justice programs, H.R. 68 clarifies how to address the occurrences of bullying through develop-mentally appropriate intervention and preven-tion techniques, which center on evidence- based models and best practices that rely on schools and communities rather than involve-ment from law enforcement and the justice system. H.R. 68 is designed to help both the victims and perpetrators of bullying. Research studies have shown that approximately 25 percent of school bullies will be convicted of a criminal offense in their adult years. It also includes provisions for gang preven-tion programs, which will help guide our chil-dren towards socially beneficial paths. If we want our children to learn, we must be able to maintain a safe and healthy school environ-ment. Bullying is a massive issue in our na-tion’s schools. The National Center for Educational Studies reports show that 14 percent of 12- to 18- year-olds surveyed report being victims of di-rect or indirect bullying. 1 out of 4 kids is bullied. Bullying is not just in a schoolyard anymore; it is a crisis that’s taking over our nation. Gone are the days that children can come home and seek solace and escape from their bullies; technological advances have made it easy for young people to be tormented on social net-works at any time from any place. They are never out of harm’s reach. This needs to end. Americans children should be protected, and no child should be persecuted for exercising their American right to be them-selves. It is time for us to come to a conclu-sive solution to America’s bullying crisis. My bill, H.R. 68, the Tiffany Joslyn Juvenile Ac-countability Block Grant Reauthorization and the Bullying Prevention and Intervention Act, provides the solution that we need. This is why I urge my colleagues in the Senate to take up and pass H.R. 68 so that we may keep all of our children safe. CAMPAIGN FOR YOUTH JUSTICE , September 28, 2018. Hon. P

ADLER : As the House of Representatives considers critical aspects of criminal justice reform, the Campaign for Youth Justice en-courages you to support H.R. 68, the ‘‘Tiffany Joslyn Juvenile Accountability Block Pro-gram Grant Reauthorization Act of 2017.’’ The Juvenile Accountability Block Grant expired in 2013 and in the past five years has gone unfunded by the federal government. The expiration of this block grant program has greatly limited state’s abilities to imple-ment effective, age appropriate account-ability and prevention measures to ensure children get needed services and that com-munities remain safe. H.R. 68 updates the Juvenile Account-ability Block Grant (JABG) to reflect cur-rent research and practice. Key provisions in the bill include incentives for states to use graduated sanctions and incentives grounded in positive youth development, providing en-hanced anti-bullying measures, and youth vi-olence prevention and intervention services. It also updates the JABG to include evi-dence-based practices such as trauma in-formed practices and mental health care. Federal support for juvenile justice pro-gramming has suffered greatly in the past decade, with funding decreasing nearly 50% to states. Reauthorizing this important pro-gram, with recommended funding levels of $30 million, would make a tremendous dif-ference to youth, families and communities. We thank you for your consideration of this important bill. Sincerely, M

FAA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2018 
SPEECH OF  
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, September 26, 2018 Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that Congress included Section 131, subsection (1) in the final version of H.R. 302, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018. This provision amends section 47107(a)(17) of title 49, United States Code, to ensure that Qualifications Based Selection (QBS) is used for any contracts and subcontracts for pro-gram management, construction management, planning studies, feasibility studies, architec-tural services, preliminary engineering, design, engineering, surveying, mapping, and related services for projects that use Airport Improve-ment Program (AIP) funding in any phase. Thus, FAA would be precluded from funding any parts of the project using AlP funds if the QBS process is or was not used in the selec-tion of professional service providers for the above activities. This provision is intended to ensure that high-quality design, engineering, and architec-tural services are procured through a QBS process, including when an airport sponsor uses AlP for construction activities. QBS has long been used by the federal government and federal-aid grant programs to ensure the best-qualified companies are selected for pre- construction designs and activities that will re-sult in high-quality, cost-saving construction projects. I was pleased to work with my colleague Congressman DANLIPINSKI from Illinois on the important measure and we look forward to its implementation.

TRIBUTE TO EAGLE SCOUT JASON GERHARDT 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Jason Gerhardt of Glenwood, Iowa for achieving the rank of Eagle Scout. Jason is a member of Boy Scout Troop No. 243 in Glenwood and he attends Glenwood Community High School. The Eagle Scout designation is the highest advancement rank in scouting. Approximately 5 percent of Boy Scouts earn the Eagle Scout Award. The award is a performance-based achievement with high standards that have been well-maintained over the past century. To earn the Eagle Scout rank, a Boy Scout is obligated to pass specific tests that are or-ganized by requirements and merit badges, as well as completing an Eagle Project to benefit the community. Jason decided to renovate the bleachers at Lil’ Rams football field as his Eagle Scout project. Jason was a former foot-ball player and he could see how the bleach-ers had deteriorated and were in need of re-pair. Jason and his parents, Janet and Jason Gerhardt, the Lil’ Rams football team, the Glenwood Rotary Club, and a local welder helped financially and with the new construc-tion. The work ethic Jason has shown in his Eagle Project and every other project leading to his Eagle Scout rank speaks volumes of his commitment to serving a cause greater than himself and assisting his community. Mr. Speaker, the example set by this young man and his supportive family demonstrates the rewards of hard work, dedication, and per-severance. I am honored to represent Jason and his family in the United States Congress. I know that all of my colleagues in the House

RECOGNIZING DR. GARY BRANCH ON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. BRADLEY BYRNE 
OF ALABAMA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of my friend, Dr. Gary Branch, on his retirement as President of Coastal Ala-bama Community College (CACC). Dr. Branch leaves a legacy of deep devotion to his staff and students, exceptional leadership by exam-ple, and has had an immeasurable impact on the lives of countless members of our commu-nity. Dr. Branch inherited an institution waiting for a leader such as himself. At the start of his tenure in 1981, he had to make the difficult decision to let go thirteen employees from then-Faulkner State College in the midst of a financial crisis. In true form, Dr. Branch was able to hire nearly all of them back to the col-lege and has never faced another such crisis since. Moving ever upward from his start, Dr. Branch oversaw immense growth in enroll-ment at CACC, from 1,100 students at one lo-cation in 1981 to now nearly 8,000 students in ten counties. Not only has he spearheaded in-creased opportunity for students in south Ala-bama, he also instituted the annual Student Leadership Retreat, Gatlinburg Getaway; the Black Ministerial Dinner and scholarship awards; the High School Counselor’s Dinners; the Scholar Bowl; and has overseen the cre-ation of a women’s intercollegiate softball league, leading to an impressive softball sta-dium benefiting our entire community. Throughout his entire time as President, Dr. Branch has constantly pushed for greater ac-cessibility to post-secondary education for all students in Alabama. To this end, he was chairman of the committee that created the Statewide Transfer Articulation and Reporting System, allowing associate-degree-holding- students to transfer to four-year universities in Alabama, and fought for CACC to benefit from state sales tax in Baldwin County. Possibly most notable, he oversaw the consolidation of Faulkner State and other institutions into Coastal Alabama Community College. From my personal experience with him dur-ing my time as Chancellor of Alabama’s Com-munity College system, I can attest to Dr. Branch’s steadfast commitment to Southwest Alabama, our students, and our economy. His impact will undoubtedly live on for many, many years to come. Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing the incredible service of Dr. Gary Branch as he leaves a legacy of 37 years to a grateful community. It is difficult to express our grati-tude in mere words, but on behalf of Ala-bama’s First Congressional District and the United States House of Representatives, we simply say: thank you.

EITH HALL. Enclosure. H.R. 6374—Fitness Information Transparency Act of 2018 H.R. 6374 would direct the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), within 180 days of enactment, to issue uniform fitness (or con-duct) standards for hiring contract employ-ees that must be followed by all DHS agen-cies. Within one year of enactment, DHS would have to provide contractors with monthly updates on the status of their em-ployees’ fitness determinations and collect quarterly data on processing times for fit-ness investigations. Using information from DHS, CBO esti-mates that implementing those provisions would cost about $1 million in fiscal year 2019 and less than $500,000 annually there-after; such spending would be subject to the availability of appropriated funds. Most costs would be for technological enhance-ments to a system to provide accurate monthly updates on the status of contract employees’ fitness determinations. DHS cur-rently employs thousands of contract em-ployees. Enacting H.R. 6374 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you- go procedures do not apply. CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 6374 would not increase net direct spending or on budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2029. H.R. 6374 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Mark Grabowicz.

The Eagle Scout designation is the highest advancement rank in scouting. Approximately 5 percent of Boy Scouts earn the Eagle Scout Award. The award is a performance-based achievement with high standards that have been well-maintained over the past century. To earn the Eagle Scout rank, a Boy Scout is obligated to pass specific tests that are or-ganized by requirements and merit badges, as well as completing an Eagle Project to benefit the community. Nathan’s Eagle Scout Project was completed for the Chichaqua Bottoms Greenbelt—Polk County Conservation. Nathan built 16 American Kestrel nesting boxes to help increase the population of this bird in central Iowa. He also donated the extra funds from his fundraising to Polk County Conserva-tion. The work ethic Nathan has shown in his Eagle Project and every other project leading to his Eagle Scout rank speaks volumes of his commitment to serving a cause greater than himself and assisting his community. Mr. Speaker, the example set by this young man and his supportive family demonstrates the rewards of hard work, dedication, and per-severance. I am honored to represent Nathan and his family in the United States Congress. I know that all my colleagues in the House of Representatives join me in congratulating him on obtaining the Eagle Scout ranking, and I wish him continued success in his future edu-cation and career. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF KEN AND JULIA FALKE 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor and thank Ken and Julia Falke, found-ers of the Boulder Crest Retreat for Military and Veteran Wellness in Bluemont, Virginia, and the EOD (Explosive Ordinance Disposal) Warrior Foundation, for their extraordinary ef-forts to support our nation’s wounded warriors and their families. Last year, a special ceremony unveiled a statue of a Naval modification to the Battle Cross on the grounds of the Boulder Crest Retreat, honors those military heroes who lost their lives in combat, in training and in the struggle against the ‘‘invisible injuries of war that followed them home.’’ Ken Falke’s inspira-tion for the statue was the beautiful memorial erected in San Diego, to the four members of EOD Mobile Unit Three who had been killed in action in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Boulder Crest Retreat is the nation’s first privately-funded rural wellness center dedicated exclusively to our nation’s combat veterans and their families. Opened in 2013, it has offered a beautiful setting for more than 2,500 veterans and their families to rest, re-connect and recharge. Motivated by a limitless desire to serve combat veterans, especially the 11 percent to 20 percent of Iraqi and Af-ghan war vets who suffer from post-traumtic stress (PTS), Ken and Julia have ventured into modes of therapy and support that are outside the mainstream. As a Navy bomb-dis-posal expert who was seriously injured in a 1989 parachute jump, Ken had learned first- hand in his recovery from traumatic brain in-jury and a broken back, not to rely on medi-cines alone. Later, through their work with the

EOD Warrior Foundation, Ken visited many fellow EOD veterans at Veterans Administra-tion facilities and was dismayed at how many of them were continuing to struggle with the PTS that their medications had not cured. As a result, Ken and Julia began a program called Warrior PATHH, or ‘‘progressive and al-ternative training for healing heroes.’’ The 18– month program that starts with a weeklong boot camp at the Boulder Crest Retreat, where days begin at 7 am with physical condi-tioning and end at 8:30 pm with discussion around a campfire led by other combat vet-erans, has allowed the 120 vets accepted for PATHH to explore their past, make greater sense of their struggles, and develop a real-ization that their preparedness and leadership skills can be carried from the battlefield to the home front. As an indication of the program’s success, over the past three years, 95 percent of combat vets who have participated in the program continue to participate in monthly video chats that help the Falkes keep track of their emotional health and keep them setting and accomplishing goals. Mr. Speaker, it is truly a privilege to ask you and our colleagues to join me in thanking two great patriots, Ken and Julia Falke, for the ex-traordinary difference they are making in the lives of our nation’s combat veterans, ensuring that they have the opportunity to succeed in their new mission—a life of passion, purpose and service, here at home.

RECOGNIZING PRIVATE FIRST CLASS JOSEPH PALAZZOLO 
HON. PAUL MITCHELL 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Vietnam veteran, Private First Class Joseph Palazzolo of Imlay City, Michigan. I re-cently had the honor of presenting Mr. Palazzolo with his long overdue Bronze Star with Valor Device for his heroic actions 52 years ago. On November 16, 1966, while serving near Pleiku in Vietnam, Joe’s unit came under heavy enemy fire. Joe dropped his pack and set a line of fire to protect others when he was shot in the shoulder. Even after being wounded himself, Joe refused to be evacuated, and instead stayed inside the line of fire to help others. By the end of the fire-fight, Joe carried a half-dozen wounded sol-diers to safety. His selflessness and bravery were evident in his actions that day. Mr. Palazzolo’s devotion to his fellow soldiers and his duty reflects distinction upon him, the 25th Infantry Division and the United States Army. It was an honor to meet Private First Class Palazzolo to present him with a Bronze Star, and I wish him the best of luck in the future.

RECOGNIZING RED ARNDT FOR HIS LIFETIME OF SERVICE AND COMMITMENT 
HON. STEVE KING 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Red Arndt for his many years of service to the Lewis & Clark Regional Water System, as well as his lifetime commitment to bringing safe and reliable water to the rural corners of this country. Born Lennis Arndt on May 1, 1948, he earned the nickname, Red, while in grade school from his full head of red hair. The name stuck and most people only know him today as Red Arndt. Red grew up in Springfield, Minnesota, about 90 minutes from his current hometown, Luverne where he first started working in 1989 as their public utilities director. Shortly after beginning his new position, Red heard about a proposal to bring water from the Missouri River in South Dakota to the surrounding states. A major undertaking with more people doubting the idea than supporting, Red saw the opportunity and potential, recommending to the mayor and city council that Luverne join and become one of the first members of the corporation that would later become the Lewis & Clark Regional Water System. Seeing Lewis & Clark develop from concep-tion to construction was a labor of love for Red, and a mission he fought hard to achieve. Red, one of only two original directors from 1990 still on the board, held a shovel when the ground was first broke in 2003. He has probably made over 60 trips to Washington, DC and many more to the state capitals and attended countless county, city and community meetings. Fighting to get Lewis & Clark off the ground was just a starting point for Red. He has worked tirelessly on behalf of the project, serv-ing as the vice-chairman of the board begin-ning in 1994 until becoming the board chair-man in 2006, a position he still holds. Lewis & Clark has experienced ups and downs during those years, yet under Red’s leadership over 200 miles of pipeline have been laid in the ground currently delivering much needed water to 14 member communities and rural water projects, reaching over 300,000 people across South Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa. He has seen over $470M in funding to Lewis & Clark, including $57M in advance funding from the three states. Red’s indisputable dedication was dem-onstrated when he participated in the ribbon cutting ceremony for the water treatment plant in August 2012, a mere two weeks after hav-ing open heart surgery. His fellow directors surprised him at the ceremony by presenting him with the Lewis & Clark Trailblazer Award, which is the organization’s highest honor. In May 2016, Luverne was finally able to celebrate their connection to Lewis & Clark, with Red reveling in taking the first swig of water. It was at this ceremony that the meter building in Luverne was dedicated in Red’s honor. Red will be the first to acknowledge that this endeavor, benefiting generations to come in the tristate area, has been a true team effort. But, there is no question Red’s vi-sion for the future, dogged dedication and strong leadership have been a driving force through the years. When he is not dedicating his time to Lewis & Clark, Red is a proud father of three boys (all sharing his red hair) and grandfather of three red-headed little girls. His family is his pride-and-joy. You will often find Red wearing a pin honoring his son who served in the United States Air Force. As a dessert first type of guy, Red lives life to the fullest, enjoying travel, fishing and nu-merous other outdoor activities in his free time, as well as hanging out in his ‘‘man cave’’. I am grateful for his commitment to public service, his hard work on behalf of Lewis & Clark, and, more importantly, I am proud to call him a friend. Mr. Speaker, I commend Red Arndt for his many great contributions and wish him the best as he continues to make the most out of the life God has given. f 
IN HONOR OF THE 130TH ANNIVER-SARY OF SOLENBERGER HARD-WARE 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and celebrate the 130th anniversary of Solenberger Hardware of Winchester, Vir-ginia. Solenberger Hardware is truly the clas-sic story of American entrepreneurialism, a story of humble beginnings, of overcoming ad-versity and adapting to new circumstances. On the occasion of the company’s anniver-sary celebration, a large, beautiful historical mural about the company has been completed that includes portraits of past company leaders and an illustration of the original store. The mural highlights one biblical expression to summarize those 130 years: ‘‘Do to Others What You Would Have Them Do to You.’’ This high standard of trustworthiness and loyalty, that was developed by each of the company’s leaders, is what has set Solenberger Hard-ware apart. John S. Solenberger, the founder of the store in 1888, made a significant con-tribution to this corporate culture when, during the Great Depression, he promised his em-ployees that he would keep them working and on the payroll, and paid in cash. Herbert Solenberger, of the following generation, treat-ed the store’s customers with such integrity that, if he found that the store had short- changed a customer, he would personally seek out the customer to repay him or her. And Herbert’s brother, Hugh, developed a standard of customer service that involved training employees to be experts about the store’s products and services, always ap-proaching their work with the customer’s best interest in mind. Such extraordinary loyalty and trust-worthiness have always been extended to the larger community, as well. The 1960s and 1970s were times of racial unrest in Win-chester and John T. Solenberger, Hugh’s son, expressed loyalty to an African-American em-ployee by promoting him to a management position in the company, based on his merits, without being thwarted by any concerns he may have had for how such a decision might affect their business. Additionally, Solenberger Hardware annually hosts fundraising events to benefit the Winchester Area Temporary Ther-mal Shelter and the Winchester Rescue Mis-sion. Another tradition contributing to Solenberger Hardware’s resilience has been its passion for change and innovation, starting with John S.’s modifying the very nature of the Solenberger business, to current leaders John, Jr. and Cyndi Solenberger’s move of the store to a place offering greater access to the customer.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1344 September 28, 2018 
The attitude of the Solenberger family has been that adversity generates change and that change is to be welcomed and encouraged. After 130 years, can the Solenberger legacy be continued? John, Jr. and Cyndi consider themselves stewards of a business that they want to pass on to the next generations, and they are now training and mentoring Seth McManigle and Jaime Solenberger-McManigle as leadership partners of the future. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and our colleagues join me in congratulating the owners and em-ployees of Solenberger Hardware for cele-brating 130 years of success and express the hope that, with God’s grace, the company will continue its legacy of success as an extraor-dinary corporate citizen, serving the northern Shenandoah Valley, for many years to come.

GEORGETTE MAGASSY DORN 
HON. JOSE´E. SERRANO 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to pay tribute to Georgette Magassy Dorn, Chief of the His-panic Division of the Library of Congress. Georgette Magassy Dorn was born in Hun-gary and was raised in Spain and Argentina. She immigrated to the United States in 1956. She has a bachelor’s degree from Creighton University, a Master’s degree from Boston College, and a doctorate degree from George-town University, which she completed while working at the Library of Congress. For twenty years, she was visiting lecturer at Georgetown University. She published books and articles on Latin American culture and served as an officer in many professional organizations in-cluding the Latin American Studies Associa-tion. Ms. Dorn has been leading the Hispanic Di-vision since 1994 and will be retiring on Octo-ber 12, 2018 after more than half a century of distinguished service to the Library of Con-gress. She started working at the Hispanic Di-vision in 1964 as a Latin American Area Spe-cialist and in 1968 became the Curator of the Archive of Hispanic Literature on Tape suc-ceeding Francisco Aguilera. In her role as cu-rator, she recorded over 400 poets and novel-ists from Latin America, the Iberian Peninsula, the Caribbean, and the United States for the Library’s archive. Nobel laureates that Ms. Dorn recorded include Pablo Neruda, Gabriel Garcı´a Ma´rquez (Colombia), Mario Vargas Llosa (Peru´), and Camilo Jose´Cela (Spain). Among U.S. Latino writers are U.S. Poet Lau-reate Juan Felipe Herrera, Ana Castillo, Sabine Ulibarri, and Rudolfo Anaya. The Ar-chive also includes other Nobel Prize winners from the Hispanic world—Gabriela Mistral Chile), Juan Ramo´n Jime´nez (Spain), Miguel A´ngel Asturias (Guatemala), and Octavia Paz (Mexico). In addition to her work as a curator, Ms. Dorn was also the Head of the Hispanic Read-ing Room assisting patrons searching for ma-terials. With the support of the Library, she ex-panded an active internship program for col-lege students and recent graduates to work with the Library’s world-class Hispanic collec-tions. Beginning in the early 1990s, Ms. Dorn oversaw the automation of the ‘‘Handbook of Latin American Studies,’’ which is an annual, annotated bibliography in the humanities and social sciences prepared by a dedicated staff in the Hispanic Division with the help of 120 contributing editors from all across the United States. This important research tool has been prepared in the Hispanic Division since 1939 and has been published annually by the Uni-versity of Texas Press in Austin. Since 1995 the Handbook is available online free of charge. Ms. Dorn has overseen an ambitious digitization plan, in addition to the ‘‘Hand-book,’’ in order to share the Library’s rich col-lections. As a result, one of the Division’s most visited sites is the Spanish-American War of 1898. Her other important contributions include de-veloping the Hispanic collections in all formats and securing valuable historical items from do-nors for the Library. In recent years, she suc-ceeded in acquiring visual materials by Latino artists for the Library’s Prints and Photographs Division. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to Georgette Magassy Dorn for her distinguished service and extensive contributions to the Library of Congress.

TRIBUTE TO STEVE MCCANN 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Steve McCann. Mr. McCann was inducted into the Creston High School Hall of Fame as Distin-guished Alumni and Contributor on Thursday, September 20, 2018. Steve graduated from Creston High School in 1967 after participating in basketball, track and chorus.

RECOGNIZING TAIWAN’S NATIONAL DAY, DOUBLE TEN DAY 
HON. STEVE CHABOT 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the upcoming Double Ten Day, the national day of the Republic of China, or as many of us like to call it, Taiwan, which is celebrated every October l0th. I would like to extend to the people of Taiwan and its govern-ment my best wishes for continued prosperity and security. Over many decades, Taiwan and the United States have stood together against numerous challenges, and time and again have dis-played a steadfast commitment to one an-other’s mutual security and prosperity. The Taiwanese people deeply appreciate the fun-damental truth that people everywhere long to be free, and that representative government is essential to realizing this dream and the true prosperity, peace, and stability it brings. They’ve done the hard work of transitioning to democracy, with all the sacrifice and com-promise that entails. This story shines as a beacon of hope to people all over Asia that democracy is not only possible but preferable. In March, President Trump signed the Tai-wan Travel Act. This legislation, which I intro-duced in 2017, will further strengthen and en-hance our bilateral strategic partnership with Taiwan. It is generally accepted that high level official communication is an essential part of any alliance. I strongly urge the Trump Admin-istration to follow through on the act soon. Our partnership with Taiwan will only be strength-ened through such implementation. In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I reiterate my support and admiration for the people of Tai-wan and their vibrant democracy, and offer my best wishes to them for a very happy Double Ten Day celebration. f

ESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and service of a longtime Pleasant Hill resident, Mr. Martin Nelis. Martin was born in Northern Ireland, and graduated with a degree in engineering from Queen’s University, Belfast. He immigrated to the United States in 1989, and worked in the information technology field before working as a Congressional aide. During his free time, Martin was a soccer player, coach, and cyclist. He was also an avid outdoorsman and often went hiking in the Redwood forests. Martin enjoyed an active lifestyle and was always willing to take up a cause. In 2007, he began serving as a Public Infor-mation Officer for the City of Pleasant Hill, and was pivotal in supporting community develop-ment efforts. He assisted with coordinating the summer concert series and the local farmer’s market. Martin also led efforts to raise funds for a new public library. He continued to play an active role in his community until his unex-pected passing on August 2, 2018. Martin was preceded in death by his father Billy, and his brother Peter. He is survived by his seven siblings, Donncha, Liam, John, Pat-rick, Cathy, Declan and Frank, his 3 children whom he adored, Aidan, Fiona and Deirdre. Martin will be remembered for his service to the community, his sarcastic wit, and those who had the pleasure of knowing him. He will be sincerely missed.

EPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECU-
RITY CHIEF DATA OFFICER AUTHORIZATION  A
CT As ordered reported by the House Committee on Homeland Security on July 24, 2018 H.R. 6447 would require the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to designate a cur-rent career appointee as the chief data offi-cer of the department. The bill also would re-quire each of the seven operational compo-nents within DHS (such as Customs and Bor-der Protection and the Transportation Secu-rity Administration) to designate current appointees as chief data officers. Those of-fices would coordinate the integration of data among DHS agencies, oversee the stor-age of records, and manage other tasks re-lated to the use of DHS data systems. Two DHS operational components cur-rently have a chief data officers while a third component has a vacant position. We expect that the other four components and the de-partment would have to hire five additional people to assist in carrying out the formal role of chief data officer established by the bill at an annual cost of around $150,000 per person. Thus, CBO estimates that imple-menting H.R. 6447 would cost about $1 mil-lion annually; such spending would be sub-ject to the availability of appropriated funds. Enacting H.R. 6447 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you- go procedures do not apply. CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 6447 would not increase net direct spending or on- budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10–year periods beginning in 2029. H.R. 6447 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Mark Grabowicz. The estimate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis. TRIBUTE TO LINDA AND MICHAEL JONES

EITH HALL. Enclosure. H.R. 6742—Secure Border Communications Act H.R. 6742 would require Customs and Bor-der Protection (CBP) in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to equip CBP offi-cers and border patrol agents with radios or similar devices that permit secure and effec-tive communication with DHS personnel and with other federal and nonfederal law en-forcement entities. According to CBP, it out-fits its officers and agents with radios that largely satisfy the act’s requirements, so CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 6742 would have no significant effect on agency spending. Enacting the legislation would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay- as-you-go procedures do not apply. CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 6742 would not increase net direct spending or on- budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2029.

HON. KENNY MARCHANT 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a small business in my district, the Bespoke Group LLC. As an exporter of pulse crops, such as lentils, dry peas, and chickpeas, the Bespoke Group was recog-nized in 2015 by the U.S. Commerce Depart-ment with the prestigious President’s ‘‘E’’ Award. This honor was founded in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, who wanted to recognize exporters who were making tremen-dous contributions to the U.S. employment level and strengthening our economy. Today, the Commerce Department reserves this accolade for those small companies that demonstrate sustained export sales increases over a four-year period, making it the highest recognition that any U.S. entity can receive for making a significant contribution to the expan-sion of American exports. Small businesses are vital to a healthy and growing American economy, and companies such as Bespoke Group LLC are helping to boost our economy to new heights. I look forward to other Texan small businesses receiving similar national ac-claim for their exemplary work in promoting American economic growth. Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my distinguished colleagues to join me in recognizing the Be-spoke Group LLC, and all small businesses across the U.S., for their continued and vital efforts to promoting American prosperity and strengthening our economy.

HONORING THE WESTCHESTER COUNTY PRESS 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, today, as the credibility of journalists and media outlets come under fire daily, I want to recognize one newspaper in my district that has been serving Westchester County for the past 90 years, the Westchester County Press. Casilda luella established the local news-paper, at first, to serve her community of Has-tings-on-Hudson, and did so for 23 years. Casilda then sold the newspaper in 1951 to Reverend Alger Adams, and his wife Jessie of Hastings-on-Hudson, who shifted the focus of the newspaper. Moving from a strictly local point of view, the Westchester County Press began reporting on the lack of African-Amer-ican representation within the county. Over the next 35 years, Reverend Adams followed leads, hired reporters, and columnists to grow the Westchester County Press. Most notably, Reverend Adams hired civil rights activist M. Paul Redd, Sr. to write a weekly political col-umn titled ‘‘M. Paul Tells All.’’

Mr. Redd’s columns brought increased ex-posure to the Westchester County Press, and he eventually became the owner in 1986. Under Mr. Redd’s leadership the Westchester County Press became the leading voice of issues impacting the African-American com-munity throughout Westchester. As owner, he would continue to write his ‘‘M. Paul Tells All’’ column until his passing in 2009. For more than 60 years, the Westchester County Press is the only weekly newspaper owned and run by African-Americans within Westchester County. Now led by Sandra Blackwell, since 2009, the newspaper con-tinues to maintain high journalistic standards when reporting on the African-American com-munity on a local, state and national level. As a result of their unwavering mission, the West-chester County Press is 1 of 200 African American newspapers that are members of the National Newspapers Publishers Associa-tion (NNPA). I want to congratulate the Westchester County Press for serving the Westchester County community for the past 90 years. Their dedication to reporting on issues impacting the African-American community cannot go unrec-ognized. Lastly, I would like to honor M. Paul Redd Sr.’s near 50 years of work, and ac-knowledge his enshrinement in the NNPA’s Hall of Fame as of 2014.

CELEBRATING GAINESBORO FIRE AND RESCUE COMPANY’S 60 YEARS OF SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY 
HON. BARBARA COMSTOCK 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, in 1958, plans for a fire department in Gainesboro began to take shape, with the help and direc-tion of the Gainesboro Ruritan Club. Red Williamson was elected the first Fire Chief of Gainesboro and the purchase of a fire truck took place with financial help from the Clearbrook Fire Company and Shade Equip-ment Company, which donated their facilities to install the tank and pumps. The truck was completed and put in service following the first Yard Party in June, 1958. IN March, 1958, the land on which the Gainesboro Fire Company exists was pur-chased for the sum of $1,200. The firehouse was built by members of the Gainesboro Fire Company and the larger Gainesboro commu-nity, and because of their extraordinary gen-erosity of time, energy and money, the entire firehouse was built in one short year, between July, 1958 and July, 1959. The history of the call volume is an indica-tion of the significant growth in the work of the Gainesboro Fire Company. In 1958, there were a total of 11 fire runs, the first being a woods fire in Cross Junction that the Gore Fire Company assisted with. Five years later, in 1963, there were 65 runs and by 2017, there were over 1,000 runs. This increased demand on the fire company’s services has necessarily involved a significant increase in operational staff, which now amounts to 65 certified firefighters, Emergency Medical Tech-nicians and paramedics. With an operating budget of nearly $300,000, approximately $130,000 of it needs to be raised by the members of the Gainesboro Fire Company and its Ladies Aux-iliary, which was formed in November, 1958. As a resilient, self-sustaining organization, the fire company has put on one type of fund-raiser or another almost every month for the past 60 years, adding up to approximately 700 fundraisers during the time of the fire com-pany’s existence. Mr. Speaker, I know that I speak for all the people of the 10th Congressional District of Virginia in expressing our deep gratitude to our community heroes—our firefighters and emergency medical personnel, along with our law enforcement officers, who are willing to face any situation, no matter how grave or dangerous, to help us in our times of greatest desperation and need. I ask that you and our colleagues join me in thanking Chief Don Jackson and the community heroes of Gainesboro Fire and Rescue Company who, for 60 years, have courageously stepped for-ward to assist the residents of their commu-nity, and to also thank the ladies’ auxiliary and other leaders of the Gainesboro community, who have so generously supported the ongo-ing work of their community heroes. f 
HONORING THE PUBLIC SERVICE OF MAYOR BETTINA BIERI 
HON. JOSH GOTTHEIMER 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service of Mayor Bettina Bieri, a staunch and impassioned advocate for the people of West Milford, lifelong humani-tarian, and mother of two incredible children. Mayor Bieri is a dedicated public servant in North Jersey whose countless accomplish-ments include restoring the New Jersey Wa-tershed, promoting the new library in West Mil-ford, and holding local officials to the highest standards of accountability. These efforts demonstrate her unshakable commitment to serving her community for thirty-two years. Mayor Bieri has consistently fought for her hometown by dedicating herself to better her community on the boards of many local serv-ice groups, including the St. Joseph’s Finance Board, the West Milford Animal Shelter, and the West Milford Chamber of Commerce. As a graduate of Pace University and a Cer-tified Public Accountant, Mayor Bieri success-fully utilized her financial expertise and imple-mented sound fiscal policies to improve West Milford’s credit rating and save her constitu-ents tax dollars. Although Mayor Bieri is retir-ing from public service, I am confident she will continue to make an indelible impact on those around her through her charitable work and unwavering commitment to helping others. Mr. Speaker, I am deeply grateful for the contributions Mayor Bettina Bieri has made to West Milford and our community throughout her career. People like Mayor Bieri are what make northern New Jersey such a great place, and I am proud to call her my con-stituent. RECOGNIZING MALNUTRITION AWARENESS WEEK HON. NORMA J. TORRES 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize this week as Malnutrition Aware-ness Week. Every 60 seconds, 10 hospitalized patients with malnutrition go undiagnosed, with the ma-jority of these individuals being older adults. Malnutrition among seniors and older adults can lead to a greater risk of chronic disease, frailty, disability and increases in healthcare costs. Malnutrition also disproportionately impacts minorities who are often managing comorbid chronic diseases. In my home district, 80 per-cent of the constituents I represent are of His-panic background. It is of great concern to hear that malnutrition is more than twice as common among low-income older adult Latino households. We cannot advance malnutrition care and promote improved patient recovery if we do not align the identification of and interventions for malnutrition with healthcare quality incen-tive programs. The great news is that there are common- sense solutions that can close this gap in care now. We can first begin by measuring the scope of the problem. Sadly, we currently don’t know the full extent of the malnutrition problems plaguing our senior population. To change this, we can add screening measures for mal-nutrition to the national health surveys of older adults and implement national key health indi-cators and Healthy People 2030 goals for older Americans. Doing something as simple as adding malnutrition measures will help shape public health programs and better guide healthcare professionals as they address seri-ous health conditions. Another simple change we can make is adding older adult malnutrition to national die-tary guidelines. We cannot expect older adults and their families to take steps to address malnutrition if we do not give them the tools to identify the problem. We must meet older Americans half way so that families can make appropriate interventions for their unique conditions and circumstances. Therefore, I call on HHS and USDA to include dietary guidance for the pre-vention and treatment of older adult malnutri-tion and the closely aligned problem of age-re-lated sarcopenia listed in the 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Lastly, malnutrition should be interweaved into healthcare incentive programs. A patient’s nutrition status is rarely evaluated and man-aged as individuals transition across care set-tings. I therefore urge the CMS to include mal-nutrition electronic clinical quality measures in Medicare quality programs as well as in meas-ures related to malnutrition in care transition programs. This will help reduce hospital read-mission rates and improve transitional care for seniors in the long run. Increasing awareness of nutrition’s role on patient recovery and implementing these measurable changes will help educate healthcare professionals and families which will result in helping seniors live healthy and independent lives.

TRIBUTE TO VIC BELGER 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Vic Belger. Mr. Belger was inducted into the Creston High School Hall of Fame as Faculty Representative on Thursday, September 20, 2018. Vic served as guidance counselor, driver’s education teacher and head baseball coach in Creston for two decades starting in the early 1980’s. His overall record as head baseball coach was 920–319, which ranks 27th all-time nationally for career victories. He also coached basketball at Creston for 9 seasons. He was named Iowa Coach of the year in 1990 and was inducted into the Iowa High School Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 1995. Vic and his wife, Pat, now live in Waukee, Iowa, where they attend their grandchildren’s activities and Vic still teaches driver’s education. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize Vic Belger for this award, and for providing the youth in Iowa’s Third District the education and direction that they will need to be suc-cessful. I am proud to represent him and Creston Community Schools in the United States Congress. I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating Vic Belger and wish-ing him nothing but continued success.

HONORING BATTALION CHIEF JAMES NELSON 
HON. ANDY BIGGS 
OF ARIZONA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, today, I honor the life of my constituent Mr. James Nelson. Mr. Nelson dedicated his life to public service, his community, and first and foremost, his family. He will be greatly missed by everyone that was lucky enough to know him in the East Valley. James grew up in Tempe, Arizona where he played football and basketball for Marcos De Niza High School. His competitive nature and out-going personality led to future success in leadership positions in his 25-plus-year career serving others. He began his fire service ca-reer in the East Valley and was a founding member of the Gilbert Fire Department in 1993. For most of his professional life he served as Captain, later promoted to Battalion Chief. James was a consummate professional and mentor to many other fire fighters. It is hard to imagine how many lives have been improved because of James’ guidance and advice. He was a pillar of strength for his family, friends, and the fire service. I express my sincere con-dolences to his wife Kerry, his three daugh-ters, Sydney, Shelby, and Shealy, his parents Ken and Nancy Nelson, his brother Paul Nel-son, his sisters Sherri Nelson and Tricia Nel-son and his other surviving family members. IN HONOR OF JILL TANNER FOR NATIONAL OVARIAN CANCER AWARENESS MONTH HON. BRETT GUTHRIE

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my constituent Jill Tanner, an ovarian cancer survivor from Owensboro, Kentucky. September is National Ovarian Cancer Aware-ness Month. Ovarian cancer accounts for 2.5 percent of cancers in women, and sadly, the American Cancer Society estimates that this year, about 22,240 new cases will be diag-nosed in the United States. Jill has taken her experience fighting ovarian cancer and has become a fierce advocate for funding and re-search to fight this disease. I have met with Jill on a number of occasions to discuss what more Congress can do to help those with ovarian cancer, and I want to thank her for her advocacy.

Mildred celebrated her birthday on September 11, 2018. Our world has changed a great deal during the course of Louise’s life. Since her birth, we have revolutionized air travel and walked on the moon. We have invented the television, cellular phones and the internet. We have fought in wars overseas, seen the rise and fall of Soviet communism and witnessed the birth of new democracies. Louise has lived through eighteen United States Presidents and twenty- five Governors of lowa. In her lifetime, the population of the United States has more than tripled. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to represent Louise in the United States Congress and it is my pleasure to wish her a very happy 100th birthday. I ask that my colleagues in the House of Representatives join me in congratu-lating Louise on reaching this incredible mile-stone, and wishing her even more health and happiness in the years to come.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor White Plains Hospital as it hosts its 125th Anniversary Gala on Saturday, Sep-tember 29, 2018. White Plains Hospital is a not-for-profit health care organization aimed at providing quality and affordable health care to West-chester County and the surrounding areas. In the year following its founding in 1893 by 22 women and three men, the hospital treated 31 patients. Today, it has a staff of 1,100 and treats more than 200,000 patients a year. White Plains Hospital has truly become a cor-nerstone of our community. White Plains Hospital not only provides both inpatient and outpatient services, but also aims to improve the health care of the local and professional communities and the busi-ness sector. It greatly expanded access to care by opening locations across Westchester County with excellent physicians in, but not limited to, primary care, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, oncology, dermatology, geri-atrics, cardiology, medical & surgical special-ties, and urgent care. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have worked alongside White Plains Hospital to support quality health care for area residents.

IN RECOGNITION OF ASHLAN BORSARI AND CHILDREN’S CAR-DIOMYOPATHY AWARENESS MONTH 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in sincere recognition of Ashlan Borsari of Plym-outh, Massachusetts, and to recognize Sep-tember as Children’s Cardiomyopathy Aware-ness Month. Ashlan Borsari was diagnosed at birth with a rare, chronic, and degenerative heart dis-ease called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. By the time Ashlan reached kindergarten, her heart had left her barely able to climb a flight of stairs, and keeping up with her friends was impossible. Ashlan underwent her first open heart surgery at the age of five, and for the next nine years, she lived close to a typical life. Unfortunately, at the age of 14, she expe-rienced a series of sudden cardiac arrests which required her to be revived through CPR. Ashlan was airlifted to Boston Children’s Hos-pital where doctors implanted an internal defibrillator. Children and infants diagnosed with cardio-myopathy face some of the worse outcomes in pediatric cardiology. Forty percent of patients diagnosed with pediatric cardiomyopathy die at a young age or undergo a heart transplant within the first two years of their diagnosis. Despite this, little is known about the causes of this disease and there currently is no cure. While there is tremendous variation in symp-toms among the four different types of cardio-myopathy, each case poses enormous chal-lenges and dangers to those who suffer from the disease. As Members of Congress, we need to do all that we can to get the word out about this little understood, yet life-threatening autoimmune disease. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize Ashlan Borsari for her remarkable spirit and perseverance, and in recognizing September as Children’s Cardiomyopathy Awareness Month. Her story reminds us that through edu-cation, awareness, and research, we can bet-ter understand pediatric cardiomyopathy. I

RECOGNIZING TAIWAN NATIONAL DAY 
HON. TOM EMMER 
OF MINNESOTA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 107th National Day of Tai-wan. The United States and Taiwan have en-joyed a fruitful partnership for decades, and I would like to wish the people of Taiwan a very Happy National Day. Taiwan is a critical partner of the United States and my state of Minnesota. Over the last decade, Taiwan has shown and continues to be a prosperous nation characterized by strong economic growth, a commitment to de-mocracy and respect for basic human rights and freedoms. Where trade and economic prosperity are concerned, our two countries have made great strides. In 2017, Taiwan was ranked as the 11th largest trading partner of the United States, the 11th largest U.S. export market overall and the 7th largest market for U.S. ag-ricultural products. Taiwan imported $3.57 bil-lion of food and agricultural products from the U.S., representing more than 28 percent of total imports of those products. Taiwan regularly sponsors trade missions to the United States in pursuit of agricultural products. Last year, those missions cul-minated in the signing of letters of intent to purchase approximately $2.8 billion in U.S.- produced grains between 2018 and 2019. Just in late September, another trade mission from Taiwan visited the United States with the in-tent to purchase $300 million in soybeans and other agriculture products. The mission also traveled to Minnesota, one of the biggest agri-culture and soybean producing states in the U.S. In fact, Taiwan is Minnesota’s 5th largest export market in Asia, with over $450 million in goods exported in 2016. Our two countries will continue to seek avenues where we can work together, and I hope my colleagues will join me in promoting this cooperation wher-ever possible. Minnesota and the rest of the country ben-efit from our relationship with Taiwan and con-tinuing this important partnership. It is my privilege to congratulate the celebrants of the ‘‘Double Tenth Day,’’ and I look forward to celebrating this important event for many years to come.

CARR & DUFF 
HON. DONALD NORCROSS 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the achievements of Carr & Duff, Inc, its founders Edward Duff and Harold Carr, and the tireless lineman they employ, as the com-pany celebrates the 60th anniversary of the company. I have a special connection to this com-pany—as a young man, Edward Duff and Har-old Carr were gracious enough to hire me. I worked in a variety of roles for the company, including journeyman, foreman and high volt-age lead splicer. I can tell you firsthand that Carr & Duff is a company that truly sets the industry standard in hard work and dedication. And as I moved on to other positions in my life, the skills I acquired in my time with Carr & Duff stayed with me—shaping me as a lead-er and providing me with an invaluable foun-dation and experience. The story of Carr & Duff is one not only of business success, but also unsurpassed ex-cellence in the field of community service. The men and women employed at this company have shown us time and time again that they are willing to go above and beyond in the name of excellent customer service, and they have been a lifeline to both of our districts, as well as the Tri-state Area, throughout the com-pany’s history. The company is renowned for going the extra mile in times of emergency. During storms, floods, and severe snow, the incred-ibly skilled electricians at Carr & Duff have proven themselves invaluable—working long hours to restore power to impacted commu-nities. Carr & Duff has such a large supply of transformers and generators that they are often able to loan out their stock to local utility companies in times of need. The people of Carr & Duff think nothing of it—it’s just another opportunity for them to help their neighbors any way they can. I ask you to join me in celebrating the im-pact that Carr & Duff Incorporated has made during its sixty-year history, and honoring the transformative legacy of a company that has truly shaped the Camden and Philadelphia area for more than half a century. f 
RECOGNIZING COACH AL LESLIE 
HON. TIM WALBERG 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Coach Al Leslie of Saline, Michigan who was recently named the ALL-USA Boys Track and Field Coach of the Year. AI has been a track coach for 17 years—the last 12 of which have been at Saline High School, home of the Hornets. This past season, the Boy’s Track Team won their 8th straight conference champion-ship, their 8th consecutive regional title, and placed third at the state championship. Later, at a national competition, the Hornets won the 800 and 1600 medley relays. Coach Leslie’s commitment to excellence, as well as the unity and team spirit that he seeks to promote, has created a winning for-mula at Saline. In fact, his favorite quote, attributed to Bo Schembechler, is ‘‘The team, the team, the team.’’ In addition to his success as a track coach, Al is also a beloved assistant football coach at Saline, where he currently teaches 8th grade history. Once again, I wish to congratulate Coach Leslie on this impressive achievement. The in-vestment he makes in the lives of young peo-ple, both on and off the field, will impact our community for years to come. f

The trust adds to and sustains places in our com-munities that enhance our natural, historical and cultural value, by assisting private land-owners and local jurisdictions conserve and care for our natural and working lands and waters. On November 16, seven newly conserved properties have been added to the 62 other parcels that make up the String of Pearls in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed. These treas-ured private lands are in Great Falls, McLean and Oakton, and are the first conserved lands to be honored in the Commonwealth of Vir-ginia. As the member of Congress representing this area, I want to express my deep apprecia-tion to these visionary landowners who have preserved their land forever, thus ‘‘saving nearby nature’’ to benefit current and future generations of Virginians and Americans. I also want to express my gratitude to the lead-ership of the Northern Virginia Conservation Trust, who, over the past 20-plus years has conserved 6,500 acres in the region and has been such an invaluable resource for con-servation management, through its steward-ship of protected land, encouragement of vol-unteer conservation activities, and critical tech-nical assistance to local governments as they implement their comprehensive plans. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and our col-leagues join me and all the people of the 10th Congressional District, in recognizing and thanking the Northern Virginia Conservation Trust and the sixty-nine conservation land-owners of the Chesapeake Bay String of Pearls Project for their everlasting contribu-tions to the quality of life of the residents of Northern Virginia and the Chesapeake Bay watershed.

HONORING GROUNDWORK HUDSON VALLEY SCIENCE BARGE 10TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, the Yonkers wa-terfront is a remarkable natural resource for our community, and for 10 years now Ground-work Hudson Valley has made incredible use of it with their Science Barge. The Science Barge is a prototype sustain-able urban farm developed by NY Sun Works and acquired by Groundwork Hudson Valley in October, 2008. Since then, it has been oper-ated as an environmental education center. The Science Barge greenhouse, floating on the Hudson River, grows an abundance of fresh produce including tomatoes, melons, peppers, eggplant, and lettuce with zero net carbon emissions, zero pesticides, and zero runoff. All of the energy needed to power the Barge is generated by solar panels, wind tur-bines, and biofuels while the hydroponic greenhouse is irrigated solely by collected rainwater and purified river water, thus oper-ating completely ‘‘off the grid.’’ It is the only fully functioning demonstration of renewable energy supporting sustainable food production in New York. The Science Barge is open for weekday educational programs and field trips for schools, camps, and other groups from mid-April through the beginning of November. Mr. Speaker, our planet is changing. Cli-mate change is real and having a profound impact already. We need more initiatives like the Science Barge to help us learn and adapt to these changes, while simultaneously teach-ing us about sustainability. I’m proud to have the Science Barge in my district and I con-gratulate the entire Groundwork team on 10 terrific years. f

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 28, 2018 Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Child Care Council of Westchester as it hosts its 50th Anniversary Celebration on October 18, 2018. The Child Care Council of Westchester pro-motes quality child care and education to sup-port the healthy development of children and families. For children, the Council is a safe space to learn and grow. For parents, the Council eases the financial burden of child care by providing high quality, affordable child care for working families. For child care pro-fessionals, the Council acts as an information hub on running a business, providing quality care, and meeting legal obligations. Finally, for Westchester employers, the Council provides parents with resources and referrals to have successful employment and careers. The Child Care Council’s continued success in Westchester can be largely attributed to its Executive Director Kathy Halas. Since 2003, Ms. Halas has led the Council as it advocates for the importance of healthy childhood devel-opment and quality child care. Ms. Halas’ un-wavering activism is an inspiration to us all and can be credited with the care of countless children throughout Westchester County and beyond. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have worked alongside Kathy Halas and the Child Care Services of Westchester to support quality early care and education for all children.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of an extraor-dinary man and fellow Northeast Georgian, Mr. Donald E. Panoz. Mr. Panoz, the son of immigrants from Avezzano, Italy, was born on February 13, 1935. While attending Greenbrier Military Academy, he met his wife Nancy, and both went on to serve in the U.S. Army.

Some of these include Elan Pharmaceuticals in Gainesville, Cha ˆteau E´lan Winery & Resort in Braselton, and Panoz LLC in Hoschton. Panoz also served as Chair-man of the Board of Directors for NanoLumens in Norcross. However, Mr. Panoz will be most remem-bered for founding the American Le Mans Se-ries—which brought European-style endurance sports car racing to America—and Milan Phar-maceuticals, which developed the method of delivering medicine through transdermal tech-nology. Mr. Panoz passed away on September 11, 2018 after a battle with cancer. As we remem-ber his legacy, I join others in thanking him for his military service and recognizing his entre-preneurial spirit and success.
