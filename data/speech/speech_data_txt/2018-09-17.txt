Grant a deepening knowledge of, and appreciation for, our Constitution to all Americans, but especially to the Members of the people’s House, who have sworn an oath to defend it.

Provide our lawmakers with the strength and wisdom to do Your will on Earth. Direct them on Your path so they shall never stray. Lord, we acknowledge that You alone are God, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.

SUBSTANCE USE-DISORDER PRE-VENTION THAT PROMOTES OPIOID RECOVERY AND TREAT-MENT FOR PATIENTS AND COM-MUNITIES ACT The PRESIDING OFFICER.

ORDER OF PROCEDURE  
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 5:30 p.m. will be equally divided in the usual form. The Senator from Utah. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on three very important topics: first, today’s celebration of Constitution Day; second, the signing of the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act; and finally, tonight’s vote on the Opioid Crisis Response Act. 
CONSTITUTION DAY  
Mr. President, today marks 231 years since the Founding Fathers signed a charter that would forever alter the course of human history: the U.S. Con-stitution. This document serves as the foundation of our government, and we rightly celebrate its anniversary each year with Constitution Day. The Constitution establishes guiding principles that have served the Amer-ican people very well. The separation of powers, the rule of law, and our sys-tem of federalism work together to-ward the goal of preserving liberty. They have worked to secure individual rights against encroachment by the government. The Framers of the Constitution rec-ognized that the government derived its power from the people themselves. The Constitution overturned the pre-vailing wisdom that men are made for governments, declaring instead that governments are made for men. These principles and our Nation’s dedication to them are core to our American ethos. Today, they set our country apart as a symbol of freedom and pros-perity across the globe. The Constitution is the culmination of centuries of human progress. We have a charge to fulfill its promises. We have a duty to uphold its prin-ciples. May we commit ourselves today and every day to defending the truths so eloquently and essentially articu-lated in the Constitution of our United States. MISCELLANEOUS TARIFF BILL ACT OF 2018  
Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I would like to address the pas-sage of the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act of 2018, an important piece of legis-lation that was signed late last week by the President. Senator W
YDEN and I introduced the bill on a bipartisan and bicameral basis, and it passed unani-mously—a great example of how both parties feel about relieving Americans from the burdens of job-killing tariffs. The Miscellaneous Tariff Bill was de-signed to help both importers and pro-ducers by suspending or reducing bur-densome tariffs that unnecessarily in-crease manufacturing and operating costs for American companies. A Mis-cellaneous Tariff Bill has not been en-acted since 2010, and our businesses and manufacturers have been forced to wait too long for Congress to act. I am pleased that we were finally able to end that wait. I am also pleased to report that this is the first MTB, or Miscellaneous Tariff Bill, to be enacted in the new process set out in the Amer-ican Manufacturing Competitiveness Act of 2016. This new process was craft-ed to provide a robust consultation that is consistent with both House and Senate rules and that would be trans-parent and open to all. The International Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce vet-ted each petition to determine eligi-bility based on this new criteria. Each of these agencies made great efforts to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6160 September 17, 2018 
evaluate each one of the thousands of petitions against the high standards set out in the AMCA. I would like to thank all of the staff that worked dili-gently to do so. Senator W
YDEN and I also worked closely with our colleagues throughout this entire process to resolve any con-cerns that they may have had with any of the included products. In the end, I think we crafted a bill that we all can be proud of because it will help Amer-ican businesses compete around the world. The passage of the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act, in conjunction with the successful implementation of tax re-form, will continue to expand the American workforce, improve the American economy, and keep America competitive. 
OPIOID EPIDEMIC  
Finally, Mr. President, I am also here to talk about the passage of an incred-ibly important bill that will aid indi-viduals, families, and communities confronting an epidemic that is over-whelming our country. This is not the first time I have been talking about the opioid epidemic, and, unfortu-nately, it will not be my last. But I am happy to say that today’s remarks will highlight some very good news. As part of a coordinated effort with four other committees, the Senate Fi-nance Committee’s package will be voted on tonight as a part of the Opioid Crisis Response Act, but before I get to what is in that bill, I want to give some details of the unfortunate reality our country is facing. Last year, more than 72,000 Ameri-cans died from a drug overdose. The majority of these overdoses involved prescription opioids or illicit opioids like heroin or fentanyl. I have spoken to many families who have witnessed the devastating effects of these addic-tions firsthand, and I have been sadly impressed by the pervasiveness of this rampant epidemic. Truly, I promise you that you have more friends, fam-ily, and coworkers who have been af-fected by this epidemic than you prob-ably realize. My home State of Utah continues to be hard hit by this crisis. An alarming number of Utahns have undergone hos-pital stays and emergency room visits due to opioid overdoses. In 2017 alone, over 450 Utahns died from an opioid overdose. As the Presiding Officer may have noticed, Congress has recognized this problem for some time. While this package is a significant step forward, it isn’t the first thing we have done, nor will it be the last thing we do. Take, for example, the bipartisan Family First Prevention Services Act, which was enacted earlier this year in February. Our committee also worked together to realize a 10-year extension of the Children’s Health Insurance Pro-gram, which, as a part of its mission, helps moms, babies, children, and teen-agers struggling with addiction or its impacts on families across the country. Our work did not stop there. We pro-ceeded to work on ways that our com-mittee, with its jurisdiction over Med-icaid and Medicare, family services, and customs, could work to improve the lives of the millions of Americans who have been impacted by this dev-astating epidemic. There are simply too many pieces of this bill to cover them all in one speech, but I wish to give some high-lights. The bill will make a real dif-ference in Medicare, a program in which one in three beneficiaries is pre-scribed an opioid. It will empower pa-tients through information on pain treatment alternatives. It will expand treatment options for patients suf-fering from addiction, including through increased access to care via telehealth and a pilot program that will allow Medicare to cover metha-done and wraparound services to treat addiction for the first time. The bill also increases the ability to track opioid prescriptions to prevent misuse and diversion, while also ensuring that beneficiaries promptly get the medica-tions they need. We know that many children are in foster care as a result of the opioid epi-demic, and this bill supports programs that will help parents complete treat-ment for opioid addiction and reunite with their children more quickly. It will also increase the availability of family residential treatment programs, allowing more parents to receive help while still caring for their children in a supervised setting. For the first time since Medicaid be-came law in 1965, pregnant women can receive Medicaid coverage for prenatal and postnatal care while seeking treat-ment at institutions for mental dis-ease. New and improved prescription- drug monitoring programs allow States to better understand the full scope of an individual’s prescription use across payments and insurers. This bill brings that data into the hands of providers and insurance plans to help them de-velop care plans for those with sub-stance use disorders. Additionally, this package is not lim-ited to fixes in the healthcare space. We also worked with Senator P
ORTMAN  to craft the bipartisan STOP Act, which has also been incorporated into this package. That bill sets new re-quirements for the U.S. Postal Service to obtain advance electronic data that allows for U.S. Customs and Border Protection to effectively target and stop fentanyl and other illegal sub-stances from entering the country through our postal system. Getting our law enforcement this additional data will bolster efforts to stop dangerous opioids at the border and keep them away from American families. In short, the Finance Committee’s portion of this larger effort is an im-portant step forward, but it is made that much more meaningful given the wide-ranging provisions included from the Judiciary, Commerce, Banking, and HELP Committees. Together, this bill will provide the resources, capac-ities, and direction to State, local, and Federal Governments to better assist those who are in such great need right now. Additionally, I thank the leader, the chairman, the ranking members, and all other Members of the four other committees who have been involved in this great undertaking. There has been no shortage of effort or genuine con-cern from both sides of the aisle to ad-dress this painful issue that has hurt so many American families. I appreciate this bipartisan push to create a suc-cessful piece of legislation. I think this bill represents Congress at its best. I encourage all of my friends, on both sides of the aisle, to vote for this im-portant piece of legislation tonight, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House to advance a bill that addresses the opioid epidemic to the President’s desk. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, the opioid epidemic is a national crisis. It has destroyed lives, torn apart fami-lies, and strained community re-sources. Since the year 2000, more than 300,000 people in the United States have died from opioid overdoses. Congress is ag-gressively working to combat this problem by expanding prevention ef-forts, empowering law enforcement, and increasing access to treatment. We passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, the 21st Century CURES Act, and the Bipartisan Budget Act to improve the tools and resources available to fight this epidemic, and we have another opportunity to continue turning the tide with passage of the Opioid Crisis Response Act of 2018. Last week, I met Arkansans who are on the frontlines of this battle. They have seen the destruction caused by opioids in our schools, our hospitals, and the judicial system. The individ-uals I spoke with agree that more re-sources are needed in this fight. That is what the Opioid Crisis Response Act will deliver. This comprehensive pack-age covers a wide range of avenues to attack this problem and get individuals the help and support they need to re-cover. This includes prevention, treat-ment, additional law enforcement tools, and expanding research into non-addictive pain treatments. I appreciate the leadership of my col-leagues on the HELP, Finance, Judici-ary, and Commerce Committees to ad-vance this important legislation that is necessary to address the ever-growing opioid crisis. The legislation expands a grant pro-gram to train our first responders ad-ministering naloxone, the drug that

can be used to block the effects of opioids and prevent deaths from an overdose. In Arkansas, this is having a very positive impact. Since 2017, the Arkan-sas naloxone project has trained more than 3,300 first responders to admin-ister the drug. This effort has saved at least 142 lives. The program continues to grow. It is working. Other States can replicate the success we have seen in Arkansas by using grant funds to train first responders. Not only does this legislation help those already impacted by the crisis, it also aims to stop even more dangerous drugs, like fentanyl, from getting into the country in the first place by im-proving detection of prohibited drugs being illegally imported through the mail. These provisions are just a small piece of the puzzle. Together, with other measures in this bill, we can make a real difference and change the conversations we have around opioid abuse and addiction to focus not on the lives taken but on the lives which are being saved. The comprehensive re-sponse to the crisis shows how com-mitted we are as a nation to combating opioid addiction. I applaud the U.S. Department of Ag-riculture with this week’s announce-ment of its partnership with commu-nities across the country to fight the opioid epidemic in rural America, in-cluding Newport, AR. In Newport, USDA is investing more than $150,000 to convert the former Jackson County Jail into the White River Women’s Shelter. This facility will help individ-uals recover from opioid misuse, and provide prevention, recovery, and treatment services to combat the opioid epidemic in the region. We all have a stake in this fight. If individuals are living healthier lives, they will be able to be more productive citizens and help the community thrive. The Opioid Crisis Response Act of 2018 will aid us in this effort. I look forward to the Senate passage of this bill and President Trump sign-ing it into law so we can reverse opioid abuse statistics. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, our Na-tion is suffering through a public health crisis. Our Nation, our neigh-bors, our families—in fact, very few among us can say that we have not been personally impacted by the opioid crisis. The scope is simply staggering; 116 lives are lost every day to opioid over-dose. There are 116 sons, daughters, husbands, wives, siblings, and parents who will never come home again—116 lives ended decades too soon, lost every day. Substance abuse disorders do not dis-criminate. We feel this pain in every region of our country—urban and rural areas and red and blue States. We know there is no silver bullet that will end this crisis overnight, but we do know how to fight it together, and that is what we are doing today. Tonight the Senate will pass the bi-partisan Opioid Crisis Response Act, and this body will show a unity of pur-pose that, frankly, I wish we could show more often. As this important bi-partisan legislation came together, I worked closely with my colleague Sen-ator S
HELLEY MOORE CAPITO of West Virginia to make sure that our Na-tion’s youth were not left behind. We know young adults are more than twice as likely to misuse prescription opioid pain relievers as compared to adults. One in five high school seniors knows where they can easily get her-oin, and the problem continues to esca-late. In Michigan, the rate of opioid overdose deaths among youth under 25 has doubled since 2012. These are empty seats at the dinner table, in class-rooms, and in workplaces. When tackling a problem this large, we need to follow the data and invest in what works, especially for adoles-cents and young adults. Health experts, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, recommend medication-as-sisted treatment, or MAT, as the gold standard for opioid addiction treat-ment. While we need to continue in-vesting in research, completed studies have shown that youth treated with MAT are more likely to reduce opioid misuse, injection drug use, continue their medical care, and achieve long- term sobriety. The research we have on using medi-cation-assisted treatment to treat adults is overwhelmingly positive and shows this course of treatment to be safe and effective, especially in com-parison to the life-threatening risks faced by patients who go untreated. Research shows that medication-as-sisted treatment has the power to cut the mortality rate of opioid-addicted patients in half, if not more. France instituted a strong MAT strategy in response to a heroin epi-demic in the 1990s. The death rate due to overdoses there decreased by nearly 80 percent over the course of just 4 years. Substance abuse disorders are not a personal or a moral failure; they are a public health crisis brought on by chemical dependency. We are fortunate that our doctors and researchers have developed medication that can help end dependency and save lives, and we must get it to patients who need it the most. It is troubling that many Ameri-cans whose lives could be saved do not have enough access to these medica-tion-assisted treatments, and it is dev-astating that American youth have hardly any access at all. Currently, only about 1 in 12 youth who need treatment for an opioid ad-diction actually receives it. A 2017 study found that one in four adults in treatment for heroin received medica-tion-assisted treatment. While this sounds low, for adolescents the rate is less than 1 in 40. Even for those who are fortunate enough to be in active treatment, MAT is not being used widely. Similarly, only one in eight adults in treatment for prescription opioids re-ceives medication-assisted treatment. For adolescents, it is 1 out of every 250. That is why the Peters-Capito provi-sions of the Opioid Crisis Response Act are actually crucial. They will support the identification and development of best practices for treating opioid addic-tion among youth and point to MAT as a specific strategy. In addition, Senator C
APITO and I successfully added a related amend-ment to the appropriations bill that funds the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It recently passed the Senate. The amendment will re-quire the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to sub-mit a report to Congress on what steps it takes to support MAT. The agency specifically will also identify barriers they must overcome to get medication- assisted treatment to eligible youth. Young Americans coping with sub-stance use disorders deserve every op-portunity to recover, to hold onto their future aspirations, and to lead stable and fulfilling lives. We must continue working together at every level of gov-ernment as we combat this opioid cri-sis with scientifically proven strate-gies, including for some of the young-est lives at risk. An important step in this response is getting these provisions across the fin-ish line. I urge my colleagues to act quickly to get this legislation to the President’s desk to be signed into law. I recognize these provisions are just a start, but we are losing 116 lives every day. We need to save as many as we can, as soon as we can. Thank you. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the pending legis-lation to address the opioid epidemic— a crisis the likes of which we have never seen in America. All of us know that this crisis is a nightmare. It is a scourge. The prescription drug, heroin, and fentanyl epidemic is a human trag-edy unfolding every day in homes, in alleyways, in bathrooms, the back seats of cars, in nearly every city and town of our country. Preliminary estimates indicate that opioid overdoses claimed an estimated

49,000 lives just last year, including nearly 2,000 people in Massachusetts. That is more than gun violence. That is more than car accidents. The opioid epidemic is the deadliest drug overdose crisis in American history. A crisis of this proportion demands action at all levels, and I am pleased that the Sen-ate is taking a step in that direction today. I would like to thank Senator L
AMAR  A
LEXANDER and Senator P ATTY MUR-
RAY and their staffs, as well as the leadership and staffs of the other com-mittees, who worked to create and re-fine the legislative package we will be voting on later this evening. This bill contains a number of pro-posals that will help families and com-munities struggling day in and day out to respond to the opioid overdose cri-sis. One of those proposals is my bipar-tisan Opioids Milestones Act, a bill I authored with Senator L
ISA MUR-
KOWSKI and Senator M AGGIE HASSAN to create a scorecard for our Nation’s re-sponse to the opioid crisis. The Milestones Act will require the Federal Government to both set tan-gible benchmarks for how we are ad-dressing the opioid crisis in our coun-try and measure progress on key objec-tives every single year. When people are sick, they get a treatment plan. The United States of America needs a nationwide treatment plan for fighting the opioid crisis, and that is what this provision will create for our country. Those objectives include reducing over-dose deaths, expanding treatment availability, increasing the number of individuals in sustained recovery, and decreasing emergency room visits for overdoses. If we don’t have a dashboard—a scorecard—to clearly and quantifiably show our progress on this epidemic, we will continue to fight the same battle over and over again. We urgently need to know whether our policies and re-sources are being used in ways that have a measurable impact on the public’s health. The Milestones Act provision in this bill will provide a na-tional roadmap for ensuring that our Federal and State resources pay life-saving dividends. That is my goal, that is Senator M
URKOWSKI ’s goal, and that is Senator H
ASSAN ’s goal, and it is in the bill. This type of strategy was put in place to fight the HIV/AIDS epidemic in America—another disease that was surrounded by stigma, inaction, and the lack of research until advocates, scientists, healthcare providers, and policymakers joined forces to chart a path forward and to make measurable progress. While that war is not yet won, new HIV diagnoses and deaths have declined dramatically over the past two decades in the United States. When America has a plan, America wins. That is why I am pleased that this legislative package includes im-portant bipartisan legislation that I in-troduced with Senator T
ODDYOUNG and Senator T
AMMY BALDWIN to help ad-dress increasing rates of infectious dis-eases like HIV caused by injection drug use. With more than 220 counties across the United States at risk of a hepatitis C or HIV outbreak related to the opioid crisis, we cannot afford to wait any longer to arm our States with the tools needed to tackle the public health con-sequences of this epidemic. Massachu-setts had more reported cases of hepa-titis C than any other State in 2015— the same year we peaked in overdose deaths caused by illicit opioids. The public health consequences of the epidemic are life-and-death. One re-cent study published in the American Journal of Public Health roughly esti-mates that 510,000 people could die over the next decade due to opioid-related causes, which include overdoses as well as other causes of death tied to opioids, such as HIV infections from sharing sy-ringes. That is what Senator YOUNG  and I are trying to deal with. We are trying to deal with this issue so that we can create the tools that help us to deal with this growing medical prob-lem in our country. This provision will help ensure that the Federal Government works with States to improve education, surveil-lance, and treatment of opioid use-re-lated infectious diseases like HIV and viral hepatitis, but we have more work to do to combat this crisis. If we are going to reduce the supply of heroin, fentanyl, and illicit prescription opioids, then we have to reduce the de-mand through treatment. That must include increasing access to effective medication-assisted treatment, or MAT. Only about 1 in 10 individuals with a substance use disorder will be able to access treatment. That is unconscion-able and demands immediate action. That is why as part of the Comprehen-sive Addiction and Recovery Act—or the CARA bill of 2016—Senator R
AND P
AULand I worked together to include provisions that would, for the first time, allow physician assistants and nurse practitioners to prescribe life-saving medication-assisted treatment, like SUBOXONE, for individuals with substance use disorders. Since these provisions went into ef-fect, more than 8,000 physician assist-ants and nurse practitioners have reg-istered to provide medication-assisted treatment. That has resulted in more Americans accessing this lifesaving care, especially in community health centers and rural communities across this country. For doctors and medical professionals, MAT stands for medica-tion-assisted therapies, but for those with an opioid use disorder, expanding MAT means more access to treatment. Nurse practitioners and physician as-sistants want to respond to the demand side of the opioid crisis, and they are stepping up in a major way to connect individuals to the treatment they need. Unfortunately, the authority nurse practitioners and physician assistants have to prescribe this lifesaving treat-ment expires in a few short years. If we don’t intervene now, a substantial amount of our current prescriber popu-lation will no longer be able to treat individuals with substance use disorder using this effective treatment. That will further strain our already woefully inadequate treatment workforce. That is why Senator PAUL, Senator H
ASSAN , Senator C OLLINS , and I intro-duced new, bipartisan legislation to provide permanent MAT prescriber au-thority for nurse practitioners and physician assistants. Our bill also ex-tends this authority to other nursing professionals already playing an impor-tant role in our fight against the opioid crisis—certified nurse midwives, clin-ical nurse specialists, and certified reg-istered nurse anesthetists. These dedi-cated nursing professionals are irre-placeable members of our healthcare community, and we need to make sure they can provide treatment that saves families from the suffering of addic-tion. The legislative package we are vot-ing on today in the Senate unfortu-nately does not contain this bipartisan legislation on medication-assisted treatment. This is a missed oppor-tunity to build upon our commitment to treatment. But the House-passed opioid legislation does contain a version of our provision to make the prescriber authority for nurse practi-tioners and physician assistants per-manent and to expand that authority to the other nursing professionals. I will continue working with my col-leagues to ensure that this lifesaving provision makes it into the final opioid package negotiated between the House and the Senate leaders. The bill we vote on today cannot be the end of our efforts to help solve the opioid overdose crisis. The opioid crisis knows no boundaries, and neither should our efforts to combat it. Not only must we expand access to treat-ment, we must also think about how we can help to prevent addiction from taking hold in the first place. Last week, I introduced bipartisan legislation with Senator O
RRIN HATCH  to help ensure that patients and their loved ones understand the risks of pre-scription opioids. I have heard too many stories about substance use dis-orders that began from an opioid pre-scribed to an individual injured on the job who needed to feel well enough to return to work the next day, or to help heal a sports injury. That is the story of Cory Palazzi from Taunton, MA. In high school, Cory was a varsity baseball and football athlete and a member of the National Honor Society. He had a love for the game of baseball. For him, the baseball diamond was the happiest place on Earth. In his junior year, Cory suffered a shoulder injury that required surgery. After surgery, Cory was prescribed opioid painkillers and became addicted to his medication. His painkiller addic-tion eventually became a heroin addic-tion, and in 2013, Cory suffered a heroin

overdose, which has left him perma-nently disabled. Cory and his family, Lori and Dave, have turned this tragedy into triumph. Today, they share their story in schools and other organizations to warn the public about the dangers of drugs and offer a message of hope for those who are faced with addiction. We thank them for their courage, for their strength, and for their commitment to ending this crisis. The Palazzi family know firsthand that prescription opioids are dan-gerous, but because of the confusing names and ingredients, many families may not know that they have just left the pharmacy with a bottle full of dan-ger. The path from one bottle of pills— for patients who have had their wisdom teeth removed or suffered a sports in-jury—to addiction needs as many road-blocks put in place as humanly pos-sible. The legislation Senator H
ATCH and I have introduced—the Lessening Addic-tion By Enhancing Labeling Act, or the LABEL Opioids Act—would require that all prescription opioid bottles dis-pensed to a patient contain a clear, concise warning that opioids may cause dependence, addiction, or over-dose. In the absence of legislation to en-sure that providers across the country receive uniform, mandatory education on safe opioid prescribing, we need to give patients information on how to safely use, store, and dispose of these dangerous medications. In the same way we put warning labels directly on cigarettes for being addictive and caus-ing potential death, we need labels to caution patients about the dangers of prescription opioids. It is important that everyone who receives an opioid prescription understand the potential risks, and a sticker on an opioid pill bottle is a powerful, consistent re-minder of that danger. We must do all we can to put a stop to this dangerous opioid crisis that has ravaged families and communities across the country for too long. We are moving in the right direction, but to-day’s vote should not be the end of our work on this issue. I thank my colleagues in this Cham-ber for their commitment, and I look forward to working with them in the conference and beyond to make sure we put everything in law nationally that helps to ensure that children will have to look to the history books to find that there ever was such an epidemic as this opioid crisis. Once again, I thank Senator A
LEX-
ANDER and Senator M URRAY for their great work on this issue. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Maine. Mr. KING. Mr. President, the discus-sion today is about the opioid crisis, one of the most serious public health crises I have seen in my adult life, cer-tainly in the State of Maine. It is an enormous problem across the country, particularly in rural areas. In my State, we are losing more than one per-son a day to an overdose death. That is an epidemic by anybody’s definition. There are few rays of hope in this rather bleak picture. The numbers con-tinue to get worse. More and more fam-ilies are being devastated by this crisis, and there aren’t many answers being provided. There is, however, one ray of hope this bill we are going to be dis-cussing and voting on this afternoon does provide, and that is, treatment works; recovery is possible. I was at a rally in Portland, ME, just a week ago, with people of all ages from all over the State who were there to publicly say: I am in recovery. It works. Treatment saved my life. I think that is what is so important about continuing the work we have done in this body. The problem is, treatment, particu-larly in rural areas, is short on infra-structure. It is short on people who can deliver the treatment. We can fund pro-grams and talk about them here, but if you are talking about a rural county— about Milo, ME, in Piscataquis County, you are not talking about a tremen-dous amount of available infrastruc-ture, but there is available an army of people who can contribute to the solu-tion of this problem. The people I am talking about are nurse practitioners. Nurse practi-tioners are, in many ways, among the unsung heroes in the healthcare discus-sion—particularly, again, in rural areas where there aren’t a lot of physi-cians. Nurse practitioners were enabled in the CARA bill to provide medicine- assisted treatment, but the problem is, that authority expires in 2021. There-fore, we need to fix that. It is working. It is an important part of our ability to deliver these lifesaving services. In Maine, we have nurse practitioners who are ready, willing, and more than able, and they have proven that, to de-liver these lifesaving services—1,700 of them in the State of Maine. Unfortunately, the bill we are going to be voting on this afternoon does not have this extension in it. I am here this afternoon to urge those who are going to be supporting the bill, and then working on it in conference with the other body, to see that this small change—giving the authority for nurse practitioners to deliver medically as-sisted treatment to those people suf-fering and trapped in the throes of ad-diction—allowing those nurse practi-tioners to have that authority, to not have it expire in 2021 and create the anxiety, both in the patient commu-nity and in the medical community, that termination will create. Let’s, for once, do something before it is a deadline. Let’s do it now. I be-lieve we can do it as part of this discus-sion, as part of the final resolution of the bill that is going to be before us this afternoon, which I entirely sup-port. I think this is an important addi-tion that will strengthen it, and it will particularly strengthen the ability to deliver this care, this treatment that is so important to so many people and families and communities, particularly in the smaller towns of rural areas of America and in my State of Maine. So I rise to support the bill but also to suggest this small change that I think will dramatically increase the ef-fectiveness of the treatment the bill enables and will allow it to be deliv-ered in an equitable and direct and im-portant way to people all across the country—no matter where they live, no matter what the status of their health infrastructure is—because, as I say, nurse practitioners are an army of peo-ple who are ready, willing, and able to deliver this service. I hope we can make this one modi-fication to this bill that will allow that service to be provided not only between now and 2021 but on into the indefinite future when, hopefully, we can rid the country of the scourge of this terrible opioid and drug addiction. I believe this is something we can and should do. I look forward to work-ing with my colleagues to make this happen. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from New Hampshire. Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues Senator KINGand Sen-ator M
ARKEY for their remarks and their work as we all come together to battle this terrible opioid epidemic. I rise as the Senate considers bipar-tisan legislation that marks a critical step forward in the fight against the fentanyl, heroin, and opioid crisis. In New Hampshire, and all across our Nation, entire communities are being ravaged by this epidemic. In order to turn the tide, we need to combat the challenges communities are experi-encing from all angles; we need to col-laborate across traditional boundaries; we need to take a truly all-hands-on- deck approach because the magnitude of this crisis demands it. This crisis does not discriminate. I have spoken to so many individuals and families from all walks of life who are heartbroken and reeling. Their loved ones were professionals—stu-dents, athletes, parents—and then they fell victim to this illness, and their lives and the lives of those who loved them were never the same. Just this morning, I met with a num-ber of grandparents who are now the primary caregivers for their grand-children—a situation that many of us at first considered a phenomenon and now realize has become commonplace because the children’s parents have died or they are in prison or they are simply absent or unable to be a care-giver due to their substance use dis-order. I spoke this morning with this group of grandparents, two of whom have been raising their grandson for nearly 9 years now, one of whom has seen two grandchildren returned to their parents after their parents recovered from their addiction. In one case, the grand-parent whose grandchildren have gone

back to their parents is, at age 57, starting life completely anew. She had given up her job and gone through her entire retirement savings to keep her children safe while their parents bat-tled their addiction. Another set of grandparents, who again have given up everything to keep their grandson safe, are scared of going to court to get permanent custody and adopt their grandchild because they are concerned the child’s father will re-appear and contest the custody, and the cost of that custody battle will mean they have no money left to care for their grandchild. Most heartbreakingly, both sets of grandparents said to me they were wor-ried about what will happen to their grandchildren should they die since the children’s parents might not be able to be there for them. I was also reminded today that at one of our largest treatment centers in New Hampshire, the providers estimate that 40 percent of those in treatment have children, which means there will be more and more children in our com-munities who need their grandparents or other caregivers to step forward. This crisis is also taking a particular toll on first responders who respond to overdose after overdose, sometimes re-viving the same people on the same day. This crisis also impacts our work-force and our economy. I have met with a number of employers who can’t fill jobs because they can’t find work-ers who can pass a drug test. There are people now in recovery, some with con-victions on their record, who wonder if anyone will ever give them a second chance. There is a lot of collateral damage from this crisis. The good news is, just as the ripple effect of this epidemic touches all parts of our communities, people from all corners of New Hamp-shire and our country are responding— as communities, as friends and neigh-bors, and as first responders and healthcare providers—in a collabo-rative manner. This is a multifaceted problem, and it requires a multifaceted approach, but for too long we haven’t seen a Federal response that matches the urgency on the ground. I am hopeful that by passing this bi-partisan legislation, we can move for-ward. We have given communities and families some of the support they need and that they have been waiting for, aching for. This comprehensive legislation we are considering today includes many priorities the people of New Hampshire, particularly those on the frontlines, have been urging us to fight for. This bill reauthorizes and improves State-targeted response grants to en-sure that States hardest hit by this cri-sis—States like New Hampshire—con-tinue to get the resources they need. This legislation also includes the bi-partisan Comprehensive Opioid Recov-ery Centers Act, which I partnered on with Senator C
APITO , to offer grants to expand existing centers of care to pro-vide comprehensive coordinated care and support services like housing and employment reintegration for those who are in recovery. We have also heard loudly and clear-ly from our healthcare providers that we need a more integrated approach in order to combat this complex disease on all fronts. So this bill includes legis-lation Senator PORTMAN and I worked on together aimed at the next genera-tion of doctors, encouraging medical schools and residency programs to in-tegrate addiction medicine and treat-ment into their curriculum, as well as ensuring that doctors who get this training can apply right away to pre-scribe medication-assisted treatment as soon as they are licensed and have a DEA number. Members of law enforcement have made clear that they need additional tools to crack down on bad actors in the pharmaceutical industry whose be-havior has greatly contributed to this crisis. So Senator G
RASSLEY , Senator C
RUZ, and I worked on a provision to make those tools available and to help hold industry bad actors accountable. This legislation also curbs the impor-tation of deadly fentanyl and other synthetic drugs being shipped through the borders to drug traffickers in the United States. These are just a number of the key provisions included in this bill. As the Senate moves forward and moves into negotiations with the House of Rep-resentatives, I will work with Members of both parties to make important im-provements. For example, we should keep working in a bipartisan way to include a provi-sion making permanent prescribing au-thority for nurse practitioners and physician assistants, which were some of the measures that Senators M
ARKEY  and K
ING were just talking about. Nurses and physician assistants are vital parts of our care workforce, in-cluding and especially in rural and un-derserved areas, and their prescribing authority should be made permanent, and we should allow additional ad-vanced practice nurses to prescribe. I am pleased that we are taking this step forward today, and I am grateful for the Senate’s bipartisan work that has brought us to this point—the con-sideration of the bill on the Senate floor. I am particularly grateful for the work of Senator A
LEXANDER and Sen-ator M
URRAY . This legislation is a vital next step in our efforts to combat this crisis. The biggest mistake anyone could make is thinking that our efforts are anywhere close to being done. As the families I met with this morning made clear, we have a lot more work to do. I am encouraged by the progress of this bill, and I believe its implementa-tion will help us mount a much more informed and comprehensive response to this devastating epidemic. I also re-main encouraged that we have secured a significant increase in Federal fund-ing to combat this crisis through our budget negotiations. Let there be no mistake. We will need to continue to work together. In particular, we will need to learn about which treatment and recovery prac-tices will be successful in the long run, and we will need further research to es-tablish best practices for supporting a newly at-risk cohort—the children of those with this disorder. We have been responding to and learning about this disease as the epidemic unfolded, and there is much we do not know and much we still need to tackle. I am encouraged that Members of both parties have come together, dem-onstrating that we can put partisan-ship aside and work together to address some of the most dire challenges our communities face. We owe it to all of the many stakeholders in this fight to keep listening to them, to keep col-laborating together, and to keep work-ing on solutions so that we can truly make progress and get better. This is a good start, but it is and must be only a start. I yield the floor. RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER  
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-jority leader is recognized. 
HURRICANE FLORENCE  
Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, since the Senate last convened, Hurri-cane Florence made landfall on our Na-tion’s eastern seaboard. According to the latest estimates, this terrible storm has already claimed more than 20 lives in North Carolina, South Caro-lina, and Florida. With more than 1 million Americans subjected to manda-tory evacuations, many families have been displaced, and the storm surge and historic rainfall have brought com-munities to their knees with crippling flooding. The Senate stands with all of those affected, and we stand ready to ensure that communities in the storm’s path have the resources they need to recover and rebuild, once the time comes. For now, we stand in solidarity with the Americans who are battling this storm and with first responders, who bravely risk their own safety to care for their communities. 
PATIENT RIGHT TO KNOW DRUG PRICES ACT  
Mr. President, on another matter, today, the Senate will take two impor-tant actions to help vulnerable Ameri-cans. First, we will pass the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act, spear-headed by Senator C
OLLINS . This legislation would ban so-called pharmacy gag clauses, which prohibit pharmacists from sharing drug pricing information that would save consumers money. In circumstances when the out- of-pocket retail cost of a medication is actually cheaper than the price through insurance, it will allow cus-tomers with access to the information they need to choose the more afford-able route. After that, we will vote on major, landmark legislation to address the

opioid crisis that continues to weigh on our country. My fellow Kentuckians and I are all too aware of how drug abuse and addiction attack families and communities. Overdoses killed 1,500 Kentuckians last year alone. That is more than four fatalities per day. Nationwide, it is more than 115 fatali-ties per day. The effects of this emergency com-pound themselves. The crisis can eat away at family ties, at community in-stitutions, at economic opportunities— precisely the things that are necessary to lift Americans out of addiction and into recovery. On the one hand, research suggests that opioid use rose the most in the very communities where employment fell the most. On the other hand, ex-perts blame opioids themselves for a major share of falling workforce par-ticipation, to the tune of roughly 1 mil-lion missing workers. A comprehensive crisis demands a comprehensive solution. That is ex-actly what this landmark legislation is. It combines work from 5 committees and input from 70 Senators. First, this legislation will help cut off the opioid crisis at its roots. It will stop more drugs at the border, improve interstate monitoring, and encourage reform of prescription dosing. It will encourage recovery through more re-sources for State and local responders, better access to care for patients, and more support for the families and care-givers of those affected. This legisla-tion looks to the future by surrounding long-term medical research and eco-nomic solutions to get our county past this vicious cycle. I am pleased that two of my provi-sions are included—the CAREER Act, which expands grants and targets fund-ing for transitional housing and job op-portunities to help recovering individ-uals find their footing and stay sober, and my Protecting Moms and Infants Act, which will refine our Federal ef-forts to combat the effects of opioids on expecting mothers and their unborn children. The situation facing Americans and communities is urgent. With this land-mark legislation, the Senate has risen to the moment. It is no wonder that ex-perts and advocates representing 200 organizations on the frontlines of the opioid crisis have publicly called on the Senate to act. That is exactly what we will do when we pass this landmark legislation later today. 
NOMINATION OF BRETT KAVANAUGH  
Mr. President, on a final matter, it has been 70 days since the President nominated Judge Brett Kavanaugh to fill the current vacancy on the Su-preme Court. For more than 2 months, the Senate has pored over Judge Kavanaugh’s professional record. We have reviewed the 300-plus opin-ions he has authored while serving on the DC Circuit, more pages of docu-ments than have ever been produced for a Supreme Court nomination—more than for the past five nominations combined—and testimony from promi-nent legal scholars and top litigators who have praised the nominee’s intel-lect and his exemplary performance on the Federal bench. We have also considered a wealth of evidence that pertains to Judge Kavanaugh’s character and his per-sonal integrity. We have heard testi-mony or received open letters from lit-erally hundreds of men and women who know Brett Kavanaugh, who have worked alongside him, who have clerked for him as a judge, or who have known him and his family personally over the years. This is what the Senate has considered for the past 70 days. In the Senate and around the country, al-most everyone who went into this proc-ess with an open mind and who was prepared to give Judge Kavanaugh a fair hearing has come away impressed. But now an accusation of 36-year-old misconduct, dating back to high school, has been brought forward at the last minute, in an irregular manner. It is an accusation that Judge Kavanaugh has completely and unequivocally de-nied. This is what he said: This is a completely false allegation. I have never done anything like what the ac-cuser describes—to her or to anyone. 
It is an accusation that the ranking member on the committee of jurisdic-tion has known about for at least 6 weeks—known about for 6 weeks—yet chose to keep secret until the 11th hour. Neither she nor any of her Demo-cratic colleagues chose to raise this al-legation during the committee staff’s bipartisan background calls with the nominee. They did not raise it, even with the name redacted, in the 65 meetings—65 meetings—that Judge Kavanaugh held with Senators before his confirmation hearings, including his private meeting with the ranking member. They did not raise it, even with the name redacted, in 4 days of exhaustive public hearings while Judge Kavanaugh testified under oath, even though they chose to raise myriad other matters at the hearing, including sometimes bizarre innuendo. They did not raise it in the closed ses-sion, the proper forum where such an allegation could have been addressed with discretion and sensitivity. They did not raise it in the thousand-plus followup questions Senators sent to Judge Kavanaugh in writing. At the 11th hour, with committee votes on the schedule, after Democrats have spent weeks and weeks searching for any possible reason the nomination should be delayed, now they choose to introduce this allegation—not through the standard bipartisan process, not by advising the Judiciary Committee col-leagues and committee staff through proper channels but by leaking it to the press, because the chain of custody of this letter runs through the Demo-cratic side of the Judiciary Committee. That is the chain of custody. I can’t explain the situation any bet-ter than the senior Senator from Maine put it yesterday evening when she said this: If they believed [Judge Kavanaugh’s ac-cuser], why didn’t they surface this informa-tion earlier so that he could be questioned about it? And if they didn’t believe her and chose to withhold the information, why did they decide at the 11th hour to release it? It is really not fair to either of them the way it was handled. 
As the senior Senator from Texas said earlier today, ‘‘that Democrats have so egregiously mishandled this up until now, is no excuse for us to do the same.’’ Just because the Democrats have egregiously mishandled this, said Senator C
ORNYN , is no excuse for us to do the same thing. I am glad that Chairman G
RASSLEY is following standard practice and regular order. As he has stated, he plans to pursue this matter by the book, with bipartisan interviews of both Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford. I have great confidence in Chairman G
RASSLEY and his ability to proceed through this process. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Montana. 
OPIOID EPIDEMIC  
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues in this body for their hard work and their true bipar-tisan efforts to address the opioid and drug crisis in the United States. The legislation before us will help to com-bat an epidemic that touches the lives of almost every person in our country. In Montana opioid overdoses have claimed the lives of 700 people since 2000. From 2013 to 2014, 42 percent of all drug-related deaths were caused by opioids. With easier access and a larger supply on the street, we are finding opioids in the hands of more and more people. It is tearing families apart. It is devastating our communities. While we must focus on combating the opioid crisis, we must also continue to address a related but separate epi-demic that is wreaking havoc in Mon-tana and in many other States; that is, the methamphetamine epidemic. In Montana, meth is destroying fami-lies and communities and dispropor-tionately impacting our Tribes. In fact, we have seen a 415-percent increase in meth cases from 2011 to 2017, and a 375- percent increase in meth-related deaths in that same timeframe. To put this in perspective, in 2013, law enforcement seized 40 pounds of meth. In 2017, that number more than quadrupled to 188 pounds. Almost all meth in Montana is smug-gled across the southern border. We have seen a dramatic increase of that drug flowing from Mexico into our communities. Meth is linked to more violent crimes and robberies than any other drug. Meth is highly addictive. It is de-structive; it destroys the body both in-side and out. We are seeing sad story after story on the effects and impacts of meth and drug use in Montana making headlines. In fact, just last week, a man was charged with leaving a baby in the woods near Lolo Hot Springs. He ad-mitted he was high on meth and bath

salts. According to reports, he left a 5- month-old in the woods because ‘‘he grew tired of carrying it.’’ While this is a despicable and hor-rible story, this is just one of many we are seeing across Montana. I am thank-ful—I am thankful for those on the ground in Montana for diligently work-ing to combat this crisis, including our very own attorney general, Tim Fox, as well as our local law enforcement. At the Federal level, our goal must be to partner with States and commu-nities to overcome this devastating re-ality, and that is why I fought for spe-cific provisions to be included in this opioid bill we are going to pass this week. My bipartisan legislation, the Miti-gating METH Act, expands the State- targeted response to the opioid crisis grants to include Indian Tribes as eligi-ble recipients and is included in this broader legislation that we have before us. This initiative is extremely impor-tant to curbing substance abuse on In-dian reservations. The STOP Act, another bipartisan bill that I have cosponsored, is in-cluded in this package before this body. This bill helps stop illegal drugs from crossing the border or being shipped through the Postal Service. Additionally, programs like the high intensity drug trafficking areas, drug courts, and the COPS Anti-Meth Pro-gram are all reauthorized in this pack-age, and I can tell you something: These are vital resources in combating meth use in Montana. Without these tools, we will continue down a dark path, but I believe, with these pro-grams and by passing this bipartisan bill in the U.S. Senate, we can begin to finally curb this problem. I truly want to thank my colleagues, and I look forward to passing this leg-islation and sending this to the Presi-dent’s desk. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Maryland. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, shortly we are going to have an opportunity to vote on the Opioid Crisis Response Act of 2018, which I strongly support. But I want to share with my colleagues a roundtable discussion I held in Balti-more just a few hours ago. In an area of Cherry Hill, I met with leading experts in regard to the opioid crisis. We had leadership from Baltimore city, Balti-more County, Anne Arundel County, representatives from the State, and a lot of different other organizations. It started with Dr. Jason Kletter, who is the president of BayMark, giv-ing us a tour of the new facility that he opened up in Cherry Hill. This is a won-derful new facility for opioid addiction. It uses medicines in order to control a person’s addiction, and it is a state-of- the-art facility. It was just opened last month—or 2 months ago—so it is a brandnew facility. I asked Dr. Kletter exactly how he was able to do this. The first thing he mentioned to me was the importance of the Affordable Care Act. Because of the expansion of Medicaid and the coverage for addiction and the coverage of essen-tial health benefits within the Afford-able Care Act, the clinic can get a lot more reimbursement for the people who use the facilities, giving them the wherewithal to be able to construct a new facility in the community, giving access to care for those who have ad-diction. We then heard from Jose Rodriguez, who is the Baltimore City Health De-partment’s director of opioid overdose prevention, and he told us about a lot of the innovative programs we are looking at in Baltimore in order to pro-vide treatment to opioid-addicted indi-viduals. One of the innovations that Mayor Pugh of Baltimore wants is known as a stabilization center. A stabilization center would be 24/7, which is critically important. People who are stressed normally are not during normal busi-ness hours, and it is important to have availability in the inconvenient hours of the early morning. An emergency room provides that access, but the problem is that emergency rooms— many—are not capable of handling peo-ple who have OD’d, and that individual could become very disruptive within the emergency room setting, making it difficult for the hospital to provide adequate care for the other patients. So the mayor of Baltimore wants to establish a stabilization center, which would be 24/7 and available to handle people who have drug problems when they need it and provide the necessary services not only to save their life, but to put them on a track to deal with their addiction needs. We are very proud of the leadership in Baltimore city to move forward on this, and I wanted to share with my colleagues some of the innovative pro-grams that are being suggested. Linda Bryan is the Baltimore County program manager for recovery-oriented systems of care. She was telling us about a program in Baltimore County where they use peer coaches or a peer support system, people who have gone through the addiction recovery proc-ess. They train them under this pro-gram, help them to go out and coach those who are suffering from addiction, so they not only get treatment, but they stay in treatment, and they have a road to recovery. It is an innovative program that is working well in Balti-more County. We then heard from Jen Corbin, who is the program director for the Anne Arundel County crisis response team. Here we have an innovative program known as safe stations, and let me ex-plain this. This is 24/7 also. I have al-ready told you the need for 24/7 pro-grams. What the leadership at Anne Arundel County—and this is a county that borders Baltimore and borders An-napolis; Annapolis is part of Anne Arundel County, so it is an urban area, but it has some rural aspects to it. They allow every one of their fire sta-tions—every single one in their coun-ty—to be accessible 24/7 for any indi-vidual who is stressed and needs help with regard to their drug problems. When they set this program up, which was less than a year ago, they were expecting to get about five visits a week. They are getting 5 to 10 visits a day—a day. People are coming in to get rid of their drug paraphernalia. No questions asked—they will take it there. They are getting in there to ac-cess the system as to how they can deal with their drug addiction prob-lems. They are seeking care. They are going in there when they are stressed, and they are getting care. First re-sponders will provide immediate help, and they have the availability of coun-ty services to get people into treat-ment 24/7. It is working. It is working so well that we have people from other counties who are re-ferring their people to go to Anne Arundel County to go to the fire sta-tion. Just this past week, one of the private insurers asked one of their in-sured: Why don’t you go to the Anne Arundel fire station in order to get help? We need to expand these types of pro-grams. The fire chief told me one other thing, which was very interesting: Since they started this program, theft crime in Anne Arundel County is down 13 percent. Theft crime, of course, as we all know—a lot of it—feeds habits, and this program is paying off in the community with reduced crime. I mentioned today’s roundtable. I have had about a dozen in Maryland throughout the entire State, from the Eastern Shore to Western Maryland, to the Washington suburbs, the Baltimore suburbs, Southern Maryland, the northern counties, and there is a com-mon theme. The common theme is that there is no simple answer to the opioid crisis. It involves not only a health issue—and we need to have services for our health—but we also need to recog-nize that it deals with transportation, it is a social problem, and it deals with how the courts handle these issues. There are multiple disciplines involved in dealing with the opioid epidemic, and that is why I am so pleased that we are going to have a chance to vote on the Opioid Crisis Response Act of 2018. We all know that despite our great efforts here—and we have provided bil-lions of dollars of additional Federal support for these programs—the opioid crisis is still on the rise. The number of OD deaths are still increasing in many parts of the country. Every community is experiencing challenges with the opioid crisis, so it is appropriate that we are taking comprehensive action to deal with this problem. The Opioid Crisis Response Act of 2018 reauthorizes and improves the 21st Century Cures Act. Governor Hogan, the Governor of Maryland, has strongly urged us to pass this section. In fiscal year 2017, Maryland received $20 mil-lion under the Cures Act, and these modifications will help States like

Maryland do even more. It is a true Federal partnership with our State and local governments to deal with this cri-sis by providing greater base support for opioid problems. Secondly, this bill provides com-prehensive opioid recovery centers under SAMHSA. Why is this impor-tant? This allows for locals to apply for Federal grants for innovative new pro-grams. I mentioned the stabilization pro-gram in Baltimore city. There is also one in the Upper Shore. There is no di-rect funding for stabilization centers because they are not hospitals, and they don’t fit into the normal reim-bursements. This program that is in-cluded in the Opioid Crisis Response Act will allow grants to move forward on these innovative programs, such as the one in Baltimore city. The legislation provides for us to deal with peer support, an area I have championed on the Finance Com-mittee, and I have talked frequently on this floor about the importance of peer support programs. This legislation will help provide technical assistance in order to provide peer support but also asks the GAO to take a look at Med-icaid reimbursements to see whether we can’t have a more comprehensive way to deal with peer support reim-bursement. It expands telehealth, an area that I have been directly involved with. I am happy to hear that. That is an impor-tant part of dealing with the opioid cri-sis. It deals with a new area that we haven’t really dealt with before, and that is housing. As I said, the problem of opioid addiction is not just health, it is also housing, and this legislation will provide a way in which we can help the homeless and deal with housing issues in order to make people less vul-nerable to being left out of opioid re-covery. It does deal with the underlying causes, with research and development in nonaddictive pain killers to get CDC grants and to look at mechanisms to control prescription drugs. It also deals with the killer effect that we have in fentanyl. Fentanyl, as you all know, is a synthetic drug that is primarily produced in China, but there are other sources that come into this country and are mixed with heroin causing, in many cases, instant death. This legislation will provide a way in which Customs will have greater en-forcement to keep fentanyl out of the United States and will provide detec-tion for first responders so they can protect themselves, because they go on a scene, there may be fentanyl there, and if they don’t know it, they can be-come afflicted by this synthetic drug. All of this is good news. I have only scratched the surface of a lot of the provisions in this bill. It is a com-prehensive bill. It is bipartisan. It rep-resents the work of several of our com-mittees, including the Senate Finance Committee on which I proudly serve. I urge my colleagues to pass this leg-islation, and let’s increase the govern-ment’s role and deal with this crisis in all parts of America. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER  
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. E
RNST ). The Democratic leader is rec-ognized. 
NOMINATION OF BRETT KAVANAUGH  
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, over the past few days, new allegations have come to light about President Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh. These allega-tions ought to be treated with the ut-most gravity. The allegations are ex-tremely credible. They were made by someone who voluntarily submitted to a lie detector test and had been dis-cussed in the past—long before Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Su-preme Court—with a family therapist. I believe her, and many, many Ameri-cans believe her. Many women in America who have been taken advan-tage of certainly believe her. For too long, women have made serious allega-tions of abuse and have been ignored or dragged through the mud. It would be a disgrace if this body and our fellow Re-publicans let that happen. Chairman G
RASSLEY must postpone the vote on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomi-nation until, at a very minimum, these serious and credible allegations are thoroughly investigated. The FBI con-ducted a background check on Judge Kavanaugh before these allegations were known. When they did their back-ground check, the FBI had no knowl-edge of what went on, so it is now the FBI’s responsibility to investigate these claims, update the analysis of Judge Kavanaugh’s background, and report back to the Senate. The FBI is the right place for this in-vestigation for two reasons: First, the FBI has the resources, the information, and the legal tools to con-duct an investigation the right way— far better than some staffer talking to Professor Ford on the phone. You can-not lie to the FBI—that is a crime. The FBI will get to the truth. They almost always do. Second, our Republican colleagues have run a transparently partisan con-firmation process, and then they imme-diately insinuated that Dr. Ford is being untruthful. Republicans and their staff cannot impartially inves-tigate these allegations; they have al-ready said that they are not true. Re-publicans and their staff cannot do this in a respected way because they have run such a partisan investigation thus far. There is no bipartisanship here— none—so to have any credibility, this has to be done by an independent, out-side body. The FBI is the best one. The vote must be postponed until it is complete. It would be an insult to the women of America to rush this through after these serious allegations have been made. It would be an insult to the majesty of the Supreme Court to rush this through when these serious allegations have come forward. In addition, Dr. Ford has said she is willing to testify before the Judiciary Committee. Does anyone believe it is better for staff to talk to her on the phone—Republican staff only because no Democratic staff will participate in this biased, far-fetched process. Does anyone think it is not better for her to come testify? Then why can’t she? Chairman GRASSLEY should provide the American people the forum to hear her out. I believe she is credible. A lot of my Republican friends don’t. What are they afraid of? Are they afraid that she might be very persuasive? Well, if she is, it will be a whole different ball game, won’t it? Chairman G
RASSLEY should and must provide the American people the forum to hear her out and decide for them-selves whether her testimony reflects on Judge Kavanaugh’s character and fitness for the Supreme Court. Of course, he can have a chance to testify again, too, and both of them said they would. Why in the Good Lord’s Name— why wouldn’t we do that? Why? There is no reason. No reason. There is no re-quirement, rule, or precedent that says the Judiciary Committee must move forward on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomina-tion this week—none. What is the rea-son we have to rush it through when these allegations are hanging out there, when women who are victimized deserve the right to be heard at the very minimum? Then the gall of my dear friend the Republican leader, who delayed Justice Scalia’s seat being filled for 9 months, to say that we can’t take a couple of extra weeks—unmitigated gall. The seat of Justice Scalia was held open for a long time, and now, with no reason, my colleague says we can’t do that. Chairman G
RASSLEY has to stop play-ing games, pretending like the nomina-tion can continue to glide through while at the same time the Senate con-ducts a review of these allegations. Hastily arranged private phone calls with committee staff members is not even close to constituting a fair and thorough review, is not part of any sort of regular order, and does not sub-stitute for an FBI background check or public hearing. Again, let me ask my dear friend the leader, what is the reason, now that both Judge Kavanaugh and Professor Ford have said they will come and tes-tify, that we won’t do it? Give me one good reason. One. It is unrelated to how we became aware of these allega-tions. Whether you like it or not, there is a right for them to be heard. With allegations as serious as the ones before us, the Senate must not—it cannot for the honor of the Senate— conduct a haphazard, slipshod review of Dr. Ford’s claims or be rushed to a vote. There must be time for the FBI to do its work and for the Judiciary Committee to properly prepare to hear testimony from Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh. There is another issue here. Judge Kavanaugh’s credibility has already

been seriously questioned in the after-math of his testimony regarding emails stolen from the Judiciary Committee by a Republican staff member, his in-volvement in the nomination of Judge William Pryor, and other controver-sies. In all of these cases, Judge Kavanaugh’s credibility was questioned because documents revealed that he was far more involved than he led on to when he testified. Now, he has unequivocally denied this. So there is an issue of credibility here. You have two people with diamet-rically opposed views as to what hap-pened. This is not just an argument for its own sake; it is for a nomination to the Supreme Court, the highest Court in the land, which determines through their legal rulings the lives of Ameri-cans and in many instances is seen as the arbiter of right and wrong. Are we going to let this happen, not even hear what someone who believes she was terribly aggrieved—and I be-lieve her—has to say? When the credi-bility of a Supreme Court Justice is on the line, we are going to just brush it under the rug—again, after delaying Merrick Garland for over 1 year—with no explanation as to why we can’t wait a much shorter period of time? The double standard, the twisting of this body into a cruel, nasty partisanship, unprecedented, in a feverish desire to fill the bench with people with whom the other side agrees—it is one of the lowest points I have seen in my years here. I want to applaud my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have called for hearings. I believe one way or another, six have said this should be delayed. I hope they will be strong. I hope they will tell Leader M
CCONNELL  he is doing the wrong thing. Dr. Ford deserves to be heard. To railroad a vote now would be a deep insult to the women of America and a lasting scar on the integrity of the Supreme Court. 
OPIOID EPIDEMIC  
Madam President, now on another matter, tonight the Senate will take up legislation that will help our coun-try fight back against the opioid epi-demic. The bill will help people from all backgrounds and all ages and is de-signed to address the spectrum of opioid addiction. That means medical prevention and law enforcement pre-vention, reversing overdoses, helping those in treatment, and enabling those in recovery to get back to their lives. On this one, we have had real biparti-sanship. Democrats and Republicans came together to pass major funding increases to fight the opioid crisis. When we consider the Labor-HHS ap-propriations bill this week—I hope we will see it signed into law soon by the President—Congress will have appro-priated $7 billion over 2 years to ad-dress opioid addiction, and that fund-ing is now making its way to the States. The legislation we will consider this week is another side of the same coin. The funding increases are important, and now this bill will complement those efforts by making important pol-icy changes and creating new programs to help providers, first responders, law enforcement, communities, and fami-lies fight back against the scourge of addiction. Stopping this crisis will take a multifaceted effort, and this bill recognizes that fact. I want to thank Members on my side whose legislation is included in this bill: Senators BALDWIN , D ONNELLY , M
ANCHIN , MCCASKILL , NELSON , CASEY , H
EITKAMP , and K LOBUCHAR . Many more Democratic Senators contributed to this bill, as did many Republicans, and I thank them for their hard work. Addiction has held too many Ameri-cans in its grip for too long. We cannot let up our efforts to fight this scourge. In the coming days and weeks, Con-gress will work diligently on merging the Senate bill with the House bill that has already passed. It is my sincere hope that we will come to an agree-ment and that we will have a new opioid law signed in the future. 
HURRICANE FLORENCE  
Madam President, along with so many others, my heart goes out to the people of the Carolinas and sur-rounding States. To see the pictures of houses being flooded—it breaks your heart to see the devastation. It re-minded me of what happened in my State a few years ago with Sandy. Our hearts go out to these people. The Federal Government always pulls together when part of the Nation has a problem. I am not going to look up the voting record of those from the other side who are now going to ask for aid when they voted no when my State was so beleaguered. I don’t believe that is the proper way to approach this. They are suffering, and we need to be there for them. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Ohio. Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, my colleague from Maryland spoke earlier about the opioid crisis and the fact that we are about to vote on legis-lation tonight that is called the Opioid Crisis Response Act. He talked a little about some of the innovations going on in the State of Maryland. We are fortunate, in my home State of Ohio, to have some great work going on as well. Like the Stabilization Cen-ters he talked about, we now have in Ohio the opportunity for people who are treated for addiction to be given this miracle drug, Narcan, which re-verses the effects of the overdose. They are able to not just go to an emergency room, where they can be taken care of for this reversal of the overdose, but also get into treatment. The Maryhaven Addiction Stabiliza-tion Center in Columbus, OH, has be-come a model not just for Ohio but for the country. It is one of the early cen-ters where they are taking some of the Federal funds we passed here and using them to come up with innovative ways to get people into treatment. Their success rate is over 80 percent. Unfor-tunately, that is not true with regard to other instances where someone is given this Narcan—usually by a first responder or in an emergency room set-ting—then does not go into treatment but rather goes back to the environ-ment and the old community or the gang where the addiction happened in the first place. In so many instances, first responders are called again, and sometimes again and again, to provide that Narcan to the same individual. That is not helping anyone. It is cer-tainly not helping that individual in taking this disease of addiction and dealing with it in a serious way. Sta-bilization centers are a great idea. We are starting to do some of these things back home. It is an innovative way that will help us turn the tide. This legislation we are voting on to-night will help in that regard. It pro-vides additional funding and additional help for some of these new approaches that we badly need. Sadly, despite some progress based on legislation we passed about a year and a half ago, the CARA Act and Cures Act—which we will talk about in a moment—things are not getting bet-ter; they are getting worse. Every State in this Chamber has been affected by this issue. This chart behind me shows those States which last year had an increase in overdoses from opioids and other drugs. If you had an increase, you are in orange. If you had a decrease, you are in blue. Sadly, as you can see, States, including my home State of Ohio and the Pre-siding Officer’s home State of Iowa, saw an increase. Overall, there was about a 9-percent increase in overdose deaths last year in America. Based on the Centers for Dis-ease Control data we got about a month ago, it was 72,000 people. Think about that. That is, of course, more in-dividuals than we lost in the Vietnam war, and 72,000 means that this is the No. 1 cause of death now in America for those under the age of 50. In my home State of Ohio, it is the No. 1 cause of death, period. We are in a crisis. We are in an epidemic. Despite some of these new innovations going on back in our States, we continue to see these grim records year after year. We need to reverse this. Tonight’s legisla-tion will help do that. As an example, Franklin, OH, which is in the center of Ohio near the Columbus area, just in the past 9 days, recently experienced 29 overdose deaths. Do you know what the coroner said? The coroner said this spike was caused by a synthetic drug called fentanyl. Fentanyl is about 50 times more pow-erful than heroin. Fentanyl is the No. 1 killer now. We need more people to get into treatment to overcome the disease of addiction and do more to keep this fentanyl—this new scourge—out of our communities. This legislation will do both of those things. This is consensus legislation. There are five committees that were

able to provide input for this legisla-tion. They had public hearings. They contributed ideas to it. That includes the HELP Committee, Judiciary, Fi-nance, Commerce, and Banking Com-mittees. I applaud the HELP Com-mittee chairman, L
AMAR ALEXANDER , because he pulled together all these ideas from these four or five different committees and helped us come up with this consensus package. I would like to thank Majority Lead-er M
CCONNELL and Democratic Leader S
CHUMER for agreeing to bring this leg-islation to the floor tonight. It doesn’t include everything all of us want to see, but it has important new initia-tives, and it is a step in the right direc-tion. I note this one issue we couldn’t in-clude in this broader package is the ar-bitrary cap that is now in place on so many treatment centers. They are capped at 16 beds for Medicaid reim-bursement, which is really a vestige of a previous policy to get people out of institutional care with mostly mental health focus, but it is having an effect on this opioid crisis we talked about because people who are ready to get into treatment are told there is no room. This is for residential treatment. We have a solution to it. We will in-troduce legislation on that tomorrow. We are told that in conference, we can try to work something out because the House has legislation that addresses this. I appreciate Senator A
LEXANDER ’s willingness to do that. Senator C
ARDIN , who was on the floor earlier, and I talked about this. He is part of a bipar-tisan group putting our ideas out there to allow these good treatment centers to be able to take in more people with-out an arbitrary cap. This package builds on two legisla-tive projects I talked about earlier— the Comprehensive Addiction and Re-covery Act and 21st Century Cures Act. The CARA legislation, the Com-prehensive Addiction Recovery Act, provides resources directly to evidence- based programs that are working: pre-vention, treatment, longer term recov-ery, and helping our first responders. The Cures legislation, 21st Century Cures, doesn’t go straight to the groups—organizations and nonprofits. It goes to the States. Then the States decide how that money is spent. These laws, again, are beginning to make a difference for the people we represent, helping these communities to push back and fight and try new things. Even before those bills passed, some in this Chamber got together to talk about how can we ensure we have the adequate resources to take on this issue. Also, in our appropriations bills, these bills are being funded above the amount we approved here or author-ized. That is good. In about 2015, just a few years ago, we began to see this fentanyl issue really rise. In my home State of Ohio, by the summer of 2016, it had invaded our State at crisis levels. In 2014, we had 503 fentanyl overdose deaths. In 2015, that rose to over 1,000 deaths and 2,357 deaths last year. Fentanyl was respon-sible for more than half of those people who died of overdoses in my State and in the country last year. The numbers are now coming in for 2017, and we are hearing it will be about two-thirds of the deaths in Ohio as we continue to hear numbers for this year, 2018. This trend of increasing fentanyl overdoses rings true all around the country. Fentanyl overdoses nationally reached nearly 30,000 last year. That means they have increased by 850 per-cent just in the 4 years between 2013 and 2017. Between 2013 and 2017, we have seen an 850-percent increase in overdoses due to this one drug, this synthetic opioid fentanyl. Here is a chart that talks about this a little bit. It shows that with regard to some drugs, as tragic as the over-dose rates are, heroin as an example, is pretty flat, going from 2015 up to 2018. Here is fentanyl—synthetic opioids. As you can see, it has gone up dramati-cally. This is the new scourge of the opioid epidemic. It is 50 times more po-tent than heroin. It is relatively inex-pensive on the streets and relatively accessible. As a result, many traf-fickers have turned to this. Fentanyl is being spread to other drugs. So heroin is being laced with fentanyl. Cocaine is being laced with fentanyl, even crystal meth. This increases the potency of those drugs, increases the chance of an addiction, and with the rise of fentanyl, of course, we are seeing more and more deaths because of its power. We are also seeing that no street drug is safe from a potential overdose and death. I heard a number of tragic examples recently during our last two tele-town-hall meetings. We have another one to-morrow night. I am sure I will hear about it. The first case was last month. Sam from Shelby County talked about the fentanyl issue. He was talking about it objectively and policywise and then his voice changed and the emotion was clear. I asked him if he had a fam-ily relationship with this drug or if anything had happened. He acknowl-edged his son died from a fentanyl overdose. His son died a few weeks be-fore the call. His son didn’t know he was taking fentanyl because it had been laced in another drug. The next tele-townhall meeting, also last month, Pauline from Zanesville called in and told me her brother passed away from a fentanyl overdose. He was a heroin addict, but he had no idea he was taking fentanyl. It was laced in the heroin, and he overdosed and died. In both of those cases, they weren’t using it knowingly, but the autopsy re-vealed it was fentanyl. This is hap-pening all across our country, and it is causing these historically high over-dose deaths. This historic trend is why we began looking into fentanyl and seeing what we can do it about it. Senator M
CCASKILL is on the floor. We conducted an 18-month investiga-tion into this under the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, PSI. We asked: Where is this coming from? How can this be happening in our coun-try? We found out something shocking, which is, it is primarily produced in laboratories in China, and it is pri-marily coming to the United States through the U.S. mail system—our own government agency, the Postal Serv-ice. Our investigators identified how easy it was to get these drugs into the United States. We had an undercover operation where we posed as buyers. Based on that, we found out these over-seas sellers essentially guaranteed de-livery if the fentanyl was shipped through the U.S. Postal Service. If you send it through a private carrier, it is not guaranteed—FedEx, UPS, DHL, one of those. If they sent it through the Postal Service, they guaranteed deliv-ery. Why is that? The Postal Service has a weaker screening policy than these private carriers. That is because of Congress. After 9/ 11, Congress said to the private car-riers, you have to have a better screen-ing policy, including providing ad-vanced electronic information to law enforcement on every package that comes into America. They were doing it for other contraband and explosives more than fentanyl, but that is effec-tive now because law enforcement and Customs and Border Protection can identify these packages. Otherwise, it is like finding a needle in a haystack. Think about that. There are 900 million packages a year in the post office alone. We need this data. Law enforcement uses it. I have seen them do it. I have gone to the distribu-tion center and have seen how they pull things off. They put on protective gear to open these packages because fentanyl is so deadly. The information tells them where it is from, what is in it, and where it is going. They then use Big Data to identify suspicious pack-ages and keep some of this deadly drug out of our communities. The law does not require the post of-fice to do that. After 9/11, we said to the private carriers: You have to do it. We said to the post office: You need to study this issue and get back to us. They have never gotten back to us. We need to get back to them and say: You have to do it too. This is a minimum. We at least have to know what is in these packages coming into our coun-try so law enforcement can stop some of this poison that is overtaking our communities and robbing thousands of Americans of their God-given purpose in life. It is not to be an addict. It is not to overdose and die. We need to help. The STOP Act—legislation I au-thored with my colleague Senator AMY K
LOBUCHAR from Minnesota—is in-cluded in this larger opioid package, which we will vote on this evening. The STOP Act does just that. It closes this loophole. It says to these traffickers:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6170 September 17, 2018 
You are not going to be able to con-tinue to exploit our U.S. Postal Service to ship your fentanyl into America. It is a commonsense solution. It deals with the most deadly aspect of the opioid epidemic and simply re-quires the Postal Service to get this data 100 percent from China now, 70 percent for the rest of the world by the end of this year, and by 2020, 100 per-cent every package. This will help stop the flow of this poison coming into our communities, but it will reduce the supply and raise the cost, which is part of the issue with the accessibility of fentanyl. Once en-acted into law, it will help. Tonight is an opportunity for us to vote on this package. The House and the Senate package is identical. If we vote on it tonight and get it passed, it will go to the President for his signa-ture. It will help. Is it all we need to do? No. We need to continue to fund CARA and Cures, as we talked about, to deal with the de-mand side of this, the prevention side, the treatment, and longer term recov-ery. This legislation also has a number of initiatives in that area. Some were talked about earlier, others were not. It builds on the CARA 2.0 legislation we introduced recently, which was the next step after the Comprehensive Ad-diction and Recovery Act. For instance, one thing it has in this bill, from CARA 2.0, is a national qual-ity standard and best practices for re-covery housing. Yes, recovery housing and Silver Living is important. There have been too many examples of hous-ing that have not had the kind of qual-ity you would expect, even allowing drug use within that recovery housing. We can’t allow that to continue. This ensures that people transitioning out of treatment will have high-quality op-tions. This legislation also authorizes sup-port for high school and college stu-dents to help children and young adults recover from substance abuse dis-orders. We have some amazing models in Ohio on this. The Collegiate Recov-ery Community at Ohio State is an ex-ample. Columbus is opening its first re-covery high school next year. CARA 2.0’s contribution to the opioid legislation also includes help for the most vulnerable among us, the babies. There is $60 million for a plan of safe care for babies born dependent on drugs. This provides treatment to ba-bies born with what is called neonatal abstinence syndrome. Their mothers are addicted, and they develop a de-pendency on drugs in the womb. These innocent babies then have to be taken literally through the process of with-drawal. I have been to neonatal units around our State to see these babies. It is a sad and tragic thing to see. We need more help to ensure these babies get the care they need so they may get through this withdrawal process. To help the newborn babies further, the legislation also includes the CRIB Act, which is bipartisan legislation I coauthored that will help newborns who are suffering from addiction to re-cover in the best setting possible, and it will provide support for their fami-lies. The CRIB Act says that families can be reimbursed for providing the love and care the children and babies need at that time. It is a very sad situ-ation. I see this across my State, but I also know this is happening across the country. There is a great group called Brigid’s Path in Dayton, OH, which I have had the opportunity to visit. It provides loving care and support for these ba-bies, but it gets no reimbursement for it. This is an opportunity to provide as much care and treatment as is nec-essary to help these children achieve their potential in life. The CRIB Act and the $60 million in funding will help the babies who have been born depend-ent on drugs. It will help Brigid’s Path and other great organizations like it to help these kids in need. There are a number of other impor-tant programs that will be reauthor-ized in this legislation, including the drug courts, drug-free communities grants, and high-intensity drug traf-ficking areas grants, to help our law enforcement at every level be able to push back against drug traffickers. As we pass this legislation, much as we did 2 years ago with the passage of CARA and CURES, Congress is com-mitting itself to actually putting poli-tics aside—it is not just bipartisan; I think it is nonpartisan—to dealing with the real epidemic that is out there, and to helping the people we rep-resent. It is not a moment too soon, as 72,000 lives were lost last year. These are not just statistics; these are people with hopes and dreams and families. We need to help those who are gripped by addiction to break free from those grips. We need to give those in law enforcement the tools they need to stop these poisons from infiltrating our country. We need to once again commit ourselves to additional resources at the Federal level that can help our States and our local communities and our pri-vate sector respond. The comprehen-sive opioid legislation we are voting on today, including the STOP Act and more, will help to do just that. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Louisiana. 
S. 2554 
Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, I speak as a Senator who is also a physi-cian. In my medical practice, I have learned that if the patient has the power, then the patient can make the wisest decision both for her health and for her pocketbook. I am here to support the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act, which is legislation that has been put forward by my colleagues Senators C
OLLINS and M
CCASKILL and which I am privileged to cosponsor. Right now, our healthcare system is designed, if you will, to shake as much money as possible out of the patient and out of the taxpayer—all to the ben-efit of others but not to the patient and not to the taxpayer. One of the most egregious examples is the phar-macy gag clause. With a pharmacy gag clause, when at the pharmacy, if it will be cheaper for you to pay cash for the drug as opposed to through your insur-ance deductible, the pharmacist, through his contract, may be restricted from telling you that. If the phar-macist does tell you that, the phar-macist will lose his contract with the pharmacy benefit manager. So you will pay more by paying your insurance de-ductible instead of less by paying cash for the drug. That money is taken away from you and is given to the pharmacy benefit manager. That is wrong. This bill, the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act, gives that power to the pharmacists and to the patients to come up with a solution that will be best for the patients’ health and their pocketbooks. By the way, it does more than that. It also requires that biologic and bio-similar drug manufacturers report po-tential pay-to-delay agreements to the Federal Trade Commission and the De-partment of Justice, as is currently done with small molecule grams and generic manufacturers. This will allow biosimilars to get to the market soon-er—again, saving the patient money and saving the taxpayer money. Yet there will be an amendment put forward that will dilute the impact of this bill and will restrict the provisions of this bill to those plans that are self- insured. I will point out that the three largest pharmacy benefit managers control 72 percent of the market for drug dis-tribution—multibillion-dollar corpora-tions that operate across all States. It clearly falls within Congress’s pur-view, as it regulates interstate com-merce, to pass a bill such as that. In defeating this bill or in watering it down, it is, again, one more way to take power away from patients and money away from patients and from taxpayers to the benefit not of the pa-tient and her health and her pocket-book but of the large PBM. The Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act is a key step in our fight to lower drug costs for patients. I ask my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation, which will give patients the power to save money on their pre-scriptions, and to support the bill as is. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise in support of the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act, which is legisla-tion that I have introduced with Sen-ators MCCASKILL , B ARRASSO , STABE -
NOW, and C ASSIDY . Our bill has also been cosponsored by Chairman L
AMAR  A

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6171 September 17, 2018 
taking up a bill that has widespread bi-partisan support and that is going to really make a difference. This commonsense bill would ban the use of pharmacy gag clauses—an egre-gious practice that prevents phar-macists from telling their consumers when they can purchase those prescrip-tions for less money by paying out-of- pocket rather than by using their in-surance. This legislation is action that we can take right now to help lower the costs of prescription drugs for some consumers. More than half of Americans, as well as more than 90 percent of seniors who are, say, 65 or older, take at least one prescription drug each month. Ameri-cans have been estimated to spend nearly $45 billion out-of-pocket each year for prescription drugs. According to a recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, as many as one out of five Americans does not fill a needed pre-scription because they are unable to af-ford it. I witnessed this struggle firsthand re-cently at a pharmacy in Bangor, ME. When a couple ahead of me in line re-ceived their prescription, they were told by the pharmacist that the copay would be $111. The husband looked to his wife and said: Honey, we just can’t afford that. They turned around and walked away, leaving the prescription behind. I was so upset when I saw that that I asked the pharmacist: How often does this happen? His reply: Every day. Our bill would ensure that phar-macists could volunteer information to customers on how to lower their costs for prescription drugs. A recent study that was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 23 percent— nearly one-quarter of prescriptions filled through insurance—ended up costing consumers more money than if they had purchased the drugs without using their insurance. Who would think that using your debit card rather than your insurance card to purchase a pre-scription drug would be less expensive? It is, of course, so counterintuitive that consumers do not think to ask this question of the pharmacists, and gag clauses in contracts prohibit phar-macists from volunteering this infor-mation to patients. They prohibit them from telling patients how to obtain the lowest prescription drug prices. Thus, consumers are paying more than they should unless they ask for specific guidance. Americans have the right to know which payment method provides the most savings when purchasing their medications. By prohibiting gag clauses, our legis-lation takes concrete action to lower the cost of prescription drugs, saving consumers money and improving healthcare. More than 40 organizations support our bill that will ban this unfair re-striction, including the National Com-munity Pharmacists Association, the American Medical Association, the Al-liance for Transparent & Affordable Prescriptions, the ERISA Industry Committee, the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, and Amer-ica’s Health Insurance Plans. Our bi-partisan bill was approved by the HELP Committee, with unanimous support, on July 25. The administra-tion has also condemned gag clauses and is on record as supporting our bill. Despite this widespread support for banning this egregious practice that restricts the free speech of phar-macists, Senator L
EEhas filed an amendment that would eviscerate our bill. The Lee amendment would limit the gag clause prohibition to only self- insured employer plans. That would ex-clude all other employer group and in-dividual market plans. Under the Lee amendment, approximately 85 million Americans would be excluded from pro-tection. Think about that. There are 85 million Americans who are receiving coverage under employer-sponsored plans or in the individual market who would be excluded from this protection. The gag clauses that would be banned in our bill are unconscionable regard-less of the type of insurance plan. We know that patients who do not take their medications experience greater complications. One study has estimated that medication nonadher-ence costs the healthcare system some $337 billion, not to mention there being poorer health outcomes for the individ-uals affected. The Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act prohibits gag clauses from being used by health plans that are sponsored by employers or offered in the individual market. The Federal Government’s role in regulating these plans and protecting consumers who are served by these markets is already well established. The Employee Retirement Income Se-curity Act—better known as ERISA— was enacted in 1974. Employers who sponsor insurance plans for their em-ployees, as defined by ERISA, are able to deduct the expenses associated with these plans. These expenses are also not subject to the payroll tax. In 2017, the value of the Federal tax benefit for employer-sponsored health insurance was estimated at $260 billion. I strongly support our State-based system of insurance regulation. Indeed, I spent 5 years overseeing the Maine Bureau of Insurance as Maine’s com-missioner of professional and financial regulation. Our bill does not change the longstanding deference to States on this issue. Yet I would note that even though ERISA preserves the au-thority of the States to impose insur-ance regulations on fully insured plans, these plans must still comply with a multitude of provisions that have been set by the Federal Government, and it has been that way for many, many years. For example, regardless of State law, a fully insured health plan must comply with COBRA and must cover minimum hospital stays after child-birth, reconstruction after a mastec-tomy, and students who take medically necessary leaves of absence. Also, these plans are prohibited from discrimi-nating based on genetic information. Unlike Senator LEE’s amendment, our legislation would prohibit gag clauses in all group health plans so that no matter how the employer de-cides to provide insurance coverage, the employees are able to get the best prices for their medications by con-sulting freely with their pharmacists. Our bill will also prohibit the use of gag clauses in individual health insur-ance plans, protecting consumers who don’t have employer-provided insur-ance and who are, rather, purchasing insurance on their own. Americans who purchase insurance in the individual market may qualify for tax credits to help cover the cost of their policies or they may be eligible for tax-preferred savings accounts, such as health savings accounts estab-lished by the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. Senator L
EE’s amendment will eliminate the protections our bill provides for these individuals, many of whom already face growing out-of- pocket costs. We need this bill as a complement to another bill we passed just recently that prohibits these gag clauses for the Medicare Part D prescription plans. This is a companion bill to that legisla-tion. The bottom line is this: Pharmacists should not be restricted from telling customers if there are other ways for them to purchase needed prescription drugs less expensively. The administra-tion has made banning these clauses a top priority, and this important con-sumer protection should be written into law. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to oppose Senator L
EE’s amendment and to support passage of S. 2554. Today the Senate can go on record taking a concrete step to help reduce prescription drug prices for some consumers. It makes no sense to exclude 85 million Americans from this protection, as Senator L
EE’s amend-ment would do. Reducing prescription drug prices must be a national priority. I am pleased to yield to the leading cosponsor of this bill, Senator M

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6172 September 17, 2018 
When people find out there is actually a pharmacist who is legally prohibited from telling them that you can pay 8 bucks if you just want to pay for it, but you will pay 20 bucks if you use your insurance plan—that is real money. That matters to Missourians. We know the data shows that in 2013 alone, Americans paid about $135 mil-lion more than they should have. Why? Where is that money going? Who is making that money and why? We need to get a better deal for people. We have so many problems with pre-scription drugs. This is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the work this body needs to do to bring down pre-scription drug prices. This is low-hang-ing fruit. The notion that we can just simply say: Pharmacists, you have the right to tell your customers they can get it cheaper, that is all we are doing. We are saying: Pharmacists, you have the right to tell your customers they can get it more cheaply. That is why the Lee amendment is so perplexing to me. Why would you want to leave 85 million people behind? I get the ideology about regulation, but sometimes common sense needs to scoot all the ideology out of this place, and we need to just look at the barebones issue of how we save people money on prescription drugs. That is what this bill will accomplish. Today was a big day for me. A bill that I am the Democratic cosponsor of, the President of the United States tweeted he supported it. Yowza. That is a big deal for me. I am thrilled the President of the United States tweeted this afternoon that he supports this legislation. It shows you not all is lost in this town. Every once in a while, we can get together. I see my friend Senator B
ARRASSO  over there. He is a cosponsor on this bill with Senator K
ENNEDY . It is really exciting to me when we have one of these moments where the administra-tion agrees, Secretary Azar agrees, Re-publicans agree, and Democrats agree. If we can do this more often, maybe the people in this country will renew their faith in us as a body. I am thrilled we are going to have a chance to get this done. I hope the body listens to the arguments my col-league made about the Lee amendment and how misguided it is in leaving so many Americans behind in terms of these cost savings. While I am on the floor, I would also like to just briefly mention another vote that I think is important. I am very glad we are expanding grants for first responder training, opioid preven-tion, and all the other important things we are doing in this bill, but I am truly disappointed that it doesn’t include a commonsense proposal that I worked with Senator C
ASSIDY on that would provide more transparency on those who are lobbying on opioid-re-lated issues. My office did an investigation through the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, where we discovered there are all these advo-cacy organizations out there, such as the American Academy of Pain Man-agement and others, that are deriving a lot of their budget from the opioid manufacturers. The opioid manufactur-ers are giving money to organizations, and, in many instances, they are just fronts for lobbying on behalf of opioids. For example, we know that over $9 million was given to these organiza-tions, with half of that coming from Purdue, the biggest manufacturer of OxyContin. I am not saying we should prohibit them from doing that, but people ought to know it. We ought to make it transparent. That is all the bill does. It just makes payments by opioid manufacturers to organizations that are 501(c)(3)s or 501(c)(4)s and re-quires them to just say the opioid man-ufacturers are behind their budget. One of these groups actually lobbied CDC about not lowering the rec-ommended dosage of opioids. Another one entered a brief in a case arguing that a doctor shouldn’t be convicted, when he was prescribing thousands of pills a day, for moving controlled sub-stances. Transparency is always a good thing. I am disappointed and frankly confused as to why some of the Members on the other side didn’t want to include this proposal in this package. I certainly want to thank Senator CASSIDY for his help. We tried very hard to get it in the bill. I hope it is not because Big Pharma has a vice grip on this place. I have seen it before, and it worries me that this might be the case. There is irony in this. Not only is that provision not included but guess what is included. There is a provision in the bill that authorizes Federal money to one of these advocacy groups. Guess what. It is an advocacy group funded by pharma. I think it is ironic that we are more comfortable giving Federal money to one of these groups that can serve as a front organization for the opioid manu-facturers that helped create this crisis than we are in requiring disclosure of the private funding for these groups. I am hopeful we can either get the bill in conference or, more importantly, get that other provision out. By the way, if we are going to allow Federal grant funding to these organi-zations, it should be all of them on a competitive basis, on merit, not name one that gets the money. There is something up there. There is some-thing up there when you just name one that gets the money. I have learned that around this place. I hope the bill passes today. I am honored to work with Senator C
OLLINS on this important prohibition on the gag rule. It will save Missou-rians money. It matters. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Wyoming. Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I also come to speak on this important piece of legislation and in favor of this important piece of legislation. I just visited with Senator COLLINS , who knows—as so many Members of this body do—that I practiced medicine for a long time before coming to the Senate. I took care of a lot of Wyoming families as a practicing physician. As a doctor, I often prescribed medi-cation to help my patients fight dis-ease and to improve their quality of life, so I know the importance of pre-scription medication. I also know the importance that pharmacists play in the lives of their patients as well be-cause the same patients I am taking care of, the pharmacist is also caring for. In so many ways, the pharmacist has to be able to speak freely to their patients about information about their medications. Pharmacists are often that last line of defense when they place a call to the doctor’s office to say: Mrs. Jones is here. By the way, you prescribed this, but don’t forget that she is allergic to this medication, and there might be some interaction, or she is already on this medicine, or this patient is on that medicine. Pharmacists provide vital and impor-tant roles to patients on a daily basis. It happens all around the country. They need to be able to speak freely about those things. They need to be able to speak freely about the things that can save a patient’s life and also things that can save a patient money, and that is what this whole piece of legislation is about. I know many patients fail to take medications that their doctors might prescribe because of the cost involved, the expense of the medicines. That is why I am so glad to see President Trump make it a priority to find ways to lower the costs that people pay for their medicine. The administration ac-tually put out a blueprint for ways we could address drug costs. Part of the plan was to eliminate the so-called pharmacy gag clauses. Phar-macists should not be gagged. They need to be able to talk with the pa-tients, whether it is about drug inter-action, the drug use, how to take it, how to use it properly, and the costs. These are important things for a phar-macist to be able to discuss. These gag clauses are clauses that are sometimes included in contracts that are not between the patient and the pharmacist. They are contracts be-tween a drug company and an insur-ance company. This needs to be stopped. The gag clause says that if a patient brings a prescription to the drugstore to be filled, the pharmacist cannot talk about the cash price of the drug. It is not allowed. It is wrong. Maybe someone had an insurance plan where their copay for the medi-cine, let’s say, was $10, and the pre-scription they are filling actually cost them $5 if they paid in cash, but under the gag clause, the pharmacist is not allowed to say anything about it. Phar-macists need to be able to speak up. It

is important. It is important for the patient. It is important for the integ-rity of the process. Right now, the pharmacist can’t tell the patient: You know, you can save a little money if you just paid cash and you didn’t bother to use the insurance along the way. The way things are now, the insurance company would collect its $10 copayment from the patient. They only have to pay $5 to the drug company and keep the rest, and the pa-tient doesn’t know anything about it. The patient is left in the dark because the pharmacist cannot share this im-portant information with the patient. I believe it is wrong, and that is why I cosponsored the legislation that is on the floor right now. The Trump administration has taken a close look at the situation, and they completely agreed. They said people should know if there is a simple way they can save money. As we vote on this legislation today, I am hoping Congress agrees. Earlier this month, the Senate passed legislation that prohibits the gag clauses for Medicare plans, and that was the right thing to do. It passed unanimously, and I am so happy to see that. Today we are taking the next step. We are going beyond Medi-care. This legislation we are about to vote on eliminates the gag clauses in insur-ance plans that people get through their employer, through their work, or plans they buy on their own. It is not just Medicare that we took care of be-fore, this takes it to the next step, giv-ing the pharmacists the freedom to speak. We are saying with a clear voice today that patients should be able to talk with their pharmacists and phar-macists should be able to talk with their patients to know if they are pay-ing the lowest price for their medica-tions. I support this bill. I thank the Mem-bers who led this bipartisan effort. It was a privilege to work with Senator C
OLLINS , Senator S TABENOW , Senator C
ASSIDY , and Senator M CCASKILL , who was just on the floor, to get this done. I appreciate your attention, Madam President, to this important piece of legislation. I look forward to voting to support it and getting it passed today and getting it down to the President for his signature. Thank you. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I come to the floor to thank my col-leagues for working so hard on this very important legislation we are going to pass tonight to deal with the opioid crisis. From Port Angeles to Spokane, I guarantee my colleagues that I have heard about this problem, I have seen how our communities are struggling, and this is the very help that they have been asking for. They want new tools, they want better solutions, and they want us to join the fight against drug manufacturers who push these drugs out to communities when they should be following a process and reporting so that our law enforcement can cut down on the huge amounts of opioids stream-ing into our communities. This legislation does many things, and I am glad that it does. The STOP Act will help crack down on shipments of fentanyl into the United States via the U.S. mail, which is something that is very important that we do, and I thank my colleague from Ohio for that. It authorizes funding for a new grant program to help train law enforcement and protect them against the deadliest opioids, like fentanyl, because their ex-posure to it has been so unbelievable and it is a risk to them every day they are out there doing their job. This bill reauthorizes the drug courts program, which many people in the State of Washington have told me has been beneficial to how they deal with this crisis as it relates to the individ-uals in their States, helping nonviolent offenders recover and helping them move forward. It reauthorizes the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Program, which uses Federal resources to help local law enforcement crack down on illicit drug rings. We need to help law enforce-ment, which is dealing with this prob-lem every single day, to have the tools to do this job. The fact that it reau-thorizes the High Intensity Drug Traf-ficking Area Program is just the kind of tool they need. This bill also makes permanent the ability for doctors to treat up to 275 pa-tients with the kind of treatment that is necessary for them, which also helps us to get to people faster and to get them into a recovery situation faster. One thing I really want to draw at-tention to is this issue of hearing over and over about how opioid manufactur-ers have flooded our communities with a product when, in reality, current law says they are supposed to monitor and track the distribution of this drug. Well, in too many cases, those safe-guards have not been followed. Throughout their process, they weren’t reporting on suspicious orders of opioids that prevents them from ending up in the wrong hands, and in some in-stances, they ended up in the hands of a black market, which then continued to flood communities with the product. In one example, a physician in Ever-ett, Washington, wrote more than 10,000 prescriptions of opioids. This number of prescriptions was 26 times higher than the average prescriber in Everett, Washington. So he wrote 26 times more opioid prescriptions than the average provider. However, the drug manufacturer failed to report this suspicious activity. When we authorized this drug, we said this process is what has to happen. Because of its highly addictive nature, it has to be tracked. Law enforcement has to keep track of and be advised of anything that looks like suspicious ac-tivity. This abnormally high number was a clear red flag that should have been reported. Instead, the opioid man-ufacturer turned a blind eye to the neg-ligent distribution. In response to those abuses, people in my State and in many other States have been critical and have filed law-suits because they have been so con-cerned about this issue. What is clear, though, is that we need to do some-thing now to make sure that opioid manufacturers follow the law that is already on the books about the report-ing of suspicious distribution or vol-umes of distributions that are sus-picious. Today, this legislation takes a major step forward on that front by in-cluding penalties for negligent opioid distribution strong enough to serve as a deterrent to those manufacturers against the actions we have seen in the past. The bipartisan Opioid Crisis Re-sponse Act includes provisions from legislation that I and Senator HARRIS  from California authored. Our provi-sions increase the civil and criminal penalties on companies that fail to take responsible measures to prevent their drugs from entering the black market. Our legislation increases the civil penalties by 10 times, from $10,000 to $100,000 per violation. That adds up very quickly in what we think have been transactions that have been very suspicious. In addition, the bill in-creases the maximum criminal penalty to $500,000 for companies that willfully disregard and/or knowingly fail to keep proper reporting on these distribution activities. Again, this is what we put into the law because of the highly addictive na-ture of these drugs. We said that they have to be monitored and their dis-tribution has to be monitored because prior to today the slap on the wrist was not enough of a deterrent, and most of those requirements were ignored. Today, we are putting a much more stringent requirement in the law to say that they will get serious fines if they don’t follow the law. This is such an important issue that a bipartisan group of 39 U.S. state at-torneys general sent a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee in support of this effort. Our own attorney gen-eral, Bob Ferguson, helped in pro-moting that effort, and I want to thank him. The state attorneys general said: 
Diversion of prescription opioids has dev-astated communities in our states. The con-sequences for turning a blind eye to sus-picious opioid orders cannot merely be a cost of doing business. We urge you to support . . . the CARES Act to ensure that penalties

effectively hold manufacturers accountable and help stem diversion. 
So I agree with those state attorneys general, and I am so glad this is in-cluded in this legislation. Creating a more serious attitude toward the ille-gal distribution of this product and its falling into the hands of black markets is so serious. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I yield the floor. Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, our Nation is in the midst of the worst drug epidemic in its history. There is no town too small, no suburb too wealthy to be spared. Every day, more than 115 Americans die from an opioid overdose. In the past 3 years, there has been a 53-percent spike in drug over-dose deaths in Illinois, with more than 2,400 lives lost in 2016. I am glad we are finally doing something to address this crisis. To truly prevent addiction and stop the next drug epidemic, we need to look at the factors driving this crisis. I am pleased that several of my bills to help prevent opioid addiction have been included in the bill before us. Whether it is witnessing violence, ex-periencing a parent’s opioid addiction, or facing abuse in the home, traumatic experiences can harm a child’s brain. Thanks to the Adverse Childhood Ex-periences, ACEs, study and advance-ments in brain science, we know that, left unaddressed, these events can have an impact on future health problems, mental illness, drug use, and the cycle of violence. But with the right care and support, we can help heal children who experience trauma and prevent serious, negative consequences. I want to thank Chairman A
LEX-
ANDER and Ranking Member M URRAY  for including legislation I introduced with Senators H
EITKAMP , CAPITO , and M
URKOWSKI . Our language will help train more teachers, doctors, social services, first responders, and the jus-tice system to recognize signs of trau-ma in children and provide help to those in need. Our provisions will improve coordina-tion between Federal agencies, ensure more Federal funding is used to pro-mote these skills and awareness, and expand the workforce capable to pro-viding care. In 2016, Big Pharma produced 14 bil-lion opioid doses—enough for every adult in America to have a 3-week sup-ply of opioids. Each year, the Drug En-forcement Administration, DEA, sets the amount of opioids allowed to be produced in the United States. Between 1993 and 2015, DEA allowed production of oxycodone to increase 39-fold and hydrocodone to increase 12-fold. The sheer volume of opioids manufactured each year increases risk of abuse—four of five new heroin users started with painkillers. One problem is that, when setting an-nual quotas, DEA is unable to look at how a drug is abused or leads to over-dose deaths. Why should DEA be hand-cuffed from considering the real-world misuse of oxycodone pills when it sets the production levels? This package in-cludes my bipartisan bill to strengthen DEA’s ability to adjust quotas to re-flect the risk of opioid misuse, while improving flexibility to avoid any shortages. I want to thank Chairman GRASSLEY , Ranking Member F
EINSTEIN , and DEA for working so closely with me and Senator K
ENNEDY . It is a good thing that we are now talking about drug ad-diction as a treatable disease, not a moral failing that should be punished. Sadly, it has taken us too long to get here. The opioid epidemic also underscores the importance of having quality health insurance—coverage that in-cludes mental health and substance abuse treatment. But once again, President Trump wants to allow insur-ance companies to discriminate against people with a preexisting con-dition—such as an opioid addiction— and promote ‘‘junk’’ insurance plans that don’t cover substance abuse treat-ment. I will fight tooth and nail against efforts to repeal, gut, or sabo-tage this quality care so that we do not return to the dark days of coverage de-nials and sky-high premiums. The legislation before us addresses several important factors, and I am happy to support it today, but it ne-glects many more actions we need to take. This opioid package fails to include my bipartisan bill with Senators B
ROWN and P ORTMAN , which would lift an outdated barrier to addiction treat-ment that restricts Medicaid from pay-ing for care in facilities larger than 16 beds. We have worked in a thoughtful, open process to improve this legisla-tion and address any policy concerns, and I look forward to including our re-vised bill in conference with the House. We must also hold the pharma-ceutical industry accountable for its role in creating the epidemic through their deceptive conduct. Drug compa-nies have profited from flooding the market with painkillers, often with misleading information, and should have to pay for the addiction treat-ment that their products have caused. Additionally, executives from Perdue Pharma, Janssen, Abbott, Endo, Insys, and other manufacturers must testify before the Senate to explain their role in this epidemic. Today’s bipartisan opioid legislation is an important step forward, but we need to do more, and quickly, to meet this destructive crisis head-on. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, eight Americans die of a drug overdose every hour. In 2016, more Americans died from drug overdoses than during the entire Vietnam war. The 2017 figures are even worse. Pre-liminary estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in-dicate that over 71,000 individuals lost their lives to drugs. More than 5,000 of those individuals were Californians. Addiction has never had such a pro-found impact on our country. On October 26, 2017, the Trump ad-ministration declared the opioid epi-demic a public health emergency. How-ever, this has done little to stem the tide of overdose deaths or to effect this public health crisis that has a strong-hold on our communities. Our government can and must do more. It is not enough to declare the obvious, that this epidemic is an emer-gency. As with any emergency, triage must begin immediately. That means swiftly executing and implementing whole-of- government strategy to end the devas-tation. That also means rapidly infus-ing funds to support this strategy and prevent more deaths. The Opioid Crisis Response Act of 2018 does just this. It provides a road-map for action and authorizes the nec-essary funds to allow the government to better triage care for those in need while simultaneously providing re-sources necessary to keep these drugs off the street. This legislation recognizes that there is no one size fits all approach when it comes to effectively addressing addic-tion. That is why it consolidates bills that span five committees, including six from the Judiciary Committee. The bipartisan Opioid Crisis Re-sponse Act establishes a number of new drug prevention and treatment pro-grams. It also extends other critical agencies and programs, including the Office of National Drug Control Policy and the Drug-Free Communities, the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas, and drug court programs. Moreover, the bill provides the Jus-tice Department with new legal au-thority to hold opioid manufacturers and distributors accountable if they fail to identify, report, and stop sus-picious orders of opioids. The bill also preserves legitimate ac-cess to pain medications, while allow-ing the Drug Enforcement Administra-tion to consider, for the first time, fac-tors like drug abuse and overdose deaths when setting annual production quotas for certain opioids. The Opioid Crisis Response Act effec-tively balances prevention, treatment, recovery, and law enforcement. This legislation bolsters the efforts of our public health experts, gives law enforcement and first responders the authority and resources they need to combat illicit narcotics, and will help spur the development of alternative therapies and drugs to help decrease our nation’s reliance on opioids. The fact that this bill includes pro-posals that were sponsored or cospon-sored by more than half of the mem-bers of this body illustrates that vir-tually no State, no community, and no family is left untouched by addiction. It is also indicative of the fact that we must act, and we must act urgently. We must treat this public health cri-sis like the emergency that it is. We must stop the devastation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6175 September 17, 2018 
I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to see that this important piece of legislation, which is supported by more than 200 organizations nationwide, is enacted into law. Thank you. Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I have heard from people across Wash-ington State about the need to respond to the opioid crisis and its tragic im-pact on so many families and commu-nities. I have visited with people from communities in Seattle and Everett and Longview, and I have heard from families across my State. I know my colleagues across the aisle and across the Nation have heard from constitu-ents about the urgency of this crisis. So I am really glad today that the Sen-ate is able to come together and pass the Opioid Crisis Response Act—the bi-partisan legislation I have been work-ing on with Senator A
LEXANDER and so many others. This bill is a bipartisan compromise. It is not what I would have written on my own, and I know it is not what my colleagues on the other side would— have written on their own, but it is the result of more than 70 proposals from Members on both sides of the aisle, and that is important. The bill we will vote on today does not reflect the full agree-ment struck between Democrats and Republicans. I am glad that Chairman A
LEXANDER  and Republican leaders have worked with us as the bill has hit the final stretch here in the Senate and that they committed to a number of specific changes beyond the text of this bill to make sure we could have this vote to-night and keep working to get it signed into law. The text of our agreement has been released, and I am hoping that Repub-lican leaders live up to their agreement to take this agreement into the con-ference and work by our side in con-ference to get this done in the bipar-tisan manner it began. This agreement goes to show that when we work together, when we focus on the problems families are actually facing and when we look for common ground and commonsense solutions, we can actually craft and pass legislation. This agreement is a much needed and long overdue step toward helping those families on the frontlines of the opioid epidemic to address its root causes and ripple effects, including some of the issues, by the way, that I have heard firsthand in my State. I heard from hospital staff about how many of the babies they deliver are born with neonatal abstinence syn-drome, battling symptoms of opioid withdrawal, which is why I fought to make sure this agreement includes sup-port for State efforts to include plans of safe care for children born to moth-ers battling addiction and also ensures the health department is implementing strategies already identified to protect moms and babies from the effects of opioid substance abuse. I heard from an elementary school principal about how some of his stu-dents are having trouble focusing in class because they deal with the trau-ma of a family member’s addiction at home, which is why I worked to make sure this agreement includes provisions to develop a task force and grants to help support trauma-informed care pro-grams and increase access to mental health care for children in their com-munities, including their schools. I heard from many more experts and everyday people, as the HELP Com-mittee held a series of bipartisan hear-ings focused on this crisis. We heard about the many different faces of this epidemic and the broad challenges we have to consider to make sure we ad-dress its root causes and ripple effects, which is why I worked with my col-leagues to make sure this agreement includes provisions to address the eco-nomic and workforce impacts of the opioid crisis, support for training to help the nearly 1 million people out of work due to opioid addiction to gain and retain employment. Washington State has already received a grant for this important work to get workers back on their feet after they battle ad-diction. So I am glad we could expand this valuable grant program. This bipartisan package of proposals is an important step forward to help our families and communities who are on the frontlines of the opioid crisis, and I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to see it signed into law. While this bill is an important step, it is by no means final. We have a lot more to do to end the tragedy and ad-dress the ongoing issue. So even as we work to get this agreement across the finish line, I am going to keep fighting for more support, resources, and solu-tions for the families in my home State of Washington and across the country who are facing the heartbreak of this epidemic. I yield the floor. 
S. 2554 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, as the Senate debates the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act, S. 2554, I rise to offer my views on the need for transparency in drug prices and to offer my strong endorsement of this bill. This legislation that we are voting on today represents a serious, bipar-tisan effort to lift barriers that prevent pharmacists from informing consumers about how much prescription drugs cost. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation. Every day, Americans buy prescrip-tion drugs without a true idea of how much those drugs cost. Pharmacists should be able to tell you if there is a cheaper way to buy prescription drugs, and yet they are unable to do so. Due to so-called gag orders, pharmacists can be prevented from providing this information proactively to patients. With prescription drug costs rising, Americans should have access to trans-parent pricing information, especially when it can lower their costs. Today, the Senate takes a significant step toward improving drug price transparency. With the passage of the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act, S. 2554, pharmacists would be able to fully inform patients of the cost of the medications they are purchasing. It is ridiculous for a patient to not be told that their copay is actually more than the full cost of the medicine they need. By banning gag clauses, this bill ensures that customers have a right to know the lowest possible price avail-able for a drug at the pharmacy. This is an important first step in advancing drug cost transparency. In addition to price transparency, the actual cost of medicine continues to be a major issue. Pharmaceutical compa-nies often price drugs as high as they believe the market will allow and have no other constraints on how much they charge. We see this happening not only in branded drugs but in price spikes among generics as well. For example, the recent announcement that major hospital systems and philanthropy or-ganizations have banded together to create their own nonprofit generic drug manufacturing company, Civica Rx, shows just how concerning the problem of reasonably priced drugs, as well as drug shortages, has become. I’ll watch with great interest as this endeavor moves forward to produce 14 common drugs used by hospitals—with the first due out next year. The bill we are voting on today solves just one piece of a very large puzzle, and we must do more. In this distinguished body, we should advance legislation that would direct the Sec-retary of Health and Human Services to negotiate drug prices in Medicare. I am a cosponsor of the Choose Medicare Act, which includes this provision. We should also move legislation that pro-vides real financial protection for con-sumers and limits their monthly copays for prescriptions. I am a cospon-sor of the Consumer Health Insurance Protection Act, which includes a copay cap of $250 per month on prescription drugs. Let’s dig in to the real cost of pre-scription drugs and look for creative solutions that support innovation but ensure that lifesaving drugs can reach patients. A cure doesn’t matter if it costs too much to reach those who need it. The problem of prescription drug costs is real, and it impacts American families across our country. This prob-lem forces seniors to choose between food and medicine. This problem pre-vents families from being able to care for their loved ones due to the high cost of expensive drugs. In fact, accord-ing to a report by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 24 percent of people re-ported that they or a member of their family either did not fill a prescrip-tion, skipped doses, or cut pills in half due to the cost of the drug. And 44 per-cent of those surveyed said they wor-ried about not being able to afford the medications they needed. This is

wrong, and it must be fixed. Today, we start to right that wrong by voting to pass the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act. But more is expected and more must be done. Let’s build on the bipartisan work that helped us pass the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act tonight and make a real difference for American families. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I sug-gest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. M
ORAN ). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, this morning, in Nashville, as I got on the plane, the headlines were not about tweets or collusion with Russia or even the Supreme Court nomination. The headline was this: Senate set to OK bill on opioids. Within a few minutes, we are about to vote in the Senate on legislation that Senator M
CCONNELL , the majority leader, has called ‘‘landmark legisla-tion.’’ It is legislation that 72 of the 100 Members of this body have made a con-tribution to. They are not just cospon-soring it. They have a piece of this bill. This legislation has come through five different committees of the Senate, and we have been working on it for sev-eral months. The reason it is on the front page of the newspapers in Tennessee and the newspapers in Kansas and the news-papers in Wyoming and the newspapers in Maine is because opioids are our most serious public health epidemic, and the Opioid Crisis Response Act that we will be voting on in a few min-utes is the Senate’s response to this crisis. We will be voting on another impor-tant piece of legislation that the Sen-ator from Maine, Ms. C
OLLINS , who is here, has talked about, and Senator M
CCASKILL is a cosponsor. It is the Pa-tient Right to Know Act. It basically does something that I think almost every American would think is a good idea. It says that when you go into a drugstore, your pharmacist must be al-lowed to tell you that if you can buy your prescription for $5 by paying out of your own pocket, you should do that, rather than using your insurance, which might require a $100 copay out of your pocket. Right now, there are con-tracts between pharmacy benefit orga-nizations and pharmacists that pro-hibit your pharmacist from telling you. Senator C
OLLINS deserves a lot of cred-it for her leadership in this area, as she does in so many other areas, and I fully support what she is proposing. It passed unanimously out of our Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Com-mittee. Let’s go back for a moment to the Opioid Crisis Response Act, which we will be voting on within a few minutes. I mentioned that it is on the front pages of the newspapers today, despite a lot of competition for other news. I mentioned that Senator MCCONNELL , the Senate majority leader, had called it ‘‘landmark legislation,’’ and I men-tioned that it is because the opioid cri-sis is the most serious public health epidemic in our country. It is ravaging virtually every community. We all have stories that we have heard, that we know, that we have told—stories like the story of Becky Savage, who testified at one of the seven hearings before our HELP Com-mittee that her sons had a graduation party in her basement. She was happy about that. They were not running around town doing other things; they were in the basement. Unfortunately, someone had brought opioid pills to the party that got mixed with alcohol, and she found both her sons dead the next morning. They were not drug addicts. They were not alcoholics. They were good boys, but somehow they made a mistake because they and their friends didn’t know the consequences of this opioid epidemic. That is why five different commit-tees in this body have reported bills that have made a contribution to the Opioid Crisis Response Act, which we are about to vote on. That is why 72 different Senators have provisions in this bill. That is why, last June, the House of Representatives passed its own version of the bill, also involving several committees in the House. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator’s time has expired. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for another 5 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, that is why we have had so much sup-port for this amendment. The bill is so large, some people have had trouble seeing the significance of it. Let me quickly mention two aspects of it: One is money, one is moonshot. Some people say: Where is the money? This is not a money bill. This is an authorization bill. The money bills are in the Appropriations Com-mittee, and they have been generous. In March, the Congress addressed $4.7 billion in the omnibus appropriations bill toward opioids. In the bill—which we should approve tomorrow for the next fiscal year—there will be another $3.8 billion. So that is $8 billion within a few months for the opioids crisis. The second is moonshot. Some people say this needs a moonshot. It does need the energy and resources of a moon-shot, but, unfortunately, this isn’t a crisis that we can assign to a Federal agency in Washington and say: Let’s fix it in 10 years. What we can do is ev-erything we can think of to do to cre-ate an environment so that doctors, nurses, judges, patients, parents, and everybody in communities that are af-fected by the opioid crisis can deal with it there, and we do our best to do that. For example, Senator PORTMAN ’s STOP Act addresses fentanyl and other synthetic, illegal drugs being mailed into this country through our Postal Service from China. Fentanyl is 50 times more powerful than an opioid pill, 50 times more dangerous. There is a 70-percent increase in deaths from overdose by fentanyl in our State of Tennessee. Here is what I think is the Holy Grail of this crisis; that is, finding a non-ad-dictive pain medicine or treatment. One hundred million Americans live with pain; 25 million Americans have chronic pain. They need help. They need something other than an addict-ive pain medicine—something that works. Dr. Francis Collins at the Na-tional Institutes of Health and Scott Gottlieb at the Food and Drug Admin-istration have advanced research and created fast tracks, and we have pro-vided hundreds of millions of dollars to find that Holy Grail. A third is to reduce the prescriptions of opioids that can be diverted, so you can reduce the chance that you might get a 60-pill bottle of opioids, use 12, take it home, put it in your medicine cabinet; then your teenager picks it up and takes it to a party, and someone is hurt or overdoses. We authorize the Food and Drug Administration to re-quire manufacturers to sell opioid pills in blister packs of, say, three or seven. Already, two dozen States have estab-lished their own limits. In Tennessee, it is a limit of three days. What are the next steps for this piece of legislation, the Opioid Crisis Re-sponse Act with 72 provisions? We are already working with the House of Representatives. We are working very well with them. I appreciate the lead-ership of Senator M
CCONNELL and Sen-ator S
CHUMER in creating an environ-ment where we can move this bill rap-idly. We are working with Congress-man W
ALDEN and Congressman B RADY  in the House and with Democrats on both sides of seven committees in the Senate on this phase and several in the House of Representatives. Our goal is to have all of our lan-guage in a combined bill ready by Fri-day of this week, along with Congres-sional Budget Office numbers, so that the House of Representatives can vote on the bill next week before they go home. Then we can vote on it the fol-lowing week—or whenever Senator M
CCONNELL can put it on the floor— and send it to the President for action. There are too many Senators for me to thank at the moment for their lead-ership as chairmen and ranking mem-bers of committees or for their agree-ing to show some restraint in insisting on provisions. Senator P
ORTMAN had provisions, Senator R
UBIO did, Senator P
AUL did, and Senator L EEdid, but they all said: Let’s go ahead and vote on this today, work out the remaining differences we have over the next few days with the House, and hope that the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6177 September 17, 2018 
final version of the bill that comes back from the House is even stronger. I am convinced that this piece of leg-islation, the Opioid Crisis Response Act of 2018, will help deal with the worst public health epidemic we have had. We have a sense of bipartisan urgency about finishing our work in the Senate and combining our efforts with the House. Their bill is a good bill. I think combining it with ours will help make it stronger, and we will get our bill to the President. We may have the same amount of money and the same amount of energy that we had for the moonshot in the 1960s, but the real work is going to be done on the frontlines because the only way to deal with the opioid crisis is community by community by commu-nity. I thank the President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Connecticut. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Tennessee, as well as leaders on both sides. This ef-fort has been truly bipartisan. It is a profoundly significant beginning but only a first step. It needs to be followed by others because we know that this epidemic truly is national. I especially thank my colleague from West Virginia who will follow me, Sen-ator M
ANCHIN , for his tireless, relent-less efforts on this issue. I have been very proud to work with him and to begin working on it when I was attor-ney general of the State of Connecticut in suing the painkiller manufacturers and taking action against the sellers of prescription opioids, to make sure they are held accountable. The communities need our help. We promised action, and we are now deliv-ering, in part, on this issue, which has been so devastating and deadly for so many families, communities, States, and towns throughout Connecticut and our Nation. The calls for action tonight are an-swered in this beginning step with money that will go to treatment, pre-vention, and law enforcement. That money is a good first step, but it must be followed by additional investments and commitment. This measure increases the number of drug take-back programs. I visited communities, most recently East Hart-ford in Greenwich, where these take- back programs have provided an anon-ymous, secure way to rid medicine cabinets of drugs that all too often can be a menace. Medicine cabinets are a modern-day menace when they provide accessible painkillers and opioids to teenagers, children, and others who begin lifetimes of addiction. This measure is profoundly impor-tant in setting standards and guide-lines for sober houses, a very impor-tant resource but one that requires some sense of regularity and guide-lines. There are many sober homes in Connecticut—for example, in Torrington—that do good work. But Connecticut is grappling with sober homes operated by bad actors who put lives at risk. This prevention is a step in the right direction. I am very proud of a bill I have led with Senators GRASSLEY and B ROWN to enhance transparency in opioid pre-scribing. This provision requires drug companies to disclose payments made to nurse practitioners, physician as-sistants, and other prescribers, ensur-ing that they are not being inappropri-ately influenced by these manufactur-ers. It is already required for doctors. It ought to be required for everyone who may be involved in prescribing these powerful medicines. The bill will also fight back against deadly drug trafficking when it in-volves use of the postal system. Just a few weeks ago, in New Haven, there was a mass overdose caused by traf-ficked synthetic drugs. More than 100 people overdosed on K2 brought into this country by China and Mexico through the mail. These new law en-forcement tools are critically impor-tant, as is the reauthorization of the Office of National Drug Control Policy and its High Intensity Drug Traf-ficking Areas Program. This bill will help protect our citizens. I thank all my colleagues for supporting it. I am looking forward to a positive, affirmative vote that will help commu-nities throughout the country and spare families the heartbreaking and gut-wrenching problem that infects so many healthy communities. Everyone is affected and touched by this prob-lem. I thank my colleagues for sup-porting this bill. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate proceeds to S. 2554, amendment No. 4011 be made pending. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from West Virginia. Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I first want to thank the good Senator from Tennessee, L
AMAR ALEXANDER , for ba-sically shepherding this through and working in a bipartisan way. It is a most important piece of legislation. Also, to all of our colleagues, this is the way legislation should work. It is something we have worked on for a long time—well thought-out. Senator B
LUMENTHAL from Connecticut and ev-eryone worked so hard on it. The American people are drowning under the weight of the prescription drug epidemic. My State of West Vir-ginia has been hit the hardest. More than 1,000 West Virginians died of drug overdoses in 2017; 870 of those deaths involved an opiate. This is a record number of opiate-related deaths, up from 759 opiate-related deaths in 2016, which was a record that year as well. Let’s put this in perspective. For those of us who are old enough to re-member watching the Vietnam war on television and the outrage—rightfully so—that came with that and the pro-tests and how we were able to bring that to an end, during that entire Viet-nam war period of close to 10 years, 58,200 young Americans’ lives were taken. Just last year alone, in 1 year, we lost more than 72,000 people to a drug overdose—72,000 in 1 year. Forty-nine thousand people were killed by opiates, heroin, and fentanyl in 2017. That is an average of 134 people dying of an opiate overdose every day. It is a silent killer. If we had these types of numbers and were losing them and they were on tel-evision—they are in every neighbor-hood; they are almost in every family’s home, one way or another, that is af-fected—the country would rise up in outrage, as they did with the Vietnam war, watching the carnage. That is why I am glad to support this bill today, because it will take a num-ber of critical steps to help us stop that devastating epidemic, many of which I have pushed for. It will reauthorize critical State grant funding to address the crisis and ensure this funding is going to the hardest hit States, such as my State of West Virginia. It will put Jessie’s Law in statute, requiring HHS to develop hospital standards to flag a patient’s opiate addiction. It is so simple. You will go into a hospital to be admitted, and they are going to ask you if you are allergic and what you are allergic to, such as peni-cillin, and they mark it all the way through. Jessie’s Law is such a commonsense piece of legislation that it could have saved this beautiful young lady, and, hopefully, it will save thousands of others. While this language was in-cluded in the fiscal year 2018 appropria-tions bill, HHS has not yet acted. This bill will force them to do so. It will also strengthen the response by our Federal agencies. The FDA and NIH will be pushed to encourage the development of nonopiate pain treat-ments. The FDA will also be given the authority to do more work with the CBP to stop the flow of illicit opiates like fentanyl, which has driven up opi-ate overdose deaths substantially. The DEA will be required to consider diversion abuse and overdose deaths when determining their opiate quotas, something that I have been pushing for years. It also would allow States to use Federal funding for programs like the Handle With Care program in West Vir-ginia, which helps to connect trauma-tized children with the resources they need. It would make it easier for Medi-care and Medicaid beneficiaries to ac-cess the treatment they need. These are critical steps. So much more has to be done. It must be done. I am particularly dis-appointed that the package does not include the Protecting Jessie Grubb’s Legacy Act, which makes common-sense changes to the regulations for substance use disorder and treatment, known as part 2.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6178 September 17, 2018 
We lost Jessie more than 2 years ago for one simple reason. One of her physi-cians did not know she was in recovery from an opiate addiction and sent her home from the hospital with 50 oxycodone. This could have been pre-vented very easily. I am very pleased that the bill in-cludes Jessie’s Law, which was also in-cluded in the fiscal year 2018 appropria-tions bill and would help hospitals de-velop systems to flag patients with opi-ate addiction, but it does not include the legacy act, which would solve the larger, more systematic problem that is keeping those in recovery from get-ting the coordinated care they need. The legacy act is needed because the part 2 regulations are simply not com-patible with the way we want healthcare to be delivered—in a coordi-nated manner that takes into account the whole patient and all of their med-ical needs. Access to a patient’s entire medical record, including addiction records, ensures that providers and or-ganizations have all the information necessary for safe, effective, high-qual-ity treatment and care coordination that addresses all of patient’s health needs. It also helps to prevent dev-astating situations like the one that took Jessie Grubb’s life by helping to ensure that healthcare providers can offer medically appropriate care for those in recovery. We need to protect people’s privacy. The regulations were put into place in the 1970s, at a time when we did not adequately protect people’s medical records. They were necessary then. In the 1990s we passed HIPAA. While it isn’t perfect, it successfully protects the privacy of millions of Americans’ medical records every day. We simply should not treat substance use disorder treatment records dif-ferently than every other single type of medical record. It doesn’t make any sense, and it harms patients. The House passed their companion to the legacy act with a strong bipartisan vote of 357 to 57 because they recog-nized that this is critical—very crit-ical—for stopping the opiate epidemic. The legacy act makes commonsense changes that will save lives and will have strong bipartisan support. I urge my colleagues to join me in fighting to include these changes in any final opioid package. I thank the good Senator from Ten-nessee. We have to stop this epidemic in Tennessee and in West Virginia. People in our States are dying. Fami-lies and communities are being torn apart. I look forward to supporting this bill today, but I will never stop fight-ing for the people of my great State of West Virginia. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Utah. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani-mous consent to complete my brief re-marks. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, Americans know all too well the crippling costs of healthcare in our country today. On top of the daily struggles of ordinary families to put food on the table, sky-rocketing costs of prescription drugs are getting harder and harder to meet. Pharmacist gag rules are only mak-ing matters worse for the American people—much worse. These contract clauses between pharmacies, on the one hand, and insurers and pharmacy ben-efit managers, on the other, prevent pharmacists from telling customers that they can actually save money on prescriptions by paying with cash in-stead of using their insurance. Phar-macists are actually prohibited under these clauses from helping their cus-tomers to get the best price for their medications. This is absurd, and it is harmful. According to a recent study, about 23 percent of all drug claims in 2013 in-volved overpayment, amounting to more than $135 million. Who pockets those extra dollars? It is not ordinary Americans. It is, of course, the insurers and the benefit managers—in other words, the pharma middlemen, you might say. We all agree that this is a problem. It is only further evidence of our broken drug pricing system that is unneces-sarily hurting the American people. We all agree this is a problem that needs to be fixed. What we must consider is how best to address the problem, who is best equipped to do so, and whether and to what extent some of it has al-ready been fixed. Senator C
OLLINS ’ bill mandates that gag clauses be prohibited under all health insurance plans, including indi-vidual and group plans that are cur-rently administered by the States pur-suant to State law. The Federal Government can and should prohibit gag clauses within the plans it administers and within those plans it oversees, but it cannot and should not intervene in plans that it does not. Many States already have made some significant progress on this issue. In fact, 26 States have already passed laws banning gag rules, and another 11 States are currently in the process of trying to pass them. I applaud them, and we ought to leave space for them to do that very thing. Some have suggested that this State action and increased attention to the cost of prescription drugs has more or less solved this problem and greatly limited the use of gag clauses already. Bear in mind that the study that I pre-viously referenced looked at practices from 5 years ago. The States were more directly involved because they had more directly witnessed this problem, and they were able to nimbly and quite capably address it. However, even if gag clauses are still in use, where they are, we must recog-nize that it is not always the role of the Federal Government to regulate everything. It is not the role of the Federal Government to regulate enti-ties under the jurisdiction of the States. However well intentioned, when Congress oversteps its authority like this, we can end up doing more harm than good. We also end up undermining the very oath we took to uphold the Constitution, which has as a structural foundation the principle that not all power is invested in Congress. Only those powers given to the Congress are vested here. Those that are not vested under the Constitution in the Federal Government are reserved to the States, respectfully, or to the people. The amendment I am offering would narrow this bill to what I believe would be its proper scope. Instead of the bill applying to all health plans, my amendment would limit its application to only self-insured groups plans that are exempt from State regulation. This would close a loophole where States are unable to provide Americans addi-tional transparency surrounding the cost of their prescription drugs. Again, while I very much support the overall goal of the underlying bill and applaud my friend and colleague from Maine, Senator COLLINS , we have to re-member that it is neither the role nor the duty nor within the power of the Federal Government to regulate all as-pects of commercial activity within the United States or all aspects of the lives of the American people. The way to help ordinary American citizens with high drug costs is not to further concentrate power within Washington, DC. The Federal Govern-ment’s intervention in healthcare has already caused huge distortions in the market for which Americans pay a steeper price every single year. If we truly want to protect the Amer-ican people from abuses like gag rules, we should fight to preserve federalism and our vision of our Constitution so that States are empowered to directly and efficiently protect their citizens from the injustices they face. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have one minute to respond to my friend and colleague. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it seems very arbitrary to me to exclude potentially 85 million Americans from the protections this bill would provide when there is such a clear Federal nexus to act in this area. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 58 percent of workers in-sured in self-insured plans are actually in ‘‘partially insured’’ plans. The rea-son this matters is that some States may attempt to regulate these plans, believing they can, and then have their State laws challenged in the courts and preempted. Why not take the commonsense ap-proach our bill does and simply ban the use of pharmacy gag clauses—an egre-gious practice that prevents phar-macists from telling their customers

they could purchase their prescriptions with less money by paying out of pock-et rather than using their insurance. We have the support of 40 medical and consumer groups for this bill, and this legislation is action we can take right now to help lower the cost of pre-scription drugs for some consumers. It has widespread bipartisan support. It came out of the HELP Committee unanimously, and it is supported by the administration. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the amendment offered by the Sen-ator from Utah and a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the underlying bill.

TRIBUTE TO KEITH KELLEHER Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Amer-ican jobs have changed dramatically in the last century, but the reasons Amer-icans work have not changed. Work is about more than a paycheck. A job is—or ought to be—a source of dignity. Men and women who work hard may not be able to live on Easy Street, but they ought to be able to walk down Main Street with their heads held high, knowing that they can provide for the basic needs of their families, and they ought to be able to retire with dignity and security. Keith Kelleher understands this. He understands that treating workers—all workers—fairly is not an outdated idea; it is a requirement for a sound economy and solid future. He has de-voted more than four decades of his life to improving the lives of some of the lowest paid workers in our economy, including nursing home workers and home health aides. As founding president of SEIU Healthcare in Illinois, Indiana, Mis-souri, and Kansas, Keith Kelleher has helped secure the right to form and join a union for more than 91,000 tradi-tionally low-paid healthcare workers and to negotiate for better wages and working conditions. Not only that, like Walter Reuther and other great labor leaders of the last century, Keith Kelleher has cham-pioned broader causes of social justice. In 2014, Keith Kelleher and the mem-bers of SEIU Healthcare helped lead the fight in Illinois for marriage equal-ity, a year before the U.S. Supreme Court made marriage equality the law of the land. This week, Keith Kelleher is stepping down officially from the union he helped found. He is retiring after more than 30 years at the helm of SEIU Healthcare, and I want to thank him for his contributions to economic and social justice in Illinois and in our Na-tion. Keith Kelleher moved to Chicago in the early 1980s from Detroit. He was working with a group called the United Labor Unions, an organization that trained people on how to organize and work together to advance their com-mon good. He lived as simply as the people he came to help. He focused on the home care industry because it had some of the lowest paid workers in the state. Private-sector workers hired by the State to provide services for seniors and people with disabilities earned an hourly rate of $3.35, with no benefits. They were a forgotten group, one large-ly ignored by traditional labor unions. In 1983, Keith Kelleher gathered seven home health aides in the base-ment of the United Methodist Temple in downtown Chicago, and they voted to organize a union. That moment was the beginning of Union Local 880. Twenty-five years later, Local 880 had grown from 7 members to 68,000 mem-bers. All great things come from small beginnings. Keith Kelleher built Local 880 from the ground up by going door-to-door in some of Chicago’s poorest, most ne-glected neighborhoods. He helped con-vince thousands of workers to pay membership fees even before Local 880 could engage in collective bargaining. They won that right in 1984, when the National Labor Relations Board offi-cially recognized Local 880. He convinced people that they mattered and that they could change their own lives though collective ac-tion. He found innovative ways to raise funds for the fledgling union, can-vassing for donations, selling chicken dinners on payday, and holding tag sales. Keith and his wife even figured out how to turn their wedding into a union fundraiser. In 1985, the independent Local 880 merged with SEIU, the Service Em-ployees International Union. In 2007 and 2008, Local 880 merged with two other SEIU local unions in In-diana, Local 20 and Local 4. In 2009, SEIU Healthcare Illinois/Indiana merged with the SEIU Healthcare local unions in Missouri and Kansas. Keith Kelleher was elected founding presi-dent of the new combined union. For nearly 40 years, Keith Kelleher has helped forge new partnerships and fought new battles. He is as determined as they come. One battle took nearly 20 years to win, but SEIU Local 880 never gave up, and in 2005, Illinois’ Governor finally signed an executive order recog-nizing unionized home care workers who work as contractors for State agencies as public employees. That vic-tory gave 50,000 workers the legal right to bargain collectively for better wages and working conditions. They have since won a 35 percent wage increase over 4 years and other improvements in benefits. Under Keith Kelleher’s leadership, Local 880 has become a significant po-litical force. You cannot miss SEIU Health members at public events. They are often known as ‘‘the purple people’’ because of the color of the t-shirts they wear. Keith Kelleher has fought for justice for union members and for those who don’t have the benefit of union mem-bership. In addition to marriage equality, he has fought for a higher minimum wage across the country. Like Tom Joad in ‘‘The Grapes of Wrath,’’ wherever there are people in need of justice, Keith Kelleher seems to be there. As he steps down officially this week from the union he helped create, I want to thank Keith personally and wish him, his wife Madeline, and his two daughters Ryan and Aileen well. He has made a real difference in the lives of tens of thousands of workers, and his life’s work will continue to lift workers up for generations to come. f 
JUAN REQUESENS Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, earlier this year, I had the opportunity to visit Venezuela, a once proud Latin Amer-ican democracy that is now in a state of collapse. The country was planning a Presidential election a few weeks after my visit in late May. My message to President Maduro and members of his government during this visit was clear and simple. They should run a clean election in which opposi-tion candidates are released from de-tention and allowed to participate. Local and international observers should be allowed to observe the entire electoral process. The election should be administered in a fair and open manner by credible nonpartisan elec-tion commissioners.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6182 September 17, 2018 
These were the same messages told to Venezuela by its neighbors in Latin America. I suggested that meeting these obvi-ous international norms and restoring the power of the country’s duly elected National Assembly would help ease Venezuela’s isolation and the suffering of its people. Tragically, obstinately, President Maduro and his circle of corrupt col-leagues chose to double down. They held a sham election. Its legitimacy was rejected by the international community and the con-sequences have been predictable: con-tinued mass exodus of desperate Ven-ezuelans to neighboring countries, in-flation nearing 1 million percent, deep-ening international isolation, and of course, an increasingly ruthless crack-down on political opponents to further solidify the regime’s illegitimate hold on power. This regime already had a shameful history of jailing political opponents. Their victims include Judge Maria Afiuni, who had the courage to rule against the government on a case be-fore her, Leopoldo Lopez, the former mayor of Caracas who was a highly popular national candidate and there-fore remains under house arrest and unable to compete in elections, and so many others including a number of dual American-Venezuelan citizens. And now, it has jailed young elected National Assembly Member Juan Requesens on highly questionable charges. His crime? Criticizing President Maduro and the staggering human suf-fering and the demise of democracy under his dictatorial rule. Haunting videos of Requesens in de-tention have surfaced which strongly suggest torture and inhumane treat-ment. Several months ago, I had the great pleasure of sitting down with several of Juan’s colleagues when I was in Cara-cas. These are the next generation of young leaders, brave men and women who won at the ballot box in many areas previously won by Hugo Chavez and Maduro. They won because they made an ef-fort to understand voters’ economic concerns and how former ruling parties had too often become corrupt or ig-nored the poor. They were the hope for the future, but to this Maduro regime, they were a threat. So voter and candidate registrations were manipulated to make it harder for opposition parties and candidates to compete. Elected National Assembly Members were harassed and threat-ened. In some cases, their passports were confiscated. I will never forget when they told me that, if I returned a year later, that half of them might be gone, jailed or chased into exile. Sadly, they were right. My colleagues Senators M
ENENDEZ , N
ELSON , RUBIO, CORNYN , and I will in-troduce legislation in the days ahead that will further targeted sanctions against those Venezuelan officials re-sponsible for this scandalous regime and those responsible for Juan’s deten-tion. It will also provide additional aid to help with the humanitarian crises in and along Venezuela’s borders. I wish we had not reached this des-perate moment. I wish the Maduro re-gime would play by basic democratic rules and let the Venezuelan people freely decide their leaders. I wish the Maduro regime had the courage to compete in a free and fair election. But it didn’t. So until it does and until Leopoldo, Juan, and the many other Venezuelan political prisoners are freed, the Na-tional Assembly’s powers restored, and a legitimate democratic process is re-established, I will continue to support pressure on this corrupt regime and sanctioning those responsible for the Venezulea’s misery.

BUDGET ENFORCEMENT LEVELS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, section 251 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, BBEDCA, establishes statutory limits on discre-tionary spending and allows for various adjustments to those limits. In addi-tion, sections 302 and 314(a) of the Con-gressional Budget Act of 1974 allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to establish and make revisions to alloca-tions, aggregates, and levels consistent with those adjustments. The Senate will soon consider the conference report to H.R. 6157, a spend-ing measure covering programs within the jurisdiction of the Senate Appro-priations Subcommittees on Defense and Labor, Health and Human Serv-ices, Education, and Related Agencies, Labor-HHSE. The Defense portion of this legislation includes funding des-ignated as overseas contingency oper-ations funding pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of BBEDCA. The Labor- HHSE portion includes spending des-ignated for various program integrity efforts pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(B), section 251(b)(2)(C), and section 251(b)(2)(E) of BBEDCA. The inclusion of these designations with these provi-sions makes this spending eligible for an adjustment under the Congressional Budget Act. On August 16, 2018, I filed an adjust-ment relating to S. Amdt. 3695 to H.R. 6157, which contained appropriations for the same two appropriations sub-committees. The Defense portion of the amendment contained $67,914 million in revised security budget authority des-ignated as overseas contingency oper-ations and $37,285 million in outlays, and the Labor-HHSE portion contained $1,897 million in revised nonsecurity budget authority for program integrity initiatives with $1,573 million in out-lays. The budgetary adjustment was made to accommodate this spending. Since the levels of budget authority for overseas contingency operations and budget authority and outlays for program integrity spending in the con-ference report are consistent with the previously filed levels and appro-priately designated, those funds are now available for use in this conference report. However, the amount of outlays flowing from the overseas contingency operations funding in the conference report is estimated to be $214 million less than my earlier adjustment. Therefore, I am reducing the general purpose outlay allocation to the Appro-priations Committee and budgetary ag-gregates to reflect this new estimate at this time. I ask unanimous consent that the ac-companying tables, which provide de-tails about the adjustment, be printed in the R
ECORD . There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R

f 
H.R. 5895 Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, the Senate passed 3 of the required 12 appropriations bills needed to fund the Federal Government starting on Octo-ber first. The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, Energy and Water, and Legislative Branch appro-priations bills fund vital programs that care for our military, protect our infra-structure, and support the dedicated Federal employees that work for the U.S. Congress. Within the minibus, programs and projects such as the VA’s National Cen-ter for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Army Corps dredging for the Port of Baltimore, and a new paid-internship program in the Senate are just a few of the hundreds of items funded in these bills that will benefit the people of Maryland and the Nation. However, I do not support the $65 million appro-priated in fiscal year 2019 for a new low-yield nuclear warhead for a sub-marine-launched ballistic missile. I be-lieve this is an unnecessary new weap-on that increases the risk of mis-calculation and unintended escalation. As a member of the Senate Appro-priations Committee, I am pleased that we have gotten this far and I look for-ward to working with my colleagues on moving the other bills to final passage. f 
SYRIA Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing on Russia’s role in Syria and the broader Middle East that had been scheduled for last week has been post-poned; therefore, I rise today to raise awareness on the danger and urgency of the moment, given the impending humanitarian catastrophe in Idlib, Syria, and the refusal of the Trump ad-ministration to impose meaningful costs on Russia for protecting Bashar al-Assad and his regime. On Syria, Congress again finds itself in a situation where we often hear more from the press than we do di-rectly from the administration. Last week many of us read with interest in the Washington Post a report that President Trump agreed to a new strat-egy for Syria that indefinitely extends the U.S. military presence and sup-ports a major diplomatic push to end the conflict. This same article also in-dicated that the administration views the military campaign against ISIS as nearly complete and that U.S. goals have now shifted to Iran’s presence in Syria given the doubts that Russia is willing and capable of ejecting Iran from Syria. Congress and the American people deserve to hear directly from the Trump administration whether in fact this is our new strategy. When this hearing is rescheduled, I expect the ad-ministration to explain in detail its proposed diplomatic engagement and the plan for U.S. forces in Syria after ISIS is defeated. I also want to know what specific tools the administration proposes to use to ensure the removal of Iran from Syria; compel the Assad regime to cease and Russia to cease support for the bombing, torture, and gassing of Syrian civilians; and hold Assad’s brutal regime to account for its crimes against the Syrian people, as well as consequences for the Kremlin’s support of this brutal regime. In my view, Russia is fully culpable for perpetuating the war in Syria and rendering that country persistently un-stable, a magnet for violent extremists and a direct threat to Israel. Now more than ever, we must shine a light on Russia’s role in perpetuating the conflict in Syria, as well as Rus-sia’s role in the region. And while we still await details on the disastrous and embarrassing Helsinki summit be-tween Presidents Trump and Putin, I am deeply concerned that for the Syr-ian people Helsinki made a bad situa-tion worse. I fear that President Trump did not raise Russia’s war crimes in Syria, such as Russian aircraft dropping Rus-sian bombs in densely populated areas of Syria. I doubt that President Trump called Putin out for violating the dees-calation agreement in southern Syria, agreed to last year by the United States, Russia, and Jordan. I am skep-tical that President Trump pressed Putin to commit to delivering Assad to participate in good faith at the UN-led process for a negotiated settlement along the lines of Security Council Resolution 2254. I doubt that President Trump insisted that Russia break its sinister alliance with Tehran that has enabled the survival of Assad in Syria and threatened the security of Israel. And I see no indication that the admin-istration is using any of the tools Con-gress has given it—including manda-tory sanctions provisions in the Coun-tering American Adversaries Through Sanctions Act of 2017, CAATSA—to change the status quo in Syria or pre-vent the looming assault on Idlib prov-ince, where Russia is already engaged in a bombing campaign alongside its client Assad. It seems to me that the administra-tion is taking a backseat—or maybe has gotten out of the car entirely— while the Assad-Russia-Iran alliance is left unchallenged to starve, torture, and bomb the Syrian people into sub-mission. While the humanitarian dimensions of this tragedy are reason enough for the administration to take a different approach, there are significant stra-tegic consequences for allowing or ena-bling an Assad-Russia-Iran partnership to solidify as a salient feature of the landscape of the Middle East. But in-stead of U.S. leadership shaping the re-gion, we have instead Vladimir Putin— the man who has long ensured Bashar al-Assad’s survival—flying around the Middle East completing deals for base access and weapons sales. And rather than utilize the threat of CAATSA sanctions to compel U.S. partners in the Arab world to cease significant purchases from the Russian defense and intelligence sectors, the adminis-tration instead sought a national secu-rity waiver for this provision of the law. While the United States has backed away from its key leadership role in addressing the region’s conflicts, gov-ernments in the Middle East rolled out the red carpet for Putin and flocked to Russia during the World Cup to sit by his side and sign agreements for in-creased cooperation. Putin can only take away one mes-sage from this posture by the Trump administration: Russian activities and influence in the Middle East will not be challenged in any meaningful way by the United States.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES6184 September 17, 2018 
With so many vital U.S. national se-curity interests at stake in the re-gion—including the safety and effec-tiveness of our troops fighting ISIS— this leadership vacuum risks outcomes that serve only Russia’s interests, not our own. While President Trump may believe that Russian hegemony in the Middle East and Russian partnership with Iran is not a cause for concern, I am deeply alarmed that we are on the road to a series of outcomes in Syria that will be as catastrophic in human terms as they will be strategically ruinous for U.S. interests and values for years to come.

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF ALLENTOWN JCC Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I con-gratulate the board of directors of the Jewish Community Center, or JCC, in Allentown, PA as they celebrate their 100th anniversary. Community leaders and JCC members will gather on Octo-ber 4 through 6 to celebrate and honor this remarkable institution in the Le-high Valley. For 100 years, the JCC of Allentown has served as the beating heart of the Lehigh Valley Jewish community. Through its early childhood and after-school programs, sports, wellness, and cultural activities, the JCC enriches the lives of generations of Lehigh Val-ley families of all backgrounds and heritage. Many JCC members are first intro-duced to the JCC community in pre-school. Eventually, they are old enough to attend a JCC summer camp, where they may learn to swim, play basketball, cook, or act in theatre. As adults, these members may take their own children to a community Seder, attend the Jewish Film Festival, or practice a healthy lifestyle of weekly gym sessions. Eventually, many mem-bers will participate in the Friendship Circle and Silver Sneakers programs at the JCC. If you take a drive through Allen-town’s historic downtown area, it is difficult to miss a building called Alli-ance Hall on the corner of 6th and Chew Streets. Today, the building is occupied by the Allentown Health Bu-reau. A century ago, however, the 19th century Victorian mansion standing at this location served as the first Allen-town JCC. In 1918, the leaders of the Allentown Jewish community—among them suc-cessful local entrepreneurs, high- skilled professionals, and survivors of pogroms overseas—were searching for ways to support younger Jewish immi-grants as they integrated into Amer-ican society and aspired to fulfill the opportunities offered by the American dream. They purchased the Victorian mansion, turning it into a focal point for the Jewish community and espe-cially its youth. The facility was so popular that, within a decade, it was clear the JCC would need more space. David Levy, Allentown’s first Jewish architect, gra-ciously donated his services to design a new, larger building on the same site. That building would be called Alliance Hall, and from 1928 to 1954, it reliably served the JCC’s ever-expanding mem-bership. The JCC flourished and inevi-tably had to relocate, one last time, to where it resides today at 22nd and Tilghman Streets in Allentown’s West End neighborhood. Most importantly, since 1918, the JCC of Allentown has been the place where all community members feel welcomed, engaged, and part of the JCC family. Today it serves over 2,000 members, and I am honored to congratulate them on the 100th anniversary of the JCC’s establishment.

Mr. President, this Sunday, I will have the honor and pleasure of attending services at Ebe-nezer African Methodist Episcopal, AME, Church in Fort Washington, MD to celebrate the 35th anniversary of service to this wonderful church by my dear friends, the Reverend Dr. Grainger Browning, Jr., and his wife, the Rev-erend Dr. Jo Ann Browning. Ebenezer AME Church’s beginning is similar to the origin of many other AME churches. In 1856, 13 Black mem-bers left Mt. Zion Methodist Episcopal Church in Georgetown because of dis-crimination and segregation. They erected a new church at 2727 O Street, NW, not far from Mt. Zion. They named it ‘‘Ebenezer’’, meaning ‘‘stone of help,’’ a reference to I Samuel 7:12. The congregation worshiped in the his-toric Georgetown location for well over one century. By 1983, however, many Black families had left Georgetown. Church membership fell to fewer than 30 people, with a Sunday offering of only $200 per week. With the vision, leadership, and sup-port of Bishop John Hurst Adams—the presiding prelate, Second Episcopal District at that time—the Reverend Howard C. Wright as pastor, Dr. Joseph C. McKinney as the African Methodist Church treasurer, and the Washington Conference Board of Trustees, 17 faith-ful members moved to Fort Wash-ington, MD, and the church in George-town was sold. One month following the move to a 500-seat sanctuary with a $3,500 month-ly mortgage note and a $300 weekly of-fering, the Reverend Dr. Grainger and Reverend Dr. Jo Ann Browning were called to serve the Ebenezer family. The congregation soon outgrew the building and began holding worship services at the Friendly High School auditorium in 1986. In 1994, having out-grown the 1,500-seat auditorium at ‘‘Friendly Ebenezer,’’ members carried their faith pilgrimage to ‘‘Ebenezer the Beautiful,’’ a 2,600-seat sanctuary on 33 acres of land. Many people call the cur-rent church ‘‘The Miracle on Allentown Road.’’ The Reverend Dr. Grainger Brown-ing, Jr., is the senior pastor of Ebe-nezer AME Church. He is a 1974 grad-uate of Hampton University in Hamp-ton, VA, where he earned a bachelor of science degree in history and education and was a member of the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity. He was awarded a mas-ter of divinity degree in 1982 from How-ard University Divinity School, where he was awarded the Benjamin E. Mays Theological Fellowship. He received doctor of divinity degrees from Payne Theological Seminary in Wilberforce, OH and from the AME University in Monrovia, Liberia. Before Pastor Browning was called into ministry, he was a high school educator with the Newton Massachusetts Public School System, serving as department chair-person in social science. While he was living in the Boston area, Pastor Browning was also vice president of the Boston NAACP from 1982 to 1983. In addition to his pastoral duties, Pastor Browning has ministered exten-sively throughout the African con-tinent, including Senegal, Gambia, Le-sotho, Zambia, South Africa, Liberia, and Egypt. He currently serves as a member of the board of trustees for both Wilberforce University—after serving as vice chairman from 2002 to 2006—and Payne Theological Seminary. Pastor Browning is also a member of the board of directors of the Rainbow/ People United to Save Humanity, PUSH, Coalition. In that capacity, he has traveled on several delegations with the Reverend Jesse Jackson, Sr., to Israel, Palestine, Sudan, Libya, Leb-anon, Syria, and Ghana, meeting with the heads of state in each one of these countries. Pastor Browning is married to the Reverend Dr. Jo Ann Browning, co-pastor of Ebenezer AME Church. She graduated from Boston University in 1976 with a bachelor of science degree in Communications. She received a master of divinity degree in 1986 and a doctorate of ministry from Howard University School of Divinity in 1991. While at Howard, she was a recipient of the Benjamin E. Mays and the Pew Fel-lowships. Pastor Browning immediately began assisting her husband and was hired as assistant minister in 1985. She origi-nally served as assistant pastor. In 1998, Bishop Vinton R. Anderson, then presiding prelate of the Second Epis-copal District, made the unprecedented appointment assigning the Reverend Dr. Jo Ann Browning as copastor of Ebenezer. Since 2005, Bishop Adam J. Richardson has continued this groundbreaking appointment. In addition to her pastoral respon-sibilities, Pastor Browning has preached, taught, and facilitated work-shops throughout the United States, Haiti, Bermuda, Barbados, Germany,

Israel, and South Africa. She is a wide-ly recognized community leader and has received numerous awards and ac-colades. In July 2002, for instance, Pas-tor Browning was inducted as an hon-orary member into Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. In 2006, she received an honorary doctor of divinity degree from AME University in Monrovia, Li-beria. In 2007, she was honored to preach Spelman College’s Bacca-laureate Ceremony, where she served on the Spelman College Sisters Chapel Wisdom Center Executive Board. In 2016, she became a member of the board of trustees at Wesley Theological Sem-inary, and in 2017, she accepted the re-quest to serve on the Board of RISE TOGETHER: The National Mentorship Network for Women of Color in Min-istry, WOCIM. Pastor Browning has also organized and convened over 30 annual women’s spiritual retreats, attracting thousands of participants from throughout the United States and around the world. She self-published her first book, ‘‘Our Savior, Our Sisters, Ourselves. Biblical Teachings & Reflections on Women’s Relationships,’’ in 2006. The book pro-vides teachings that explore the reali-ties of being a Black woman, wife, mother, and minister. It is designed to empower and bless women as they con-tinue on their own journeys of faith. Her second book, ‘‘Faithful, Focused and Fearless: Lessons to Fortify Your Future,’’ was released June 2009. The Brownings are the proud parents of Grainger Browning III, a 2008 grad-uate of Morehouse College, and Candace Davis, a 2008 graduate of Hampton University and current grad-uate student at Howard University. They are the proud grandparents of Grainger Browning IV and Kaylah Browning and Imani Davis. The story of Ebenezer AME Church is much like the Parable of the Mustard Seed. When Grainger and Jo Ann Browning arrived at Ebenezer AME in 1983, the church had a membership of 17 people and an annual budget of $12,000. Under the Brownings’ inspired leader-ship, the membership now exceeds 8,000 people, and the church has an annual budget of $10 million. Ebenezer AME Church has over 100 different min-istries dedicated to serving the spir-itual, educational, political, social, economic, health, and recreational needs of the community. For nearly 30 years, the Ebenezer AME Church fam-ily has donated nearly $2 million in scholarships to high school graduates and returning college students. Ever mindful of the multitude of spiritual and physical needs, Ebenezer AME Church’s future plans include the de-velopment of a school, family life cen-ter, and senior citizen complex. The Brownings and Ebenezer AME Church continue to strive to be a source of help and inspiration within the walls of the church and throughout the commu-nity. I am proud to celebrate the Brown-ings’ 35th anniversary at Ebenezer AME Church this Sunday. I call upon all of my Senate colleagues to join me in congratulating the Reverend Dr. Grainger Browning, Jr., and his wife, the Reverend Dr. Jo Ann Browning, for their extraordinary leadership and dedicated service to their parishioners, the surrounding community, and all of humankind.∑

REMEMBERING AUBREY M CGINNIS ∑Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of Au-brey McGinnis. Aubrey was born on December 26, 1960, and passed away on Saturday, March 18, 2017. Aubrey joined the U.S. Army in 1981, serving the Illinois Army National Guard for 22 years and retiring as a chief warrant officer 4 pilot. During his service, Aubrey graduated from the Illinois Institute of Tech-nology, where he earned a bachelor’s of science degree in electrical engineering in 1986. After working for a few years at Amoco, he earned an additional de-gree in aviation technology at Vin-cennes University on a Tuskegee Air-man Scholarship. Aubrey then pursued his lifelong passion to fly commer-cially with, first, Comair, Inc., and later with United Airlines as an airline pilot. As a loving husband to Ericka McGinnis and devoted father, Aubrey enjoyed being a provider and spiritual guide to his beautiful family. Aubrey was a dear friend to many, and he left a profound mark on the lives of all those he loved and met. He was a quiet voice of reason and wis-dom, and I am proud to stand here today and honor his legacy.∑

TRIBUTE TO LOUISE ABERCROMBIE ∑Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Louise Abercrombie, a woman who has worked diligently serving the people of Oklahoma through her journalism career for 50 years. Louise began her career with the Ponca City News, gathering city briefs, walking almost 30 blocks a day. This hard work eventually led her to cover obituaries and religion and then the chamber of commerce beat and poli-tics. Louise covered all aspects of commu-nity news in her career, becoming widely known for her accurate report-ing and keen research skills. She has interviewed six Oklahoma Governors, covered five Presidents, many inter-national leaders, and several Members of Congress. I personally had the privi-lege of working with her when she cov-ered a countless number of my fly-ins over the years. I want to thank Louise Abercrombie on her years of service and wish her well in her retirement. Well done, Lou-ise.∑ MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to the Senate by Ms. Ridgway, one of his secretaries. f

A bill to require the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the Depart-ment of Commerce to provide esti-mates relating to the distribution of aggregate economic growth across spe-cific percentile groups of income; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the R
ECORD . There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows: 
S. 3440 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Measuring Real Income Growth Act of 2018’’. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: (1) Economic inequality in the United States has increased dramatically during the 4 decades preceding the date of enactment of this Act, with fewer households taking home a larger share of the national income. (2) While growth was once distributed rel-atively evenly across all individuals in the United States, research shows that economic gains are increasingly enjoyed by the most affluent. By contrast, the majority of indi-viduals in the United States have seen in-come and wage growth significantly below what is suggested by national measures of output and income. (3) The Bureau of Economic Analysis of the Department of Commerce (referred to in this section as ‘‘BEA’’) reports annual and quar-terly estimates of gross domestic product (referred to in this section as ‘‘GDP’’) in the United States. These estimates are impor-tant measures of the overall size and health of the economy of the United States but do not describe how economic gains are distrib-uted across the population of the United States. (4) In a country of 325,000,000 individuals, top-line GDP numbers do not capture the full range of household economic experiences and may be misleading. The real GDP grew more than 3 percent annually between 2003 and 2005, but the average income for 
1⁄2of all individuals in the United States fell during that period. (5) Disaggregating economic growth by in-come groups will provide a more complete picture of how families in the United States are faring across all rungs of the economic ladder and whether economic growth is bene-fiting all individuals in the United States. (6) Recent academic estimates of distribu-tional growth show how much of the eco-nomic gains during the 40 years preceding the date of enactment of this Act have ac-crued to the top of the income distribution. Between 1980 and 2014, the average income of the top 1 percent of the income distribution grew 5 times as much as the average income of the bottom 90 percent of the income dis-tribution and more than 9 times as much as the average income of the bottom 
1⁄2. (7) Official and timely estimates of dis-tributional growth from BEA, reported alongside top-line GDP numbers, would en-able Congress to better evaluate economic policies that impact every individual in the United States. (8) Efforts to address slow wage growth, stagnant incomes, and growing economic in-equality require broadening the focus beyond GDP and obtaining metrics that better cor-respond to the experiences of all families in the United States.

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 629—EX-PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE WITH RESPECT TO EN-HANCED RELATIONS WITH THE REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA AND SUPPORT FOR MOLDOVA’S TER-RITORIAL INTEGRITY Mr. COONS (for himself and Mr. R
ISCH) submitted the following resolu-tion; which was referred to the Com-mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. R ES. 629 Whereas the United States has enjoyed sta-ble and positive relations with the Republic of Moldova for over 25 years; Whereas, since Moldova’s independence in 1991, the United States has provided finan-cial assistance to support the people of Moldova’s efforts to build a prosperous Euro-pean democracy; Whereas the Governments of the United States and Moldova further strengthened their partnership through the launching of the inaugural Strategic Dialogue on March 3, 2014; Whereas the United States Government seeks to help Moldova increase its pros-perity, secure its democratic institutions, se-cure its internationally recognized borders, and integrate with Europe and the Euro-At-lantic community; Whereas the United States and Moldova continue to broaden and deepen their part-nership through advancing shared interests in democracy, good governance, anti-corrup-tion, energy independence, economic devel-opment, and security cooperation through the relaunching of the Strategic Dialogue on June 23, 2017; Whereas corruption remains a major obsta-cle in Moldova, which inhibits the country’s ability to develop businesses, attract foreign investment, ensure good governance, and pursue closer integration with the European Union; Whereas the Government of Moldova has been urged to fight corruption and improve governance since Moldova’s independence, particularly in the wake of a 2014 scandal in-volving the loss of over a billion dollars, and the Government of Moldova has moved for-ward with certain reforms seeking to address these issues; Whereas efforts to improve governance and adopt domestic reforms are critical to Moldova’s ability to secure loan packages from international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and the Euro-pean Union; Whereas the International Monetary Fund has approved a three-year loan package pre-mised on the continuation of reforms focused on strengthening the economy, bolstering economic development, and promoting trade and investment; Whereas Moldova ratified an Association Agreement containing comprehensive free trade provisions with the European Union in 2014, and the Agreement became fully effec-tive in July 2016; Whereas the people and Government of the United States supports the democratic aspi-rations of the people of Moldova and their expressed desire to deepen their association with the European Union; Whereas in a judgment in 2004, the Euro-pean Court of Human Rights found that Transnistria was formed with the support of the Government of the Russian Federation and considered it ‘‘under the effective au-thority or at least decisive influence of Rus-sia’’; Whereas the United States supports the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Moldova and on that basis participates as an observer in the ‘‘5+2’’ negotiations to find a comprehensive settlement that will provide a special status for the separatist region of Transnistria in Moldova; Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation banned the import of Moldovan wine in 2013, and Moldovan meats and produce in 2014, and has threatened to ban Moldovan agricultural products, curtail the supply of energy resources to Moldova, and impose stricter labor migration policies on the people of Moldova; Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation maintains a contingent of Rus-sian troops and a stockpile of Russian mili-tary equipment and ammunition within the Transnistria region; Whereas, by September 2016, the Govern-ment of the Russian Federation had issued Russian passports to residents of the Transnistria region; Whereas the Council of Europe, the Organi-zation for Security and Cooperation in Eu-rope, and the Government of Moldova have called upon the Government of the Russian Federation to remove its troops from Moldovan territory; Whereas, in May 2017, the Constitutional Court of Moldova ruled that Moldova’s con-stitutional neutrality means that the pres-ence of foreign troops in Moldova is uncon-stitutional; Whereas, in July 2017, the Moldovan Par-liament adopted a declaration calling on the Government of the Russian Federation to withdraw its troops from Moldova; Whereas the Senate and the House of Rep-resentatives both passed by an overwhelming majority, and the President signed into law Public Law 113–96, providing for a United States international broadcasting program-ming surge to counter disinformation from Russian supported news outlets and ensure that Russian-speaking populations in Ukraine and Moldova have access to inde-pendent news and information; Whereas Moldova has been a valued and re-liable partner in promoting global security by participating in United Nations peace-keeping missions in the Central African Re-public, Kosovo, and South Sudan; Whereas Moldova cooperates with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization through an Individual Partnership Action Plan to im-prove expertise, interoperability, peace-keeping capabilities, military education and training, and public sector reform; Whereas, on June 22, 2018, the United Na-tions General Assembly adopted a resolution calling on Russia to withdraw its troops from Transnistria; Whereas, in August 2018, the Russian Fed-eration conducted military exercises on the western bank of the Dniester River in viola-tion of the Agreement on the Principles for a Peaceful Settlement of the Armed Conflict in the Dniester Region of the Republic of Moldova, which Russia signed in 1992; Whereas August 27 is Moldovan Independ-ence Day, which commemorates the adoption of Moldova’s Declaration of Independence from the Soviet Union on August 27, 1991; and Whereas Moldova will hold parliamentary elections in early 2019: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate — (1) reaffirms it is the policy of the United States to support the sovereignty, independ-ence, and territorial integrity of Moldova, and that Moldova has a sovereign right to determine its own partnerships, free of exter-nal coercion and pressure, including Moldova’s right to associate with the Euro-pean Union or any regional organization; (2) supports the Strategic Dialogue as a means to strengthen relations between Moldova and the United States and enhance the democratic, economic, and security re-forms already being undertaken by Moldova; (3) encourages the Secretary of State and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development to focus United States assistance on supporting reforms that strengthen the justice sector, promote an open, transparent, and demo-cratic government, foster independent media, increase energy security, and pro-mote inclusive economic growth in both rural and urban areas; (4) encourages the Government of Moldova to continue implementing crucial reforms to increase the capacity of and trust in demo-cratic institutions, strengthen the justice sector through anti-corruption efforts, and maintain open space for civil society to oper-ate; (5) urges the Government of Moldova to en-list civil society in anti-corruption efforts, in accordance with Article 13 of the United Nations Convention against Corruption, to which Moldova is a signatory; (6) reaffirms the importance of and support for free, fair, and transparent elections in Moldova; (7) supports efforts to counter disinformation campaigns in Eastern Europe in ways that are consistent with democratic principles; (8) calls upon the Government of the Rus-sian Federation to fulfill its commitments made at the Istanbul summit of the Organi-zation for Security and Cooperation in Eu-rope in 1999, and to withdraw its military forces and munitions from within the inter-nationally recognized territory of Moldova; (9) calls upon the Government of the Rus-sian Federation to refrain from issuing eco-nomic threats or exerting pressure against Moldova and to cease any and all actions that support separatist movements within the territory of Moldova; and (10) urges all parties to refrain from unilat-eral actions that may undermine efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution, and supports efforts to resolve the Transnistria issue through a comprehensive settlement that se-cures Moldova’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. f

Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about the opioid legislation. I will get to that; however, I do wish to briefly comment on an-other critical issue. Once again, I want to thank Pro-fessor Ford for her bravery. This is not easy for anyone. Nobody asks for this to happen to them, and I can only imagine the trauma and heartache in-volved in sharing and reliving a sexual assault like this. But she should know that I and millions of people are stand-ing by her side and stand ready to help however we can. I want to make three points. First, this nomination needs to be de-layed. The idea that this nomination could be jammed through given what we know now is almost unthinkable and would be shameful and wrong. Whatever one may think about the timing of this new information and the process that has taken us to this point, the fact is that Senators now have new information about a potential crime committed by a nominee for the high-est Court in the land and an individual who has come forward with details of the alleged criminal act, and we can’t simply ignore it. There is no urgency to fill this seat before October. Republicans held a Su-preme Court seat open for more than a year in order to prevent President Obama from fulfilling his constitu-tional role, so surely we can take the time we need now in order to fulfill our constitutional role. To be very clear, we should have nine Justices on the Supreme Court, but it is more impor-tant right now to slow down, make sure we have all of the facts, all the in-formation, and that Senators have a chance to weigh that before casting a vote to a position of such importance. Secondly, we need a full, fair, and ro-bust investigation into these allega-tions, and we need this to happen be-fore anyone is brought in to testify or ‘‘re-testify’’ to make sure Senators have the information they need to ask the right questions and to do their jobs. We saw what happened in 1991 when an accuser was brought in for ques-tioning before the Senators had access to all of the corroborating information, and we cannot allow that to happen again. We saw the way Senators com-pletely mishandled the questioning of Anita Hill when they didn’t have ac-cess to the facts, hadn’t yet heard from all of the witnesses, and didn’t have a grasp of the information and her expe-rience. I am very worried this would happen exactly that way again if we don’t take the time to do this right. There is no way a thorough investiga-tion can be completed in time for a hearing on Monday. That brings me to my third and most important point. We cannot allow this to turn into another attack on a woman who has come forward to talk about her experience. We just can’t.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6195 September 17, 2018 
The Senate needs to be better than that. And I am going to do everything I can with anyone who is willing to join me to make sure we are. I joined millions of women in 1991 in watching as Anita Hill was attacked, interrogated, and maligned on national television simply for sharing her expe-rience. A generation of women watched what happened to her and were then less likely to share their own stories and more likely to let their attackers and harassers off the hook because they saw what happened to Anita Hill at the hands of the U.S. Senate, and they didn’t want anything like that to happen to them. That cannot happen again. An all-male Judiciary Com-mittee dropped the ball in 1991. We can-not allow an all-male Republican side of the Judiciary Committee to do the same in 2018. Over the past year, we have made some tremendous strides with the ‘‘me too.’’ movement and the understanding more and more that sexual harassment and assault is not OK and cannot be tolerated no matter how powerful the perpetrator. We have made tremendous strides with the understanding more and more that women who have come forward should be listened to, should be heard and believed, and that investiga-tions and all appropriate actions should be taken once they have come forward to share their experience. We have made tremendous strides with the understanding more and more that women who come forward do so at great cost. None of them want to have to do so. All of them wish they had never been through what they went through. And the idea that they are making it up for some personal gain or agenda is as wrong as it is offensive. We have made progress, but all that progress is at stake if this is now al-lowed to become a replay of what hap-pened to Anita Hill, and I am already seeing some troubling signs of some people going down that path. Right away, some Republicans have shifted into an attack mode, attacking the process and starting to attack the ac-cuser. I can only imagine Republicans are getting ready to attack and inter-rogate Professor Ford in a misguided attempt to protect Judge Kavanaugh and put politics ahead of their job as U.S. Senators and their duty to their constituents. We cannot allow attacks like that to happen. I urge all of my colleagues, Democrats and Repub-licans, to put a stop to it whenever they see it. Let’s look at the facts. Let’s inves-tigate the allegations. Let’s consider what that means for our view on this nominee, but let’s make sure that it doesn’t become another 1991, and let’s make sure this doesn’t become another attack on a woman resulting in an-other chill on women everywhere. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to turn to another issue, and I ask unanimous consent that my remarks appear in the R
ECORD before the vote took place. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from South Dakota. f 
REMEMBERING STAFF SERGEANT DAVID FISCHER Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a fallen hero, Assistant Fire Chief Dave Fischer of Sturgis, SD. Dave, a 22-year member of the Sturgis Volunteer Fire Department, also served in the South Dakota Na-tional Guard’s 82nd Civil Support Team based out of Rapid City. On Friday, September 7, 2018, Dave dutifully responded to the report of a structure fire in nearby Tilford. Like so many times before, Dave was one of the first Sturgis firefighters to arrive at the scene, where a single-family home was engulfed in flames and begin-ning to threaten other nearby homes and families. According to reports, Dave was at-tempting to move one of the fire de-partment’s command vehicles just north of the home when a propane tank exploded, a piece of which struck him and his vehicle, killing him instantly. Both he and the owner of the home, Raymond Bachmeier, perished on that tragic day. We send our sympathies to all of the friends and family members they leave behind. Dave’s death is a tremendous loss for the State of South Dakota, especially the Sturgis area and surrounding com-munities, where he lived almost his en-tire life. Dave exemplified what it meant to serve others. He was a member of the Sturgis Volunteer Fire Department for more than 20 years. He was active in the Sturgis emergency medical service, where his wife still serves as the direc-tor. And Dave served in the National Guard for 23 years, serving a tour in Iraq with the 216th Engineer Detach-ment Firefighting Team in 2004 and 2005. As a soldier, a firefighter, and a first responder, Dave spent over half his life selflessly putting others first, willing to risk his life to keep his fel-low neighbors and fellow Americans safe. By all accounts, Dave was a true hero. His commander in the South Da-kota National Guard, LTC Dale Gadbois, called Dave one ‘‘of the finest soldiers I knew who would help anyone and everyone in times of need. From the beginning it was obvious he put his service before himself and paid the ul-timate price rushing in to help the community in an emergency. It was an honor to have served with him.’’ Those words are a testament to the kind of person Dave was, always put-ting others first. Dave was laid to rest this last Satur-day at the Black Hills National Ceme-tery near Sturgis. He leaves behind his wife and children. We continue to keep them in our thoughts and prayers dur-ing this incredibly difficult time. While we can’t take away the hurt, please know that we will never forget the sac-rifices that Dave made, and we will not forget the sacrifices that Dave’s family has made. Not everyone is willing to put their life on the line to keep us safe, but Dave did just exactly that. He put oth-ers before himself throughout his life. His legacy will not soon be forgotten. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

NOMINATION OF BRETT KAVANAUGH Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I just wanted to follow my colleague from Washington with comments about having a hearing in the Judiciary Com-mittee as we proceed to next Monday. I think it is very important that all of our colleagues have all of the informa-tion. I also think it is important that an investigation be taken seriously and be underway at the same time. So I hope that my colleagues are not just thinking that we will have a hearing and move forward as quickly as pos-sible but will treat this as the serious investigation that people in the State of Washington and around the country want to see. I so appreciate the fact that this is a very challenging time, but information must be received and a true investigation must also occur. I thank the President. I yield the floor.

INTRODUCTION OF THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND IUU FISHING ACT 
HON. MADELEINE Z. BORDALLO 
OF GUAM  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 17, 2018 Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, today I intro-duce the Human Trafficking and IUU Fishing Act. I thank my colleagues, Congressman G
RI-
JALVA (D–AZ) and Congresswomen R
ADEWAGEN (R–AS) and B ONAMICI (D–OR), for their support as original cosponsors. Increasingly, we are seeing foreign fishing fleets forcing vulnerable people—migrant workers taken or smuggled out of their home countries and coerced into taking illegal nar-cotics as stimulants—to fish around the clock without rest, out of fear for their very lives. Human trafficking and forced labor in the global seafood industry is, very simply, a form of modern slavery. The United Nations’ International Labor Or-ganization, the Food and Agriculture Organiza-tion, and the International Organization for Mi-gration all recognize human trafficking, forced labor, and related transnational organized crime in the seafood industry to be pressing global problems. In June 2018, the U.S. State Department’s Trafficking in Persons Report identified more than 40 countries with substantial human traf-ficking and forced labor across their seafood industries and supply chains. This is especially true in southeast Asia and the south Pacific, where IUU fishing dominates much of the seafood industry. Right now, trafficked persons who were forced into the IUU fishing industry remain ma-rooned on sparse islands in the South China Sea, waiting to be rescued. Seafood products harvested with slave labor are largely untraceable and could end up in our grocery store aisles, on the menu at our restaurants, or on our family dinner tables. Last year, the United States imported some $21.5 billion in seafood products from abroad. Congress and the Executive Branch have a responsibility to ensure that the United States does not import any seafood associated with human trafficking, forced labor, or other human rights abuses. To address this problem, our Human Traf-ficking and IUU Fishing Act would add the Secretary of Commerce (NOAA Fisheries) to the President’s existing Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, chaired by the Secretary of State. Human trafficking and illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing rank among the top global crimes. These criminal activities generate billions in illicit profits each year for transnational crimi-nal organizations and other groups respon-sible for human rights abuses. Since 2016, U.S. Customs and Border Pro-tection has detained 15 shipments of seafood processed illegally in mainland China by North Korean workers under forced labor. With poor traceability and a lack of account-ability in the global seafood supply chain, we simply do not know where our seafood prod-ucts come from or the conditions under which they are harvested and processed. We must ensure that American fishermen are never expected to compete against foreign seafood imports harvested with slave labor. Our bipartisan bill builds upon the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (Public Law 106–386), sponsored by Congressman SMITH (R–NJ) from New Jersey. I urge all my colleagues to join us in co-sponsoring the Human Trafficking and IUU Fishing Act.

RECOGNIZING MIKE ANDREW LEPRINO 
HON. MIKE COFFMAN 
OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 17, 2018 Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Mike Andrew Leprino. Mike passed away on August 30th, and leaves be-hind a legacy of hard work, generosity, and community service. He truly lived the Amer-ican dream. His loss will be greatly felt in our community, as well as across Colorado, Cali-fornia, and the United States. Mike was the son of Italian immigrants who came to the United States in 1914. Eventually settling in Colorado, the Leprino’s opened a small Italian grocery store in 1950 where they sold a variety of cheeses, in the style of their native Italy. While chain grocery stores com-petition caused their small business to close, the Leprino’s did not despair, instead they came up with a new way to thrive by entering the newly booming market of cheese for piz-zas. Soon their new company, Leprino Foods, began to grow exponentially. Mike was a pillar in the Denver community. A banker, developer and community servant. Some of the greatest treasures and neighbor-hoods in our state were built and funded by Mike. He gave back relentlessly to his state and country, something that he also instilled in each of his children. Mr. Speaker, I can think of no better exam-ple of the American dream, than that of Mike, and his parent’s before him. They always re-mained optimists and Mike is someone who from humble beginnings built an enviable leg-acy in our state. We can all take a lesson in hard work, determination, and the entrepre-neurial spirit from Mike Leprino. He is pre-ceded in death by his wife Joan, son Michael, sister Ange Testa, and brother Lou. Mike is survived by his wife Suzy, daughters; Laurie Leprino, Nancy Leprino, and Mary Leprino. He is also survived by 6 grandchildren, 2 great- grandchildren, sister Marie Videtto and brother Jim Leprino. Those of us who were fortunate enough to know Mike and his indomitable opti-mism and spirit will miss him. f 
RECOGNIZING THE BICENTENNIAL OF MARTINSBURG, INDIANA 
HON. TREY HOLLINGSWORTH 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 17, 2018 Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Bicentennial of Martins-burg, Indiana. Martinsburg was founded in the wilderness of southern Indiana less than two years after the Hoosier State joined the union. Over the course of 200 years, the inevitable forces of time and nature have changed Martinsburg, but fortunately much remains the same. Martinsburg is still a town that prides itself on being a friendly place to grow up and a good place to raise a family. It is still a town that knows that small-town values of decency, hospitality, and hard work are worth pro-tecting. It is a town that remembers and treasures its heritage. Members of the namesake Martin family still live, work, and worship here. In fact, since 1859, residents have been able to shop or just visit at Billy Martin’s Store. Today, they boast that they are the oldest operating store to be passed down from father to son in the entire state of Indiana. It is a town that understands that when dis-aster strikes, the only way to rebuild is to re-build together. Many of the homes and store-fronts look different today than in the old pic-tures because while the tornado may have de-stroyed homes, it did not destroy this commu-nity. Martinsburg is not just part of the fabric of our Hoosier history, but also our American his-tory. Each year, millions of visitors to the Smithsonian have the opportunity to see the orange school bus that carried rural children to school in Martinsburg during the 1930s and ’40s. Much has changed, but the spirit and values that have made this community great for two centuries have not. Martinsburg is truly a mag-nificent addition to Washington County and the state of Indiana. I am honored to represent this town and its people on the 200th anniver-sary of their founding. Here’s to the next 200 years of friendship, fellowship, and community in Martinsburg, Indiana.

HONORING THE 50TH ANNIVER-SARY OF THE EVERSON MUSEUM OF ART 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 17, 2018 Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of the Everson Museum of Art’s 50th anniversary. Everson has long been the premier art museum in Central New York, helping drive the regional economy and con-tributing to the identity of our community. Lo-cated at 401 Harrison Street in downtown Syr-acuse, the building is considered a leading ex-ample 1960s architecture. Everson traces its roots back to 1897, when art historian George Fisk Comfort established the Syracuse Museum of Fine Arts. The mu-seum grew rapidly and was constantly chang-ing its location to house an extensive collec-tion. It was not until 1968 that a permanent museum was built, made possible through a generous donation by Helen Everson. In honor of Mrs. Everson’s gift, the new art collection was renamed Everson Museum of Art. The museum is home to nearly 11,000 pieces of art, including paintings, sculptures, ceramics, and videos. Notable works are por-traits of George Washington, Edward Hick’s The Peaceable Kingdom and several Marja Vallila sculptures. Additionally, Everson holds the distinction of displaying one of the first video art collections in the United States. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House to join me in recognizing Everson Mu-seum of Art’s 50th anniversary. Under the ex-cellent leadership of Director Elizabeth Dun-bar, it is my hope the museum continue to thrive for many years to come. Furthermore, I encourage my colleagues in the House to ap-plaud all talented artists and their contributions to communities around the country.

RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBU-TIONS OF FREDERICK GROVER, M.D. 
HON. DIANA DeGETTE 
OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 17, 2018 Ms. D
EGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the contributions of a remarkable Coloradan, Frederick Grover, M.D., who on September 20th will retire after nearly 50 years of exem-plary professional, military and community service. Dr. Grover has been a powerful force in our community; he has had an extraordinary ca-reer as a cardiothoracic surgeon at our pre-eminent medical institutions and is a recog-nized national leader in his field. Dr. Grover is a graduate of Duke University School of Medicine. He completed his resi-dency training at Duke and the University of Colorado. After two years of service in the U.S. Navy in San Diego, he spent 19 years at University of Texas at San Antonio Health Science Center in the Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery. He then became the head of the Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery at the University of Colorado School of Medi-cine and Chief of Surgical Services at the De-partment of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Denver. His impact will be felt for decades through his active participation in the training and men-toring of more than 50 thoracic surgery resi-dents, his clinical work in the areas of ac-quired adult cardiac surgery and lung and heart transplantation and his dedication to international medical missions. Dr. Grover’s legacy includes a new chair, with its first appointee serving this year, at the University of Colorado Denver School of Medi-cine: The Fred and Carol Grover Endowed Chair in Surgery. Dr. Grover served as President of the Soci-ety of Thoracic Surgeons (SOTS) from 2006 to 2007 and has worked closely with my office and the entire Colorado congressional delega-tion over many years to impact federal health care legislation. As a fellow congregant at Montview Boule-vard Presbyterian Church, I have seen Dr. Grover’s commitment to his community and to improving people’s health on a global scale. He has been on Montview’s Global Mission Committee since 2003 and has led numerous medical missions to Nepal, improving health care facilities and performing life-saving sur-geries. He is also very much a family man, devoted to especially to his grandchildren—who range in age from grade school to college. He has made a point of bringing each of them, when very young, to Washington DC so they could experience our nation’s capital. I have been proud to host them in Congress, even on the House floor itself. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today to honor my friend Fred Grover for his dedication to patients, his compassion and his significant participation in the civic life of Colorado. It is an honor to celebrate his service. f 
CELEBRATING THE BOROUGH OF WANAQUE’S 100TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. RODNEY P. FRELINGHUYSEN 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 17, 2018 Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the Borough of Wanaque located in the County of Passaic, New Jersey, on the occasion of its 100th Anniversary. The original occupants of Passaic County were the Lenape Indians, who were attracted to the land for its diverse natural resources and abundance of freshwater sources, which they utilized for fishing, hunting, and naviga-tion. Wanaque is the name given to the valley by the Lenape and has been translated as ‘‘valley of sassafras.’’ In 1697, Dutch settlers began to settle within the region and included such families as the Beams, Sloats, Van Dines, Vreelands, Van Wagoners, Ryersons, and many others. Like the Native Americans, they were drawn to the region for its natural resources, and they established settlements along the Passaic River, which was navigable to Manhattan and was used as a trade route until the incorporation of the Erie Railroad in 1836. The growth of industry in Passaic Coun-ty was directly connected to the presence of its rich natural resources. The activities of the early Dutch settlers centered on farming. Sheep were also raised and their wool was spun and woven into cloth. Timber was cut from the surrounding forest and hauled to newly constructed sawmills and gristmills to be made into lumber for houses. The Boroughs of Wanaque and Ringwood were originally part of Pompton Township, a since defunct township. Pompton Township was originally formed in 1797, from portions of Saddle River Township and Franklin Township in Bergen County, and incorporated on Feb-ruary 21, 1798. When Passaic County was formed in 1837 it included Pompton Township. The borough of Pompton Lakes was formed in 1895 and was the first municipality to split from the township. The township was divided on February 23, 1918, into the three boroughs of Bloomingdale, Ringwood, and Wanaque, with the remaining portion passing to Pompton Lakes. This ultimately ended the existence of Pompton Township. The early settlements in the Wanaque Val-ley were induced by the presence of rich mines of iron ore discovered in the early part of the 18th Century. For this reason, Ringwood has been referred to as the birth-place of the American iron industry. Cornelius Board, a Welsh miner who entered the Wanaque Valley in 1737, may have been the first to mine ore in the area. In 1740, he built a forge along the Ringwood River (the present-day Wanaque River), which marked the beginning of the Ringwood Iron Works. Later that year the Ogden family bought prop-erty from Board, built their first iron furnace, and established the Ringwood Company. The forests provided wood for the manufacture of charcoal, which was in turn sold to the iron mines. After 1763, a dozen highly productive mines were opened in the area, and many forges and furnaces were located throughout the Wanaque Valley. Peter Hasenclever acquired the property for the London Company and made improvements to enlarge the ironworks. He added needed acreage around Ringwood and Long Pond and constructed a dam on Tuxedo Pond to provide waterpower. Hasenclever established Ringwood Manor as an iron plantation and imported over 500 mine workers from Germany and Britain. After a se-ries of changing property owners, the iron mines were expanded during the mid–19th Century. However, the iron industry in Ringwood did not continue for very long; by 1880, the iron ore from the region was being replaced by ores from the Mesabi Range in Minnesota. The growing railroad network across the country enabled the transport of ores from elsewhere in the country, and the market for locally available ores diminished. By 1893 iron production at Ringwood ceased, and the facility closed its doors. In the late 1800s, the Wanaque Valley had turned further toward industrialization, and be-fore the century’s close, four blacksmith shops, a feed mill, a grist mill, a tannery, and a bobbin factory were located there. A paper industry was established in Borough of Wanaque, and the grist mill, which stood near the present location of the Wanaque Dam, be-came the Wanaque River Paper Company in 1892. The paper mill was owned by local resi-dent Robert D. Carter who employed many of the area’s residents. In the 1920s the Wanaque River Paper Company was lost to the impending construction of the Wanaque Reservoir. Another major industry in the Wanaque Val-ley prior to the reservoir’s construction was the

production of gunpowder. The American Smokeless Powder Works was established in the Borough of Wanaque in 1894 through 1895 with Laflin and Rand Powder taking over the company several years later. The DuPont Company soon acquired the explosives plant and became a major employer in the commu-nity. During World War I, over 7,500 were em-ployed at the explosives plant, and a section of the community, known as Haskell, became a company town, housing DuPont employees and their families. Although the DuPont Com-pany was a major employer of Wanaque and Ringwood prior to and during World War I, by 1926 the company ceased operations because of the impending reservoir construction project, and a major employer was lost from the community. The first railroad into the Wanaque Valley area was begun in 1865, and the first station was established at the Ringwood Avenue crossing. In 1872, Midvale was listed as a stop on the Montclair Railroad, and by the time the railroad was operated by the New York and Greenwood Lake Railway, there were two stations in Wanaque—one in Midvale and one in Haskell. The New York and Greenwood Lake Railroad was respon-sible for bringing many new settlers to the Wanaque area, and excursion trails carried passengers to Greenwood Lake from Jersey City. The construction of the Wanaque Reservoir had a profound impact on the Boroughs of Wanaque and Ringwood and its residents. To provide the necessary space needed to create such a massive structure, many homes and businesses were demolished. The loss of the DuPont plant and the paper mill in Wanaque, which provided major sources of employment for residents in the area, left hundreds of resi-dents unemployed through the Depression years of 1929 through 1939. However, the onset of World War II brought an improved economy, and after the war, Wanaque and Ringwood experienced a construction boom of housing and public buildings. Today, the Borough includes neighborhoods known as Wanaque and Haskell, each of which has their own ZIP code and is served by their own separate post office. As of the United States 2013 Census, the borough pop-ulation was 11,208. Wanaque is a close knit family community, with an outstanding school system, library, many recreation programs, and a beautiful, new municipal building. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and our col-leagues join me in congratulating the Borough of Wanaque, on the occasion of its Centennial Anniversary.

RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVER-SARY OF KENTUCKY EDU-CATIONAL TELEVISION (KET) 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 17, 2018 Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Kentucky Educational Television’s (KET) 50th Anniversary. Since 1968, KET has impacted the lives of countless Kentuckians through its advocacy and broad-casting of educational programs. KET has long-served as a successful educational plat-form for the arts, theater, history, politics, health and STEM fields. In 1989 , KET intro-duced one of the first interactive distance learning program services, giving Kentuckians the opportunity to advance their education via network broadcasting. KET is now one of the largest public television networks in the coun-try with more than 25 programs, reaching over one million people each week. I applaud KET’s commitment to raise aware-ness of pertinent issues across the Common-wealth and challenges in our rural Appa-lachian region. While many media outlets have been slow to produce comprehensive cov-erage of the nation’s deadly opioid epidemic, KET has led the way by shedding light on the long history of addiction in Kentucky and the multi-faceted pledge for rehabilitation and re-covery. It is because of these efforts, including in-depth reports, community forums, and an-nual coverage of the National Rx Drug Abuse and Heroin Summit, that KET recently re-ceived the national Mental Health America Media Award for its Inside Opioid Addiction Initiative. Thanks to KET’s broadcasting ef-forts, more people across Kentucky have ral-lied together to become part of the solution to the drug abuse crisis and we are making sig-nificant strides to save lives across the state. As part of this Golden Anniversary celebra-tion, I also want to commend KET for bringing Kentuckians together and promoting healthy debates about vital issues for the state. For decades, great journalists like Al Smith, Bill Goodman, Bill Bryant and many others have set the stage for state and federal legislators to discuss how key policies impact our daily lives, while also providing civic awareness dur-ing elections, spending countless hours on the air, sharing election results from all of our 120 counties. In addition to educational program-ming and news coverage, KET has also used its platform to extend immense compassion through local partnerships to benefit those most in-need. As KET celebrates the 50th anniversary of its first broadcast, I join my fellow Kentuckians in sharing my appreciation for every minute of broadcasting excellence that has been used to educate our children and our families. KET has made a significant impact in our state and it is an honor to support this organization’s continued work. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE NA-TIONAL SOCIETY OF DAUGHTERS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION, SCRANTON CITY CHAPTER 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 17, 2018 Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Daughters of the American Revolution, Scranton City Chapter, which cele-brates, along with other DAR chapters, the two hundred thirty-first anniversary of the framing of the United States Constitution dur-ing this third week of September. The Con-stitution was adopted by the American Con-gress of the Confederation as the foundation for American government on September 17, 1787. The National Society of Daughters of the American Revolution was founded on October 11, 1890 by a group of pioneering women who were excluded from men’s organizations and felt compelled to express their passion for America. Since its founding, the Daughters of the American Revolution has admitted over 950,000 members who can trace their blood-line to an ancestor who aided America in her fight for independence, and the organization still adheres to the same historical, edu-cational, and patriotic objectives established during its original meeting. The Daughters of the American Revolution were instrumental in petitioning Congress for a bill to designate the period between Sep-tember 17 and September 23 as Constitution Week. That legislation was signed into law by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on August 2, 1956, and President George W. Bush officially declared the inception of Constitution Week in 2002. The law invites schools, churches, and civic organizations to publicly observe and rec-ognize the profound impact on our nation of our remarkable constitution. It is an honor to recognize the Scranton City Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution as they celebrate Constitution Week. I wish them all the best as they con-tinue to promote patriotism and national pride through education and civic engagement. f 
STANDING WITH RELIGIOUS MINORITIES IN INDIA 
HON. JAMIE RASKIN 
OF MARYLAND  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 17, 2018 Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solidarity with members of minority groups in India who are facing persecution because of their faith or class standing. I recently met with Teesta Setalvad, a prominent civil rights law-yer in India. She updated me on the increas-ing religious violence being committed by ex-tremist groups against religious minority com-munities in India including Muslims, Christians, and Hindu Dalits, also known as ‘‘untouch-ables.’’ Although this violence is not new, the United States Commission on International Religious freedom has noted a substantial de-terioration in conditions for minority groups since 2014, when the ruling Bharati Jayanti Party (BJP) rose to power on a Hindu nation-alist political platform. Intensifying religious-based violence has swept 10-of-29 states in India, including Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat, which are controlled by the BJP, and which have begun enforcing anti-cow slaughtering and anti-conversion laws. While attacks on minorities are not al-ways directly instigated by the government, a cloak of impunity covers mob violence that tar-gets these communities. Human rights groups have criticized the pervasive police and judi-cial bias apparently backed by BJP and affili-ated groups such as Rashtriya Swayamsevak Singh (RSS) and Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP). The aggressive enforcement of anti-cow slaughter laws is being used to persecute and intimidate Muslims and Dalits whose families have engaged in dairy, leather or beef trades for generations. Mob violence is common against people suspected of harming cows. In 2017, there were at least 10 public lynchings conducted by ‘‘cow protection’’ mobs. One

such attack occurred when a 55-year-old man, Pehlu Khan, was set-upon by a mob and beat-en to death while transporting a cow home that he had bought at a fair. Most appalling are the cases of sexual as-sault against minorities for political purposes. In January of this year, eight Hindu men kid-napped and raped an eight-year-old Muslim girl in a Hindu temple before killing her. Her murder served the purpose of driving her no-madic community from the area. After the per-petrators were arrested, a mob of Hindu law-yers surrounded the police in an attempt to bar them from entering the courthouse to file charges against the perpetrators. Christians, like Muslims, have been targeted because of the paranoid suspicion that pros-elytizing could convert people away from Hin-duism. Nuns and members of the clergy have suffered attacks for preaching Christian val-ues. Just last month, the home of a pastor in Manipur was burned down and Chadarajupalli Subbaravamma, a woman in her mid-60s in Andhra Pradesh, reportedly was murdered be-cause she converted to Christianity 10 years ago. Likewise, Dalits have been victim to struc-tural violence. They face everyday humiliation as they are blocked from areas of worship and are denied the most basic of human rights, such as access to clean water. Additionally, attacks and sexual assaults against women of the Dalit community frequently go unreported or uninvestigated. In Kerala state, a woman was recently doused in gasoline and set on fire by her estranged husband in the view of village council members. No one attempted to help the woman, and her husband managed to flee the scene. When individuals of minority groups resist violence and oppression, they are met with greater brutality. But liberal democracies stand up for all religious minorities who are fighting for the right to practice their beliefs in the face of vigilante violence and persecution from the majority. It is disheartening that communal violence against religious minorities is on the rise in India, a great ally of the United States and the largest democracy on earth. We must stand up and speak out against these abhorrent at-tacks on religious minorities. India’s govern-ment can no longer look the other way in the face of accelerating violence against religious minorities and the Dalit community. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in standing with civil rights leaders such as Teesta Setalvad in urging India to recognize the humanity of all its people and put an end to these heinous crimes.

DR. FREDERICK L. GROVER, MD 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 17, 2018 Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and applaud Dr. Frederick Grover for his decades of service to the Colo-rado medical community and Veterans in Col-orado. For over forty years, Dr. Grover has trained and mentored numerous thoracic surgery resi-dents all while providing high-quality care to numerous patients throughout Colorado. In ad-dition to clinical interests in the areas of ac-quired adult cardiac surgery and lung and heart transplantation, Dr. Grover is also fo-cused on risk adjusted outcomes analyses and quality improvement in the field of cardiothoracic surgery. He chaired the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Work Force on National Databases from 1995 to 2004. Dr. Grover served as the Chair of the Department of Sur-gery at the University Colorado School of Medicine where he helped develop future gen-erations of medical professionals and the suc-cess of Colorado’s medical community for generations to come. His selfless devotion to his students has provided an exemplary stand-ard of service. In addition to his work at the University of Colorado, Dr. Grover distinguishes himself as a caring member of the community by striving to aid numerous professional organizations. His dedication to the field of medicine and contributions can be seen across Colorado and our nation. He has been a strong advo-cate for healthcare policy at the national level by serving as President of the Society of Tho-racic Surgeons. Additionally, the work he has done within the Veteran’s community of Colo-rado as the Chief of Surgical Services at the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Denver and his pioneering of the VA Car-diac Surgery Database as the Medical Director has been very beneficial to Veterans in Colo-rado. He chaired the United Network for Organ Sharing Thoracic Committee, and has served on the UNOS Board of Directors. He was the co-principal investigator of a large VA multi-center clinical trial comparing off-pump to on-pump coronary artery bypass, which was published in the New England Journal of Med-icine. I extend my deepest thanks to Dr. Frederick Grover for his service to the people of Colo-rado and across the nation. I am certain the effects of his service will continue to benefit our communities for decades to come. I thank Dr. Grover for being a remarkable member of the Colorado medical community. f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF THE LATE CONGRESSMAN MAURICE HINCHEY 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 17, 2018 Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of the late Congressman Maurice Hinchey, our beloved colleague. He departed this life on November 22, 2017 after honorably serving two decades in the United States House of Representatives from 1993 to 2013, and serving in the New York State As-sembly from 1975 to 1992. He was a Navy veteran, an honorable and dedicated public servant, and stalwart for the working class people of New York. Of Ukrainian-American heritage, he was a founding member of the House Ukrainian Caucus. Recently, we were reminded of Congress-man Hinchey’s contributions to his people and our country. On Tuesday, July 24, 2018, President Trump signed into law H.R. 4722–A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 111 Market Street in Saugerties, New York, as the ‘‘Mau-rice D. Hinchey Post Office Building’’. With the naming of this USPS office building, Maurice’s family and his grateful constituency will proud-ly honor and remember a treasured son of Saugerties. I had the distinct honor and privilege of working alongside Maurice on the House Ap-propriations Committee. Through the Com-mittee, he fought to protect student aid by supporting higher education for all worthy stu-dents and championed Pell Grants. He se-cured funding that would help art revitalization for the Samuel Dorsky Museum of Art at SUNY New Paltz. He understood governing started at the local level, and did all he could to direct federal support for a more prosperous life for his people. A fierce and notable environmental advo-cate, Maurice was dedicated to protecting his area’s powerful and precious natural resource, the Hudson River. Through his dedicated work on the Appropriations Committee, he secured funds to modernize and develop environ-mental science laboratories at his district’s local colleges. He also fought against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s lax initia-tive on cleaning up polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs) pollution in the Hudson River. As a member of the House Appropriations Interior Subcommittee, and having my own congres-sional district surrounded by the Great Lakes, I found his leadership on renewable energy and cleaning up water ways both exemplary and inspiring. We are in his debt for his tire-less environmental advocacy as he moved America along the path of progress. A man to stand up for blue collar workers, Maurice was very loyal and adored by the labor community. Having worked as a toll col-lector to pay his college tuition, and then a ce-ment plant worker, he understood the eco-nomic difficulties of the working class people in his district. In the 106th Congress he intro-duced H.R. 2759, the Older Workers Pension Protection Act of 1999. This bill would have helped safeguard employees from age dis-crimination against their benefits. He also fought against funding cuts to Job Corps, a vital entity for young people in his area who need skill and job assistance. As we continue to fight for the rights and protections of our working women and men, may we continue to be inspired by Maurice’s spirit and vision. Maurice and I shared a deep love for Ukraine and our central European roots. We served in the bipartisan Ukrainian Congres-sional Caucus and trumpeted a vision of an independent Ukraine, free of Russian aggres-sion. Maurice uniquely understood the impor-tance of a democratic, prosperous, and free Ukraine, as the edge of liberty on the Euro-pean continent. He was a true champion of democracy both home and abroad. Maurice’s leadership and indefatigable ef-forts on behalf of working people are sorely missed. May his life’s work be an inspiration to the people of the Hudson Valley and his mem-ory be cherished always. Rest well, my dear friend and colleague. May the angels of mercy usher you to a peaceful place where your ge-nius and goodwill shower our planet.

RECOGNIZING BLR ELDER CARE 
HON. MIKE COFFMAN 
OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 17, 2018 Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize BLR Elder Care on the celebration of its 10th Anniversary. BLR Elder Care is a non-profit organization located in the City of Aurora, Colorado and is in Colorado’s 6th Congressional District, which I have the honor of representing here in the United States House of Representatives. BLR Elder Care seeks to provide a dignified, meaningful life to the homeless elderly population in Ethiopia. It does so by providing basic necessities to el-derly Ethiopians who are in need. The gen-erosity of BLR Elder Care serves as a beacon of hope and a source of compassion for the elderly needy in Africa. In recent years, the founder and President of BLR Elder Care, Mamay Worku, has also started a program focused on helping African Women immigrants here in Colorado. Mamay Worku has done so by creating the Women of Africa Alliance for Solutions (WAAS). Through WAAS, she has created an effective platform to advocate for educational opportunities, eco-nomic independence and to build synergy among the diverse African immigrant commu-nities. Mamay Worku, immigrated to the United States in 1989. She has tirelessly served the African immigrant community here in Colorado and those in need in her native country of Ethiopia. It is my honor to recognize all of her hard work as well as all the supporters of BLR Elder Care for their continuing assistance for these two remarkable organizations.

IN RECOGNITION OF MR. DAVID D
ESILVA 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 17, 2018 Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend Mr. David DeSilva on being in-ducted into the California Agricultural Teach-ers Association Hall of Fame. David DeSilva was born and raised in Cali-fornia’s Central Valley. His passion for teach-ing agriculture was developed from a young age. Growing up on a dairy farm, David’s par-ents instilled in him a deep appreciation for agriculture. He worked alongside them on the farm and was heavily involved in the Future Farmers of America organization. After grad-uating from California Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo, Mr. DeSilva began his ca-reer in education at Hanford High School. After five-years at Hanford High School, Mr. DeSilva continued his career at College of the Sequoias in Visalia, California. He would re-main in this position for thirty-years, retiring in 2014. Mr. DeSilva’s tenure at College of the Sequoias was impressive and reflective of his dedication to agriculture and his students. As the agriculture division chair at the college, he was well respected by his peers and viewed as a leader on agriculture issues. Many of his former students have become agricultural teachers, industry leaders, and business own-ers. Mr. DeSilva’s impact extended far beyond the classroom. Locally, he created and imple-mented the California Crop Center at the World Ag Expo in Tulare, California. It is known as a hub of activity for a wide variety of the top crops grown in the state. He was also responsible for the development of Col-lege for Kids, a summer agriculture program for children. Mr. DeSilva’s influence eventually led to international opportunities. He promoted agriculture at colleges in the Ukraine, Russia, and even Haiti. Whether locally or internationally, Mr. DeSilva’s goal remained the same: working with young students and increasing the com-munity’s knowledge about agriculture. Even in retirement, he remains actively involved with the Knights of Columbus organization and local Future Farmers of America chapters. Throughout Mr. DeSilva’s childhood, nearly four-decade career, and into retirement, agri-culture education has been a defining purpose for his life. To be inducted into the California Agricul-tural Teachers Association Hall of Fame, an individual must be a retired agriculture educa-tor with proven dedication for vocational agri-culture, agriculture education, and the Future Farmers of America organization. Mr. DeSilva has consistently demonstrated his dedication to this field throughout his life and is unequivo-cally deserving of this honor. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives to join me in commending Mr. David DeSilva on his dedicated service to the Central Valley and on being inducted into the California Agricul-tural Teachers Association Hall of Fame. f

And finally, we recognize and congratulate the House employees being presented the Team Player Award. This award recognizes the value the House Officers and the Inspector General place on working collaboratively across all House organizations to strengthen and protect the U.S. House of Representa-tives. On a rotating basis, the Officers and the Inspector General take turns nominating a member of another organization’s staff who has exhibited the characteristics of a Team Player.

On behalf of the entire House community, I want to once again congratulate, acknowl-edge, and thank these employees for their professionalism and commitment to the U.S. House of Representatives as a whole, and in particular to their respective House Officer, the Inspector General, and collaboratively across these organizations. Their long hours, hard work, diverse skills, and team spirit are invalu-able, and their years of unwavering service and dedication to the House set an example for their colleagues and raises the bar for the employees who will follow in their footsteps. I applaud all our honorees, and I am proud to stand before you and our great nation on their behalf to recognize the importance of their public service.
