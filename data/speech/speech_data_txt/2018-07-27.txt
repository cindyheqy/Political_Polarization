CONGRATULATING THE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT CONSORTIUM ON ITS 30TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 27, 2018 Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the Housing Development Con-sortium (HDC), a nonprofit housing alliance that has celebrated its 30th anniversary. The HDC was founded in 1988 as an alli-ance of local housing authorities and advo-cacy groups with a simple mission: to make King County a better place to live for every-one, regardless of their income or race. What began as a small collection of local groups has expanded over the past three decades to encompass over one hundred and sixty orga-nizations across the county. Though united in vision, the member organi-zations of the HDC span a variety of industries impacted by housing challenges including fi-nancial institutions, building contractors, law firms, and government agencies. All member organizations under the HDC’s umbrella strive to reduce homelessness and provide afford-able housing for low-income families. As living costs in King County continue to increase, the HDC has secured funding to keep housing af-fordable for 116,000 tenants and people who are at risk for homelessness. The HDC has lived up to its mission of working to ensure that all people live with dignity in safe, healthy, and affordable homes surrounded by commu-nities of opportunity. The consortium operates on the local, state, and federal levels, funding and supporting a wide range of programs. They have created a program that provides King County residents with protection from income discrimination. They have established funding for housing trust funds in Washington State that have con-tributed to the construction of thousands of low to moderate income homes. They have campaigned for changes to the federal tax code and other measures that seek to mini-mize roadblocks to home ownership nation-wide. For the HDC, no challenge is too great or too small. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I congratulate the Housing Development Con-sortium on 30 years of exemplary service to their community. I look forward to the next three decades of service and progress.

RECOGNIZING CHEF MORRIS SALERNO, JR. 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 27, 2018 Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Morris Salerno, owner of BISTECCA—An Italian Steakhouse, of High-land Village, Texas as he returns from sup-porting the United States team as they com-peted for the title of Global Chef 2018. Morris assisted the United States team as Manager/ Mentor for the team headed by Chef Patrick Mitchell at the Global Chefs Challenge in Kuala Lumpur earlier this month. Held every two years, the competition, at-tended by chefs from more than 100 coun-tries, was hosted at Asia on Plate— Worldchefs Congress & Expo 2018. The final competition required the preparation and pres-entation of a four-course menu of twelve servings within an allotted five hour time. Twenty teams, represented by a chef and an assistant, pitted their menu and preparation skills against each other for evaluation by a jury of senior judges representing the Worldchefs Culinary Committee. Chefs and their teams applied their own creative interpre-tations to a variety of assigned products and proteins from around the world. Each team was judged on five elements: Mise-En-Place, Professional Preparation, Service, Presen-tation and Taste. As Manager/Mentor, Morris personally won a gold medal in the 2014 Expogast Culinary Competition in Luxembourg, and a bronze medal in the 2012 competition as part of Team Texas at the Culinary Olympics. Chef Mitchell also won a gold medal in 2014 at Lux-embourg, resulting in two of the 14 total gold awards presented at the competition returning to Texas. In supporting Chef Mitchell as Man-ager/Mentor in preparation for Global Chef 2018, Morris provided not only his guidance and experience as an accomplished inter-national culinary competitor, but also his time and talents in hosting fundraising dinners for the team’s competition expenses. I offer these comments in appreciation of Chef Salerno for his professionalism and sup-port of the United States Team in Kuala Lumpur and other competitions abroad. I also want to recognize him for his years of service to the constituents and communities of the 26th District. Through his art, craft, and part-nership with his brother Mike Salerno, North Texans have had the opportunity to enjoy world-class meals and service for more than 30 years at Highland Village’s The Grotto and BISTECCA—An Italian Steakhouse and at the Flower Mound Salerno’s. I thank Morris and all of the Salerno family for their service, and wish them success. f 
SUPPRESSION, SURVEILLANCE, AND MASS DETENTION: XINJIANG’S HUMAN RIGHTS CRI-SIS 
HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 27, 2018 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, yesterday we held a hearing at the Congres-sional-Executive Commission on China on the human rights crisis in the Xinjiang province of China, which I co-chair. I commend Senator RUBIO for holding this hearing, as there is a dire need to shine a light on the stunning and outrageous detention of nearly one million Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. What is clear from news reports is that Uyghurs are being detained in ‘‘reeducation centers’’ throughout Xinjiang. Those interned are being asked to renounce Islam, inform on their families for ‘‘extremism,’’ and parrot their love for Xi Jinping and the Communist Party. Whole families disappear, children are de-tained, students studying abroad and soccer players are detained because of their ‘‘foreign’’ contacts. There are reports of suicides and deaths and mistreatment in these detention centers. Human rights champion Rebiya Kadeer’s whole family—sons, daughters in law, grand-children have disappeared. The disappear-ance of the families of other Uyghurs has also happened—like Radio Free Asia’s heroic jour-nalists. It is mind-boggling. The Chinese govern-ment is constructing a high-tech police state in Xinjiang. The goal is to forcibly assimilate and ‘‘transform’’ entire ethnic minority populations. All this is being done in the name of counter-terrorism and counter-extremism. But China’s repression may just create the extre-mism that they fear. Over the past year, the world has started to see too many comparisons between the Nazis and the current Chinese government. For example, Liu Xiaobo was the first Nobel Peace Prize laureate to die in state custody since Carl Von Ossietzky died in Nazi custody. Now nearly one million are detained in what should be called concentration camps—the largest jailing of an ethnic and religious minor-ity maybe since the Holocaust, certainly since the apartheid days in South Africa. ‘‘Reeducation’’ is certainly not a new tactic in China. Tibetans, Falun Gong and other dis-sidents have experienced ‘‘reeducation through labor’’—but the size and scale of what is happening to the Uyghurs is audaciously re-pressive, even by China’s low standards. Where is the outrage? Where is the anger? I commend the State Department and Sec-retary Pompeo for their public statements. But why has the Organization of Islamic Coopera-tion been silent? What has Turkey and other Turkic nations been doing to address this issue? Every business, non-governmental organiza-tion, academic, and government that interacts with the Chinese government and Communist Party risks its integrity by remaining silent. There should be a concerted effort to con-vince the International Olympic Committee to consider whether the Olympic goal can be ac-complished in 2022 if China maintains an apartheid-like police state that targets Muslim minorities. How can any law firm or lobby shop shill for the government of China while Uyghurs are so brutally and forcefully assimilated? Or when

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1102 July 27, 2018 
Tibetans, Christians, human rights lawyers, and Falun Gong are systematically repressed? I heard Frank Wolf say recently that in the 1980s, no firm would have dared to work for the Soviet Union—but now China’s cash is too tempting to turn down even for some of my former House colleagues. Shame. Shame. It is really a shame. I wonder if the Congress can limit U.S. gov-ernment contracts by the exact amount lobby firms receive from China, Russia, or some other authoritarian government? That would make for some interesting busi-ness choices. Either make no profit from your dealings with China or choose to represent an increasingly repressive and authoritarian Chi-nese government. No one should profit from representing au-thoritarian countries, particularly when they constantly seek to undermine U.S. values and interests. Chinese officials should also not profit from their complicity in torture and arbitrary deten-tions. This is the exact reason the Congress passed the Global Magnitsky Act. The Senator and I have urged the State De-partment to consider levying Magnitsky sanc-tions on officials in Xinjiang. We will continue to do so. We urge anyone with specific and credible information about Chinese government offi-cials complicit in human rights abuses in Xinjiang to send that information to us. We will make sure it gets to the State Department. I also think the sanctions available in the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 should be considered, particularly broad eco-nomic sanctions targeting industries in Xinjiang that benefit China’s political leaders or State-Owned Entities. China has been designated as a ‘‘Country of Particular Concern’’ since 1999. That des-ignation carries with it the possibility of eco-nomic sanctions. This lever should be used now because, in my opinion, what is hap-pening in Xinjiang is currently the world’s worst religious freedom situation. Targeted and tough economic sanctions are the only way to convince China’s leaders that they have a clear interest in ending repression of China’s Muslim minorities. There is also an important role for the UN here. I am glad that Ambassador Currie is here with us today. What is happening in Xinjiang are clear violations of international treaties in many respects. According to the UN Convention on the Pre-vention and Punishment of the Crime of Geno-cide, crimes of genocide are not confined to mass killing of an ethnic group; they also in-clude ‘‘Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group’’ and ‘‘Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life cal-culated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.’’ Personal accounts from Xinjiang’s re-edu-cation camps seem consistent with these defi-nitions. We should not be ignoring the early warning signs. Actions need to be taken to prevent crimes against humanity. I realize that China’s veto on the UN Secu-rity Council will create obstacles to any UN in-vestigation, but we should be making them use that veto, request a briefing at the Secu-rity Council, and bring together the OIC and other Muslim majority countries to raise the issue within the UN system. At a time when the Chinese government is seeking to gain allies through its Belt and Road initiative, it would seem the last thing they want is an international debate about their treatment of ethnic and religious minori-ties. Finally, I want to commend the exemplary work of Radio Free Asia’s Uyghur Service re-porters. Despite threats to their families they have kept working and have provided us with an extraordinary record of events. Your cour-age and professionalism are admirable. Thank you. Again, I commend Senator R
UBIO for hold- ing this important hearing to shine a light on an outrageous and horrible situation. We all need to believe in the power of light and sunshine because evil flourishes in the dark.

CAMBODIA DEMOCRACY ACT OF 2018 
SPEECH OF  
HON. STEVE CHABOT 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, July 25, 2018 Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5754, the Cambodia Democ-racy Act of 2018. As the Republican Co-Chair of the Congressional Caucus on Cambodia and an original cosponsor of this legislation and I believe it is critical that Congress sup-port the people of Cambodia in their march to-ward democracy. I want to thank Congress-man L
OWENTHAL , the Democratic Co-Chair of the Congressional Caucus on Cambodia, Chairman R
OYCE , and Chairman Y OHO for their work on this important legislation. Throughout his 30-year rule, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen has routinely stifled Cambodia’s progress toward democracy. Last year, he began his latest crackdown because he knew that given the chance, the Cam-bodian people would elect someone else. He began by uprooting civil society organizations. This included cracking down on newspapers such as the Cambodia Daily and outlets like Radio Free Asia and Voice of America as well as forcing the National Democratic Institute to leave the country. Then he started peddling the ridiculous story that the United States was trying to orchestrate a coup. Then he threw Kem Sokah—leader of the Cambodian Na-tional Rescue Party (CNRP) and his principal opponent—in prison. Hun Sen proceeded to disband the CNRP, bar its MPs from serving in public office, and cause many of them to flee into exile. Due to these crimes, there can be no doubt Cambodia’s so-called elections this Sunday will not be free or fair. At present Cambodia can no longer be called a democ-racy, whatever its dictator wants to claim. H.R. 5754 is simple. It would sanction those individuals who are responsible for crushing democracy in Cambodia to encourage them to reverse their actions, to show our support for the Cambodian people, and to demonstrate that we will not stand idly by when democracy is squashed around the world. I would urge my colleges to support this measure. CHINA AND CHINESE COMPANIES CONTINUE TO VIOLATE U.S. IN-TELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS HON. TOM MARINO 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 27, 2018 Mr. MARINO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn China and Chinese companies for their continued theft and violation of United States intellectual property (IP) law. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) conference report that was passed on Thursday by the House of Representatives missed a crucial opportunity to hold ZTE, a Chinese telecommunications company, ac-countable for their blatant violation of U.S. IP law. ZTE, and other Chinese companies, either outright steal American IP and present it as their own, or blatantly refuse to pay licensing fees for the use of this IP. If ZTE broke into a warehouse in Pennsylvania and stole mil-lions of dollars’ worth of microprocessors we would certainly hold them accountable. How-ever, we are refusing to defend IP and make clear that ZTE must abide by U.S. IP law as a requirement for doing business in the U.S. For too long China, and Chinese compa-nies, have blatantly stolen U.S. IP at the ex-pense of American companies and con-sumers. I would ask my colleagues and the Administration to make it a priority in holding companies like ZTE accountable for the theft and violation of U.S. IP laws.

TRIBUTE TO EAGLE SCOUT LOGAN A. BRYAN 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 27, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Logan A. Bryan of Waukee, Iowa for achieving the rank of Eagle Scout. Logan is a member of Boy Scout Troop No. 178 in Waukee and is a stu-dent at Waukee High School. The Eagle Scout designation is the highest advancement rank in scouting. Approximately 5 percent of Boy Scouts earn the Eagle Scout Award. The award is a performance-based achievement with high standards that have been well-maintained over the past century. To earn the Eagle Scout rank, a Boy Scout is obligated to pass specific tests that are or-ganized by requirements and merit badges, as well as completing an Eagle Project to benefit the community. Logan’s Eagle Scout Service Project included raising funds to purchase a portable AED for use at the Walnut Creek youth baseball complex. He also held a train-ing class for coaches and board members to learn how to use the AED in an emergency. The work ethic Logan has shown in his Eagle Project and every other project leading to his Eagle Scout rank speaks volumes of his com-mitment to serving a cause greater than him-self and assisting his community. Mr. Speaker, the example set by this young man and his supportive family demonstrates the rewards of hard work, dedication, and per-severance. I am honored to represent Logan

ESTABLISHING THE ADAMS MEMORIAL COMMISSION 
SPEECH OF  
HON. STEVE CHABOT 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, July 23, 2018 Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1220, which would establish the Adams Memorial Commission. As a former teacher and a history major from the College of William and Mary, our nation’s second old-est college, I think we should do more to re-member President John Adams. He was in-strumental in our nation’s founding and he is a central, if often overlooked, figure in Amer-ican history. John Adams—who served as our first Vice President and second President—was a statesman, lawyer, diplomat, political theorist, and leader in the campaign for American Inde-pendence. As a Member of both the First and Second Continental Congress, he became a leader in the movement for independence. During the Second Continental Congress, he nominated George Washington to lead the Continental Army, and is one of the most prominent signers of the Declaration of Inde-pendence, serving on the committee that helped Thomas Jefferson craft this monu-mental document. During and after the war, he served in numerous diplomatic posts in Eu-rope. Along with Benjamin Franklin, he nego-tiated the Treaty of Paris that ended the Revo-lutionary War and solidified America’s new independence. He also served in Holland dur-ing the war, and as our Ambassador to Britain following the war. Throughout his time serving the United States, President Adams remained true to his principles, and consistently fought for his beliefs. Due to these immeasurable contributions, President Adams deserves to be more visibly honored among our nation’s founders. H.R. 1220 recognizes his service by establishing a Commission to advance current efforts to build a memorial in his honor. I would urge my col-leagues to support this legislation.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 27, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Della and Charles Davis of Council Bluffs, Iowa on the very special occasion of their 70th wedding anniversary. They were married on July 10, 1948 in Des Moines, Iowa. Della and Charles’ lifelong commitment to each other and their family truly embodies Iowa values. As they reflect on their 70th anni-versary, I hope it is filled with happy memo-ries. May their commitment grow even strong-er, as they continue to love, cherish, and honor one another for many years to come. Mr. Speaker, I commend this great couple on their 70th year together and I wish them many more. I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating them on this momentous occasion. f 
CONGRATULATING TUKWILA CITY COUNCILMEMBER JOE DUFFIE ON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 27, 2018 Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the achievements of Tukwila City Councilmember Joe Duffie, and congratulate him on his retirement from the Council after 35 years of unwavering service to his community. Before serving on the Tukwila City Council, Duffie had already garnered an impressive list of accomplishments. In 1962, he was drafted into the U.S. Army and completed advanced infantry training as the most distinguished trainee of his Company. He served in Korea and earned the rank of Squad Leader. Shortly thereafter, Duffie went on to attend Command General Staff College where he achieved the rank of Staff Sergeant, went through Senior Non-Commissioned Officer training, and com-pleted Command Sergeant Major Academy. After leaving Active military service Mr. Duffie maintained his positions as head custodian at Tukwila elementary school for two decades, served in the National Guard for thirty-one years, worked as a welder in a Seattle ship-yard, and currently owns Duffie’s—a home maintenance company with the slogan, ‘‘No Job is Too Small.’’ That slogan perfectly captures Joe Duffie. Since his election to the Tukwila City Council in 1981 by a four-to-one margin, he has been regarded as a man of the people. He is a tire-less worker who selflessly gives out his per-sonal phone number to any citizen who wants to reach him. He has constantly prioritized openness and transparency, and started a monthly tradition where Tukwila citizens have the opportunity to chat with their City Council representatives over coffee. His unique com-passionate and personal approach to govern-ment will be missed. One of Mr. Duffie’s greatest passions is education. His efforts have helped make Tukwila public schools some of the most di-verse and inclusive in the country. His un-swerving advocacy for the youth of Tukwila has resulted in many of the city’s students knowing him by name. On top of his work as a City Councilmember, he has lead a weekly running program for Tukwila’s elementary school students. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to thank Joe Duffie for his decades of service on the Tukwila City Council. I congratulate him on a well-earned retirement, although I know that Mr. Duffie will never stop working to make the city of Tukwila a better place. RECOGNIZING DR. GEORGE INGLETT ON HIS RESEARCH HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 27, 2018 Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. George Inglett who is turning 90 years old. Dr. Inglett is a pillar in the Peoria community, and has advocated for a safer and healthier food supply at the National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research. Dr. George Inglett is best known for the de-velopment of a family of food ingredients based on cereal glucans, known collectively as the Trim Technologies. His research on these ingredients has led to them being used as fat substitutes, fiber additives, texturizers, and emulsion stabilizers in many foods. In 2005, Dr. Inglett was chosen as one of the Laureates of the Lincoln Academy of Illinois, the highest honor the State of Illinois can be-stow on a person who was born or has re-sided in Illinois for outstanding achievement. Over the course of his career Dr. Inglett has been presented numerous awards for his years of work in agricultural research. It is because of dedicated and selfless lead-ers such as Dr. George Inglett that I am espe-cially proud to serve Illinois 17th Congres-sional District. Mr. Speaker, I would like to again formally congratulate Dr. George Inglett on his 90th birthday and thank him for all of his contributions and service to our commu-nity.

CONGRATULATING DIANE NARASAKI ON HER RETIREMENT 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 27, 2018 Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Diane Narasaki, Ex-ecutive Director of Asian Counseling and Re-ferral Service (ACRS), on her retirement. Ms. Narasaki has served as the Executive Director of the ACRS for twenty-two years. Diane Narasaki’s commitment to help others began at a young age. As a teenager, she learned that her parents, Richard and Dorothy, were interned during World War II along with 120,000 other Americans of Japanese ances-try. Her parents’, as well as others stories in-spired Ms. Narasaki to stand up for victims of oppression and inequality—a mission that has defined her remarkable career. After getting her Master’s Degree from Se-attle University’s Master of Nonprofit Leader-ship program, she immediately set about mak-ing her mission happen. She spent two dec-ades as a leader in her community, holding di-rector-level positions at the Northwest Labor and Employment Law Office, the American Friends Service Committee, and the Wing Luke Asian Museum. In 1987, she helped overturn the conviction of Gordon Hirabayashi, a fellow Japanese American who was jailed for challenging the internment. In 1995, Ms. Narasaki joined the Asian Counseling and Referral Service, which pro-vides a wide variety of services to King Coun-ty’s Asian and Pacific Islander communities.

During her tenure as Executive Director, ACRS expanded its behavioral health and civic engagement programs. In addition, ACRS moved its headquarters to a larger fa-cility in Rainier Valley, which allowed them to better serve the fastest growing racial group in King County. Today, ACRS has a staff of 250 people, a budget of $13 million, and serves more than 26,000 people annually in over 40 languages and dialects. Outside of running one of the oldest and largest pan-Asian Pacific American organiza-tions in the United States, Ms. Narasaki’s con-tributions to her community are numerous. She co-founded Washington State’s Asian Pa-cific Islander Coalition, a network of local and community groups serving immigrants and ref-ugees. She has chaired the Washington State Asian Pacific Directors Coalition and the Mi-nority Executive Directors Coalition, and co- chaired the Asian Pacific Women’s Caucus and the Seattle Community Police Commis-sion. The U.S. Secretary of Health & Human Services appointed her to serve on SAMHSA’s Center for Mental Health Services National Advisory Council. In 2005, the Ford Founda-tion named her as one of seventeen people in the country to receive the Leadership for Changing America award. She also helped or-ganize the Asian Pacific American Legislative day, an event in which dozens of community groups join forces at the State Capitol in Olympia to voice their concerns to lawmakers. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I congratulate Diane Narasaki on her well-de-served retirement. Her story is an inspiration to all those who strive to serve their commu-nities.

HONORING THE CENTENNIAL AN-NIVERSARY OF CONGREGATION B’NAI ISRAEL 
HON. JOHN J. FASO 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 27, 2018 Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-ognize and celebrate the centennial anniver-sary of the founding of Congregation B’nai Israel in Fleischmanns, New York. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Jewish immigrants began to move into the Catskills region, first to farm and later to enter the rapidly developing resort sector. Strong in their faith, a small group of Jewish farmers, merchants, and resort owners would meet reg-ularly for Torah study. It was these intimate gatherings that laid the strong foundations for Congregation B’nai Israel to grow. Congregation B’nai Israel was formally in-corporated in 1918, and ground was broken on their synagogue only a few short years later. The synagogue is one of the oldest in the Catskills, and is listed on both the National and New York Register of Historic Places. Simple yet beautiful, with exposed trusses, a gabled roof, and unique Gothic and classical details, the synagogue’s modest design serves as a reminder of the congregation’s humble but inspiring beginnings. The congregation has long served the spir-itual needs of residents and continues to con-tribute to the area’s vibrant societal and cul-tural fabric. This centennial anniversary marks a great milestone in the congregation’s history and serves as an important time for reflection of the past and hope for the future. On behalf of the 19th Congressional District and the U.S. House of Representatives, I would like to ex-tend my sincerest congratulations to Con-gregation B’nai Israel. f

Benjamin has an exceptional record of community service.

The work ethic Benjamin has shown in his Eagle Project and every other project leading to his Eagle Scout rank speaks volumes of his commitment to serving a cause greater than himself and assisting his community. Mr. Speaker, the example set by this young man and his supportive family demonstrates the rewards of hard work, dedication, and per-severance. I am honored to represent Ben-jamin and his family in the United States Con-gress. I know that all of my colleagues in the House of Representatives join me in congratu-lating him on obtaining the Eagle Scout rank-ing, and I wish him continued success in his future education and career. f

I want to close by saying Happy 90th Birth-day, George.

HONORING MAJOR ALEXANDER W. HILL FOR HIS SERVICE IN THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 27, 2018 Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor and commend Major Alexander ‘‘Alex’’ W. Hill from Federal Way, Washington, on his service in the United States Air Force. Major Hill distinguished himself from an early age. He attended local public schools and in 2002, graduated from Fife High School as a Washington State Honor Graduate. Major Hill then attended Washington State University (WSU), where he met his future wife, Sara, who is now the mother to their two young daughters, Mackenna and Arlee. He made the selfless decision to go above and beyond by joining the ROTC program at WSU. After graduating in 2006, Major Hill was commis-sioned in the Air Force. Major Hill’s career in the Air Force has been one marked with distinction. He has logged over 2,800 flight hours and more than 1,600 combat hours. He has mastered operating a wide variety of aircrafts including AC–130U, AC–130W, MC–130W, MC–12W, C–130E/H/J, TC–12, and T–6A. Among his many accom-plishments, Major Hill was awarded the Army Commendation Medal, the Air Force Com-mendation Medal with two oak leaf clusters, the Distinguished Flying Cross, and the Aerial Achievement Award. Major Hill has proven himself to be a strong and capable leader. On November second, 2016, joint U.S. and Afghan forces were am-bushed by Taliban fighters near Kunduz, Af-ghanistan. Having suffered sixteen casualties in the first few moments of the ambush, and surrounded on all sides with enemies rapidly approaching, friendly forces turned to their air support—an AC–130U gunship commanded by Major Hill. Over the next two hours of non- stop combat, the gunship’s crew conducted nineteen attacks, firing lethal ordnance within meters of their severely wounded comrades. Major Hill and his crewmember’s efforts pre-vented enemy soldiers from approaching, and allowed the joint U.S. and Afghan forces to successfully withdraw and evacuate their wounded. Throughout the engagement, Major Hill and his crew displayed perseverance and quick thinking in a seemingly impossible situation. They were able to remain calm throughout multiple weapon malfunctions and setbacks. In the end, Major Hill and his crew saved fifty lives that day. Their bravery and clear- headedness earned them the 2016 MacKay Trophy for most meritorious flight of the year. Noted as humble by his peers, Major Hill is a committed leader who serves our country with distinction. He has not only answered the call to duty, but has answered it with excep-tional skill and discipline. Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I rec-ognize Major Alexander Hill, and thank him for his exemplary leadership and courage in serv-ice to his country. f

RECOGNIZING TERESITA BATAYOLA AS A 2017 WOMAN OF INFLUENCE HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, July 27, 2018 Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Teresita Batayola, CEO of Inter-national Community Health Services (ICHS). International Community Health Services provides medical and dental care, as well as behavioral health and health education serv-ices to many, including the Seattle area’s Asian and Pacific Islander communities. Under the leadership of Teresita Batayola, it has grown into an award-winning healthcare orga-nization, and the largest nonprofit organization that serves Asian and Pacific Islander popu-lations in Washington State. Born in the Philippines and raised in Seattle, Ms. Batayola knew from an early age that she wanted to be a leader in public service. She received a B.A. in Public Affairs from Seattle University, and a Masters in Urban Administra-tion from Bucknell University. She proved to be an exemplary leader on economic and community development issues, and she worked as Strategic Development Advisor on a World Bank Project in Surabaya, Indonesia, and then headed Comprehensive Planning for the City of Seattle. Washington Governor Jay Inslee also appointed her to the Healthier Washington Health Innovation Leadership Net-work and the Seattle College Board of Trust-ees. In 2005, she became the CEO of ICHS. Under Ms. Batayola’s stewardship, ICHS ex-perienced unprecedented growth, opening several new clinics around the Seattle area— the culmination of an eight year-long planning effort. The organization currently serves over 25,000 patients at eight locations, providing care in over fifty languages. Ms. Batayola’s outstanding leadership has helped to earn ICHS many awards. The Puget Sound Business Journal recognized Teresita Batayola as one of 2017’s Women of Influ-ence. In 2014 and 2015, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services named ICHS a National Quality Leader. The organization also received the Warren Featherstone Reid Award for Excellence in Healthcare from the state of Washington in 2015. Ms. Batayola herself has been recognized for an astounding number of awards. Some of these include being selected as Seattle Business Magazine’s outstanding leader in healthcare, the Filipino Community of Seattle’s recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award for Community Leadership, the Univer-sity of Washington Women Center’s WOMAN of COURAGE, the National Association of Community Health Center’s Betsey K. Cooke Grassroots MVP Award winner, as well as a White House Champion for Change. Her commitment to affordable healthcare has ensured that ICHS has been able to pro-vide diverse communities access to vital serv-ices. Ms. Batayola has helped make available culturally appropriate services to many who would otherwise be marginalized in the health sector. By doing so, she has helped to fight for equality and make our community an inclu-sive environment where everyone can thrive. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to congratulate Teresita Batayola on being named a 2017 Woman of Influence. I commend her on her
