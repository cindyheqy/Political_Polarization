TRUMP ADMINISTRATION’S DISASTER RESPONSE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. G
UTIE´RREZ ) for 5 minutes. Mr. GUTIE´RREZ. Madam Speaker, before I respond to President Trump’s claim that the rescue and recovery ef-fort in Puerto Rico a year ago after Hurricane Maria was ‘‘one of the best jobs that’s ever been done,’’ I want to make a few things clear. First of all, everyone is praying for our friends and neighbors along the eastern seaboard who will be facing the wind and rain of Hurricane Florence today. I support them and the first re-sponders who are helping and the peo-ple running shelters and delivering medicine to the sick and the injured; and I fully support FEMA, Homeland Security, and State and local govern-ments for what they are doing, espe-cially the brave men and women on the front line in harm’s way today. Secondly, in the last few weeks, the official death toll of Hurricane Maria was raised to 3,000 based on a meticu-lous study by George Washington’s Milken Institute of Public Health, and the number is based on facts and the truth. More people died in Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico than died in Hur-ricane Katrina and that died in the at-tacks on September 11. That is not fake news, Mr. President. The temptation is to fault FEMA and the job they did in Puerto Rico. I want to make clear, individuals at FEMA and FEMA as an agency did heroic work in Puerto Rico, and FEMA con-tinues to do that work. I flew with FEMA pilots 10 days after the storm hit, and I saw their work up close. It is clear that they saved lives. But let me also be very, very clear. With 3,000 people dead, for the Presi-dent to say that Puerto Rico was a suc-cess, a triumph of his Presidency, is simply delusional. Only in the President’s mind could he give himself an A-plus. Only in the President’s mind could we go a year without an apology to the American people for his incompetence in man-aging a crisis where 3,000 people died, Mr. President. And now he denies that they are even dead. It takes a man of humility, honor, and compassion to admit when he has made a tremendous and deadly mistake in caring for the American people; and we know we do not have a man in the White House who is capable of such emotions of empathy, of basic human decency. This Congress has failed to provide any meaningful oversight for fear they might embarrass the President with the facts. Thursday will mark 1 year since the storm hit, and think back a year ago. The popular and charismatic mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yulin Cruz, called for help on national TV, saying people are dying. The President had a melt-down because he doesn’t like being criticized by women, so the mayor’s words were more than the President could take. Most of us knew at the time, and all of us know now a year after the storm, the mayor was right and the President was wrong. People died. He was dead wrong. Disasters require preparedness and rapid response, but FEMA was not fully prepared, and they were not fully supported in the rapid response by the Trump administration, which was then and is now a disorganized mess. And we don’t need Bob Woodward to tell us that. Yes, the massive power of the storm was compounded by decades of neglect from Washington, which contributed to the debt crisis and infrastructure col-lapse. And to be clear, Puerto Rico’s problems didn’t happen overnight and didn’t happen on President Trump’s watch. But let us also be clear, it is his watch now. As President of the United States, he is responsible for Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory that belongs to, is a posses-sion, property of the United States of America. Yes, islands are surrounded by water, Mr. President—in the case of Puerto Rico, deep water—but FEMA and Homeland Security never called the most powerful military in the world, the U.S. military, which has capabili-ties and capacities well beyond those of FEMA. From the beginning, the President’s focus was on damage control from a po-litical standpoint, not damage control

from a human life standpoint. The sad truth is that, in trying so hard to make sure that the hurricane didn’t become ‘‘Trump’s Katrina,’’ we lost far more lives. This was a disaster mismanage-ment, and that lies at the feet of the President and his administration. What is offensive to many of us is that, even though the President dropped the ball, he is now doing a vic-tory dance in the end zone—or should we call it the dead zone. I pray that his response to the cur-rent disaster unfolding along the East Coast will be better and more empa-thetic. He has a golf club in North Carolina and a winery in Virginia, so maybe the American people in those States will get more of the President’s help than my fellow Puerto Ricans did. And I pray the response is more suc-cessful. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-bers are reminded to refrain from en-gaging in personalities toward the President.

RECOGNIZING MIAMI BRIDGE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. R
OS-LEHTINEN ) for 5 min-utes. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speak-er, I rise today to recognize the Miami Bridge organization located in my con-gressional district. I would also like to highlight my friend and constituent, Judy Reinach, also known as the barefoot hostess, for her tireless efforts on behalf of this or-ganization for decades. Founded by Catholic Charities in the 1970s, Miami Bridge has been helping young people in crisis who have run away, are truant, homeless, or are hav-ing issues and problems in their homes. From its humble beginnings in a city of Miami motorcycle repair shop un-derneath the Metrorail Bridge, this in-credible organization has been a guid-ing light for our youth throughout Miami-Dade County who are in need of assistance and do not know where else to turn. In fact, its name, Miami Bridge, is homage to its humble loca-tion. Today, it has two campuses—one in Miami and the other one in Home-stead—that serve our south Florida community. Using its efficient intake process, Miami Bridge successfully matches young people or family members with the services that best meet their needs. Victims of abuse, of neglect, or worse seek refuge in the comprehensive serv-ices provided by Miami Bridge in order to help turn their lives around. This organization’s professional staff and its board of directors provide coun-seling, case management, a formal aca-demic education program, mental health services, substance abuse pre-vention services, youth development activities, life skills education, recre-ation, and so much more. Miami Bridge also offers First Stop for Families, a crisis intervention serv-ice that helps head off conflicts and links families to resources to help them open lines of communication, teach effective parenting skills, reduce antisocial behaviors, and link families with any other available resources. As a former Florida certified teacher, I applaud its truancy diversion services because I know that education, staying in school, is the key to a successful life and future. Madam Speaker, the statistics dem-onstrating the success of this organiza-tion speak for themselves. Between 2015 and 2016, 890 families were served by Miami Bridge: 93 percent of youth served were placed back in their home or an appropriate placement after leav-ing the shelter; 85 percent of youth re-mained in school after completing their shelter stays. However, the development of this in-credible organization has not occurred in a vacuum. The Key Biscayne Is-lander News has given Miami Bridge events substantial coverage, and the Rotary Club of Key Biscayne has helped raise funds for programs that help the neediest young men and women in our community. Many south Florida individuals and businesses have aided and supported the mission of Miami Bridge over the past decades. I congratulate its leadership: CEO Dorcas Wilcox, CFO Steve Hope, Chief Operations and Technology Officer David Sharfman, Chief Administrative and Compliance Officer Baldwin Davis, and Chief Program Officer Mary Behr, in addition to its board members—Mar-lene Quintana, Alfred Karram, Jr., Jo-seph Cantrell, Beatriz Martin, Judy Reinach, Darren Campbell, Todd Giardina, Jahan S. Islami, Johane Domersant, Julie Harris Nelson, Mayling Exposito, Michael Alvarez, Patrick Murphy, Peggy Fucci, and Province ‘‘Boo’’ Zamek—on their tre-mendous work. So Miami Bridge, here is to many more years of success and services on behalf of south Florida’s troubled youth. Thank you for all the work that you do.

55TH ANNIVERSARY OF 16TH STREET BAPTIST CHURCH BOMB-ING The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. S
EWELL ) for 5 minutes. Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember the 55th observance of the bombing of 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, and to commemorate the lives and legacy of four precious little girls—Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Carole Robertson, and Cynthia Morris Wesley—who were murdered during that devastating attack 55 years ago. On September 15, 1963, at 10:22 a.m., the four little girls were getting dressed in the bathroom downstairs in the church, preparing to sing in the church choir. The morning of the bombing, some 200 church members were in the building getting ready for the 11 o’clock service. When the bomb detonated on the church’s east side, it caused the inte-rior walls of the church to cave in and sent mortar and bricks flying from across the front of the church. Most of the parishioners were able to evacuate the building as it filled with smoke, but the bodies of four little girls were found beneath the rubble in the base-ment restroom. The bombing was a racially moti-vated act of terrorism, Madam Speak-er, orchestrated by four suspected members of the Ku Klux Klan. As part of the attack, the men planted 19 sticks of dynamite outside the base-ment of the church. Along with the murder of the four little girls, a dozen other people were injured, including Sarah Collins Ru-dolph, the younger sister of Addie Mae Collins. Sarah had been in the base-ment with her sister and the other girls getting ready for church—yes, getting ready for church service. The attack would later be described by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., as one of the most vicious and tragic crimes ever perpetrated against humanity. As the day continued, thousands of African Americans protested, gath-ering in scenes across the State. Gov-ernor Wallace, at the time, soon called in the police to break up the protests. Dozens of people were arrested, and two young Black boys were also killed that day: Johnnie Robinson, 16, and Virgil Ware, 13. Robinson was shot by a police officer, and Ware was killed by two White youths within hours of the bomb detonating. Following the attack, several people were suspected, but no one was imme-diately brought to justice. It wasn’t until 14 years later, in 1977, when then- Alabama Attorney General Bob Baxley reopened the case and the investigation began to make headway. Eventually, Klan leader Robert Chambliss was fi-nally brought to trial and convicted of the murders. It would take another 20 years before the other Klansmen accomplices were brought to justice. It was then-U.S. At-torney DOUG JONES who brought jus-tice, leading to the convictions of Thomas Blanton and Bobby Cherry. The events that took place in Bir-mingham, Alabama, on September 15, 1963, became a major catalyst for the civil rights movement. The loss of four young girls was not in vain for, you see, we got the passage of very impor-tant historic civil rights legislation be-cause of their sacrifice: the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Today, as we continue to seek justice and equality for all people, Madam Speaker, we must appreciate just how far we have come. Every gain in the battle for civil rights has come at a high cost, paid for by those who be-lieved in a vision and a dream bigger

than themselves. In order to see re-sults, we must continue to fight, fur-ther their legacy and their work each and every day. On a personal note, it is never lost on me that I get to walk the Halls of Con-gress today because four little Black girls lost their lives, so they can’t. b1015 It is humbling and inspiring to know that my very presence in this institu-tion was because of the personal sac-rifice of others. I was honored that my first bill to pass Congress was to pay tribute to Addie Mae Collins, to Carole, to Cynthia, and to Denise post-humously, when the Congress of the United States gave a Congressional Gold Medal in 2013 on the 50th anniver-sary of their deaths. I want to thank Pastor Price and the amazing congregation of 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, who tirelessly keep the flame and memory of this tragic incident alive and pre-serves this historic church for future generations. Madam Speaker, on behalf of the Seventh Congressional District and the State of Alabama, I ask my colleagues to join me in remembering the 55th ob-servance of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing and in honoring the life and legacy of four little girls, Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Car-ole Robertson, and Cynthia Morris Wesley. The events 55 years ago shaped the future of our Nation and continues to have a lasting impact on our quest for equal justice and our pursuit for a more perfect union.

RECOGNIZING ABE AND TRISH HARPSTER AS 2018 ANGELS IN ADOPTION HONOREES The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. T
HOMPSON ) for 5 minutes. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-nize Abe and Trish Harpster of Spruce Creek, Pennsylvania. Abe and Trish were recently chosen as the Congressional Coalition on Adoption’s 2018 Angels in Adoption Honorees for their extraordinary con-tributions to adoption. I proudly nominated the Harpsters for this honor because they truly are generous and selfless individuals. The Harpsters have successfully adopted three of their children: Logan, Riley, and Teagan. Trish works in sales and Abe runs his family’s dairy farm in Huntingdon County. Both feel extraor-dinarily blessed and lucky to be par-ents of these three great kids. Having attempted several adoptions, Abe and Trish like to share their adop-tion stories and act as a resource for parents beginning the process. They are passionate about improving Fed-eral laws and regulations to ensure more children are connected with a permanent, loving family. Every year the Harpsters host a fly- fishing tournament on their family farm. The money raised from this event goes directly to the Centre Coun-ty Youth Services Bureau. This nonprofit organization has been strengthening children and families since 1968. They work to provide every child with the opportunity to reach their full potential. Last year’s fishing event raised more than $60,000 for the Youth Services Bu-reau, and in the coming years, the Harpsters hope to raise even more for this great organization. Later this month, Angels in Adoption honorees from across the country will arrive in Washington, D.C., to be cele-brated for their great contributions. I look forward to meeting Abe and Trish to congratulate them on this outstanding honor and discuss child welfare issues as well as their own per-sonal experiences with the adoption process. For the past 20 years, Angels in Adoption has celebrated individuals, couples, and organizations from across the country that have made an ex-traordinary contribution on behalf of children in need: everyday heroes, or in this case angels, like the Harpsters, who never seek recognition but whole-heartedly deserve it. I look forward to congratulating Abe and Trish in person. Madam Speaker, I would also like to note that this past Sunday was Na-tional Grandparents Day. In honor of this special day, we must not forget the outstanding work being done by the foster grandparents across the country. The Foster Grandparent Program is a part of the Senior Corps of the Co-operation for National and Community Service. This program provides a way for vol-unteers age 55 and over to serve as role models, mentors, and friends to chil-dren with exceptional needs. In the Commonwealth of Pennsyl-vania, there are more than 10,000 Sen-ior Corps volunteers. These volunteers have touched the lives of so many chil-dren by tutoring more than 4,000 young people in Pennsylvania alone. And, Madam Speaker, these foster grand-parents provide the kind of guidance and love that set children on the path towards a successful future. I look forward to celebrating Abe and Trish Harpster, and want to recognize all those who play an important role in the lives of young people. There is no greater gift to give than time, love, and support to a child in need. 
RECOGNIZING NOTHING BUT NETS FOR WORK  
AGAINST MALARIA  
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, recently I met with a constituent who works with the grass-roots organization Nothing But Nets, which raises awareness in the fight against malaria. As you may know, malaria is trans-mitted to people through mosquitoes carrying the disease. In 2016, there were 216 million new cases of malaria worldwide and 445,000 deaths, 70 per-cent of which were children under five. Malaria takes the life of a child every 2 minutes. Most malaria cases and deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa, but Southeast Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East are also at risk. Malaria is a treatable, preventable disease, but half the world’s population lives in danger of contracting the para-site from a simple mosquito bite. U.S. leadership is critical to the elimination of malaria around the world and we have helped to create and expand lifesaving interventions like long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets, indoor residual spray, and rapid diagnostic tests. Our continued leadership is critical in finally eliminating malaria around the world. I look forward to the day when we can eradicate malaria once and for all. f 
INVESTMENTS IN OUR NATION’S WATER SYSTEMS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York (Mr. T
ONKO ) for 5 minutes. Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support much needed investments in our Na-tion’s water systems. Earlier this year, EPA estimated some $472 billion is needed to maintain the Nation’s drinking water infrastruc-ture over the next 20 years. We have woefully underinvested in drinking water for far too long, and now crumbling pipes and failing sys-tems pose a serious threat to public health and public safety. Later today, the House is expected to vote on S. 3021, America’s Water Infra-structure Act, the latest iteration of WRDA. It is a good bill, the result of bipar-tisan and bicameral negotiations. I am incredibly proud of the work done by both majority and minority members of the Energy and Commerce Committee on H.R. 3387, the Drinking Water System Improvement Act, which was reported out of committee unani-mously in July of 2017. Nearly all of that bill has been incorporated into S. 3021. I would like to highlight a number of the provisions that I am pleased were included in the final package. Since 2014, I have introduced legisla-tion to reauthorize the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, the primary source of Federal funding for our water systems. Since its creation, the pro-gram has never been reauthorized, and funding has been flat, despite the grow-ing needs in our communities. S. 3021 would increase the authoriza-tion from $1 billion annually until it reaches a $1.95 billion level in fiscal year 2021. In addition to providing significantly increased funding through the SRF, I want to mention a number of other provisions.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH8176 September 13, 2018 
First, WRDA makes numerous impor-tant changes to the SRF program, in-cluding extending the length of loans from 20 to 30 years, and up to 40 years for disadvantaged communities, while increasing the set-aside for these com-munities by raising the maximum and, importantly, instituting a minimum amount of assistance. It provides $125 million annually to support State water offices through the Public Water Systems Supervision grant program. It seeks to improve the availability of compliance data submitted by water systems and States. It promotes better asset management practices, improves consumer con-fidence reports, and reauthorizes the Source Water Petition Program. It includes funding for EPA to review methods and technologies to prevent and detect leakage, contamination, and other problems. It requires Buy America standards for SRF projects through fiscal year 2023 and prevailing wage standards to ensure that American workers are ben-efiting from these investments. It provides funding for systems to conduct risk assessments of their resil-ience to extreme weather. It establishes a grant program to help schools and daycare centers re-place water fountains containing lead components. Also related to lead, it requires fu-ture EPA needs assessments to include the cost of replacing lead service lines. I know a number of communities are dealing with emerging contaminants, such as PFOA and PFOS. Currently, only systems serving more than 10,000 people are required to test for unregu-lated contaminants. This bill requires water systems serving over 3,300 people to monitor for these contaminants, em-powering local residents to take action to mitigate serious health threats that they may not have known existed oth-erwise. This would mean that thousands of communities, communities like Hoosick Falls, New York, and similarly sized systems would no longer have emerging contaminants go undetected, potentially threatening their residents for years. Finally, while not included in the committee-passed bill, WRDA author-izes $100 million for areas hit by nat-ural disasters to repair their water sys-tems, enabling post-Maria Puerto Rico to access funds without the financial burden of State matching require-ments. This is not an exhaustive list of pro-visions in this title, but it gives a sense of the breadth of policies that were in-cluded to improve the Safe Drinking Water Act. This bill is not a clean water silver bullet, but it will put us on the path to end the decades of neglect of our water infrastructure and make the invest-ments needed to maintain and upgrade our systems in order to protect public health. I want to thank my colleagues, Rep-resentative H
ARPER , Chair S HIMKUS , Chair W
ALDEN , and their staffs for working with our side of the aisle on this legislation. I want to acknowledge the contributions of our ranking mem-ber Representative F
RANK PALLONE , Jackie Cohen, Jean Fruci, and Rick Kessler, and other members of the En-ergy and Commerce minority staff for their hard work. I always say that every life and every job in this country depends on access to safe drinking water. The needs are great and the cost of inaction is high. Today, Congress has the opportunity to act. I urge my colleagues to support America’s Water Infrastructure Act and for the Senate to take it up imme-diately.

HONORING LOGAN S. PALMER The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. R
ODNEY DAVIS) for 5 min-utes. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise today to re-member Petty Officer Logan Palmer of Harristown, Illinois, who was trag-ically lost in the accident last August aboard USS John S. McCain. Logan knew early that he wanted to serve his country. After he graduated from Sangamon Valley High School and Richland Community College, he enlisted in the Navy as an interior communications electrician. Petty Officer Logan Palmer died serving and protecting our country, and for that, we remain eternally grateful. Today, the House will vote on a bill to designate Harristown’s post office in Logan’s hometown of Harristown, Illi-nois, a small rural community in Macon County, Illinois, as the Logan S. Palmer Post Office. Although I never had the honor of meeting Logan, I have since come to know his parents, Theresa and Sid, and I was honored they were able to join me when I introduced this bill earlier this year. While they sat in the gallery, I was able to drop that piece of paper in the box to introduce this bill to the floor of the House, and I am honored today to ask my colleagues to join me in passing this important legislation to honor one of America’s heroes. Designating this post office will not only honor Logan’s service, but serve as a grave reminder of the risks that our servicemembers take on each day and the responsibilities we have to them as a country. It is my privilege to be able to honor Logan today, but, again, it is not why we are here. Many times this chamber will be criticized for naming post of-fices, naming public buildings, but, again, let us remember the sacrifices that many of those who those buildings are named after made for the freedoms and the liberties that many of us in this country take for granted every day. When Logan joined the Navy, no one in his hometown, let alone his family, thought that he would sacrifice so much for the freedom and liberty of our great country. It is my honor to honor Logan S. Palmer with this bill today, and his name will live forever on his local post office. f 
b1030 DEMOCRATIC VISION The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York (Mr. J
EFFRIES ) for 5 minutes. Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, once again, the do-nothing Republican Congress has outdone itself. Here in America, we have a wage stagnation problem, an underemploy-ment problem, an infrastructure prob-lem, a retirement insecurity problem, and a corruption problem right here in Washington, D.C. What is the House Republicans’ re-sponse to these challenges facing the American people? They want to get out of town before sundown. Why don’t we remain here in Wash-ington, doing the people’s business week after week, month after month until we get something done on these issues, improve the lives of working families, middle-class folks, senior citi-zens, the poor, the sick, and the af-flicted? They want to get out of town before sundown. There are two very different visions for the American people. Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the Presidency. What has that brought to the American people? Chaos, crisis, confusion, the culture of corruption. Part two, the sequel, and the signa-ture piece of legislation is the Repub-lican tax scam, where 83 percent of the benefits went to the wealthiest 1 per-cent in this country simply to sub-sidize the lifestyles of the rich and shameless. That is their signature ac-complishment? The Democratic vision is very dif-ferent. Democrats here in the House are fighting for the people. We are fighting to lower healthcare costs, fighting to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, fighting to protect people with preexisting conditions, fighting to dramatically lower the high cost of prescription drugs, fighting to increase pay for everyday Americans so that folks can provide a comfortable living for themselves and for their families, fighting for a real infrastructure plan that invests $1 trillion in fixing our Na-tion’s crumbling bridges, roads, and tunnels and will create 16 million good- paying jobs. Democrats here in the House of Rep-resentatives are fighting to clean up corruption in Washington to make gov-ernment work for everyday Americans. We are fighting to end, once and for all, the era of Citizens United. That is the House Democratic vision: lower healthcare costs, increased pay,

A TEXAS RELIGION The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. P
OE) for 5 minutes. Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Speaker, it is that time of the year, a time folks in Texas and in the South have been wait-ing for. It is called football season. It has been said there are only two seasons in Texas: football season and spring football season. Football in Texas is its own religion. Whether you are watching the game under the Friday night lights, joining 25,000 of your closest friends on Satur-day, or checking your watch in church to make sure your preacher gets you out on time on Sunday, there are more than a few prayers being said in the name of football on any given day in Texas. Just last week, I headed to Waco, Texas, with my entire family to watch my alma mater, the Abilene Christian Wildcats, take on the Baylor Bears. The outcome wasn’t what we were hop-ing for, but there is nothing better than college football under a Texas sunset. Texans naturally believe everything is bigger and better in Texas—because it is. My son, Kurt, started playing football when he was 8 years old, and I have watched him play every game from Humble, Texas, pee-wee football until he took the field wearing the pur-ple and white of our alma mater, Abi-lene Christian University. From the beginning, Kurt played quarterback. Being the quarterback is one of those positions that is tough on parents. It is all the fame or all the blame. Every time I saw him take the field, I saw that same little 8-year-old boy full of determination. It was that very determination that led to him being a walk-on at Abilene Christian University and earning a spot as a safe-ty and becoming an Academic All-Con-ference player. I was a judge during that time in Texas in Houston, and I would head out on Friday night after court and drive all night to towns such as Abilene; Kingsville; Canyon; Wichita Falls; Commerce; Las Cruces, New Mexico; and Ada, Oklahoma, to get there in time for Saturday’s game. There is nothing more fun than being in a stadium on that first weekend and seeing your team and your son take the field to thousands chanting, ‘‘Wild-cats, purple, white, purple, white, fight, fight, fight.’’ Last week I saw Kurt’s son, my grandson, Jackson, take the field, also as safety, for the Georgetown, Texas, middle school team. Texas football is a legend and legacy. It has spawned books, movies, TV se-ries, and it has been known to ruin a family dinner or two in a house divided over the loyalty of their team. Blood may be thicker than water, but it is not thicker than football. Yes, Texans love football, right down to the names they choose for their chil-dren and to the cars they drive. I am sure there is some big executive in De-troit wondering why they have to send so many maroon pickups to Texas. Well, of course, they are for the Texas Aggie fans. We may not have too many fall wed-dings in Texas, but I am willing to bet you that you have been to a wedding where the new Mr. and Mrs. took off down the aisle to the University of Texas’ ‘‘The Eyes of Texas’’ or got a big Texas A&M ‘‘Whoop’’ after the preacher declared them husband and wife. But it is not just the action on the gridiron. It is the atmosphere; it is the band; it is the drill team; it is the cheerleaders; it is the moms selling T- shirts, the school clubs hanging ban-ners, the same old guys in the same old seats season after season in the stands, and the whole atmosphere of what makes the game great. So, Madam Speaker, it is that time of the year.

PUERTO RICO IS A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York (Mr. E
SPAILLAT ) for 5 min-utes. Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, September 20 this next week is the 1- year anniversary of Hurricane Maria. One year later in Puerto Rico, in the neighboring island of Puerto Rico where there are U.S. citizens living be-cause Puerto Rico is a commonwealth of the United States, the schools are still closed. One year later and people are still waiting for home repairs. One year later and the death toll con-tinues to rise. One year later and we are just now finding out that the death toll result-ing from Hurricane Maria and its after-math resulted in 2,975 deaths, a drastic, dramatic increase from the original re-ported numbers by the government of merely 64 people. Madam Speaker, the numbers have ballooned from 64 people who died dur-ing that terrible storm and the after-math, to 2,975. We are just now finding out that close to 3,000 U.S. lives were lost while this administration did very little. Just this week, the President said that he has done an A-plus job. He seems to feel that there are only 64 deaths there, but that is not the case. In fact, there were 3,000 lives that per-ished there with slow response, and that is failure. That is an F-minus, to me, for government. But that is not all. Such is the indif-ference of this administration to the lives of Puerto Rico. And, Madam Speaker, we have a moral obligation to help the Puerto Rican people. They are American citizens. When we are in a time of war, when our Nation is in danger, we call upon them to defend us. Thousands and thousands of Puerto Ricans have given up their lives for democracy in the United States. We all remember the photograph of President George W. Bush on Air Force One hovering over New Orleans right after Katrina, and it was a watershed moment for our Nation that the photo became the poster child for neglect and the failed response of the government during a tragedy. Well, guess what. Puerto Rico has be-come our modern-day Katrina. Un-doubtedly, this administration’s mis-management of Puerto Rico has be-come its most significant failure to date. FEMA provided roughly a third of the meals, half as much water, and just a small fraction of tarps to Puerto Rico than it provided to Texas after Hurri-cane Harvey in the first 9 days after the storm. Several weeks elapsed be-fore FEMA and the Defense Depart-ment increased their presence on the island. And even though airports and ports had reopened after a few days, they still failed to bring the necessary help to that island. The agencies failed to direct the air-craft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and other ships to Puerto Rico and provide first aid to the people who were hurt-ing. We have now entered the 2018 hurri-cane season. As you know, we are brac-ing for Florence, Isaac, Helene, and Olivia to make landfall. This adminis-tration needs to do better in respond-ing to these emergencies. It is heartbreaking and a serious tragedy for the American citizens of Puerto Rico, their families, and our Nation as a whole to have been treated this way. We cannot turn our backs on Puerto Rico, and we must continue to support our brothers and sisters along this journey to rebuild their lives dur-ing this humanitarian crisis. Mr. Speaker, the Puerto Rico crisis has become a humanitarian crisis that has proven far greater than we ever imagined.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH8178 September 13, 2018 
the world’s strongest and greatest in the history of the world. Since 1789, the Constitution has served as our country’s legal founda-tion. Its wisdom is timeless, and just as George Washington called the Con-stitution the guide he would never abandon, we should not abandon the brilliance of our Founders’ intent. The Constitution establishes the United States of America as a nation of laws where the government derives its limited powers from ‘‘We the People,’’ the consenting governed. Those words, I believe, Mr. Speaker, are the most important words outside our Bible. Thanks to the foresight of the Con-stitution’s Framers and their under-standing of government overreach and human nature, we have an abiding doc-ument that checks the power of the Federal Government and protects the rights of individual citizens. What has happened with our govern-ment, though, is that it has expanded in such a manner that it flips the Con-stitution on its head. Let’s take a look at Articles I through III, which outline the powers of each branch of govern-ment. In this pocket copy of the Constitu-tion, Article I is eight pages; but it is, by far, the longest of the articles, de-tailing the powers of the Congress. Article II is only three pages, out-lining the powers of the executive branch. Article III is only a half page and es-tablishes the limited powers of the ju-dicial branch. Now, what has happened is that the relative power of each branch is com-pletely inverted. The power to write the law and thereby represent the will of the people has been diminished by both the executive and judicial branches. The judicial branch seeks to write the law through its power of interpre-tation in setting precedent. The judi-cial branch has become an instrument for activists to pass agendas that could not be accomplished by passing laws in Congress because they lacked the sup-port of the majority of people in the country. Rather than serving as the least pow-erful branch of government that acts as a check, the judicial branch has taken the power delegated to Congress and become a much more powerful branch than ever intended. The executive branch has promul-gated rules which have the force of law and have circumvented the lawmaking process of Article I, thwarting again the grand design of the Constitution. These trends must stop and the plan of the Constitution reasserted. The Constitution is genius in its brevity, in its endurance, and in its forethought to limit and separate the governing pow-ers established therein. It is an honor and a sacred duty for me to protect and uphold the Constitution in rep-resenting the people of the Fifth Dis-trict here in this Congress. RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. R
ODNEY DAVIS of Illinois). Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until noon today. Accordingly (at 10 o’clock and 46 minutes a.m.), the House stood in re-cess.

PRAYER Pastor Rosalinda Rivera, New Life Outreach Church, Richmond, Virginia, offered the following prayer: Dear God, we come before You this day with grateful hearts for this won-derful Nation we live in. For our Sen-ators, our Congressmen and -women, our President, for their families, bless them as they sacrificially lead us as a Nation. We lift up those today that are im-prisoned by a lifestyle of addiction, trapped in the trenches of hopelessness. Your Word says that if we are in a pit, You will lift us up and put our feet on a rock. So we cry out on behalf of our hus-bands, our wives, our sisters, our broth-ers, for the young people of America that are trapped by the pit of opioid addiction and sex trafficking. You are the God of hope and healing. So, in Your name, I declare the chains of addiction are broken. I declare free-dom in the hearts of every person fighting addiction. Through You, our God, we have the victory. Thank You for always being faithful. In the name of Jesus, Amen.

WELCOMING PASTOR ROSALINDA RIVERA The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. B
RAT) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mr. BRAT. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to welcome Pastor Rosalinda Rivera, and her friends, of Chesterfield County, Virginia, to the House Chamber today. As an associate pastor at the New Life Outreach Church, the church her parents, Carmen and Victor Torres founded in 1972, she has helped reach those who are in search of a better way of life. In addition to her role in the church, she is involved in many other organiza-tions to serve those in need. Whether it is helping young people overcome the challenges of addiction at New Life for Youth, helping young mothers restore relationships with their children at Mercy Mom’s House, or inspiring groups all over the U.S. with her writ-ing and ministry, her service has been one spent devoted to the service of oth-ers. She has turned the lives of countless people around, giving them faith, hope, and purpose. Her work is a testament to the Judeo-Christian tradition, which calls all people to love and care for others in the same way that God loves and cares for each of us. Thank you, Rosalinda, and God bless you.

HONORING TRIYOUNG ON AMER-ICAN BUSINESS WOMEN’S DAY (Mrs. LESKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize TriYoung, a woman- owned business in Peoria, Arizona, on American Business Women’s Day on September 22. In August, I visited businesses across Arizona’s Eighth District to discuss how reduced Federal regulations, pro- growth policies, and Republican-led tax reform have impacted business owners and employees. For Julie Young, president of TriYoung, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has produced a sizeable savings that she plans to reinvest back into her em-ployees.

TriYoung is a perfect example of how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is making a difference in the lives of business own-ers and hardworking Americans. I am honored to represent this woman- owned business in Congress, and I will continue to support legislation that al-lows small businesses like TriYoung to thrive. Thank you, Julie, for sharing your story.

BRETT KAVANAUGH DOES NOT BE-LONG ON THE HIGHEST COURT IN OUR LAND (Mr. KENNEDY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, Brett Kavanaugh does not belong on our highest court in the land. Mr. M
CCONNELL can withhold all the documents he wants. Mr. Kavanaugh’s words betray that silence. His emails show that he will dismantle Roe v. Wade. His rulings show that protec-tions for preexisting conditions are no longer safe. His words show that mar-riage equality and LGBTQ rights would no longer be etched in stone. His si-lence shows that a President will be handed a shield against accountability. To those harmed by his rulings, he offers not even a handshake. When pressed, he offers just a lawyerly dodge and a shield of confidentiality. But the American people marched for a woman’s right to choose. They took to our streets to end gun violence. They fought for marriage equality. If you believe that healthcare is a right for all and not a privilege just for a few, then we need you to raise your voices today. Mr. Kavanaugh should not be on our court. 
f 
TARLETON STATE RODEO TEAM (Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, today I want to take a moment to recognize the Tarleton State University Rodeo Team located in Stephenville, Texas. Now, if you have never been to a Texas rodeo, I can promise you, it isn’t like anything you have ever seen be-fore. There is nothing quite like it and, frankly, there is nothing more Texan. Day in and day out, the young men and women on the Tarleton State Rodeo Team are dedicated and give 100 percent, no matter what. In fact, this summer, because of their hard work, the men’s team finished second at the College National Finals Rodeo. However, this was not an isolated ac-complishment. The Tarleton Rodeo As-sociation has been part of a winning tradition since 1947. They have won seven national championship titles and 27 individual national championships. Mr. Speaker, because of all of this, the Tarleton State Rodeo Team is the best in Texas and one of the best in the Nation. I am proud to represent these cham-pions in the 25th Congressional Dis-trict, and I look forward to watching them continue to dominate the com-petition. In God we trust. f 
RECOGNIZING ARTS IN EDUCATION WEEK (Ms. PINGREE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Arts in Education Week. I believe strongly that arts in our schools, whether it is visual art, music, drama, creative writing, or dance, are as much of a component of a well-rounded education as STEM or hu-manity subjects. The measurable benefits of a robust arts education are clear. The U.S. De-partment of Education has found that students in arts programming had bet-ter attendance and fewer disciplinary issues. But anyone who has experienced arts education knows that its value goes well beyond what’s measurable. It builds confidence, teaching students how to express themselves in front of their peers and the larger community. It promotes diversity and inclusion, encouraging kids to engage with and learn from creative traditions that they may not be familiar with. And it can start important conversations, using fun and accessible mediums to get us thinking about hard topics. I thank the educators and students in Maine and across the country who commit to bringing the power of the arts into our schools and homes every day.

RECOGNIZING THE TIRELESS WORK AND DEDICATION OF HAR-RIET V. CARTER (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the decades of service of my congressional commu-nity liaison and my friend, Harriet V. Carter. Harriet, a graduate of Tulane Univer-sity, who participated in study abroad programs, served as a congressional aide for many years in my district of-fice and, during her semi-retirement, has been a goodwill ambassador to our community on my behalf. Harriet Carter is a graduate of Lead-ership Miami, the Cuban American Na-tional Council’s Hispanic Leadership Training Program, and has been active in the Greater Miami Jewish Federa-tion, the Jewish Community Relations Council, and a bevy of groups that help Floridians. Harriet’s tireless work in my office and throughout our community dem-onstrates the positive impact that one person can have. Harriet Carter’s dedi-cation to the service of others is an in-spiration, and I am sure that she will continue to work diligently on behalf of our South Florida community for many years to come. f 
WASHINGTON’S RAMPANT CULTURE OF CORRUPTION (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, the recent indictments of two GOP House Mem-bers showcases this rampant culture of corruption symbolic of a government of, by, and for special interests and wealthy donors. Now, this week, Republicans are try-ing to rush through their tax scam 2.0, which explodes the deficit to give more money to wealthy donors and the rich-est Americans. Because of the first tax scam, some of the biggest corporations are now on track to spend $1 trillion on dividends and stock buybacks. Meanwhile, working class constitu-ents struggle to keep a roof over their head, pay for healthcare, and put food on the table for their family. Democrats want real bipartisan tax reform that creates jobs, reduces the deficit, and is for the people, not just the ultra-rich. We want to clean up the corruption and make Washington work for the people again. This means strength-ening our ethics laws to fight special interests. This means fixing our broken campaign finance system to end the in-fluence of big-money donors, and this means empowering voters to demand a responsive, accountable government, one that protects the right to vote, se-cures our election infrastructure, and ends partisan redistricting.

HURRICANE FLORENCE PREPAREDNESS (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute and to re-vise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, as Hurricane Florence threat-ens to strike South Carolina, I am grateful to Governor Henry McMaster, Adjutant General Bob Livingston, At-torney General Alan Wilson, as well as Kim Stenson, Director of the Emer-gency Management Division, who have all done a fantastic job of preparing for the high winds and extraordinary flooding, while keeping the people of the State up to date with the encour-agement of President Donald Trump. I appreciate that the Governor has been in close coordination with Presi-dent Donald Trump and together they are working to ensure South Caro-linians have all the resources for the courageous first responders to respond to Hurricane Florence, which endan-gers families.

17TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 2001 AUMF (Ms. LEE asked and was given per-mission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow marks the 17th year since Congress passed the 2001 AUMF, which has be-come a blank check for endless war. I would like to read part of the speech I delivered on September 14, 2001, be-cause these words remain true and rel-evant today. I said: ‘‘Mr. Speaker, I rise really with a very heavy heart, one that is filled with sorrow for the families and the loved ones who were killed and in-jured this week. ‘‘September 11 changed the world. Our deepest fears now haunt us. Yet I am convinced that military action will not prevent further acts of inter-national terrorism against the United States. ‘‘This resolution will pass, although we all know that the President can wage a war, even without it. However difficult this vote may be, some of us must urge the use of restraint. Some of us must say, let us step back for a mo-ment. Let us just pause for a minute and think through the implications of our actions today, so that this does not spiral out of control. ‘‘I have agonized over this vote, but I came to grips with it today. I came to grips with opposing this resolution dur-ing the very painful, yet very beautiful memorial service. As a member of the clergy so eloquently said, as we act, let us not become the evil that we de-plore.’’ Now, 17 years later, I am asking my colleagues to join me in repealing this overly-broad resolution by cospon-soring H.R. 1229.

b1215 HONORING FORMER CONGRESSMAN JACK EDWARDS (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of former Congressman Jack Edwards, who will celebrate his 90th birthday next Thursday. Congressman Edwards’ service to his beloved country started long before his 20 honorable years as a Representative for Alabama’s First District. As just a teenager, Jack left home and pursued something larger than himself and enlisted in the Marine Corps, where he later earned the rank of sergeant. Years later, Jack brought his mili-tary background to the Halls of Con-gress with the first wave of Alabama Republicans. Jack worked alongside five U.S. Presidents during his time in office to ensure that our national defense was funded at the necessary levels, which ultimately brought an end to the Cold War and led to the dismantling of the Berlin Wall in 1989. But as a fiscal conservative, he never shied away from speaking his mind about ineffective programs that simply needed to go. Jack, you were a people’s champion in these Halls, a wonderful mentor for me, and I can only hope to be remem-bered as you are. But more impor-tantly, I am honored by your friend-ship and your continued support. I look forward to celebrating your 90th birth-day with you next week. f 
COLORADO FLOODS (Mr. POLIS asked and was given per-mission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, 5 years ago this week, Colorado was struck by dev-astating floods. From Fort Collins, to Estes Park, to Lyons, to Boulder, doz-ens of communities were hit with un-precedented amounts of rain that gave way to rivers and tributaries over-flowing, with huge amounts of damage, including the loss of eight lives. When the floods came 5 years ago, we committed to one another to be Colo-rado strong and to rebuild. I am proud to say that, in the years since the flood, I have been amazed by the resiliency of so many families. For my family, it meant a flooded base-ment and the loss of some of our treas-ured family photographs we stored there. For others, it upended their lives. Stu and Sarah Jane were new parents to their 9-month-old daughter when the flood waters demolished their house in Fourmile Canyon. Shortly after receiv-ing a reverse 911 call, the canyon gave way. The family escaped to a firehouse, and, after 2 days, a National Guard hel-icopter flew in, transporting them to safety. There are so many stories of so many Colorado families, and the smallest dif-ference in circumstances would have meant that many families wouldn’t be alive today. In the last 5 years, communities have come together to repair roads, trails, homes, and businesses. This resiliency and grit that Coloradoans showed the week of September 9 through Sep-tember 16, 2013, as rains fell, was matched only by the sense of commu-nity and tenacity that took hold as the waters subsided. HONORING MINNESOTA’S LAW ENFORCEMENT (Mr. EMMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor five incredible members of Minnesota’s law enforcement, each of whom is deservedly receiving the FBI Director’s Award for Excellence: Stearns County Deputy/Investigator Dennis Kern, former Captain Pam Jen-sen, retired Bureau of Criminal Appre-hension Agent Ken McDonald, and Fed-eral Bureau of Investigation Special Agents Shane Ball and Chris Boeckers. Twenty-nine years ago, on October 22, 11-year-old Jacob Wetterling dis-appeared. Minnesota was left in shock and horror. Our State hoped and prayed for decades that Jacob would return home. Though unable to change the tragic outcome of Jacob’s life, Deputy Kern, Captain Jensen, Agent McDonald, Agent Ball, and Agent Boeckers were able to offer some peace and comfort by apprehending Jacob’s murderer. Mr. Speaker, words can’t adequately express the gratitude that the Wetterling family and all Minnesotans have for the law enforcement who never stopped searching for Jacob, who never gave up. To Deputy Kern, Captain Jensen, Agent McDonald, Agent Ball, and Agent Boeckers, on behalf of all Min-nesotans, thank you and God bless you.

NEED TO PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY (Mr. NORCROSS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I am here to speak about the need to protect Social Security. Last year, the Republicans passed an expensive tax scam that gave 83 per-cent of the benefits to the top 1 per-cent. This and the new tax scam 2.0 will add trillions to our deficit. Now they are trying to use this mas-sive deficit that they created to justify cutting and dismantling Social Secu-rity, all while a retirement security crisis is looming to wreak havoc on those who are going to retire over the next decade. One in three Americans have less than $5,000—one in three have less than $5,000—saved. Fewer have pensions. For so many families who have worked hard, played by the rules, Social Secu-rity is all they will have. And Repub-licans, they want to take it away. Mr. Speaker, let’s build up Social Se-curity, not dismantle it.

After attending Indiana University, Doug served for 7 years with the Cen-tral Intelligence Agency as an oper-ations officer. Unknown to his family and friends, Doug operated undercover in Afghanistan and Syria, fighting America’s global war on terror. Working in Afghanistan, Doug quiet-ly penetrated the ranks of al-Qaida and the Taliban, where he was able to infil-trate and eliminate one of the largest IED manufacturers in the world. Doug left the CIA in 2013 and now lives quietly in Coldwater, Ohio, his hometown. While Doug does not seek recognition for his past service, his actions struck a major blow to the enemies of our country, and they deserve commenda-tion. Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me in recognizing the bravery of Mr. Laux and to wish him continued success as a private citizen.

CONGRATULATING DR. LEANA WEN (Ms. BARRAGA´N asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. BARRAGA´N. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Dr. Leana Wen. Dr. Wen is the new president of Planned Parenthood. Dr. Wen is an im-migrant. Her family came here from China, and they were granted political asylum when she was a child. She is a Rhodes Scholar, and she grew up poor in my congressional district in Comp-ton, California. She has worked to close the racial health disparities that are happening in healthcare and to reduce infant mor-tality. She has been a voice against cuts to healthcare. And she is a cham-pion for health clinic funding across the country, to make sure they can continue to serve low-income families. I am proud to say that she is a fight-er, and I am proud to say that she grew up in Compton, California. With that, Dr. Wen, congratulations. I am looking forward to working with you and Planned Parenthood.

HONORING RICHARD D EVOS (Mr. AMASH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. AMASH. Mr. Speaker, the west Michigan community is mourning the loss of Richard DeVos, a man whose spirit touched millions of lives and helped shape Grand Rapids into the thriving city it is today. Rich passed away on September 6 at the age of 92, survived by 4 children, 16 grandchildren, and 6 great-grand-children. Rich follows his late wife, Helen DeVos, who passed away at the age of 90 in October of last year. A World War II veteran, an entre-preneur who never feared failure, Rich was a larger-than-life presence whose Christian faith and love for America were evident in all that he did. I greatly admired Rich, as did count-less others, not just from west Michi-gan, but from around the world, for his optimistic and caring approach to fam-ily, friends, business, and philanthropy alike. Anyone who knew Rich will tell you that he was an incredibly charismatic, encouraging, and kind person. I was fortunate enough to have a personal glimpse into this legend of a man who did so much for the west Michigan community while his work at home and abroad was changing the world. While no one can fill the void that Rich’s passing leaves, our community takes comfort in knowing that his leg-acy of generosity, entrepreneurship, and kindness will have a lasting im-pact. May the memory of him be eternal. f

GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-tend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and the underlying legislation. The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 3798, the Save American Workers Act of 2018, and H.R. 5895, Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Mili-tary Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act of 2019. Mr. Speaker, today is quite an un-usual day, not only for our Nation, but also for Members of Congress. As a re-sult of that, I have had a discussion with my dear friend, Judge H
ASTINGS , and we have decided we are going to try to expedite that which we do today, so all Members need to be advised we might finish the process of the rule on the floor some 55 minutes early. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and the underlying legislation. The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 3798, the Save American Workers Act of 2018 and H.R. 5895, Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veteran Affairs Appropriations Act, 2019. Since 2010, the American people have been dealing with the impacts of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare. As we now know, Obamacare contains a number of provi-sions that have greatly impacted the labor market, the workforce, and employers of all sizes. At the broadest level, the bill created massive mandatory spending spending pro-grams that have contributed greatly to the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH8182 September 13, 2018 
country’s debt and financial burdens on the American tax payer. At the center of this is the employer man-date. The employer mandate impacts hiring and employees’ hours because it requires em-ployers with 50 or more full-time employees to provide health insurance and carries a specific fine for noncompliance. Under this, employees who work 30 or more hours per week are con-sidered full-time. In addition, complex reporting requirements make the burden of this provi-sion even greater for employers. The employer mandate requirement has re-sulted in employers reducing workers’ hours to 29 hours per week or less in an attempt to minimize the mandate’s devastating impacts. These reduced hours have caused millions of workers to receive less take home pay. The 30-hour rule does little more than dis-courage employment and financial stability for American workers—especially low wage work-ers. According to a Hoover institution study, 2.6 million Americans making less than $30,000 were at risk of having their hours and wages cut as a result of Obamacare’s 30-hour rule. H.R. 3798 would give employers and work-ers more flexibility by changing Obamacare’s definition of full-time worker from 30 hours per week to 40 hours per week and from 120 hours per month to 174 hours per month for full-time equivalents. In addition, the bill gives employers retroactive relief from the employer mandate penalty. Thus, any employer that owed a penalty for failing to provide coverage during that period would no longer owe it, a big help to some our small businesses. The bill also includes a provision that will delay the implementation of the Obamacare tax on high-cost health plans, known as the ‘‘Cadillac tax,’’ until 2023, granting employers one additional year of relief from the tax. Finally, in light of the repeal of the individual mandate penalty, H.R. 3798 removes burden-some regulatory requirements on some pro-viders of minimum essential coverage. Mr. Speaker, this rule also provides for con-sideration of H.R. 5895, Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2019. This three-bill Appropriations package pro-vides funding for fiscal year 2019 in three very important categories. This bill is a product of members working across the aisle in a won-derful display of bipartisanship and I am pleased to see this body take up such an im-portant measure. The agreement addresses one of our funda-mental responsibilities here in Congress, tak-ing care of our veterans. The bill provides $5.3 Billion above FY18 levels and ensures funding for VA medical care. It funds VA medical care at $72.3 Billion, providing for 7 million veteran patients to be treated in FY19. The bill strengthens veteran programs like mental health care services, opioid abuse prevention, suicide prevention, and rural veterans health initiatives. Additionally, the legislation con-tinues to rebuild infrastructure for our service members and their families with $10.3 Billion for military construction projects, an increase of $241 Million. The second part of this appropriations pack-age, energy and water, prioritizes our national security and invests in American infrastructure. The bill supports a strong nuclear national se-curity strategy with a total $560 Million above FY 18 levels for the Department of Energy’s nuclear weapons security programs. It also provides a much-needed influx of funds into our nation’s water resources infrastructure by directing $7 Billion to the Army Corps of Engi-neers. Finally, the legislation directs a much-need-ed increase of $29.8 Million for our extremely dedicated and brave Capitol Police Officers. This money will ensure their safety, the safety of our Capitol complex, and the thousands of guests who visit every day. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. b1230 Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank the distinguished chair-man, my good friend, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. (Mr. HASTINGS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I am going to truncate my original remarks. Mr. Speaker, today’s legislation is yet another callous attempt by my friends on the other side to undermine healthcare for millions of Americans, all while recklessly adding billions of dollars to the deficit. This legislation not only guts vital provisions of the Affordable Care Act, but also weakens the requirements on employer-provided healthcare. I might add, even though we may not be bring-ing it up, we do support the conference report and will be willing to go forward in that regard. The time has come for our friends across the aisle to abandon their tired playbook, a playbook full of tactics and strategies bent on sabotaging and undermining healthcare, rather than plans to make our healthcare system stronger and more inclusive. Mr. Speaker, we are also here today, as I just said, on the conference report, for a three-bill spending package, fund-ing a portion of our government, which runs out of funds at the end of this month. This funding package isn’t perfect, and while I would have preferred we consider appropriations bills one at a time through regular order, as the Speaker promised, this effort rep-resents how this House should operate when we consider legislation. We hold hearings, markups, go to conference, negotiate in good faith, and finally, emerge with a bipartisan compromise. Good process makes for good policy. While this bill may not be one Demo-crats would have written, I am glad this conference report rejects House Republicans’ and President Trump’s extreme budget cuts and harmful antienvironmental riders. Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to say this: We have learned that, as Hurri-cane Florence closes in on millions of Americans, the administration has raided the coffers of the Federal Emer-gency Management Agency in order to move money to ICE. I am not going to spend a lot of time on that. I think it is just wrong. Mr. Speaker, this Republican-led Congress sets yet another record with today’s 97th closed rule. Week after week, my friends across the aisle con-tinue to make history for all the wrong reasons, but we should not let this lat-est milestone go unrecognized because it is yet another sad point in this Chamber’s history. In this historically closed-off Con-gress, Republican leaders have used re-strictive rules to block measures to create jobs, bring down the cost of pre-scription drugs, and make education more affordable for our children. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding me the customary thirty minutes for debate, and I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to debate the Rule for H.R. 3798, the Save American Workers Act and the Conference Report to Accompany H.R. 5895. Mr. Speaker, last year Republicans took one on the chin when their Affordable Care Act re-peal bill—a bill they spent all of 17 days work-ing on—went down in flames in a most public and spectacular fashion. They learned that conspicuously snatching health insurance from millions of people would probably cost them some votes. So, instead of continuing with their more open, though admittedly failed tactics, my friends across the aisle are pursuing an alto-gether shiftier strategy today. That strategy, with its aim of ridding the American people of their healthcare coverage, can be summed up in one word: sabotage. Today’s legislation is yet another callous at-tempt by Republicans to undermine healthcare for millions of Americans, all while recklessly adding billions of dollars to the deficit. This legislation not only guts vital provisions of the Affordable Care Act, but also weakens re-quirements on employer provided healthcare. Now is the time for us to face facts and ac-cept truths. Fact, the latest Kaiser Health Tracking poll found that 50 percent of Ameri-cans hold a favorable view of the Affordable Care Act. Fact, 75 percent of Americans want to keep the Affordable Care Act’s provisions that pre-vent health plans from discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions. Fact, 72 percent of Americans want to retain the provi-sion of the ACA that prevents insurers from charging sick people more. The time has come for my friends across the aisle to abandon their tired playbook—a playbook full of tactics and strategies bent on sabotaging and undermining healthcare rather than plans to make our healthcare system stronger and more inclusive. Mr. Speaker, we are also here today to con-sider H.R. 5895, a conference report for a three-bill spending package—funding a portion of our government—which runs out of funding at the end of this month. This funding package isn’t perfect, and while I would have preferred we consider appropria-tions bills one at a time through regular order as the Speaker promised, this effort rep-resents how this House should operate when we consider legislation: we hold hearings, markups, go to conference, negotiate in good faith, and finally emerge with a bipartisan com-promise.

would have written, I’m glad this conference report rejects House Republicans’ and Presi-dent Trump’s extreme budget cuts and harm-ful anti-environmental riders. Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to say this, we have learned that as Hurricane Florence closes in on millions of Americans, the Trump Administration has raided the coffers of the Federal Emergency Management Agency in order to move money to ICE for the continued immoral detention of children. The ability of this Administration to reach new lows is astounding. To my fellow Americans who are in Hurri-cane Florence’s path, our thoughts and pray-ers are with you. As a Floridian, I know all too well the effects these devastating storms can have and I urge everyone to take all necessary steps to be prepared, be safe, and listen to the direction of local authorities as this storm impacts the Southeast. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, this Republican led Congress sets yet another record with today’s 97th Closed Rule. Week after week, my friends across the aisle continue to make history for all the wrong reasons. But we should not let this latest milestone go unrecognized, be-cause it is yet another sad point in this Cham-ber’s history. In this historically closed-off Congress, Re-publican leaders have used restrictive rules to block measures to create jobs, bring down the cost of prescription drugs, and make edu-cation more affordable. These policies deserve consideration on the House Floor, yet they are continuously blocked by the Republican Majority. This discouraging record not only sup-presses the voices of Democratic and Repub-lican Members, it also suppresses the voices of millions of Americans. Mr. Speaker, my Republican friends may claim today’s three-bill spending package gets the ball rolling to fully fund the government. But we need to put into context what it means to fully fund the government, it means that we must pass 12 appropriations bills in order to fully fund our government. So, before they take a victory lap over to-day’s spending package, I will simply remind the Majority that with precious few legislative days remaining, we still must pass the remain-ing seventy-five percent of bills that will fund our government. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the distinguished gen-tleman, his work with me is appre-ciated. On behalf of not only Judge H
ASTINGS and myself, really, the Rules Committee, which both of us represent, with great anxiety, we recognize, as our Members do, about the storm that is headed to the United States of Amer-ica. We want to wish all the people who are in the storm’s way the very best, but we are attempting to do what we can to make sure we complete our work properly. Thus, I ask for my colleagues to vote for this conference report, which will do so much to move us not only to the point where we can continue to work together, but to fund the important ac-tivities that need to take place. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues support this bill and the underlying bills. Mr. Speaker, this is a good rule and so are the two underlying bills. it has become abun-dantly clear that Obamacare has failed the American people. Our nation’s healthcare sys-tem is broken and only getting worse. The American people are counting on us to empower individuals, families, and employers to spend their health care dollars the way they want. They are counting on us to remove the federal government from their health care and the first bill is another step in the right direc-tion. The second bill is a wonderful example to bipartisanship—the package isn’t perfect, but it is a good bill. It takes care of our veterans and our military, it provides much-needed funding for our infrastructure and our waterways, and it ensures we are providing the Capitol Police officers the funding they need. I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying bills. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The previous question was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the resolution. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to the rule, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. S
HUSTER ) and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. D
EFAZIO) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 3021, the America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018. This bill is good for our infrastruc-ture, good for jobs, and good for Amer-ica. It is a bipartisan, bicameral com-prehensive bill that delivers on a prom-ise to regularly address water re-sources and infrastructure issues across the Nation. Title I of this act is the Water Re-sources Development Act of 2018, or WRDA. I want to remind my colleagues that we overwhelmingly passed WRDA in June by a vote of 408–2. WRDA invests in the ports, locks, and dams, inland waterways, flood pro-tection, and other infrastructure that makes America more competitive and protects our communities. It also builds upon reforms to the Army Corps of Engineers to help improve project delivery. This bill is fiscally responsible and fully offset. It cuts red tape, and it maintains congressional authority and oversight of Federal investment. I want to thank Ranking Member D
EFAZIO for working together on the WRDA title. However, today’s bill in-cludes more than just WRDA, and I also want to thank the Energy and Commerce Committee, the Natural Re-sources Committee, and our Senate counterparts for helping put this pack-age together. I am proud to say today’s legislation continues a 2-year cycle of regular order for Congress considering these es-sential WRDA bills. This has been one of my top priorities since I became chairman over 6 years ago. b1315 We need to pass this bill, continue providing direction to the Corps, and ensure all of these infrastructure im-provements move forward. This is simply good public policy, and it is good for our Nation. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-leagues to support this jobs and infra-structure bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH8222 September 13, 2018 
JOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT TOACCOM -
PANY S. 3021, A MERICA ’SWATER INFRA -
STRUCTURE ACT OF 2018 The America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 will create jobs, grow the economy, pro-mote fiscal responsibility, and protect lives, property, and the environment. America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 supports our nation’s economic competitive-ness by increasing water storage, providing protection from dangerous floodwaters, deep-ening nationally significant ports, and main-taining the navigability of inland waterways across the country. The legislation will also repair aging drinking water, wastewater and irrigation systems. It also promotes hydro-power development and increases Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) transparency. Title I of this bill, the Water Resources De-velopment Act (WRDA) of 2018, promotes the Federal commitment to our nation’s com-petitiveness, prosperity, and economic growth by maintaining a strong transpor-tation infrastructure, ensuring the efficient flow of domestic and international com-merce, and protecting the lives and liveli-hoods of the American people in a sustain-able and environmentally conscientious manner. In WRDA, Congress authorizes projects encompassing the key missions of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), including developing, maintaining, and sup-porting the nation’s economically vital wa-terway infrastructure, supporting effective and targeted flood protection and environ-mental restoration needs while strength-ening national security. Through WRDA, Congress exercises its oversight authority to make policy reforms that promote efficient, effective, and transparent project develop-ment and implementation. This legislation promotes innovation and stronger stake-holder partnerships that will improve water infrastructure development. Since 2014, Congress has resumed the reg-ular consideration of WRDAs, and WRDA 2018 continues the WRDA two-year cycle that provides appropriate oversight of and policy direction to the Administration and the Corps. The transformative nature of the last two WRDA bills has provided the Corps and the non-Federal sponsors with new opportunities to advance projects more quickly. As these new authorities and processes are imple-mented, the Managers expect that project delivery will speed up. The Managers also ex-pect that the provisions put forward in this bill, as well as the last two WRDA bills, will promote investment in worthwhile and bene-ficial water resources development projects, and enable these projects to move forward. Water resources projects have historically been rejected through the use of benefit-cost analyses (BCAs) in the formulation, evalua-tion, and budgeting of water resources devel-opment projects. The Managers have been approached by members and non-Federal project sponsors who have projects that are authorized, but because of past practices re-garding BCA calculations, non-Federal project sponsors are left without a clear path forward. This legislation makes clear the Managers’ intent: authorized projects are worthy of funding. Specifically, this bill contains provisions that require the careful study of and report-ing on the use and application of current BCAs. The Managers expect this study to re-sult in recommendations to improve project transparency and the taxpayers’ return on Federal investment. The bill also provides additional transparency measures to help non-Federal project sponsors better under-stand where their projects are in the budg-eting process, and the calculations used to justify or reject federal investment in the project. Corps water resources development projects are long-term investments which are critically important to maintaining the nation’s economic prosperity, national secu-rity, and environmental protection. The Managers expect the Corps to proactively work with non-Federal interests to trans-parently discuss the principles and analyt-ical methodologies used in developing BCAs on these projects. Title II and IV of this legislation builds on the existing Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act programs to protect and restore water quality. This legislation pro-vides Federal financial assistance to local drinking and wastewater systems to improve water quality and comply with both the Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water Act’s requirements. The United States Environmental Protec-tion Agency (EPA) published its sixth na-tional assessment, Drinking Water Infra-structure Needs Survey, in March 2018. That assessment estimated the nation’s drinking water utilities require $472.6 billion in infra-structure investments and $271 billion in wastewater needs over the next 20 years to protect the public health and ensure the se-curity and economic well-being of our cities, towns and communities. This bill reauthor-izes the Safe Drinking Water State Revolv-ing Loan Fund (SRF), growing the program over the next three fiscal years to $1.95 bil-lion annually in 2021, nearly doubling the amount currently authorized. Along with the SRFs, this bill reauthorizes the Water Infra-structure and Finance Innovation Act (WIFIA) and a program within WIFIA the Se-curing Required Funding for Water Infra-structure Now (SRF WIN). All of these mech-anisms will substantially increase invest-ments toward addressing this critical need. Investments in water infrastructure are es-sential for protecting public health and the environment, but they also generate signifi-cant economic benefits. The Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that for every dollar in revenue re-alized by the water and wastewater industry, $2.62 in revenue are realized by all other in-dustries. Adding one job in the water and wastewater industry creates an additional 3.68 jobs in the national economy. The Managers understand that our nation’s ability to provide clean water and safe drink-ing water is challenged by deteriorating wastewater infrastructure that is in urgent need of repair, replacement, or upgrade. This legislation takes steps to address these needs through financial support from grants, state revolving loan funds, innovative financing mechanisms, the use of funds for compliance assistance, and the use of technical assist-ance for disadvantaged communities. Title III of this legislation includes several provisions that promote the development of hydropower through closed-loop pump stor-age, in-conduit projects, and at existing non- powered dams. This legislation also amends the Federal Power Act to authorize the FERC to issue preliminary permits to a hy-dropower construction license applicant for up to four years, and promote the timely re-habilitation and replacement of hydropower infrastructure. Title IV of the bill also addresses the need in many states, particularly throughout the West, to increase water supplies necessary to sustain the livelihoods of farming, ranching, and tribal communities. This legislation also addresses flood protection concerns in rural and tribal communities. Section 1116 directs the Corps to expedite the dredge material management plan proc-ess and make maximum use of existing infor-mation, studies, and innovative dredge mate-rial management practices. It is the Man-ager’s intent that dredged material manage-ment plans begun in 2018, but not completed shall also be expedited under this provision. Managers ask that, when a non-Federal en-tity develops a reasonable alternative to the Federal standard for dredged material dis-posal facilities that meets relevant Federal environmental and dredged material place-ment and disposal standards, it should re-ceive preferred consideration by the Sec-retary. Additionally, the Secretary is en-couraged to consider entering into agree-ments with non-Federal sponsors for the ac-quisition, design, construction, management, or operation and maintenance of dredged material disposal facilities, including port facilities, through section 217 of WRDA of 1996. Section 1126 addresses the concerns that Managers heard about the regulatory per-mitting process for water storage projects is extremely lengthy, in part due to issues as-sociated with identifying and analyzing the purpose and need of the project. This section is intended to increase transparency earlier in the regulatory process by providing the permittee an opportunity to obtain a project’s purpose and need statement. For Section 1133, as much as is possible, if the determination is made that additional housing is warranted, the purchase of private land shall be avoided. Section 1134 directs the Corps to imple-ment these sediment removal provisions in an expeditious manner in order to restore these reservoirs to their intended storage ca-pacity. The Managers recognize the impor-tance of water storage capacity to rural and western communities. Federal reservoirs have gradually seen a reduction in water storage capacity associated with sediment buildup to the detriment of farmers, ranch-ers, and rural communities. Managers expect that the final feasibility study for the project in section 1142 will be carried out expeditiously and be completed by the anticipated completion date of Feb-ruary 2019. The Managers intend that section 1143 apply to all projects authorized by Title VII of WRDA 2007 so that the Secretary can ac-knowledge credit for the cost of work carried out in the coastal Louisiana ecosystem by the non-Federal interest for elements inte-gral to the project prior to the date of enact-ment of WRDA 2018. For example, the ‘‘Mul-tipurpose Operation of Houma Navigation Lock’’ is dependent upon the adjacent earth-en levees (including Reach F and G of the Morganza to the Gulf of Mexico project) and other structures (including the Bubba Dove Floodgate and Bayou Grand Calliou Flood-gate). Operating a lock complex without ad-jacent levees can significantly reduce the ability to reduce salinity and to manage and control the fresh water available via the Atchafalaya River, Gulf Intercoastal Water-way and the Houma Navigation Canal. In ad-dition, the Bubba Dove Floodgate has re-duced the original wetland impact of the Houma Navigation Lock and is integral to the lock’s design and function. Section 1203 (f) expedites activities under section 4003(a) of Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA) 2014. The Managers understand that these activities have not been implemented due to a lack of appropriated funds, and emphasize that the importance of such flood and drought moni-toring to communities in the Upper Missouri River Basin necessitates that the Corps expe-dite activities for this monitoring in order to protect lives and properties in the region. The Managers expect section 1229 to be car-ried out in an expeditious manner and in ac-cordance with all applicable Federal and state water laws. Section 1332 further amends the Annual Report process set up by section 7001 of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8223 September 13, 2018 
WRRDA 2014. WRDA 2016 changed the proc-ess to ensure individual existing environ-mental infrastructure projects may be in-cluded in the Annual Report Main Table so that they can be considered for inclusion in future WRDA bills, and the amendments in this section clarify that proposed modifica-tions to existing regional environmental in-frastructure programs are also able to be considered. Such projects that have pre-viously ended up in the appendix of these re-ports, such as Charlotte County, Florida, are encouraged to reapply. Similarly, this section amends the criteria by which the Secretary may select to include a local request in the appendix to the Annual Report, rather than the Report, itself. The Committees on Transportation and Infra-structure and Environment and Public Works have repeatedly criticized the Sec-retary for failure to follow the specific cri-teria outlined in section 7001(c)(1)(A), and in-cluding local requests in the appendix de-spite those requests meeting the statutory criteria. In response, this legislation clari-fies that the Secretary may not include a re-quest that meets the criteria in 7001(c)(1)(A) in the appendix solely on the basis that the local request requires legislative changes to an authorized project or study, or the re-quest may be inconsistent with Corps or Ad-ministration policy. The Committee is aware of one particular request for a modification of the Abiquiu Reservoir, New Mexico, that was placed in the appendix to the 2017 An-nual Report to Congress because of Adminis-tration policy. Project sponsors for similarly situated project or study requests are en-couraged to reapply. The Managers encourage the Secretary to consider the benefits of safety modifications for 2-way traffic and other improvements to commercial navigation when evaluating au-thorized navigation studies. The Managers encourage the Secretary to provide technical assistance and other sup-port to state emergency management agen-cies to assist in the development of hand-books for floodplain managers. These hand-books should include policies to help manage the risks of coastal and river flooding. In ad-dition, these handbooks should consider coastal protection solutions that promote re-silience, such as living shorelines, as well as regional sediment management. Addition-ally, non-Federal entities may provide re-sources for emergency repairs under section 1024 of WRRDA 2014 (33 U.S.C. 2325a), regard-less of the cause of the emergency. The Managers encourage the Corps to pro-ceed with a sense of urgency when evalu-ating and programming the actions to pro-ceed with the water resources projects nec-essary for flood control, dam repair, beach erosion control, and harbor navigation im-provement in Puerto Rico, and the repair and mitigation necessary as a result of the hurricane and severe weather damages that occurred between September 2017 and March 2018. Additionally, the Managers encourage the Corps to advance the project for eco-system restoration, Can˜o Martin Pen˜a, San Juan, Puerto Rico. The Managers believe the Secretary should simplify and expedite the process for includ-ing in-kind work in project partnership agreements, consistent with current law. The Managers further encourage the Corps to improve communication with stake-holders and the public regarding the risk as-sessments conducted by the agency of the levees around the country. The managers believe that the financing of project operations, maintenance, where the locals are not otherwise responsible for the project, or capital improvements by local non-Federal interests can results in savings to Federal taxpayers. As the Secretary carries out the operations and maintenance of our nation’s infrastruc-ture, the Managers expect periodic mainte-nance dredging of the Kennebec River Fed-eral Navigation Channel will be prioritized based on a joint plan that is being developed by the Secretary and the Secretary of the Navy. Additionally, the managers believe the Corps should prioritize annual dredging for the harbor in Wilmington, Delaware. The Secretary may use his or her author-ity under section 9 of the Flood Control Act of 1946 (60 Stat. 643, chapter 596) to remedy the erosion issues on the Ohio River near Clarksville, Indiana. Ongoing cooperation between the Lou-isiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority and the Lafitte Area Independent Levee District relating to flood protection projects in Jean Lafitte, Louisiana, and the vicinity should continue. To the maximum extent practicable, the Secretary should sup-port that cooperation in a manner that is consistent with Louisiana’s Comprehensive Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast. The amendment to section 203 of WRDA 1986 (33 U.S.C. 2231) made by section 1126 of WIIN 2016 (130 Stat. 1648), which concerns study of water resources development projects by non-Federal interests, was in-tended to supersede any conflicting laws. As water resources projects are vital to the nation’s competitiveness, the Managers en-courage robust annual funding. The Con-tinuing Authorities Programs should receive full appropriations each fiscal year. The au-thorization of appropriations under section 595(i) of WRDA 1999, for water, wastewater, environmental restoration and surface water protection projects in certain rural states should be robustly maintained. Section 2005 includes new grant opportuni-ties for states to assist small and disadvan-taged communities when contaminants are present or are likely to be present in drink-ing water provided by a public water system or underground source of drinking water. The Managers intend this legislation to as-sist states with small and disadvantaged communities to promptly respond to prob-lems that potentially present an imminent and substantial endangerment. Section 2010 establishes new authority for states and EPA to address the challenges of water systems that have repeatedly violated drinking water standards and pose a risk to human health. The section includes limited liability protection for outside entities that help the system come back into compliance. The Managers do not intend this legislation to limit enforcement of drinking water vio-lations not identified in the plan or to dimin-ish the availability of injunctive relief to ad-dress unresolved drinking water violations. Section 2021 authorizes EPA, subject to the availability of appropriated funds carrying out the purposes of the section, to require drinking water systems serving between 3,300 and 10,000 persons to comply with mandatory unregulated contaminant testing for up to 30 unregulated contaminants. The legislation also authorizes $15 million in the years the monitoring is required to pay costs tradi-tionally associated with such testing. Sys-tems serving fewer than 3,300 persons will re-main subject to random sampling and have their testing and mailing costs covered by EPA. Such systems will not be subject to a civil penalty for their inability to comply with sampled monitoring. Title II provides for Drinking Water Im-provement. As Congress reauthorizes the Drinking Water SRF, the managers strongly support Congress providing robust funding of capitalization grants to States to fund SDWA SRFs established under section 1452 of the SDWA (42 U.S.C. 300j–12) and the CWA SRFs established under title VI of the CWA (33 U.S.C. 1381 et seq.). The managers also en-courage the Administrator to work with the States to realize the full benefits of the re-newed DWSRF authorization amounts. Section 3003 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of the FERC to establish an expedite process for issuing and amending li-censes under the Federal Power Act for qualifying facilities under that section. The Committee on Transportation is aware that certain projects owned or operated by the Corps of Engineers may fall within the scope of this section. However, nothing in section 3003 provides new authority to add hydro-power to existing non-powered projects owned or operated by the Corps of Engineers where hydropower is not specifically an au-thorized purpose, established in law, for such projects. The decision and conditions to add hydropower to an existing, non-powered project of the Corps rests solely with the Secretary of the Army, through its existing regulatory authorities, and with the Com-mittee on Transportation and Infrastructure in the U.S. House of Representatives and the Committee on Environment and Public Works in the U.S. Senate, through enact-ment of future water resources development legislation. Section 4102 establishes a Wastewater Technology Clearinghouse at EPA. Providing communities with the knowledge and re-sources necessary to fully use decentralized wastewater systems can provide affordable wastewater recycling and treatment to mil-lions of people in the United States. Section 4103 provides Technical Assistance for Treatment Works in the CWA. The Man-agers recognize the importance of technical assistance for small, rural, and tribal water systems. It is the Managers’ view that onsite technical assistance, provides the most effec-tive means for communities that are strug-gling to implement the CWA. The Managers also acknowledge that the use of remote training does not always provide commu-nities with sufficient assistance to comply with complicated and system-specific issues. Section 4201 amends the Water Infrastruc-ture Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) by enhancing the process under WIFIA for fi-nancial assistance to those applying for state loan funds to carry out water and wastewater infrastructure projects, the Se-curing Required Funding for Water Infra-structure Now (SRF WIN). It allows states that combine projects and submit one appli-cation to the WIFIA program to receive addi-tional considerations. This section provides specific selection criteria and expedites the evaluation of applications of these combined projects to 180 days, with feedback from the EPA on how to improve their application, if denied. This section also puts the application fee cost on the state financing authority and removes the burden from the bundled com-munities. It eliminates the need for these combined projects from having to do any du-plicative environmental reviews and allows for the federal cost share of the project to cover up to 100% of the total project cost. These amendments utilize the leveraging power of WIFIA financing to enhance the ability of the state financing authorities to provide financial assistance to local commu-nities. This will allow states to finance thou-sands of existing and vetted water and wastewater infrastructure projects expedi-tiously. Section 4301 establishes a mandatory re-quirement that not later than one year after the date of enactment of the Act that the EPA will enter into a memorandum of agree-ment with the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) that will establish a structure for how EPA can provide technical assistance for any credit instrument that Reclamation may provide now or in the future.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH8224 September 13, 2018 
Section 4302 directs the BOR, working with the Corps to create a flood action plan. The Managers recognize that 2017 was a record year for runoff in the Upper Snake River Basin, causing communities in the region to experience significant flooding. The Man-agers further recognize that landowners and stakeholders have serious concerns for how the BOR and the Corps have managed the spring runoff out of Jackson Lake and down the Snake River. The Managers seek assur-ances that the BOR will work with the Corps to protect communities to minimize flooding in the region. Section 4304 establishes a new workforce training program for workforce development in the water utility sector. The managers find that water and wastewater utilities pro-vide a unique opportunity for access to sta-ble, high-quality careers. This section also establishes a competitive grant program to promote the development of innovative ac-tivities relating to workforce development in the water utility sector. Section 4306 authorizes EPA’s WaterSense program, a voluntary program which identi-fies and promotes water efficient products through voluntary labeling, is authorized by this legislation. The bill requires EPA to re-view and revise the program’s performance criteria to achieve additional water savings not more frequently than every 6 years. The Managers expect EPA to conduct these re-views as required by the section and to re-view the requirements of the program and update them as needed and appropriate. Section 4312 recognizes the rehabilitation and restoration of Indian irrigation systems owned and operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is essential to the success and livelihood of individuals and businesses across 17 reservations. Congress outlined these objectives in Public Law 114–322 and es-tablished the Indian Irrigation Fund for the BIA to carry out its trust responsibility for certain individual Indians and Tribes. This provision authorizes seven years of addi-tional funding to complete this necessary re-habilitation, which will ensure the delivery of clean water, reduce the loss of water through seepage, and improve the safety of the systems. The Managers believe the Ad-ministration should prioritize the Indian Ir-rigation Fund in addressing restoration of these Indian irrigation systems. The Man-agers strongly encourage the Administration to fulfill the objectives outlined in Public Law 114–322. 
Mr. D EFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I particularly want to thank the chairman for getting the Water Resources Development bills back on track. We had gone many years without an authorization, and the chairman made it a priority to do this every 2 years. We also have created a new process through which we provide some direc-tion to the Corps of Engineers on where to invest their scarce resources. If I had my way, or maybe if we have different leadership in the next Con-gress, we would go back to a much sim-pler, explicit process where we would designate high-priority local infra-structure investment as needed in the certain areas around the United States of America to better facilitate com-merce. But that is for another day. This is a good bill. It is a bipartisan bill. There is, however, one problem. That problem is that Ronald Reagan worked with a Democratic Congress to create a harbor maintenance trust fund funded by a miniscule ad valorem tax on the value of goods that come in from overseas and pass through our ports. Consistently, Congress has underspent those funds under both Democratic and Republican leadership. Many years ago, I started to work with the chairman’s father on this very issue. That is more than two decades ago now. We did make substantial progress in the last Congress and in this Congress. An amendment that I offered to the water resources bill put us on a track toward spending all of the tax that is collected for harbor maintenance on harbor maintenance. Now, I know that is kind of shocking in this town, that you would collect a tax from people and then spend it on the thing for which it is dedicated, but I think that would be right. My proposal was adopted unani-mously in the committee twice. Then Speaker RYAN, through his control of the Rules Committee, reached into the bill and extracted that amendment. Why would they do that when we, on an average daily basis, have less than 40 percent of the authorized capacity at our 59 largest harbors? Why would we cripple United States commerce and shipping interests? Why would we do that? Well, so they can pretend that the deficit is a little tiny bit less. When it comes to taxes, a trillion dollars here, a trillion dollars there, we don’t care about deficits. But when it comes to spending the harbor maintenance tax on harbor maintenance, we can skim off a few hundred million dollars every year and put it over here in an imagi-nary trust fund that we never spend. So it is a bunch of BS that we are doing that. You should not be col-lecting taxes from the American people and then not spending money on the intended and needed purpose. The Corps’ estimate is that they need about $20 million to bring all harbors up to authorized depths in the next 10 years. If we were spending the full har-bor maintenance trust fund income on an annual basis and spending down the balance that has already accumulated, we could exceed that goal and deal with other issues, such as jetty prob-lems and the like. The White House has come up with a brilliant and different solution. They want to reduce the harbor maintenance tax so we will never, ever bring up our ports to authorized depths. In any case, that is the major prob-lem with this bill. The chairman has already mentioned a number of the attributes of this bill. There is a provision that potentially will make the Corps more efficient on dredging projects and look at multiyear as opposed to annual con-tracts. The Corps is getting some tools to respond to climate change—I can’t believe we got that in there—sea level rise, and natural disasters. It requires the Corps to be more transparent in how it chooses projects. As I mentioned earlier, I think Con-gress should be a little more direct there. Again, that is for another day. It has provisions that are important to my district and my State, which are fully justified. Mr. Speaker, again, it is a good, bi-partisan project, and I reserve the bal-ance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I just want to say the ranking member is 100 percent correct on his assessment of the harbor maintenance trust fund. I support it. He is absolutely right. I just want to make sure, when he is refer-ring to BS, he is not referring to BILL S
HUSTER . Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. W
ALDEN ), the chairman of the Energy and Com-merce Committee. Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for his help on this legislation. I, too, agree in terms of the harbor maintenance trust fund. I rise in support of America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018. This legisla-tion includes really important lan-guage to assist irrigators in the Klam-ath Basin who are enduring another challenging drought year, and it helps ensure we are prepared if our farmers are hit again with severe drought con-ditions in the years ahead. This bill provides the Bureau of Rec-lamation with the authority to use the funds we secured earlier this year, about $10 million, to implement meas-ures such as groundwater pumping and other priorities for our irrigators, and ensures that they have the authority to survive difficult water years we may face over the next 4 years. I also want to express, as chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, our support for a couple other titles in this bill. Title II of the legislation modernizes the Safe Drinking Water Act to address regulatory compliance and infrastruc-ture challenges facing communities across our country. It brings greater investment to improve our aging drinking water systems and supports State-led efforts in large cities and rural communities alike. For the first time in 22 years, Mr. Speaker, it authorizes capitalization grants for State drinking water revolv-ing loan funds—$4.4 billion over 3 years, to be exact. This is a big infrastructure bill. These loans are a crucial tool to help communities address compliance issues and address drinking water threats. I urge EPA to help each State realize the promise of this new authorization. As we brace for the horrible impacts of Hurricane Florence, I want to point out that title II also authorizes $100 million for areas affected by natural disasters that need help repairing their drinking water systems to deliver clean, safe drinking water. Our prayers are with those in the storm’s path, Mr. Speaker. While this legislation won’t make them whole, it will help them recover.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8225 September 13, 2018 
Title III of the legislation will make substantial regulatory improvements to the hydropower licensing process, with the goal to deliver more clean, re-newable, carbon-free, and affordable energy to consumers. This title incor-porates several important bills that passed out of the Energy and Com-merce Committee, and I am proud to support their inclusion in this legisla-tion before us today. With that, I urge strong bipartisan support of the America’s Water Infra-structure Act. I thank the gentlemen on both sides of the aisle and everyone involved for their work in getting this to the House floor, and I urge its pas-sage. Mr. D
EFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-fornia (Mrs. N
APOLITANO ), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 3021, Amer-ica’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018. I thank Chairman S
HUSTER , Ranking Member D
EFAZIO, Chairman G RAVES , and our own respective staffs for their work on this legislation. It is encour-aging to see the Transportation and In-frastructure Committee continue in a bipartisan fashion on this legislation every 2 years. The bill authorizes Army Corps of Engineers’ feasibility studies; chief’s reports; and section 7001 water resource projects across the country for a di-verse array of purposes, including flood damage reduction, ecosystem restora-tion, water supply, navigation, and other things. The bill also includes important pro-visions that both the House and the Senate have worked on to improve EPA water programs. I am pleased to have coauthored sev-eral provisions that will assist commu-nities experiencing stormwater chal-lenges and drought with additional water supply and water treatment op-tions. Section 4106 authorizes $450 million in grants to cities over the next 2 years to plan, design, and construct stormwater, water recycling, and sewer overflow projects. This is incredibly important in my area in Los Angeles, which is addressing a new MS4 stormwater permit and is imple-menting water recycling projects as a way to address long-term drought and climate change. Section 1164 requires the Corps to work with local governments on inte-grated water resources planning to in-corporate locally developed plans for stormwater management, water qual-ity improvement, and water recycling in Corps projects. Section 1146 makes permanent my provision from WRDA 16 that allows public agencies or private companies to remove sediment from Army Corps dams in order for the dams to be more efficient for water supply and flood control operations. There was a par-ticular problem of sediment buildup in several of our dams, including the Santa Fe and San Gabriel Dams in my region. Section 4304 creates an EPA water in-frastructure and workforce investment program, which will provide grants to educational institutions, workforce de-velopment organizations, and water agencies to provide training in the water sector. The water agencies in my district have been strongly supportive of creating this program, because many employees in the water sector are re-tiring and workforce training is needed for new water technologies. Section 4306 formally authorizes and improves the EPA WaterSense pro-gram, which creates a national stand-ard for the labeling of water-efficient products. Local, State, and Federal agencies can then give rebates to indi-viduals and businesses that purchase these WaterSense-approved products, in order to decrease overall water con-sumption demands. Section 1222 requires the Corps to as-sess forecast-informed operations in water control manuals to ensure that dams are being used effectively to maximize local water supply. Some of them are more than 40 years old. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. F
RANCIS ROONEY of Florida). The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. D
EFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from California an additional 30 seconds. Mrs. NAPOLITANO. I am confident that this bill, if enacted, will provide drought-prone regions like mine with the tools necessary to increase water supply through water recycling and capturing and treating stormwater. I want to thank my constituent water agencies for their input through-out this process, including the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District; the Three Valleys Municipal Water District; the San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District; the San Ga-briel Valley WaterMaster; the Los An-geles County Department of Public Works; and my local Corps leadership in General Helmlinger, Colonel Gibbs, and David Van Dorpe. Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Lou-isiana (Mr. G
RAVES ), chairman of the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment. Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, we have Hurricane Flor-ence bearing down on our Nation now. The Carolinas and Georgia are inevi-tably going to have disaster, destruc-tion, and damages. What happens in the aftermath, as folks begin looking at it, they ask the question: What could we have done differently? This bill, together with other legisla-tion, is exactly what needs to be done. This begins the process of addressing this ridiculous backlog of $100 billion in projects that we need to move for-ward on, that we need to construct, and bringing efficiencies to the table, like allowing for States and local govern-ments to advance these projects on their own, taking advantage of their capabilities of greater cost efficiencies, of streamlined permitting processes, and other efficiencies that they are ca-pable of doing. This bill brings all sorts of solutions to the table, including, Mr. Speaker, looking at whether the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers should even be within the Department of Defense. When I call Secretary Mattis and talk to him about Russia, China, North Korea, Syria, and Iran, should I intro-duce a wetlands permit in that con-versation? I don’t think I should. It is not com-patible with the agency. So we are looking at where this mission can be a top priority, can be properly housed, and where we can accomplish these projects much faster than we are doing today. Mr. Speaker, this bill also has some important things for us back home, in-cluding recognizing the hundreds of millions of dollars in work that our State has done to restore our eroding coastline and the ecological produc-tivity that goes along with it; looking at carrying out a pilot dredge program, whereby we can issue dredging con-tracts over years over multiple chan-nels, rather than doing one channel at a time, where we can benefit from economies of scale and, again, greater efficiency with taxpayer dollars; and, importantly, Mr. Speaker, ensuring that the old river control structure is not managed by a static 70–30 split that was determined decades ago, using up-dated science so we benefit navigation, the environment, and other important priorities. I want to thank Chairman SHUSTER , Congressman D
EFAZIO, Congresswoman N
APOLITANO , Congressman S ANFORD , Congressman R
OUZER , and all those in-volved for their hard work on this. I urge its adoption. Mr. D
EFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. P
ALLONE ). Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. D
EFAZIO, Mrs. N APOLI -
TANO , and all the leadership on both the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Transportation and Infrastruc-ture Committee for putting this bill to-gether. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to talk about the Energy and Commerce jurisdiction, which is initially the Safe Drinking Water Act. Our Nation’s public drinking water system serves more than 300 million people, but aging and failing infra-structure threatens access to safe drinking water in communities large and small. b1330 The Environmental Protection Agen-cy estimates that our water systems will require $472 billion in infrastruc-ture repairs over the next 20 years, but

investment simply has not kept pace with the need. This bill reauthorizes the Safe Drink-ing Water Act State Revolving Fund for the first time in 20 years and pro-vides significant new funding to State and local governments in dire need. The bill nearly doubles the author-ized funding from $1 billion to almost $2 billion in 2021 and increases funding for public water system supervision grants to States. Important provisions in the bill en-sure that this money gets to the com-munities that need it most by raising the cap on special assistance to dis-advantaged communities under the State Revolving Fund and setting a floor for such assistance to guarantee help for those communities. I want to thank Representative T
ONKO , the ranking member of our House Energy Subcommittee on Envi-ronment, who led the effort to reau-thorize and improve the State Revolv-ing Fund for many years. Many of the provisions in this bill were incor-porated from AQUA Act, which he au-thored. The bill also contains a provision first introduced by myself and Rep-resentative R
USH establishing a grant program for replacing leaded drinking water fountains in schools and requir-ing, for the first time, a national in-ventory of lead service lines and the cost to replace them. The bill contains Representative D
IN-
GELL ’s provision to make drinking water quality reports to consumers more frequent, comprehensive, and un-derstandable. Significantly, the bill incorporates Representative P
ETERS ’ provision to assist systems with resiliency to ex-treme weather, and it establishes new requirements to assess and address vul-nerabilities to those threats. It also provides $100 million for grants to extend access to safe drink-ing water into areas impacted by nat-ural disasters, responding to concerns raised by Representative G
REEN . Additionally, the bill contains lan-guage championed by Representative M
CNERNEY authorizing a water sense program to encourage consumer prod-uct water efficiency, and it authorizes Buy America requirements for iron and steel products for 5 years. Mr. Speaker, this bill won’t solve all our drinking water challenges, but it makes important improvements and delivers real benefits. I am also pleased that this final bi-partisan bill includes important energy provisions that I pushed, to include among them provisions authored by Representatives K
ENNEDY , D EGETTE , and P
ETERS . All in all, the drinking water and en-ergy titles of this bill are critical, sig-nificant steps forward that will benefit America’s families, industry, and the environment. Mr. Speaker, America’s Water Infra-structure Act is a victory for all of us, and I urge my colleagues to support the legislation. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. GRAVES ). Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-er, I rise in support of America’s Water Infrastructure Act, which includes the House-passed WRDA. The chairman’s commitment to pass-ing bipartisan WRDA bills every 2 years has been an impactful item at better managing the bureaucracy at the Army Corps and more regularly ap-proving vital water projects. This is good government and a policy that I would like to see the committee re-main committed to in the future. In my district, Mr. Speaker, this bill is extremely important to the agri-culture economy and to everyone who relies on the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. I am glad the final bill included my amendment to stop the Army Corps from building any new, unproven struc-tures for endangered species along the Missouri, and, instead, they now are re-quired to prove that it will actually work before spending millions of tax-payer dollars. The Corps has to prove that these structures do not negatively impact the other management priorities on the Missouri River. In closing, this is a good bill, and it is necessary to advance the important flood control projects and ensure our inland waterways remain reliable and efficient options for transporting goods. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for S. 3021. Mr. D
EFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. D
INGELL ). Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 3021, America’s Water In-frastructure Act of 2018. Every Member in this House should be able to support it. It is how Congress should work, and it is what the American people expect. Overall, the bill would authorize $6.1 billion in Federal funds for the Army Corps of Engineers to carry out new and existing projects critical to our Nation’s economy, environment, public health, and safety, including the Great Lakes region. This legislation also includes the Drinking Water Systems Improvement Act, which the Energy and Commerce Committee approved last year, in bi-partisan fashion. These provisions will improve drinking water systems and authorize $4.4 billion for the State Drinking Water Revolving Loan Fund Program, which will provide much- needed Federal financing for States and utilities to strengthen drinking water infrastructure. Everybody remembers Flint. Now we have PFAS. It is important that every American be able to trust the water they are drinking. This is why I am proud that this bill includes important provisions from legislation I intro-duced that would increase drinking water notifications and make con-sumer confidence reports on drinking water easier for every American to un-derstand. It is an essential part of our response to drinking water crises in this country. We have a crisis of confidence in our systems, and consumers deserve clear and immediate notifications and trans-parency when it comes to the quality of the water they are drinking. By re-quiring large water systems to provide consumer confidence reports bian-nually, the American people will have more frequent reports on water qual-ity, which will help identify and miti-gate risks sooner. With 90 percent of Americans receiv-ing their drinking water from a public drinking water system, it is our collec-tive responsibility to provide strong funding authorizations for modernizing drinking water systems, and we must continue to find effective ways to keep the public informed. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. D
ENHAM ). Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of America’s Water Infrastruc-ture Act. This bill revitalizes our wa-terways, bolsters flood protection, and ensures our channels and harbors can supply America and the world with U.S. goods. Most importantly, this bill includes my New WATER Act, a provision that will help us to build new water storage in California. The last time we built anything of substance in California for water stor-age was 1979. We have waited 50 years— 50 years—because we don’t have Fed-eral financing and Federal authoriza-tion. Finally, under this bill, the New WATER Act will set up a bank for fi-nancing for these water storage projects, and we can finally get some of these big reservoirs under way: Shasta, raising Shasta; building Sites Res-ervoir, which has been studied for dec-ades; building Los Vaqueros; building Temperance Flat. It is time to build water storage in California. We need to be solving our own problems, and the New WATER Act helps us with that financing. Below-ground water storage projects, water recycling, and desalination projects are also eligible. We want to look at all water in Cali-fornia, but this allows us a Federal fi-nancing plan to match State and local dollars as well. Also, I included the lower San Joa-quin County Army Corps chief’s report in this bill to enhance flood protection for more than 50,000 valley residents in San Joaquin County. This will reduce annual property damage and enhance security at 262 critical infrastructure sites, including French Camp. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from California an addi-tional 15 seconds. Mr. DENHAM. French Camp will be the Army Corps’ first VA project, building a megaclinic for our veterans

in our local community right in this area in between Lathrop and Manteca. We look at revitalizing America’s in-frastructure. This is a monumental step forward in America’s water infra-structure, and I ask my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. D
EFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Massa-chusetts (Mr. K
ENNEDY ). (Mr. KENNEDY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the bill before us, S. 3021; and spe-cifically, Mr. Speaker, the Fair Rate-payer Accountability, Transparency, and Efficiency Standards Act written into title III, culminating more than 4 years of work on this issue. In 2014, due to an unintended loop-hole in the Federal Power Act, my con-stituents were locked out of chal-lenging a nearly $2 billion rate in-crease, because at the time the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission was deadlocked 2 to 2 on whether to ap-prove or deny the change. With this bill before us today, we can close that loophole and ensure that no ratepayer suffers the same consequence that continues to threaten the bank accounts and pocketbooks of my con-stituents. It is especially important today given that the commission cur-rently has only four sitting commis-sioners. While this is not the bill that I first introduced more than 3 years ago and it is not the one that the House unani-mously passed each of the last two Congresses, it is a compromise with our Senate colleagues and is an impor-tant step in the right direction. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the bill before us, H.R. S. 2031. Specifically I rise in support of the Fair Ratepayer Accountability, Transparency, and Efficiency Standards Act, written into Title III, culminating more than four years of work on this issue. As my colleagues have heard time and time again, my constituents in New England pay among the highest retail electric rates across the country. And in 2014, due to an unin-tended loophole in the Federal Power Act, my constituents were locked out of challenging a nearly $2 billion rate increase because at the time, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commis-sion was deadlocked two-to-two on whether to approve or deny the change. As written, the Federal Power Act allows for rate changes to take effect by operation of law if FERC fails to act within the statutory 60-day time period. Due to a deadlock in 2014, no ac-tion was taken. And as we have since learned, the Federal Power Act only allows for appeals of official FERC Actions, not rates that take ef-fect by operation of law, including deadlocks like the one that left my constituents voiceless. With this bill before us today, we can ensure no ratepayer suffers the same consequence. It is especially important now given the current status of the Commission with only 4 sitting commissioners. This bill represents a compromise with my Senate colleagues. The bill states that any rates that take effect by operation of law, due to a deadlock or a Commission that lacks suf-ficient members for a quorum, are appealable both at FERC and in the courts. It is intended to ensure that FERC and the courts consider the merits of a rate change and whether such a change is just and reasonable as required by the Federal Power Act. It would not allow FERC or the courts to simply dismiss a chal-lenge because FERC failed to issue an order. Additionally, I would like to highlight two concerns with this language and make clear congressional intent in the process. First, this bill would not apply to rates that the Commis-sion either chooses, or inadvertently allows, to take effect upon expiration of the statutory clock. It has been my understanding and my experience that FERC can and will continue to address all rate filings with the due diligence and scrutiny each deserves, and I hope FERC will continue to do so even on the most con-tentious of cases. I expect FERC will abide by the requirements of this legislation and not take advantage of any loophole to avoid a contentious filing. Second, while unusual, this bill would re-quire each of the sitting commissioners to ex-plain in writing their view on the rate change. To my knowledge, there is no other similar re-quirement in any part of the Federal Power Act or Natural Gas Act. However, it is my be-lief that if and when the time comes to ad-dress a deadlock, commissioners will use the opportunity to explain their views for purposes of transparency and good government. While this is not the bill I first introduced more than three years ago, the one that passed the House unanimously in each of the last two Congresses, it is a good compromise and a significant step in the right direction. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. W
OODALL ), a hardworking member of the House Transportation and Infra-structure Committee and a member of the Rules Committee. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership on the committee. Mr. Speaker, this is probably the most important bill that most mem-bers of the United States of America citizenry will never have heard of. When I go back home, folks ask me to make smart and prudent invest-ments that will make a difference in people’s lives. They ask me to repeal unnecessary regulations that stand in the way of making those improve-ments. They ask me to pay for those things rather than passing the bill on to our kids and our grandkids. The bill that the chairman and the ranking member have brought before us today fulfills every single one of those challenges. In my district, Mr. Speaker, we are talking about preserving water quality in Lake Lanier, the sole water source for most of the metro Atlanta area. We are talking about funding the Savan-nah Harbor Expansion Project, a project of economic significance for the entire southeastern United States. We are talking about offering local offi-cials the financing tools they need to bring projects to bear faster and cheap-er than ever before. Mr. Speaker, median household in-come has never been higher. Small business optimism has never been high-er. Unemployment is at its lowest point in decades. Job openings are at a record high. Manufacturing jobs are at a record high. This does not happen by accident. This happens when you cre-ate an environment in which success can breed. I want to thank the ranking member from Oregon. I particularly want to thank my chairman from Pennsyl-vania. Chairman SHUSTER said he was going to bring three bills to the floor. He said we are going to get back in the business of doing the people’s business, not sometimes but always; and here, at the end of his third term as chairman, we are bringing our third WRDA bill to the floor. Mr. D
EFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michi-gan (Mr. M
ITCHELL ), my good friend and another hardworking member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the America’s Water Infrastructure Act, a critical piece of legislation that authorizes water infrastructure projects across our Nation. One particular project is near and dear to my heart, critical to the State of Michigan and our national economy and security: the Soo Locks. This lock is the only waterway, the only connec-tion between Lake Superior and the rest of the Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence Seaway. Right now, that one lock accommo-dates almost all of the shipping of iron ore and many other goods from Min-nesota through the Great Lakes. If that lock fails, the damage is instanta-neous: economic damage—11 million people would lose their jobs within the first 90 days—and risks our national se-curity. That is why construction of a second lock is so vital. This upgrade was au-thorized over 30 years ago. I guess it shouldn’t surprise us that it has lan-guished a bit. We now have bipartisan support, both sides of the aisle sup-porting the need to get this lock, a sec-ond large lock, built. We have recogni-tion by the administration that this lock is critical for our economy and our national security. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill as the next step in building the 1,200-foot lock at the Soo Locks so we can ensure that our national security and our economy is not devastated by the failure of one lock. Mr. D

b1345 Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, safe drink-ing water for our families is something that we all should agree on, and this bill delivers on that promise. It makes certain that communities like Parch-ment, in my district, are able to deal with the PFAS contamination issue. In Parchment, thanks to the proactive efforts of the State of Michi-gan, we discovered PFAS in the water, and we immediately sprang into action to solve the problem in the short term—local, State, and Federal folks all working in tandem to fix the prob-lem. Specifically, the bill does that by increasing authorization for the Drink-ing Water State Revolving Fund. It critically works to modernize our aging water infrastructure by pro-viding more resources. Drinking water quality remains high across the country, but improvements can and must be made now. This bipar-tisan bill is yet a very important step forward. I look forward to supporting it and would urge all of my colleagues on both sides to do the same. I want to thank Chairman S
HUSTER  for getting this bill to the floor, and I look forward to ultimately getting it to the President for his signature. Mr. D
EFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. M
CMORRIS ROD-
GERS ), our conference chair. Mrs. M
CMORRIS RODGERS. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership and yielding the time. Today, I am proud to stand in sup-port of the Water Resources Develop-ment Act. I appreciate all the work that has been done to help strengthen our Nation’s ports, dams, and water-ways. In this legislation, we are keep-ing our promise to the American people to rebuild our Nation’s infrastructure. I was proud to offer two significant provisions to help the people of eastern Washington. The first is the Port of Whitman Economic Expansion Act. This will allow the Port of Whitman to purchase land from the Army Corps of Engineers to continue their mission of economic development in our region. The other provision is from bipartisan legislation that passed this House ear-lier titled the Hydropower Moderniza-tion Act of 2017. In Washington State, hydropower makes up nearly 70 percent of our elec-tricity, and it is the Nation’s largest source of clean, renewable, reliable, and affordable energy. We have some of the lowest electricity costs in the country because of clean hydropower, but there is still room for tremendous potential to increase the production of renewable energy as hydropower, but FERC doesn’t incentivize investing in dams. Capital intensive projects like updat-ing turbines or improving fish ladders are only included in the lifespan of a dam’s license during the relicensing window. My provision will require FERC to include all protection, mitiga-tion, and enhancement measures dur-ing the relicensing process. I appreciate Chairman SHUSTER and Chairman W
ALDEN and the staff for all of their work. Mr. D
EFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. B
UCSHON ). Mr. BUCSHON. Madam Speaker, un-necessary government red tape is pre-venting us from taking advantage of clean, renewable hydropower genera-tion at existing nonpowered dams. The current regulatory process simply takes too long, taking up to a decade for the project to be approved. We can change this by supporting America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018, which includes the Promoting Hy-dropower Development at Existing Nonpowered Dams Act, which I au-thored. This legislation instructs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commis-sion, FERC, to create an expedited per-mitting process that will result in a final decision on an application in 2 years or less. The legislation also requires FERC, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Department of the Interior to de-velop a list of existing nonpowered dams that have the greatest potential for hydropower development. Stream-lining the permitting process will incentivize investments in clean hydro-power development and help modernize our existing infrastructure. I ask my colleagues to join me today in supporting this legislation. Mr. D
EFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Again, I want to particularly con-gratulate the chairman on his accom-plishment of resuscitating regular WRDA reauthorizations, and this, of course, will be the last time in which he will be on the floor on this par-ticular issue. I would also like to thank the staff, Ryan Seiger, Mike Brain; from Rep-resentative N
APOLITANO ’s office, Joe Sheehy; and a special thanks to legisla-tive counsel, whose staff tells me was absolutely fabulous on this, Kakuti Lin. And then, of course, I believe the chairman will thank his staff, but I would also extend thanks to them but not name them individually if he is going to do that. Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-ance of my time. Mr. SHUSTER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Madam Speaker, I thank my partner in this, Ranking Member D
EFAZIO, for his efforts on the bill, but also Ranking Member N
APOLITANO and Sub-committee Chair G
ARRET GRAVES for their great work on this bill. I thank the entire Republican staff on the Transportation and Infrastruc-ture Committee. The following staff spent hours working on behalf of the Members of Congress to produce this final product: Ian Bennitt, Elizabeth Fox, John Pawlow, Victor Sarmiento, Peter Como, Geoff Gosselin, Fred Miller, Chris Vieson, Kathy Dedrick, Ryann Seiger, Joe Sheehy, Alex Burkett, Mike Brian, Richard Russell, Brian Clifford, Lizzy Oslen, Pauline Thorndick, Andy Hardy, Craig Thomas, Marry Francis Repko. John Drake, Andrew Rogers, Chris Baysinger, Mary Martin, Jerry Couri, Mike Bloomquist, Ryan Long, Karen Christian, Brandon Mooney, Annelise Rickerts, Jackie Cohen, Rick Kessler, Jean Fruci, Kakuti Lin, Allison Hartwich, Geoff Antell, Kiel Weaver, Cindy Herrle. Madam Speaker, I thank the Demo-cratic staff for their partnership in crafting this legislation and now pass-ing on the floor, and, hopefully, ulti-mately, we get it to the President’s desk and signed into law. Thanks to all the folks on the other side of the aisle, the staff, for their willingness and hard work and the effort they put into it. I want to point out, though, Chris Vieson and Geoff Gosselin, the staff di-rector and deputy staff director, for their great work and leadership on the committee. But also the Water Re-sources staff, Ian Bennitt, Jon Pawlow, Elizabeth Fox, Victor Sarmiento, and Peter Como for their efforts and long hours that I know they took to put this all together. And finally, I would just like to say, passing WRDA is personally very grati-fying to me. When I became chairman, we had not passed a WRDA bill in 7 years. Prior to that, for over 20 years, WRDA bills were passed every Con-gress. It was regular order. Today, we will pass the third WRDA bill in three Congresses, and I want to thank the leadership on both sides of the aisle for working with us and helping us to get it to the floor. I thank all of my colleagues in the House. As I think we maybe said ear-lier, when we passed it out of the House, it was 408–2, overwhelmingly. And again, I can’t thank my colleagues enough for working with me and help-ing to bring back regular order to WRDA. I ask all my colleagues to support this bill, and let’s move on to the next bill. Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-ance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. FOXX). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Penn-sylvania (Mr. S
HUSTER ) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 3021, as amended. The question was taken; and (two- thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ‘‘An Act to provide for im-provements to the rivers and harbors of the United States, to provide for the conservation and development of water and related resources, to provide for water pollution control activities, and for other purposes.’’.

GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speak-er, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to re-vise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 6227, the bill now under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speak-er, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, this bipartisan Na-tional Quantum Initiative Act is co-sponsored by House Science, Space, and Technology Committee Ranking Mem-ber E
DDIE BERNICE JOHNSON , as well as 24 other committee members. The bill has earned widespread support and was unanimously approved by the com-mittee on June 27. Before I explain what the bill does, I would like to explain why it matters so much. In our lifetime, we have seen remark-able advances in the size and speed of our computers. Most of us carry phones in our pockets that are several thou-sand times more powerful than all the combined computing power available to NASA during the Apollo missions. Yet, as impressive as these advances have been, quantum computing has the power to affect an even more dramatic transformation of our society and worldwide technology. Computers today rely on tiny on-off switches within a processing chip. Technological advances have made pos-sible supercomputers that can perform series of on-off operations at aston-ishing speeds. But classical computing technology is nearing its limits. Each switch can only operate in one of two positions, off or on, zero or one. Quantum computing is different. Rather than on-off switches, quantum computers rely on qubits. These are subatomic particles that can be both on and off at the same time. This en-ables quantum computers to perform complex calculations at speeds that are potentially millions of times faster than today’s most advanced supercom-puters. Countries that harness the power of quantum computing will be able to rev-olutionize cybersecurity, healthcare, communications, financial services, and transportation, just to name a few of the industries. The flip side of this is that quantum computing will make traditional IT se-curity programs obsolete. The nation that develops quantum communica-tions technology first may be able to decode, in a matter of seconds, other countries’ sensitive national security information, proprietary technologies, and personal information. Other countries are investing billions of dollars in new research facilities and equipment for quantum computing. China has publicly stated a national goal of surpassing the U.S. during the next decade. That is why it is impera-tive that we act now to develop a na-tional quantum strategy and preserve America’s dominance in the scientific world. The National Quantum Initiative Act achieves this by creating a 10-year Fed-eral program to accelerate quantum re-search and development in the United States. The bill leverages the expertise and resources of U.S. industry, aca-demia, and government to move quan-tum information science to the next level of research and development. The legislation enables a National Quantum Coordination Office within the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. This office will oversee interagency coordination and strategic planning, serve as a central point of contact for stakeholders, con-duct research, and promote commer-cialization of Federal research by the private sector. The bill also supports basic research, education, and standards development at the National Institute of Standards

and Technology, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of En-ergy. Madam Speaker, $225 million a year of these agencies’ baseline funding will now be directed to new quantum re-search centers and laboratory research. Their activities will address funda-mental research gaps, create a stronger workforce, and develop revolutionary knowledge and transformative innova-tions to give U.S. companies and work-ers an enduring competitive advantage. The bill ensures that U.S. high-tech companies, which are investing heavily in quantum research, and a surge of quantum technology startups will con-tribute their knowledge and resources to a national effort. H.R. 6227 was developed with input from industry, academia, national lab-oratories, Federal agencies, and the ad-ministration. It was an open and bipar-tisan process. b1400 The input of those stakeholders has yielded a strong consensus bill. Additionally, Senator T
HUNE and Senator N
ELSON , the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Com-merce Committee, have introduced a companion bill in the Senate. With bi-partisan, bicameral support and the backing of the administration, I be-lieve this bill could become law by the end of the year. Let’s take action to spur America’s quantum development. I urge my col-leagues to support this bill, and I re-serve the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6227, the National Quantum Initia-tive Act. I want to take a moment to thank Chairman S
MITH for introducing this good legislation, of which I am a proud original cosponsor. I also want to ex-press my appreciation for the delibera-tive, bipartisan process by which this bill was developed over the past year. H.R. 6227 is the product of engage-ment with key stakeholders in indus-try, academia, and the Federal Govern-ment. The Science, Space, and Technology Committee held a hearing on quantum technology last October. At that hear-ing, we heard from agency, university, and industry representatives about the recent breakthroughs in quantum sens-ing, quantum communication, and quantum computing. We also heard about the priorities for Federal invest-ment in quantum research and the need for a strategic and coordinated approach going forward. In addition to the hearing, com-mittee staff held numerous bipartisan meetings and roundtables to inform the development of this bill. Quantum information science and technology promises to revolutionize the way we solve problems. Many be-lieve that quantum computing tech-nology has the potential to accelerate progress on some of the most pressing challenges, including how to address climate change and understand com-plex diseases like cancer. While it is difficult to predict how far-ranging the societal and economic impacts of quantum computing will be, recent breakthroughs demonstrate that we are rapidly clearing the nec-essary engineering hurdles. It is truly an exciting time for this bill and for the wide range of innovators who are planning to take advantage of these new breakthrough capabilities. The race is on to build the world’s first quantum computer capable of solving problems that have long eluded conventional computers. Not unlike the space race in the 1960s, the stakes in today’s quantum race are high. Global leadership in quantum com-puting brings with it a military and in-telligence edge, as well as a competi-tive advantage in what many expect to be a massive industry in decades to come. At this time, when China, Europe, and Russia are investing heavily in quantum research and technology de-velopment, it is imperative that we do everything we can to maintain our global standing as the leader in this area. We must invest more in research. We need to ensure that we are edu-cating and training the next genera-tion of top quantum scientists and en-gineers. And we should do more to en-courage partnerships between aca-demia, industry, and government. The National Quantum Initiative Act will set us on the right path. H.R. 6227 directs the President to establish a 10- year National Quantum Initiative Pro-gram, with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Na-tional Science Foundation, and the De-partment of Energy playing lead roles. Through the establishment of a na-tional coordination office, an outside advisory committee, and an inter-agency working group, the program will take an integrated government ap-proach to accelerating progress in quantum research and development. I want to express my appreciation for the deliberative, bipartisan process by which we developed this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. E
DDIE B
ERNICE JOHNSON ) for those nice com-ments. And she is right, this was a very bipartisan effort and a very bipartisan bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. W
EBER ), who is also the chairman of the Energy Subcommittee of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6227, the Na-tional Quantum Initiative Act. H.R. 6227 coordinates a Federal pro-gram to accelerate quantum research and development for the economic and national security of the United States. Quantum technology is a field posi-tioned to fundamentally change the way we move and process data. Theo-retically, quantum computing could allow for the solutions to exponentially large problems, things that cannot be accomplished by even the fastest super-computers today. It could allow us, Mr. Speaker, to vis-ualize the structures of complex chemi-cals and materials, to model highly de-tailed flows of potential mass evacu-ations with precise accuracy—with hurricanes abounding today, that is very, very important for us—and to quantify subatomic interactions on the cutting edge of nuclear research. Quantum computing may also have profound implications for cybersecu-rity technology. And the gentlewoman from Texas alluded to this: Should China and Russia beat us to achieving quantum encryption, our current secu-rity encryption measures would be ren-dered obsolete. You heard Chairman SMITH, in his remarks, say that we could possibly decode their encryptions in a matter of seconds, if not minutes. It is absolutely imperative, Mr. Speaker, that the U.S. maintain its leadership in this field. In order to achieve this kind of revolutionary im-provement in technology, we need foundational knowledge in the ad-vanced computing and materials science required to construct those quantum systems. The Department of Energy, the DOE, Office of Science is the leading Federal sponsor of basic research in the phys-ical sciences and robust quantum tech-nology research. At Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, the National Energy Re-search Scientific Computing Center, NERSC, allows scientists to run sim-ulations of quantum architectures. At Argonne National Laboratory’s Center for Nanoscale Materials, re-searchers study atomic-scale materials in order to engineer the characteristics of quantum information systems; and at Fermi National Accelerator Labora-tory, scientists are applying their expe-rience in high-energy physics to the study of quantum materials. Earlier this year, I was privileged to invite several of my colleagues to join me on a visit to Argonne and Fermi labs, and we had the privilege of speak-ing with those very scientists con-ducting this groundbreaking research. It really is breathtaking and really is ground-shattering, if you ask me, in what it is going to do for science. Support for basic research in com-puter science and for computational partnerships between industry, aca-demia, and the national labs is abso-lutely necessary to develop the tech-nology needed for future commercial quantum systems. For these reasons, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 6227. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. L
IPINSKI ).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8233 September 13, 2018 
Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. J
OHNSON for yielding, and I thank her for her leadership on this bill. I rise in support of this bipartisan legislation that will make a significant national commitment to the field of quantum science and engineering, which is critical for our global sci-entific and technological leadership. While the benefits of quantum tech-nology may still be a ways off, there is fierce international competition in this field, most notably from China, and we can’t afford to waste any time. It is through strategic investments like this that we became the world’s economic scientific and technology leader, and we can only maintain that position through continuing significant invest-ment in cutting-edge basic research. We already know that other coun-tries are increasing their investments in quantum technology, in some cases guided by long-term strategies, and this bill will make sure that we develop a coherent strategy of our own. This bill is a bright spot in what is otherwise a long, downward trend in Federal R&D funding as a percentage of GDP. Much as today’s unbalanced budget leads to future debt problems, today’s underinvestment in R&D leads to future innovation deficits. I commend my colleagues from both parties for working together to bring this important bill to the floor, but we want to be clear that this is just a first step. We need to double down on our ef-forts and to reprioritize Federal re-search and development. I want to highlight and commend an organization that is a leader in the field of quantum information science and engineering and that made signifi-cant contributions to this bill. The Chicago Quantum Exchange is a part-nership between the University of Chi-cago, Argonne National Laboratory, and Fermi National Accelerator Lab-oratory. I want to thank Chairman W
EBER for bringing the Science, Space, and Tech-nology Committee’s Subcommittee on Energy out to Argonne and Fermi ear-lier this year. He spoke about some of the great work that they are doing there. The Chicago Quantum Exchange was created to develop and grow inter-disciplinary collaboration for the ex-ploration and development of new quantum-enabled technologies and to help educate a new generation of quan-tum information scientists and engi-neers. Partnership with the private sector is also an important element of the ex-change. The Chicago Quantum Ex-change serves as both an excellent model for the Multidisciplinary Cen-ters for Quantum Research and Edu-cation envisioned in this bill and for what the future of R&D and quantum information science will look like. Finally, I want to thank Chairman S
MITH for his leadership on this bill and for working with us to make this a good, bipartisan piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. ROHRABACHER ), who has been a longtime and active member of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, and also the former vice chairman of the committee. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6227, the Na-tional Quantum Initiative Act. This act will move us toward a new millen-nium of computing. Computers used to be big, really large, and the ways to make them more powerful was thought to be by making them bigger and bigger. Enor-mous mainframes filled entire office floors. Well, after some very significant dis-coveries and development in the tech-nological arena, we advanced this tech-nology, making computers smaller, lighter, and more capable so we could send, for example, astronauts to the Moon. That led to more and more im-provements, and now computers are in cars, are in our coffee machines and ev-erything else that we do. They have gotten so small that most of us can carry them around and, perhaps, right now, are carrying them around in our pocket. At this point now, we stand on the cusp of another giant leap forward for mankind, the quantum leap. By har-nessing the natural properties of atom-ic and subatomic particles, we can de-velop the capabilities in the next dec-ade that are far more capable than the systems that we marvel about today. This act will coordinate our Federal activity, reduce waste and redundancy, and ensure that our efforts are stra-tegic. This will keep us in advance, and way in advance, of our adversaries around the globe and ensure our secu-rity and our prosperity. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this act and supporting a better future for America and the world. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, so I continue to re-serve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H
ULTGREN ), who is one of the few members of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee to actually be a member of three subcommittees. He is a member of the Energy Sub-committee, the Research and Tech-nology Subcommittee, and the Space Subcommittee, and we appreciate his active service on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman S
MITH. I appreciate all of his hard work and success. And I also want to thank Ranking Member J
OHNSON for her bipartisan work on this legislation, as well as her work on H.R. 589 that we will be getting over the finish line a little bit later in this series. b1415 Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in the way that we are able to ask questions and comb through data when doing complex com-putational problems. Like many things we do at the Office of Science, this en-deavor requires time, effort, and com-mitment. Quantum computing was first theo-rized in the 1980s with researchers such as Richard Feynman, the physicist in my district I now know very well. While every particle physicist draws Feynman diagrams to explain the interaction of subatomic particles, his later work in this field may have just as lasting an impact that he has had on the field. I am proud to represent Fermilab in my district with the Feynman Com-puting Center on campus, and Fermilab is also a partner in the Chicago Quan-tum Exchange with Argonne, the Uni-versity of Chicago, and other partners to further develop quantum systems outside of just computing. I look forward to the advancements this research will provide, but, more importantly, the people we will be able to help. We are getting to the point where we can actually use the reams of data we first got out of our genome project, and our ability to better use this and other data will help us find more targeted cures and develop better treatments. Similar to what we are doing in this legislation, I also want to thank the chairman and ranking member for their efforts on the Department of En-ergy Research and Innovation Act. This legislation contains a number of sections from legislation I introduced to improve the ability of our national labs to get ideas out of the lab and into the private sector. The increased flexibility this legisla-tion gives to the labs will allow them to better work with universities and the private sector when there are capa-bilities that only exist in our labs. These labs have been a passion of mine, with the ability to see two of them up close in Illinois. I have seen the innovation engine they can be, not just for our Nation, but for local and regional economies. It is vital that we continue to sup-port our laboratories, which host more than 32,000 researchers from across the Nation, touching nearly, if not every, university in the United States. This legislation gives the Office of Science clear direction on their mis-sion, and I am pleased that we could work with the Senate to get this to the President’s desk after this vote series. Again, I thank the chairman for yielding. I urge passage of these impor-tant bills. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time. I urge support of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no other requests for time either,

DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY RESEARCH AND INNOVATION ACT Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 589) to establish Department of Energy policy for science and energy research and development programs, and reform National Laboratory man-agement and technology transfer pro-grams, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the Senate amendment is as follows: Senate amendment: 
Strike title IV. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. S
MITH) and the gentle-woman from Texas (Ms. E
DDIE BERNICE  J

GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-bers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their re-marks and to include extraneous mate-rials on H.R. 589, the bill now under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 589, the Depart-ment of Energy Research and Innova-tion Act, is the product of more than 4 years of work by the Science Com-mittee to advance basic research in science and technology and set clear science priorities for the Department of Energy. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my col-leagues on the Science Committee who have sponsored this legislation with me, particularly Ranking Member E
DDIE BERNICE JOHNSON , Vice Chair-man F
RANK LUCAS , Energy Sub-committee Chairman R
ANDY WEBER , Energy Subcommittee Vice Chairman S
TEVE KNIGHT , and Energy Sub-committee members D
ANA ROHR-
ABACHER , M OBROOKS , N EAL DUNN, R
ANDY HULTGREN , MARC VEASEY , ZOE L
OFGREN , D ANLIPINSKI , and P AUL T
ONKO , as well as full committee mem-bers B
ARBARA COMSTOCK , BRIAN BABIN, ANDY BIGGS, CLAYHIGGINS , ELIZABETH  E
STY, and E DPERLMUTTER . Six standalone Science Committee energy research bills from last Con-gress are included in this legislation. The DOE Research and Innovation Act prioritizes critical basic research and science at the DOE national labs. It provides the first comprehensive au-thorization for Office of Science pro-grams, which conduct and support more than $6 billion in research each year. This legislation also requires DOE to coordinate research across the Depart-ment. It provides private industry with increased access to the unique user fa-cilities and capabilities of the national labs that will help to develop advanced technologies for the next generation. Title I of H.R. 589 improves the tech-nology transfer process between DOE and private industry. The innovative early stage research performed at the national labs can have great value to the private sector. While the labs consistently develop ideas and technology that have com-mercial potential, Federal red tape and bureaucracy discourage the coopera-tion needed for the private sector to take technologies to market. Title I enables national lab directors to better partner with industry and en-sure that the United States can remain a world leader in science and tech-nology. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois, Representative R
ANDY  H
ULTGREN , and the gentleman from Colorado, Representative E
DPERL-
MUTTER , for their initiative on this issue and for sponsoring similar legis-lation in the last Congress to advance these important reforms at our na-tional labs. Title II of the legislation requires DOE to better manage and coordinate research efforts at the Department of Energy. This title also requires DOE to pro-vide a regular analysis of science and technology activities within the De-partment. This will identify key areas for collaboration across science and ap-plied research programs, and allow the Secretary to identify programs that cost too much and could be better un-dertaken by the private sector. Title III establishes priorities and provides statutory direction for the basic research programs within the DOE’s Office of Science. This includes research and basic energy sciences, bio-logical and environmental research, high-performance computing, nuclear physics, high-energy physics, and fu-sion energy science. These basic research programs are central to the mission of the Depart-ment. Investment in this research can lead to new scientific discoveries that will maintain U.S. leadership in tech-nology and innovation. This title also authorizes basic re-search programs in solar fuels, elec-tricity storage, exascale computing, and low-dose radiation. The House has previously passed Science Committee legislation by En-ergy Subcommittee Vice Chairman KNIGHT and subcommittee member H
ULTGREN to authorize these four key basic research programs. H.R. 589 represents a bipartisan, bi-cameral agreement to modernize and increase the productivity of the DOE national lab system, streamline DOE research programs, and prioritize the basic scientific research that will maintain American leadership in science. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the bal-ance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to sup-port the final passage of H.R. 589, the Department of Energy Research and Innovation Act, for which I am pleased to be a cosponsor. The bill before us today is a result of constructive negotiations with our ma-jority and with our colleagues in the Senate over the last 2 years. I am also pleased to note that many of the provi-sions in this bill actually were pro-posed first in the version of the Amer-ica COMPETES Reauthorization Act, and that was sponsored by every Demo-cratic member of the committee last Congress. This bill includes what would be the first comprehensive authorization of the DOE Office of Science, which is the largest supporter of physical sciences research in the country. This is a $6.6 billion office that manages 10 of our national laboratories, often called the crown jewels of our national research infrastructure. Yet, thus far, unlike NSF, NASA, and nearly every other major scientific re-search agency stewarded by the Fed-eral Government, the Office of Science has not received the statutory guid-ance and support that its capabilities and mission warrant. So passing this portion of the bill into law alone would be a big step in the right direction. The bill also includes a number of important technology transfer provi-sions that previously passed the House as part of a bipartisan bill that I and many of my colleagues on the com-mittee cosponsored. In addition, it would provide the first authorization of the promising Innova-tion Hub model for energy research, and it would enable greater private sec-tor management of ARPA-E. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman S
MITH and his staff for work-ing closely with us and our Senate counterparts to find common ground in each of these areas, as I believe they will be critical to ensuring our Na-tion’s competitiveness and our clean energy future. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the bal-ance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. W
EBER ), who is the chair-man of the Energy Subcommittee of the Science Committee.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8235 September 13, 2018 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman S
MITH for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 589, the Department of Energy Re-search and Innovation Act. H.R. 589 provides policy direction to the Department of Energy on basic science research and coordination, and implements important reforms to DOE national laboratory management that will modernize the research pipeline. This legislation gives Congress the opportunity to enact energy research and development policy that prioritizes critical programs at the Department of Energy. From advanced scientific com-puting to nuclear physics to fusion en-ergy science, focusing on basic research at our national labs provides the best opportunity for U.S. economic growth and technology innovation. Significant investments, Mr. Speak-er, in basic science research by foreign countries like China, as has been al-luded to, threatens America’s global standing as the leader in scientific knowledge. To maintain our competi-tive advantage as a world leader in science, we must continue to support the research and research infrastruc-ture that will lead to the next genera-tion of energy technologies. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chair-man S
MITH and Ranking Member J OHN-
SON and many of my Science Com-mittee colleagues for cosponsoring this very important legislation. I am grate-ful for the opportunity to work with members of this committee to guide re-search that will help America compete around the world and be the leader around the world. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-leagues to join me in supporting H.R. 589. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. M
ARSHALL ), who is the vice chairman of the Research and Technology Subcommittee of the Science Committee. Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 589, the De-partment of Energy Research and Inno-vation Act, sponsored by my friend and the chairman of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, Represent-ative S
MITH. This bipartisan bill advances basic research and sets explicit science prior-ities for the Department of Energy, which is critical for our future innova-tion. H.R. 589 also authorizes the core pro-gram in my bill, the Low-Dose Radi-ation Research Act, which unani-mously passed the House earlier this year. The provision directs the Department of Energy to carry out a research pro-gram on low-dose radiation, which will increase our understanding of the health effects low doses have on bio-logical systems. Research has consistently shown us the adverse health effects associated with high doses of radiation, but we are a long way from accurately assessing the effects of low doses of radiation. As a product of industrial activities, medical procedures, and naturally oc-curring systems, humans are exposed to low doses of radiation every day, and it is imperative we can accurately assess this risk. There is broad consensus among the radiobiology community that more re-search is necessary for Federal agen-cies, physicians, and related experts to advance the use of radiation tech-nologies. We have invaluable diag-nostic tools today, such as CT scans, which emit low doses of radiation. It is vital physicians are able to inform pa-tients of the health risks associated with these types of imaging processes. As a physician in my home State of Kansas, I certainly have firsthand un-derstanding of the crucial importance of verified research and ensuring the best medical outcomes for our patients. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. b1430 Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have further speakers, but I will yield to the ranking member if she has any speakers. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time. I support passage, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. KNIGHT ), who is the vice chairman of the Energy Subcommittee of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. Mr. KNIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Department of Energy Research and Innovation Act. This bill makes important investments in science and technology research to en-sure the United States protects its edge in novel, efficient, and commer-cially viable energy production. H.R. 589 makes needed reforms to the national laboratories’ relationship with the private sector to streamline the transfer of commercially ready technologies to American businesses. This will allow the benefits of public investment and critical research to be passed on to American entrepreneurs with greater speed and reinforced eco-nomic growth and job creation. In addition, this bill directs the De-partment of Energy to establish energy innovation hubs to pull together and create efficiencies in key scientific areas across basic and applied research programs. This bill also includes au-thorization of the solar fuels initiative, incorporating the text of my bill last Congress, the Solar Fuels Innovation Act. This provision builds on research that is now being undertaken up and down the coast of California, from Berkeley to Caltech, to produce fuels from sunlight. The solar fuel process, also known as artificial photosyn-thesis, converts sunlight into energy to create a range of storable chemical fuels, overcoming the biggest obstacle to maximizing the benefits of renew-able technologies. Basic research and artificial photo-synthesis and related efforts could lead to a solar fuel system that consolidates solar power and energy storage in a co-hesive process. This would transform the economy in California and the rest of the Nation. The solar fuels initiative would solve the critical challenge posed by wasted renewable energy and enlarge incentives to invest in new solar businesses. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chair-man SMITH and my colleagues who have helped me advance this bill for their foresight in identifying research initiatives that promise new ap-proaches to energy technology that will be good for our economy and our environment. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for his comments and also for his ini-tiatives on the subject of energy in so many ways. Several other bills that we are considering are a result of that ini-tiative. Mr. Speaker, I have no other requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. F
RANCIS ROONEY of Florida). The ques-tion is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. S
MITH) that the House suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill, H.R. 589. The question was taken; and (two- thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the Senate amendment was concurred in. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH8238 September 13, 2018 
as well as Ranking Member J OHNSON  and Chairman S
MITH for cosponsoring this important legislation, and for their years of leadership in advocating for nuclear energy research and devel-opment. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the op-portunity to work alongside my Senate counterparts to prioritize fundamental research that will support nuclear in-novation and keep America safe, inde-pendent, and most importantly, glob-ally competitive. I also want to thank my colleagues on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee who have worked alongside of me with advancing this legislation. The Nuclear Energy Innovation Ca-pabilities Act, which I introduced in the 114th Congress and the 115th Con-gress, provides updated statutory di-rection to the Department of Energy’s nuclear research activities to ensure that fundamental research is prioritized and precious resources are not wasted. Mr. Speaker, this bill lays out a clear set of parameters and a definite timeline for DOE to complete an ad-vanced research reactor facility, which is a crucial part of ensuring innovative materials and nuclear fuels R&D can take place right here in the United States instead of overseas. While modeling and simulation can accelerate R&D, nuclear energy re-search must be validated through di-rect experimentation in the lab. This type of research requires access to a source of fast neutrons, and today, these are only available for civilian re-search in Russia. The versatile neutron source author-ized in this bill will provide the United States with this vital capability. S. 97 also directs DOE to partner with indus-try to construct and operate reactor prototypes at DOE national labs. Mr. Speaker, our national labs pro-vide a very unique environment that safely allows for creative testing and development for advanced nuclear technology without a burdensome reg-ulatory process that can slow progress to a crawl. In order to maintain our nuclear capabilities, the United States must continue developing cutting-edge technology right here at home. Without the direction provided in this bill, Mr. Speaker, we will continue to rely on foreign research. We will fall further and further behind. We will lose the ability to develop innovative nu-clear technology and be left importing next-generation reactor designs from overseas. This is unacceptable. S. 97 will maintain America’s ability to influence security and proliferation standards around the world as more de-veloping nations look to nuclear en-ergy to grow their economies. The language in this bill is the prod-uct of many Science, Space, and Tech-nology Committee engagements with relevant stakeholders and nuclear re-search and development. Mr. Speaker, last Congress this lan-guage passed the House three times as a standalone bill, with the House amendment to S. 2012 and in the NDAA, each with overwhelming bipar-tisan support. This language also has a history of strong support in the Senate. It passed as an amendment in the Senate during the 114th Congress and again as a standalone bill this Congress. S. 97 is vital to ensure that this im-portant research and development is carried out. We cannot afford to miss the economic opportunity provided by next-generation nuclear technology. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-leagues to join me in supporting S. 97, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support S. 97, the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act. It is the Senate companion to H.R. 431, which I am very pleased to cospon-sor. Today, nuclear power plays a vital role in providing our country with clean, reliable energy. I happen to be one of those who live in an area where we have nuclear energy. Looking toward the future, one of my top priorities is preventing and miti-gating the potentially devastating im-pacts of climate change. I believe that this clean energy resource can and should play a key role in our efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of our elec-tricity sector. But there currently are technical, economic, and policy chal-lenges that prevent nuclear energy from playing a larger role in enabling our clean energy future. The Nuclear Energy Innovation Ca-pabilities Act takes several positive steps to address these challenges. Im-plementing the provisions of this bill will help accelerate the development of advanced nuclear energy technologies that are safer, less expensive, more ef-ficient, and produce less waste than the current generation of nuclear reactors. I hope it will also help ensure a brighter future for the U.S. nuclear en-ergy industry. I would like to express my appreciation for the process we fol-lowed to put this bill together. Major-ity and minority staff in both the House and Senate worked closely to-gether, from engaging stakeholders, through crafting and incorporating suggested changes to the bill language. This is a great example of what we can achieve when we leave politics at the door and look for common ground to address challenges facing our Na-tion’s research enterprise. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the bal-ance of my time. Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the great gentleman from Texas (Mr. S
MITH). Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. W
EBER ) for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, S. 97, the Nuclear En-ergy Innovation Capabilities Act, di-rects the Department of Energy to en-able the American nuclear power in-dustry to conduct civilian nuclear en-ergy research and development that will advance our leadership in nuclear technology. While we are considering the Senate version of this bill today, I would like to credit the author of the original leg-islation, Energy Subcommittee Chair-man RANDY WEBER , his primary co-sponsors, and Science, Space, and Technology Committee Ranking Mem-ber E
DDIE BERNICE JOHNSON for their years of leadership on this issue. The originating Science, Space, and Technology Committee legislation was developed over 4 years of collaboration, including hearings, coordination with DOE and the Nuclear Regulatory Com-mission, and countless meetings with stakeholders. Every effort has been made to ensure this legislation will provide the resources necessary to more effectively and efficiently de-velop the next generation of nuclear power. Advanced nuclear energy technology is the best way to make reliable, safe, and emission-free electricity available throughout the modern and developing world. The legislation authorizes the research facilities and infrastructure necessary to help development of new, advanced nuclear reactors here at home, maintaining American leader-ship in the global nuclear technology sector. This technological edge allows us to better influence global nonprolifera-tion standards and prevent civilian nu-clear energy technology from being misused for weapons development over-seas. S. 97 directs DOE to develop plans for long-term research and authorizes critical infrastructure at the DOE na-tional labs. This includes leveraging DOE state-of-the-art super computers to accelerate the theoretical develop-ment of advanced reactors. The bill also authorizes construction of a research reactor at a DOE site. This research reactor will provide ac-cess to the fast neutrons necessary to develop advanced nuclear reactors. By investing in research infrastructure, DOE can maximize the impact of Fed-eral research dollars and facilitate the development of a wide variety of nu-clear technologies. Finally, S. 97 creates a reliable mech-anism for the private sector to partner with DOE labs to build DOE-certified prototype reactors at DOE sites. While the Science, Space, and Technology Committee has heard from dozens of companies with innovative reactor de-signs, the ability to move new nuclear technology to the market has been stalled by government approval and li-censing red tape. S. 97 provides an alternative pathway for these nuclear entrepreneurs. The safe development of advanced nuclear technology at DOE sites will provide access to DOE resources and expertise, and fast track the commercial regu-latory process by involving nuclear re-actors at the earliest stages of proto-type design and construction.

CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 5895, ENERGY AND WATER, LEGISLA-TIVE BRANCH, AND MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2019 Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1059, I call up the conference report on the bill (H.R. 5895) making appropriations for energy and water development and related agencies for the fiscal year end-ing September 30, 2019, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to House Resolution 1059, the con-ference report is considered read. (For conference report and state-ment, see proceedings of the House of September 10, 2018, at page H7946.) The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tleman from New Jersey (Mr. FRELING -
HUYSEN ) and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. L
OWEY ) each will con-trol 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to present the conference report for H.R. 5895. This conference report includes the Energy and Water Development, Mili-tary Construction and Veterans Af-fairs, and Legislative Branch Appro-priations bills for fiscal year 2019. It is a product of months of negotiations be-tween the House and the Senate. This conference report is a respon-sible compromise that addresses shared priorities: funding for programs that benefit all Americans, including na-tional security, energy development programs and water resources infra-structure, care for veterans, and oper-ations of the legislative branch. Criti-cally, this conference report represents the next step toward fully funding the Federal Government for fiscal year 2019. This is the first time since fiscal year 2017 that Congress will have passed any Appropriations bill before the end of the year and the first time in over a decade—since fiscal year 2007—that Congress will be sending more than one Appropriations bill to the President’s desk before September 30. We have done our best to repair a broken appropriations process. This is a welcome and long overdue return to regular order and fulfills our promise to the American people to deliver re-sults. Passage of this legislation also pro-vides certainty to the Federal Govern-ment—most importantly, for our troops and their families, who rely on military infrastructure to sustain their quality of life and accomplish their missions, and for our veterans, who de-serve full access to their benefits and healthcare. It is my sincere hope that we will continue this progress with the consid-eration of additional conference re-ports. The Energy and Water portion of the report provides $44.6 billion for Depart-ment of Energy, Army Corps of Engi-neers, and the Department of Defense’s nuclear programs. Investments in national security pro-grams help our Nation maintain its strongest possible nuclear deterrence posture, support our Navy’s nuclear- powered fleet, and keep nuclear mate-rials out of the hands of terrorists. And the bill also targets an array of energy programs that support our goal of energy independence and directs much-needed funds to water resources infrastructure across the country. The Military Construction and Vet-erans Affairs portion of the report to-tals $98 billion in discretionary fund-ing. This includes the largest dollar amount ever for the Department of Veterans Affairs, $86.5 billion, a sub-stantial investment that will improve access to and quality of care for vet-erans. Importantly, this also includes addi-tional funding for the VA MISSION Act and will support ongoing care for our veterans through community care cen-ters, caregivers, and other medical services. This funding is provided with-in the existing discretionary spending caps. Also, the bill provides strong invest-ments for our defense infrastructure and military installations. This will support the rebuilding of our Armed Forces, help counter threats and ag-gression abroad, and support our troops and military families. The third portion of this conference report includes the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill. This legislation continues the operations of Congress and its support agencies, ensuring that Members of Congress are best able to serve the American people. Within the total of $4.8 billion, pro-vided for both the House and the Sen-ate, funding is prioritized for security and safety within the Capitol complex, including increases for the Capitol Po-lice. The legislation helps the legislative branch improve its functions. Of note, for the first time, we have included dedicated funding for paid internships, which will allow more young Ameri-cans and students from all back-grounds to serve Congress. I want to express my deep gratitude to the chairs and ranking members of the three subcommittees who spear-headed this legislation—Energy and Water Chairman S

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH8240 September 13, 2018 
remarkable group of men and women, and I salute them. Support for this conference report today indicates that Congress is will-ing and able to get its work done on be-half of the American people on time, under regular order, and within our set budget limits. Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this conference report, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this three-bill minibus, which deliv-ers important victories for the Amer-ican people. The fiscal year 2019 Energy and Water Development, Military Con-struction and Veterans Affairs, and Legislative Branch bill is a bipartisan rejection of President Trump’s extreme budget cuts. It restores $8.1 billion in funding for programs that create jobs and strengthen our economy. Instead of cutting energy efficiency and renewable energy programs within the Department of Energy, as House Republicans proposed, we have in-creased its funding. That means more resources to develop clean energy tech-nology and accelerate job creation in this growing sector of the economy. And this bill gives an emphatic thumbs-down to President Trump’s proposed elimination of the highly suc-cessful ARPA-E program, which pro-motes and funds research and develop-ment of advanced energy technology. Turning to the Military Construc-tion-Veterans Affairs division, I am pleased that the bill provides a second installment of $2 billion for VA infra-structure improvements. And, as more veterans suffer from our country’s dev-astating opioid epidemic, we are doing right by our veterans by providing $400 million for opioid treatment, preven-tion, and safety initiatives. We owe a tremendous debt of grati-tude to those who have sacrificed for us in our Armed Forces, and we must en-sure they receive the benefits and as-sistance they deserve. Unfortunately, when it comes to the VA MISSION Act, the White House and House Repub-licans refuse to live up to that sacred trust. Despite the inclusion of nonbinding report language, the legislation before us utterly fails to address the transi-tion of the VA Choice program from mandatory to discretionary spending. It is deeply disappointing that we have been unable to address this issue with a bipartisan, bicameral com-promise. Instead, Congress has left be-hind a shortfall that will lead to cuts to vital domestic programs, including for our veterans. It is now imperative for next year that we find a responsible, long-term solution to protect domestic priorities and veterans’ healthcare. b1500 Finally, I would be remiss if I did not celebrate one of the successes in this bill that is closer to home. I am de-lighted that we have secured $8.8 mil-lion in the new dedicated funding stream for Members’ offices to pay in-terns. Congressional interns should be re-flective of the country we serve. This new funding will help a more diverse range of young people follow their dreams and begin a career in public service. I appreciate the hard work of my friend, Chairman F
RELINGHUYSEN , and the subcommittee Chairmen S
IMPSON , C
ARTER , and F ORTENBERRY , as well as our Senate counterparts in crafting this compromise. I am grateful for the leadership of Ranking Members M
ARCY  K
APTUR , T IM RYAN, and D EBBIE  W
ASSERMAN SCHULTZ fighting on behalf of our priorities for the American peo-ple. Of course, I thank the staff on both sides of the aisle who work so very hard night and day to help us deliver this important legislation. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this minibus, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. S
IMPSON ), who is the chairman of the Energy and Water De-velopment, and Related Agencies Sub-committee. 
GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to re-vise and extend their remarks and in-clude extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Idaho? There was no objection. Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I will in-clude my complete remarks for the R
ECORD . Mr. Speaker, I just want to say how thankful I am for Chairman F
RELING -
HUYSEN and Ranking Member L OWEY  for their leadership on this bill, and for all the subcommittee chairmen and ranking members on both sides of the rotunda for the work they have done to complete this bill. Mostly, I want to thank the staff that the chairman has already thanked for the hard work they did. Most people don’t realize that, when we are at home in August, they are here working hard every day, sometimes all night long, trying to come up with a compromise that maintains our House priorities. I think they have done a good job in this. It meets the NDAA requirements that were passed in the House and the Senate, and it meets the requirements of the Nuclear Posture Review and other things. So they have done a great job protecting House priorities. We didn’t get everything we wanted in this bill. The Senate didn’t get ev-erything they wanted in the bill either. That is kind of the nature of a com-promise. But this is a good bill. It should pass. It is our first step in re-storing regular order, and I want to thank everybody who has been in-volved in creating this. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the conference report for H.R. 5895, the fiscal year 2019 Energy and Water Development, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act. Before I get into the details of the bill, I would like to thank several Members involved in this effort—my Ranking Member, MARCY  K
APTUR ; our Senate partners, L AMAR ALEX-
ANDER and D IANNE FEINSTEIN ; our full com-mittee leadership, Chairman F
RELINGHUYSEN  and Ranking Member L
OWEY here in the House and Chairman S
HELBY and Ranking Member L
EAHY in the Senate; and all the con-ferees who participated in producing this final product. I’d like to assure my colleagues that the House conferees on this minibus worked dili-gently to ensure that House priorities were well represented in the final package. The En-ergy and Water bill totals $44.64 billion, which is $1.44 billion more than last year’s level. In-creases over last year are targeted to those areas where they are needed most to provide for our national defense and to support our nation’s infrastructure.5895, the Fiscal Year 2019 ilitary Construction The conference report reflects the House priority of strong support for the Department of Energy’s nuclear weapons security programs, including Weapons Activities, Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, and Naval Reactors. It aligns with the Administration’s Nuclear Posture Re-view, or NPR, which calls for maintaining a strong nuclear deterrent to meet the chal-lenges of a changing security environment, re-vitalizing the nuclear complex, and supporting effective arms control and nonproliferation ef-forts. Since the NPR was released after the budget submission, the House worked hard to ensure funds above the budget request were included for critical NPR recommendations. Overall funding for the national nuclear se-curity programs totals $15.23 billion—an in-crease of $560 million above the fiscal year 2018 enacted level and $138 million above the President’s budget request. Within this amount, $65 million is provided to support the NPR’s recommendation to pursue a lower- yield ballistic missile warhead to enhance the credibility of our nuclear deterrent and $1.07 billion is provided to address the growing backlog of deferred maintenance and to re-capitalize aging nuclear weapons infrastruc-ture. Also within this amount, the budget re-quest for Naval Reactors is fully funded, an in-crease of $169 million above fiscal year 2018, to support the Navy’s nuclear propulsion pro-gram. The conference report provides funding in-creases across the Department of Energy to defend against cyber attacks and to strength-en energy sector cybersecurity preparedness, response, and recovery. Addressing our nation’s critical infrastructure needs is another House priority strongly re-flected in the final conference report. Funding for the Army Corps of Engineers totals $7 bil-lion. Harbor Maintenance activities are funded at $1.55 billion, which is $150 million more than fiscal year 2018. The level exceeds the WRDA annual target and represents 92 per-cent of estimated revenues compared to the fiscal year 2019 target of 77 percent estab-lished in WRRDA 2014. Within the Bureau of Reclamation, the bill provides an additional $343 million for water

conservation and delivery projects, including $134 million for water storage projects author-ized under the WIIN Act and $99 million for rural water projects. The bill advances an ‘‘all-of-the-above’’ en-ergy strategy that will support a strong na-tional economy well into the future. Specifi-cally, the bill promotes innovation and growth in nuclear energy, funding research, develop-ment, and demonstration activities at $1.2 bil-lion, an increase of $108 million above fiscal year 2018. Research to advance coal, natural gas, oil, and other fossil energy technologies is funded at $740 million. Basic science research funding totals $6.6 billion, $325 million more than last year. In-creased funding will advance U.S. leadership in high performance computing and improve science research infrastructure at our national laboratories. Finally, the conference report registers the grave concerns of many Members of Con-gress over judicial interference in the oper-ation of the Federal Columbia River Power System hydroelectric dams. All in all, this appropriations package, in-cluding the Energy and Water division, is a strong bill that incorporates many high prior-ities of the House. I urge my colleagues to support it. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentle-woman from Ohio (Ms. K
APTUR ), who is the ranking member of the Energy and Water Development, and Related Agen-cies Subcommittee. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this three-cornered minibus before us. It is really the opening pitch of 12 bills of which we are a part, and it partially funds our Nation’s energy and water development requirements; military construction; the legislative branch; and, of course, programs to serve our Nation’s veterans who put their lives in service to liberty at home and abroad every day. Please let me thank Chairman F
RELINGHUYSEN , Ranking Member L
OWEY , and our very able sub-committee chair, M
IKE SIMPSON , as well as our committee staff for their tireless efforts to bring this first set of appropriation bills over the finish line. Though it is fair to say Republican leaders took the long way to a bipar-tisan agreement, we now find ourselves passing three appropriations bills be-fore the October 1 deadline of the be-ginning of the new fiscal year. Some-thing that should not be a momentous occasion has thus turned into one. While I don’t think that our sub-committee deserves a pat on the back for simply doing our job, let me note that this is an achievement we have not seen in many, many years with our bill, Energy and Water Development. This House must move toward regular order again, and this sets the pace. Our specific title contributes to en-suring the critical availability of en-ergy and water for our Nation’s domes-tic stability, as well as our national se-curity, not just for today, but for the tomorrows to come. America has made enormous strides in increasing our energy independence to close to 90 percent in the short term. No bill is more important than this one in reaching 100 percent independence as the strategic goal for our Nation. But it is not yet time to declare mission ac-complished. Future energy security is the ultimate goal we must continue to strive for. The nearly $7 billion in funding also in this bill for the Army Corps of Engi-neers will ensure continued forward progress across all project areas. The Corps can contribute mightily to infra-structure investment for moderniza-tion and job creation across our Na-tion. The Corps’ role in essential flood control is critical as we watch the ap-proach of Hurricane Florence and we think about navigation and the respon-sibilities of the Corps, as well as envi-ronmental restoration. I am grateful for the chairman’s con-tinued partnership to address the Asian carp threat to our freshwater Great Lakes ecosystem, as well as for funding to keep our Great Lakes ports open to shippers. Our Nation has a wonderful navigation system that drives eco-nomic investment and undergirds our essential industrial manufacturing base. This bill makes many other impor-tant investments for our Nation, in-cluding reversing the misguided cuts to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Re-newable Energy in the House bill. The compromise yielded an additional $57 million to sustain the momentum to rapidly falling prices for wind and solar energy as critical to achieving an all- of-the-above energy platform. This funding also allows us to con-tinue investing in the Office of Ad-vanced Manufacturing, vehicles tech-nology, and bioenergy. These programs are an investment in clean energy technologies, and they drive our global leadership in innovation and set us on the path for continuing job creation. This bill strongly funds programs that were eliminated in the President’s budget, including weatherization as-sistance to conserve energy and the path-breaking office of the Department of Energy’s advanced research, ARPA- E, which unlocks science to build our future and the progress that goes with it. Additionally, harmful, controversial policy riders that have no place in this bill were removed. One dealt with the waters of the U.S., and one would interfere with an ongoing judicial proc-ess. Both would have seriously hin-dered passage of this bill. With regard to funding the VA, I am concerned we have set ourselves on a course for another self-inflicted crisis when funding for the VA MISSION Act runs out. Our veterans deserve the best treatment in the world, not to have their care used as a political weapon for partisan gain. Mr. Speaker, again, I thank my col-leagues and friends from the com-mittee, Chairmen S
IMPSON and F
RELINGHUYSEN , and Ranking Member L
OWEY , for their persistent leadership for our Nation, and to the Senate for bringing such a good example of bipar-tisanship, which I hope we can con-tinue. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this package. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. FORTENBERRY ), who is the chairman of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee. Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me thank Chairman F
RELINGHUYSEN for all of his dedicated, hard work on this bill and his leader-ship through many years of service. We are really grateful for the gentleman’s mentorship and all of his exhaustive ef-forts to make America truly a much better place. In that regard, Mr. Speaker, while I was on my way over here, I was reflect-ing on something. The dome of the Capitol that connects our two bodies here continued to be constructed dur-ing the Civil War. Abraham Lincoln was encouraged to stop it, given all the other demands of the crises all around him. He refused. He said that, one day, that dome will unify our Nation once again. Here we are with the legislative branch bill. Even though it is the smallest of the appropriations bills, I believe it does capture the richness of the American experience and captures the heart of the narrative of our Na-tion. In that regard, we have worked very closely, of course, with the former chairman, K
EVIN YODER , as well Rank-ing Member T
IMRYAN, as well as the United States Senate to develop a very good bill here. The final product, I be-lieve, is solid and reasonable. The legislative branch division pro-vides about $4.8 billion in funding, and that is a 2.8 percent increase over last year. But the priorities, Mr. Speaker, were placed on security, transparency, and maintaining fiscal responsibility. The bill provides about $1.2 billion for the House of Representatives, which is a 2.7 percent increase. How-ever, it needs to be noted that this is still below funding levels from the year 2010. As the chairman mentioned, this includes $8.8 million for a new account for the compensation of interns, which is a widely agreed upon new initiative, allowing each Member to spend up to $20,000 a year. In the areas of security, about $30 million is going to our Capitol Police to enhance the safety and security of this campus, as well as to protect Members when they are offsite. About $733 million is going to the Ar-chitect of the Capitol to ensure safety and security improvements to our his-toric buildings and to address a grow-ing deferred maintenance list that we have. A particularly new initiative is that we are directing the Architect to design plans for a more welcoming ar-rival area around the Capitol South Metro Station. Regarding the issue of transparency, there is about $589 million for the Gov-ernment Accountability Office, which

will enable them to hire 130 new per-sons to assist with GAO’s critical over-sight work that provides us in Congress accurate, nonpartisan reporting of how taxpayer dollars are being appro-priately used. The Congressional Budg-et Office will also receive a slight in-crease to be better responsive to Mem-bers of Congress. Regarding fiscal responsibility and new initiatives, we have included lan-guage supporting the Library of Con-gress’ visitor experience project, which has the potential to transform how our Library, the Library of America, wel-comes the millions of visitors that it receives each year. We expect that this will become a model of public-private partnership in the years to come. Finally, I would like to draw atten-tion to the expansion of the popular House Wounded Warrior Program that will now offer 110 2-year fellowships for those who have already sacrificed so much for our country and wish to pur-sue public service here among us. Mr. Speaker, a lot goes on in our Capitol, from the dedicated Capitol Po-lice officers who stand guard around the clock, to the employees of the Ar-chitect of the Capitol who work to pre-serve and maintain this important physical infrastructure, to the IT pro-fessionals who have successfully de-fended our networks from 4.5 billion at-tempted cyber attacks last year alone, and to the committed staff that is a part of this legislative process. We owe them all. We also, again, are thankful to Chair-man F
RELINGHUYSEN for his dedicated leadership. I would personally like to wish the gentleman all the best in his future endeavors. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. R
YAN), who is the ranking member of the Legislative Branch Sub-committee. Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I want to extend my congratulations to my friend from New Jersey for his work on this and so many other issues, and for his constant dedication to this Congress. I also sit on the Defense Appropria-tions Subcommittee with Congressman F
RELINGHUYSEN . I just want to thank the gentleman for his leadership, hard work, and his years of travel around the world to make sure that the men and women in our military are safe and protected and have the equipment that they need. So I thank the gentleman for all his service. I rise in support, Mr. Speaker, of this conference agreement. Once again, we see that the Congress can pass decent legislation when Republicans and Democrats, House and Senate, all work together to reach a bipartisan agree-ment instead of one party trying to make all the decisions behind closed doors. This bill and these bills reflect that. The bill we are sending to the Presi-dent’s desk takes care of our veterans; it funds our civilian and military infra-structure and energy needs; and it pays for the operations of the legislative branch institutions essential to our de-mocracy. Almost every agency in the legislative branch division of this bill receives its full budget request. One of the highlights of the bill is the funding for the Government Account-ability Office, which works to root out waste, fraud, and abuse government-wide. With so many safeguards having failed against mismanagement and cor-ruption in our government over the past few years, the GAO is more impor-tant than ever. By providing the resources for the GAO to take another step toward re-storing its pre-sequestration capacity, we are helping to save taxpayers money and prevent some of the worst abuses of the administration. Another key accomplishment in this measure is the restoration of the dedi-cated funding for paid internships in the House of Representatives. I also want to thank the gentlewoman from New York and the gentleman from New Jersey for helping make that possible. It has been 25 years since we have had a paid internship program here in the United States Congress. Once more, when a young person from a middle- class family comes to Washington, D.C., and desires to enter public serv-ice, they can worry a little bit less about the costs here in Washington, D.C., for rent and grocery bills, and compete with other applicants based on merit instead of economic background, which is just a matter of basic fairness. b1515 There are so many other issues. One more, Mr. Speaker, that I would like to mention in this bill is that we have ensured we are doing all we can to address the epidemic of harassment and discrimination that has existed since time immemorial but rightly showed up in the headlines in the last year or two. The Office of Compliance is given over $1.3 million more than last year so they can have the resources to tackle the problem and to handle the in-creased workload we have given them by expanding their jurisdiction. In the near future, we expect their mission to expand further, and these funds will help them prepare for that. Again, I extend my sincere thanks es-pecially, again, to Chairman F
RELING -
HUYSEN , who is leaving, N ITALOWEY , Chairman F
ORTENBERRY , Senator D
AINES and Senator M URPHY , and so many others. Also, thank you to the staffs on both sides, including Anne Sokolov, Ryan Keating, Adam Berg, Jenny Panone, Tim Monahan, and Reyn Archer, for making this bill possible and, as Con-gressman S
IMPSON said, for the long hours that they have put in over the August recess to make this happen. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. C
ARTER ), chairman of the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Sub-committee. Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, first, I want to congratulate Chairman FRELINGHUYSEN and Ranking Member L
OWEY for their incredible patience and deft negotiating to bring us to this point. I also want to thank Ranking Member D
EBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ  for her rock-solid support and keen analytic eye. I also think we need to remember Mr. Charlie Dent, who re-tired early from this committee. He was the chairman and had a strong hand in the product that came out here today. I am pleased to describe for my col-leagues the good news in the Military Construction-VA division of the mini-bus. We are able to provide long overdue support to our military and their fam-ily members, with a total of $10.3 bil-lion for military construction, which is an increase of $241 million, or 2.4 per-cent, above FY18 levels. With that funding, we are able to provide $465.3 million for the Guard and Reserve com-ponents’ projects in 20 States and terri-tories, $352 million for two medical fa-cilities, $267.5 million for five DOD schools, and just over $8 billion for military construction projects in the U.S. Members will appreciate that we are able to provide $693.2 million in un-funded requirements requested by the services, which includes $100 million for upgrades for antiterrorism and force protection at military installa-tions. The bill also includes $921.4 million in OCO funding, an increase of $171 mil-lion over FY18. Our bill fulfills Congress’ commit-ment to our Nation’s veterans with total discretionary funding of $86.5 bil-lion for the Department of Veterans Affairs, a $5 billion, or 6.2 percent, in-crease over 2018. These funds provide important medical services to vet-erans, to include supporting the new and expanding programs resulting from the recently passed MISSION Act, as well as disability compensation, post-9/ 11 education benefits, and a host of in-surance and lending programs. Of note, we were able to provide $1.1 billion for the new electronic health record contract, the same record as DOD’s, which will allow the exchange of veterans’ health records with DOD and community providers. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. P
OE of Texas). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. CARTER of Texas. In addition, consistent with the budget caps agree-ment, the bill includes $2 billion in medical infrastructure assistance: non-recurring maintenance, seismic im-provement activities, major construc-tion, and minor construction. I urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote on the package. Help us do the right thing for our serv-icemembers and veterans and their families who have given so much.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8243 September 13, 2018 
I would also be remiss in not thank-ing all those involved in the committee work to get this bill forward. I am very grateful we had a conference. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. C
UELLAR ), a member of the Appro-priations Committee. Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member, Mrs. L
OWEY , for yielding and for the wonder-ful work she has done as our leader in the Appropriations Committee. I cer-tainly want to thank, also, the chair-man for his leadership and the bipar-tisan work that both individuals, Mrs. L
OWEY and Mr. F RELINGHUYSEN , have done in working together to make sure we pass this legislation and bring these three bills to the floor. I would like to highlight a couple of things that some Members have in-cluded. First of all, on the MILCON-VA, we are talking about a $5 billion increase. My friend from Texas (Mr. C
ARTER ) and Ms. D
EBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ have worked together in a bipartisan way. There is $86.5 billion for the Depart-ment of Veterans Affairs, which in-cludes funding for mental health serv-ices, modernizing the VA’s health record system, and addressing the claims backlog that every Member knows has been so difficult. So that extra $5 billion is going to do a lot to help the veterans. There is also $10.3 billion for military construction projects that will support our troops and our freedom at home. I know that in my part of San Antonio, San Antonio’s Military USA, this is an important type of assistance. Certainly, we have $1.3 billion for telehealth. This amount is $30 million above what we just provided earlier this year. This will further expand the telehealth capacity to rural areas. There is also $206 million for suicide prevention outreach for veterans. Again, whether it is this or the En-ergy and Water bill—and I see the two leaders over here, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Appropriations— these are monies that will be helpful to the San Antonio area for flood mitiga-tion or even for Corpus Christi to im-prove the channel project that will make sure that they will be able to handle the capacity to export petro-leum products, which is a $13 million increase. Again, I want to say thank you to ev-erybody working together in a bipar-tisan way. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Flor-ida (Mrs. M
URPHY ). Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speak-er, since coming to Congress, I have made it a priority to ensure that our men and women in uniform are pre-pared for success once their military service ends. The members of our Armed Forces serve and sacrifice for this Nation. We have a moral obliga-tion to help them thrive when they transition to the civilian world. That is why I am so pleased the final version of this bill includes the bipar-tisan amendment I coauthored to in-crease funding for the Wounded War-rior Program. This initiative places disabled veterans in paid, 2-year fellow-ships in House offices, providing them with potentially life-changing opportu-nities for professional and personal growth. It also enables Members of Congress to better serve the American people, because veterans can use the unique skills they gain in the military to improve public policy and help con-stituents. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GENEGREEN ). Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5895, the Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act. In an era of partisanship, bipartisan legislation like this bill is sorely need-ed. A little over a year ago, Houston was devastated by Hurricane Harvey. Re-covering from a storm of that mag-nitude doesn’t happen in a single year. The Houston ship channel is still in need of dredging just to return to the authorized depth that we were at be-fore the storm hit. That is why bills like this one are so important. In this legislation, the Army Corps of Engineers will receive just under $7 bil-lion, $171.5 million above the 2018 en-acted level. The Army Corps works hand in hand with local organizations like the Port of Houston and Harris County Flood Control in our district to repair damage from previous storms and mitigate future risk. It is essential that we fund the corps at an adequate level that ensures that we are constructing projects that limit future damage, not just repair the damage already there. I am pleased to see that funding lev-els have increased in this year’s bill, but more needs to be done. This issue is not a partisan one and affects districts far and wide. I am also pleased to see that the har-bor maintenance trust fund will receive $1.55 billion, $149 million over the 2018 allocation and $584 million above the request. Ports are the economic drivers are our country. At the Port of Hous-ton, we had drafting restrictions that affected safety and commerce for months because of Hurricane Harvey. While I am pleased that we are in-creasing the allocated money this year, there is still an injustice that needs to be corrected with the harbor mainte-nance trust fund. Around $1.8 billion in harbor maintenance tax is collected every year through port user fees. When Congress enacted this fund, it in-tended to use the revenue to ensure that no port would be in need of dredg-ing and that the people who use the port have a hand in funding the main-tenance. It is essential that, in future years, Congress rectifies this issue and ensures that all money collected from usage of our ports goes directly to funding their maintenance, generating further economic activity. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5895, the Energy and Water, Legislative Branch and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Ap-propriations Act. In an era partisanship, bipar-tisan legislation like this bill is sorely needed. A little over a year ago, Houston was dev-astated by Hurricane Harvey. Recovery from a storm of that magnitude doesn’t happen in a single year. The Houston ship channel is still in need of dredging just to return to the au-thorized depth that we were at before the storm hit. That is why bills like this one are so impor-tant. In this legislation, the Army Corps of En-gineers will receive just under $7 billion, $171.5 million above the 2018 enacted level. The Army Corps works hand in hand with local organizations like the Port and Harris County Flood Control in our district to repair damage from previous storms and mitigate fu-ture risk. It is essential that we fund the Corps at an adequate level that ensures that we are con-structing projects that limit future damage, not just repair the damage already there. I am pleased to see that funding levels have in-creased in this year’s bill, but more needs to be done. This issue is not a partisan one and affects districts far and wide. I am also pleased to see that the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund will receive $1.55 bil-lion, $149 million over the 2018 allocation and $584 million above the request. Ports are the economic drivers of the country. At the Port of Houston we had drafting restrictions that af-fected safety and commerce for months after Harvey. While I am pleased that we are in-creasing the allocated money this year, there is still an injustice that needs to be corrected with the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. Around $1.8 billion in Harbor Maintenance Tax is collected every year through port user fees. When Congress enacted this fund it in-tended to use the revenue to ensure that no port would be in need of dredging and that the people who use the port have a hand in fund-ing the maintenance. It is essential that in future years Congress rectifies this issue and ensures that all money collected from the usage of our ports goes di-rectly to funding their maintenance, generating further economic activity. While there is work still to be done, this bill moves the ball forward and I urge my col-leagues to support it. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I would like to thank Mrs. L
OWEY for our close working relationship of well over 24 years. I would like to take the opportunity to thank all the ranking members who put this package together here, the re-markable men and women who make up our professional staff on the Appro-priations Committee, and our personal staff who dedicated most of their Au-gust, part of July, and certainly this part of September to doing the work of

the people. I am enormously grateful to all of them for their hard work and their dedication. Mr. Speaker, I salute my colleague, Mrs. L
OWEY , and all members and staff for their work. Particularly, I’d like to thank: Nancy Fox, Maureen Holohan, Shannon O’Keefe, Jason Gray, Marta Hernandez, Tammy Hughes, Rachel Kahler, Parker Van de Water, and Tom Doelp in the Front Office; Angie Giancarlo, Loraine Heckenberg, Perry Yates, and Amy Murphy on the Energy and Water Subcommittee; Sue Quantius; Sarah Young; and Kiya Batmanglidj from the MilCon/ VA Subcommittee; Jenny Panone and Tim Monahan from the Legislative Branch Sub-committee. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to thank my friend, Chairman F
RELINGHUYSEN . It has been far too long since mul-tiple spending bills were enacted prior to the start of the fiscal year. It is a testament to the chairman’s leadership that we are set to clear three today, and I hope we send at least one more package to the President before the end of the month. Additionally, I would like to thank the staff for their tireless efforts, par-ticularly Adam Berg, Jaime Shimek, Matt Washington, and the majority staff, including clerks Jenny Panone, Sue Quantius, and Angie Giancarlo- Clark. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back the bal-ance of my time. Mr. D
EFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, today, I voted in support of the Conference Report for H.R. 5895, the Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Vet-erans Affairs Appropriations Act of 2019. The legislation includes several provisions that I strongly support, including nearly $7 bil-lion for the Army Corps of Engineers. Specifi-cally, this legislation provides $1.55 billion, $149 million above the 2018 enacted level, to Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund projects to ensure that critical harbor and port projects re-ceive the funding they need. It also includes $86.5 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs, including $8.6 billion for mental health, $348 million for opioid treatment and preven-tion, and $206 million for suicide prevention programs. Despite funding these vital programs, I have concerns with a number of provisions included in the Conference Report. This legislation au-thorizes more than $97 billion, including $921 million to the Overseas Contingency Oper-ations (OCO) fund, an account which is not counted in the budget and is not paid for. It adds to the deficit and is used as a slush fund by the Pentagon. Unlike every other federal agency, the De-partment of Defense (DOD) has yet to com-plete a financial audit; taxpayers deserve to know how the biggest bureaucracy in the fed-eral government spends their money. Additionally, the bill prohibits the closing of Guantanamo Bay, which costs more than $100 million each year to house 41 prisoners and has been used as a top recruiting tool by terrorists. The bottom line is that the prison has been a black eye for the United States, has eroded relationships with our allies, under-mined U.S. missions abroad, and put U.S. citi-zens and our troops at risk of retaliation. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my support for funding appropriated to the Of-fice of Compliance contained within the Con-ference Report to Accompany H.R. 5895. This important funding will support efforts to the on-going reform of the Congressional Account-ability Act to better enable legislative branch offices and agencies to receive proper training regarding workplace conduct. I strongly oppose slush fund settlements being paid out with taxpayer dollars, and I am pleased that no funding contained in this bill will go towards money for settlements. I ap-preciate the work of the Conference Com-mittee in getting this critical funding included in this appropriations package. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired. Pursuant to House Resolution 1059, the previous question is ordered. The question is on the conference re-port. Pursuant to clause 10 of rule XX, the yeas and nays are ordered. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15-minute vote on adoption of the con-ference report will be followed by a 5-minute vote on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal, if ordered.

Mr. D ESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 606, a bill to designate the United States Post Office at 1025 Nevin Ave-nue in Richmond, California as the ‘‘Harold D. McCraw, Sr., Post Office Building.’’ Harold D. McCraw, Sr. began working for the Richmond Post Office in 1956 as a Career Substitute Carrier, and worked in various su-pervisory positions during his tenure of more than 45 years. From the time of his appointment as Officer- in-Charge of Richmond in August of 1973, Harold was active in the National Association of Postmasters of the United States (NAPUS). He began with the East Bay Chapter and served in the state chapter as Area Director, Chapter Secretary Chapter President, and Chairman of the 1989 National Convention held in San Francisco. Harold served NAPUS at the national level as Western Region Liaison Officer, EEO Com-mittee Chairman, Advisory Board Member, and Postmasters Representative. In January 1988, assumed the office of National Vice President for Area 22. Harold also served as the Editor of the state publication, The Cali-fornia Postmaster, and of the national publica-tion, Postmasters Gazette. In addition to serving the community in his job as Richmond Postmaster, Mr. McCraw also served on various boards and commis-sions. He served as a member of the Board of Directors of the Greater Richmond Commu-nity Social Services Corp., where he facilitated the development of a childcare facility that has expanded to five locations and cares for hun-dreds of children. Harold also helped bring about great change in the Richmond area through his service a member of the Richmond Manage-ment Service Corp and the Greater Richmond Housing Corp., which established housing projects and expanded retail space for small businesses in the area. The post office on Nevin Avenue has oper-ated as Richmond’s main post office since 1938. The building is located in the heart of downtown and is a driver of the city’s econ-omy. During World War II it served as an air raid shelter, and to this day remains a land-mark and meeting point for community resi-dents. It is also a classic example of Art Deco architecture that is an essential piece of Rich-mond history and culture. I am honored to name the post office in Richmond, California after Harold, a man who dedicated his life to the United States Post Of-fice and the Richmond Committee. I would like to thank Chairman G
OWDY and Ranking Member C
UMMINGS for their support of this legislation. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. f

Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, today the House will pass H.R. 4913, renaming the Salisbury, Maryland Post Office, the ‘‘Sgt. Maj. Wardell B. Turner Post Office Building’’ In honor of Sgt. Maj. Wardell Turner who was killed in ac-tion in Afghanistan. Mr. Speaker, this legislation honors the memory of a fellow serviceman, devoted hus-band, loving father and valorous soldier. It is my sincere hope that the designation of this post office in Sergeant Turner’s name will help our community on the Eastern Shore, and our country, celebrate and remember the legacy of service and sacrifice left behind by this true American hero. Sergeant Turner was a local legend on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. He graduated from Bennett High School in Salisbury, Maryland in 1984 where he was a standout fullback and middle linebacker. He helped lead the Bennett High School Clippers to back-to-back undefeated seasons and state titles in 1982 and 1983. His leadership and ability earned him an athletic scholarship from Towson Uni-versity. He was a four-year letter winner and in 1989, graduated with a bachelor’s degree in management. Years later, in 2011, he would earn his master’s degree in criminal justice from Central Missouri State University. In 1991 he married his wife, Katherine, whom he met at a New Year’s Eve dance on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. In 1993, looking for an op-portunity to serve, he enlisted in the Army. Ac-cording to those closest to him, the Army was more than just a career, it was a calling.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8247 September 13, 2018 
His military career took him across the United States and to bases in Germany and South Korea. While in Germany, Wardell Tur-ner was recognized for saving a young wom-an’s life as she attempted to jump off a bridge. He was later deployed to Bosnia in the 1990’s and then to Iraq in 2003. He served in military police units beginning in 1993, most recently with the 720th Police Battalion based at Fort Hood, Texas. Earning the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, and other Meritorious Service Medals along the way, he steadily climbed the enlisted ranks and was promoted to Sgt. Maj. in 2013. Sgt. Maj. Turner was assigned to the head-quarters of the U.S. Army Garrison at Fort Drum in New York when he was sent to Af-ghanistan in July of 2014 during Operation En-during Freedom. There he served as the sen-ior enlisted advisor for the Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan in Kabul whose primary mission was the training of Af-ghan security forces. Sgt. Maj. Turner had planned for this to be his last deployment, hoping to retire in a year or so and spend more time with his family. Those that knew him described him as highly organized and a devoted family man. Prior to his death, just before Thanksgiving, he had found time to gather and ship Christ-mas gifts to his family back home. According to his wife, Katherine, despite his being unable to be home for the holidays, these gifts, and the effort he made to make sure they arrived on time, highlighted just how much his family meant to him, and him to them. Sergeant Turner was killed on November, 24, 2014, when his convoy was hit by an IED while on patrol in Eastern Kabul. Sergeant Turner’s son, Devin Turner, who was also enlisted in the Army and was de-ployed to Afghanistan at the time, planned to share Thanksgiving with his father. Tragically, he was informed a few days before the holi-day that his father had been killed. Specialist Turner escorted his father’s casket home. After his father’s funeral, Specialist Turner, de-spite his loss, returned to Afghanistan to finish his tour. According to Devin, his father would have supported his decision to return to duty and didn’t believe in leaving your business un-finished. Sgt. Maj. Turner was laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery in January of 2015. Mem-bers of his family say that they found peace in his sacrifice knowing he died doing what he loved . . . serving his country. Sgt. Maj. Wardell Turner has left a lasting legacy in our community. In 2016 Towson Uni-versity created the ‘‘Wardell Turner Scholar-ship’’ to be awarded annually to a defensive back on the football team that is in good aca-demic standing and demonstrates the qualities and attributes exemplified by Mr. Turner. Those enumerated qualities include leader-ship, selfless service, and commitment. Last year, friends, family and high school teammates gathered at the Wicomico Pres-byterian Church to retire his Bennett High School jersey and to celebrate his life and his military service. During the ceremony, Mayor Jake Day of Salisbury, Maryland proclaimed October 28, 2017, as ‘‘Sgt. Maj, Wardell Tur-ner Day’’. His legacy survives and continues with his five children, Shayla, Quinton, Devin, Wardell II, Xavier, several grandchildren, and his de-voted wife, Katherine. Mr. Speaker, Sgt. Maj. Wardell Turner is a true American hero. His life of courage and service provides an example for us all. It is my pleasure to offer this bill to rename the Salis-bury post office the Sgt. Maj. Wardell B. Tur-ner Post Office building. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation that honors one of the Eastern Shore’s favorite sons. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer legislation to honor a good man, a faithful public servant, a veteran, and a friend to the people of the great state of Ohio by renaming the Post Office in Ashland, Ohio after former Ohio Senate President, Bill Harris. Bill served our nation as a United States Marine for 23 years. He completed tours of duty in the Korean and Vietnam Wars. His ac-tions led to him being awarded the Bronze Star twice and the Vietnam Medal of Honor. He rose to the rank of Major and retired in 1977. Shortly thereafter, Bill found himself moving to Ashland, Ohio and opening a car dealer-ship. It is still run by the Harris family. Bill was an active member of his community, serving as chairman of the Ashland Area Chamber of Commerce and was a member of the Board for the Ashbrook Center at Ashland University. I got to know Bill when we served in the Ohio legislature together. While he was in the Senate, I served in the House. Bill was Ohio Senate President when he led them to enact major reforms to Ohio’s tax code. He also had a passion for making Ohio’s higher education system better and more affordable. But I also got to know Bill on a personal level. After Bill broke his leg slipping on ice in 2009, he was unable to drive. Since I lived the closest to him, I drove him down to Columbus while he was recovering. We spent many hours talking, sometimes about politics and state govern-ment, but mostly about family and life. He told me stories and imparted his wisdom on those drives from Ashland to Columbus and back. Bill Harris dedicated his life to his family and friends, his community and country. I offer this legislation as a way to honor Bill’s legacy and recognize his achievements. I ask for my col-leagues’ support of this bill to rename the Post Office in Bill’s hometown of Ashland after him as thanks for his commitment to Ashland, the State of Ohio, and to America. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of my legislation, H R. 6020, a bill to rename the Howell Post Office after a local, and really a national, hero: Ser-geant Donald Burgett. Mr. Donald Burgett was born in Detroit, Michigan on April 25, 1925. On his 18th birth-day he followed in his brother’s footsteps and joined the Army. He joined the newly formed paratroop company and became a member of the famous 101st Airborne. Assigned to A Company, he fought in battles throughout the European Theatre. His story is quite simply amazing. He dropped over 12 miles away from his drop zone at just after one in the morning. He fought in the battle at Ravenoville in a little vil-lage along the coast of Normandy, where he was among the group of Americans that liber-ated the first village in Europe—and this was all before sunrise that day. From there, he fought in battles all down the coastline, being attacked by the Germans at every turn and even being attacked by Russian cavalry at one point on his way to Carentan where he was wounded twice in action. After surviving Normandy, Mr. Burgett went on to fight in Operation Market-Graden in Hol-land and survive the bitterly cold siege of Bas-togne during the Battle of the Bulge. Sergeant Burgett returned to the States on January 1, 1946—at the age of just 20 years old. After the war, Sergeant Burgett picked up flying, be-came a pilot and visited all the states in his own plane. He married his wife in 1953, and they had 5 children which they raised in How-ell, MI. He was a very active member of his com-munity, including extensive service with the VFW, American Legion, and Disabled Amer-ican Veterans. He authored four books which gave firsthand accounts of the paratroopers’ experience in WWII. The first of that series was ‘‘Currahee!: A Screaming Eagle at Nor-mandy’’, which was endorsed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He also wrote ‘‘The Road to Arnhem: A Screaming Eagle in Hol-land’’, ‘‘Seven Roads to Hell: A Screaming Eagle at Bastogne’’, and ‘‘Beyond the Rhine: A Screaming Eagle in Germany’’. Mr. Burgett passed away on March 23, 2017, at the age of 91. As a lifelong Michi-gander, Mr. Burgett was truly a member of the ‘‘Greatest Generation’’ and he spent a great deal of time making sure the efforts of his comrades would be known and remembered. I ask all my colleagues to join me in honoring his life and his service to the country by mak-ing sure his name and legacy lives on in his community. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. f

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8249 September 13, 2018 
Born in Memphis, Tennessee in 1929, Judge Russell B. Sugarmon is heralded for his contributions to the City of Memphis and his work to reverse the tide of racism in Ten-nessee, paving the way for future black lead-ers in the area and inspiring their efforts to in-crease their representation in elected, Demo-cratic bodies. Working alongside notable Memphis pio-neers and leaders in the fight for racial justice and equality, Judge Sugarmon was instru-mental in using the courts to desegregate pub-lic transportation, restaurants and public facili-ties and the desegregation of Memphis public schools. As a trailblazer for African-Americans in public office and a leader in the Civil Rights Movement, it is only fitting that we enshrine our recognition of Judge Sugarmon’s contribu-tions to the City of Memphis and the African American community by naming the 1320 Au-tumn Ave. Post Office in Memphis, Tennessee in honor of his legacy. I thank my colleagues in the House for vot-ing to pass this measure honoring Judge Rus-sell B. Sugarmon, an exemplary American and titan of his time. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to quick-ly take up this bill and send the legislation to the President’s desk. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, was read the third time, and passed. The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ‘‘A bill to designate the fa-cility of the United States Postal Serv-ice located at 1325 Autumn Avenue in Memphis, Tennessee, as the ‘Judge Russell B. Sugarmon Post Office Build-ing’.’’. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF KENNETH PALMER (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, this Sep-tember marks Kenneth Palmer’s 60th anniversary as a member of the Mo-hawk Fire Department. A courageous fighter, a teacher, and a survivor of quadruple bypass surgery, Ken has inspired our community through his deep passion for service. Ken has left his mark on firefighters and first responders in Herkimer Coun-ty through his leadership as the Mo-hawk Fire Chief, Department Training Officer, president and vice president of the Herkimer County Fire Chiefs Asso-ciation, Chaplain for the Mohawk and Newport Fire Departments, and Chief Fire Chaplain for New York State. Now, even at the age of 80, Ken re-mains ready for the fire alarm to sound. But his journey hasn’t always been easy. On February 25, 2000, Ken underwent successful quadruple bypass surgery. Despite the hardships he endured dur-ing this stressful time, Ken had a strong support system. He often credits his beautiful wife, Sharon, and so many family members and friends praying for him from New York to California during his enduring struggle. Now, as a Red Cap Ambassador for the American Heart Association, Ken provides compassionate support to oth-ers suffering from heart disease and heart-related illnesses. Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor to recognize a dear friend, Kenneth Palmer, such a strong force for good, who has risked so much to protect our families. I ask all my colleagues here today to join our community in ex-tending our gratitude to Kenneth Palmer for his incredible 60 years of service. f 
INDICTMENT OF NORTH KOREAN HACKER PARK JIN HYOK (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, last week, the Justice Department unveiled the latest in a string of criminal com-plaints against America’s cyber adver-saries. The extremely detailed docu-ment lays out a damning case against Park Jin Hyok, a North Korean hack-er, and the regime that supports him. From the Sony Pictures Entertain-ment hack to WannaCry to attempts to undermine the global financial system, the North Korean regime is a desta-bilizing presence in cyberspace. I com-mend the members of the law enforce-ment community who are working this case. Mr. Speaker, cyberspace is often thought of as a domain where bad ac-tors can act with impunity. This in-dictment shows that this is not the case. America is getting more and more sophisticated at being able to track down and unveil and unmask these cyber bad actors.

b1615 THE ONE-MINUTE STORY OF A ONE-YEAR-OLD (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this is the 1-minute story of Kelly Dore. Kelly’s biological father began traf-ficking her for sex in the first year of her life. The evildoer continued to do so for 14 years. Kelly spent her child-hood in a living hell most of us cannot even contemplate. Her kindergarten memories are not of playtime and story time; instead, they consisted of hiding in the bath-room because the repeated trauma caused uncontrollable bleeding. The evildoer threatened to kill Kelly’s mother if Kelly ever told. At 14 years, Kelly liberated herself from this depravity by testifying against her father in a courtroom. Mi-raculously, she not only survived the ordeal, but she became an advocate. Today, Kelly works to strengthen trafficking laws, giving an inspira-tional voice for victims of human traf-ficking like her. No child should ever have to go through what Kelly went through. Con-gress must join Kelly in the fight against the buying and selling of our children on the marketplace of sex trafficking. And that is just the way it is.

SYRIA (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, 2 days ago, President Trump and Vice Presi-dent P
ENCE delivered solemn speeches about the attacks on 9/11, talking about how much they care about the victims of al-Qaida’s attack on our country, but they are now standing up to protect the 20,000 to 40,000 al-Qaida and other jihadist forces in Syria, threatening Russia, Syria, and Iran with military force if they dare attack these terrorists. This is a betrayal of the American people, especially the victims of al- Qaida’s attack on 9/11 and their fami-lies, first responders, and to my broth-ers and sisters in uniform who have been killed or wounded in action and their families. For the President, who is Com-mander in Chief, to act as the protec-tive big brother of al-Qaida and other jihadists must be condemned by every Member of Congress. HEALTHSOUTH’S 35TH ANNIVERSARY (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute and to re-vise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize HealthSouth Nittany Valley Rehabili-tation Hospital on 35 years of excel-lence in rehabilitation care. HealthSouth is a rehabilitation hos-pital in Pleasant Gap, Pennsylvania, that offers comprehensive inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation services designed to return patients to leading active and independent lives. Mr. Speaker, I know firsthand the dedicated work these highly skilled professionals perform each day at HealthSouth. Before coming to Con-gress, I worked for 30 years as a thera-pist, a rehabilitation services director, and a licensed nursing home adminis-trator. There is no greater joy than to see your patients make progress after a de-bilitating event such as a stroke, a spi-nal cord injury, a brain injury, or a motor vehicle accident. HealthSouth is fortunate to be led by Chief Executive Officer Susan Hart-man, a long-time rehabilitation profes-sional who joined HealthSouth in 1994 and was named CEO in 2005. I congratulate CEO Hartman and the entire staff at HealthSouth on 35 years of dedicated service to the community. They are committed to providing pa-tients with comfort, professionalism, and respect throughout their rehabili-tation experience, and we are grateful for their high level of care. f 
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to act to reauthorize and extend the Violence Against Women Act. Enacted back in 1994, the Violence Against Women Act has provided in-valuable support and resources to women impacted by domestic violence across Minnesota and across our coun-try. It has funded hundreds of thou-sands of dollars in grants to groups like the Minnesota Coalition Against Sexual Assault, and Cornerstone Advo-cacy Services, which provides coun-seling and therapy services to victims. The Violence Against Women Act, Mr. Speaker, is critical to preventing domestic violence and sexual assault and helping victims get the treatment and justice they deserve. I have authored a provision that has been included in past reauthorizations. For decades the Violence Against Women Act has been reauthorized with strong bipartisan support, but it ex-pires at the end of this month, and I urge my colleagues in joining me in calling for its extension, because vic-tims of domestic violence are counting on it. f 
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, over the last 2 years, members of the Judiciary Committee and my com-mittee, the Criminal Justice Sub-committee, which I serve as the rank-ing member, have worked extensively with groups all over the Nation to re-authorize the Violence Against Women Act, and we have done so in a bipar-tisan and nonpartisan manner. The bill is written. It was introduced on July—just a month ago—26, 2018. Victims are waiting for the reauthor-ization that will improve the Violence Against Women Act. In fact, law en-forcement are waiting, victims are waiting, those who have experienced sexual assault and sexual harassment. And I would just tell my friends on the other side of the aisle, Republican leadership needs to put that bill on the floor of the House and put it on the floor now. Again, this is not a partisan bill. It has been crafted and supported by faith organizations and advocacy groups for women and victims. It is supported by law enforcement. So, Mr. Speaker, we can do our job and we should do our job. When we come back from our recess that we work in our districts, let us put on the floor the Violence Against Women Act and let’s vote for it now.

CONDEMNING IRAN’S PERSECU-TION OF MEMBERS OF THE BAHA’I FAITH (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 274, which was introduced by my colleague, Ms. I
LEANA ROS-LEHTINEN . This legislation condemns the gov-ernment of Iran’s state-sponsored per-secution of its Baha’i minority and its continued violation of international covenants on human rights. Following the Islamic revolution of Iran in 1979, members of the Baha’i Faith, the largest non-Muslim religious minority in the country, have been subjected to relentless persecution. In Iran, no rights or protections are ac-corded to those who are adherents of religions not recognized under the Ira-nian constitution.

PROSTATE CANCER DISPARITY (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, this morn-ing I met with the Prostate Health Education Network and leaders from across the country who are on the frontlines of the fight against prostate cancer. It is critical for African American men and their families that leaders like us raise awareness and funding to end the racial disparity in prostate cancer research. African American men are more like-ly to get prostate cancer, are diagnosed at more advanced stages, and are twice as likely to die as our Caucasian coun-terparts. Fighting cancer requires sustained efforts at all levels to raise awareness to ensure individuals and their families have quality and affordable access to screening and treatment. It is critical that Congress continues putting resources toward ending racial disparity in prostate cancer and healthcare more generally.

THANKING MEMBERS OF CON-GRESS FOR EXPRESSING THEIR CONCERN (Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-mission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, the public often has the impression that we in Congress are not caring people who work together on issues. I want to say to the American people that in the last few days, you could not find a group of people more concerned about their fel-low Members than we have here. We know this hurricane is hitting North Carolina, it is likely to hit South Carolina and possibly Georgia, and I want people to know how much I appreciate Members on both sides of the aisle who have come up to me to ask what impact this is going to have on me, on my district, on the people of my district, and on North Carolina in general. It is very heartwarming to have those concerns expressed. People have said, ‘‘We are praying for you.’’ I know that is the case throughout the country, but I want to particularly say to all of my colleagues—I thanked them all personally—but to all of my colleagues, those who haven’t spoken to me but have spoken to other Mem-bers, thank you very much for your concerns and prayers. I certainly will pass those along to my constituents, but I think it is important that people know we care a great deal about each other and we express that to each other. f 
SUICIDE PREVENTION MONTH The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. M
AST). Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentle-woman from Arizona (Ms. S
INEMA ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the des-ignee of the minority leader. Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of our country’s vet-erans, who make great sacrifices to keep America safe. When they return home from service, it is our responsibility to ensure they receive the care and support of a grate-ful Nation. For far too many veterans, that responsibility is not fulfilled. The government’s failure has tragic con-sequences for those struggling with mental health illnesses. September is Suicide Prevention Month. Americans across the country take time to raise awareness about the tragedy of suicide. We lose an esti-mated 20 veterans to suicide each day, and that is unacceptable. Every year since I have been in Con-gress, we have brought together Repub-licans and Democrats to draw atten-tion to veteran suicide and send a clear message that this epidemic must end. Honoring our commitment to vet-erans is not a partisan issue. We know the only way to achieve real, lasting change for our Nation’s bravest men and women is to bring both parties to-gether to solve this problem. Today, Members from both sides of the aisle have joined me to bring awareness to veteran suicide and we are working together to find solutions. I know we can make bipartisan progress, because we have done it be-fore. We have shown it is possible for both parties to work together to im-prove veterans’ mental healthcare. After hearing the tragic story of a young Arizona veteran who lost his life to suicide in 2013, my team worked across the aisle to pass a bill that im-proved lifesaving VA mental health services for veterans with classified ex-perience. It took 3 years of hard work, but our bill is now law, and it helps veterans successfully transition to ci-vilian life. It is important progress, but there is still so much work left to do. We must serve our bravest men and women, just as they have served us. We challenge the VA, the Depart-ment of Defense, and our fellow law-makers to join us in confronting the tragedy of veteran suicide. We must do more to honor our commitment to American’s veterans. Today and every day, we stand with military families who have lost a loved one to the tragedy of suicide, and we say to you, your family’s sacrifice will not be forgotten. We will not stop until every veteran receives the care that he or she needs. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK ), my friend and colleague, and I am grateful to be joined this afternoon in this Special Order for his comments. Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak of a solemn topic, one of utmost importance for sure, and I want to thank my colleague and my friend, K
YRSTEN SINEMA from Arizona, and for all the work that she is doing for the veterans’ community and for hosting this Special Order. Mr. Speaker, our Nation’s veterans are our finest citizens, to whom we owe the most. Their sacrifice in defense of freedom allows us to stand here today in this chamber, a testament to our values and a symbol of hope. All too often, we see our Nation’s veterans struggle upon their return home. Issues with depression, sub-stance abuse, and post-traumatic stress disorder serve as constant reminders of the price they paid to protect our way of life. b1630 Tragically, we have seen a rising per-centage of these heroes resorting to taking their own lives. This is beyond unacceptable and statistics paint a grim picture of this epidemic. Between 2005 and 2015, Mr. Speaker, suicide rates for all veterans increased by 25 percent—25 percent between 2005 and 2015. Additionally, veterans ac-count for nearly 15 percent of suicides in U.S. adults. Mr. Speaker, we can do better, and we must do better. I am proud to stand here today with my colleagues in soli-darity against veteran suicide. I am thankful for the establishment of the third Veterans Crisis Line call center to provide guidance, support, and crit-ical resources to those in need. While steps are being taken to prevent vet-eran suicide, we still have a long way to go because one hero’s death is one too many. As Congresswoman K
YRSTEN SINEMA  had pointed out, Mr. Speaker, Sep-tember is National Suicide Prevention Awareness Month, but this issue will continue to transcend any time frame. For those who sacrificed for us, we owe them and will continue to fight to eradicate this public health crisis of veteran suicide. Mr. Speaker, I want to, once again, thank Congresswoman S
INEMA for hosting this Special Order. Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker, for many veterans, the return to civilian life can feel overwhelming. Ensuring enough community support and mental health resources are available is essential. We recently heard from Andrew, who lives in Chandler, Arizona. He joined the Marine Corps at 17 years old when he said he was ‘‘full of motivation and excitement’’ to serve. ‘‘I wanted to do my part to protect America,’’ Andrew said. As an antitank assaultman, Andrew fought beside incredible marines in Iraq, and when he finally returned

home, he said he returned with memo-ries of death. Andrew leaned on loved ones and his faith to pull him out of his darkness. Ever since, he has continued his heal-ing journey by serving his fellow vet-erans. He presses forward with the val-ues instilled on him by the Marine Corps: honor, courage, and commit-ment. Responsibility to care for our vet-erans belongs to all of us. That is why we are working with those who inter-act with veterans each and every day: letter carriers, librarians, grocery store clerks, and academic advisers. We are giving community members the tools they need to support veterans every day right where they live and work. We are also working to increase the number of peer supports available to veterans. There are veterans like Andrew who used their experiences, struggles, and accomplishments to help fellow vet-erans successfully navigate the transi-tion to civilian live. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to have a colleague and friend of mine joining us in this Special Order this evening. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-woman from New Hampshire (Ms. K
USTER ), my friend. Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congresswoman for yielding and for hosting this Spe-cial Order on this important issue. Every single day, we ask the men and women who serve our Nation in uni-form to make incredible sacrifices on behalf of our Nation, and they never fail to deliver for us. These brave Americans and their families know the true meaning of service, but that service often comes at a price. Our men and women in uni-form, our veterans, cannot be cast aside once they have returned home. The prevalence of suicide among serv-icemembers and veterans is a stain on our collective conscience. Servicemembers throughout the his-tory of our country have had harrowing experiences in their service to defend this country and protect our way of life. But it has only been recently that the scope of the trauma of war has been truly understood. Since the time of Abraham Lincoln, we, as a country, have made a solemn vow to care for those who have borne the battle, a vow that has made caring for veterans one of the few bipartisan issues in this era of divisiveness in Washington. Today, we must ensure that our sol-emn promise to veterans extends to ef-fective mental healthcare. No veteran should ever have to wait for this type of care, which can be just as crucial for recovery as physical health services. My father, Malcolm McLane, flew fighter planes during World War II. He was shot down in the Battle of the Bulge, and spent 6 months in a German POW camp. When I was a child, he rarely spoke about his experiences dur-ing the war, but now, in hindsight, I be-lieve that he was experiencing what we now know to be PTSD. We understand so much more today about the brain and the impact of trau-ma that so many of our servicemem-bers endure, and it is critical that the VA and our society use that knowledge to improve care for veterans when they return home. We must ensure that the unseen wounds of war receive the attention they deserve. Many of us today voted to fund veterans’ mental health and suicide prevention programs. And while it is commendable that Congress is taking important steps to address this issue, much more needs to be done to ensure that no veteran is left behind. As a member of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I fight for the men and women who fight for us. During Na-tional Suicide Awareness Prevention Month, we should all pledge to work together to ensure that no veteran ever has trouble accessing the mental health services that he or she needs and deserves. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Arizona, KYRSTEN  S
INEMA , for her commitment to this issue. She was very effective in the tes-timony that she brought to the Vet-erans’ Affairs Committee, and I appre-ciate her perseverance. Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. M
AST), my friend and colleague. I thank the Congressman so much for the work that he has done to join us today. I appreciate it. Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I guess I found in my time that suicide is an epi-demic of purpose, and worth, and value. I come to this line of thought be-cause I have had countless veterans call me; reach out to my office; find me on Facebook; find me on some other form of social media; had a member of their family call my office or reach out, a mother, or a spouse, and talk about the fact that their veteran wants to take their life. And in seeing that play out time and time again, I realize each and every time that somebody is out there searching for their value in their life. They are searching for where is their value? Where is their worth to the rest of the world? And for me, that helps me to recognize that this can be prevented. I think veterans face this challenge in a unique way and in an elevated way, not because the challenge of war or recovering from injury is something that cannot be overcome. I think most of us end up finding in our lives that when we have overcome something in-credibly difficult, those are the most memorable and purposeful moments of our life. No person, veteran included, should have to believe that their greatest con-tribution to the world, or to their Na-tion, or to their family, or their com-munity is something that is behind them. That is something that is especially difficult for a veteran to overcome be-cause their worth, and their value, and their work every single day was tied di-rectly to serving all of those things at the highest possible level, serving their brothers and their sisters to their left and right, knowing that on any given day, they might have the opportunity to save a life, to save the life of one of their closest friends that they could ever have in life, a friend that would be willing to do absolutely everything for them, to include sacrificing their own life for that friend of them. It is hard to replicate, maybe impos-sible to replicate, that purpose, and that worth, and that value. And I be-lieve that it is in that that we find such a challenge to overcome suicide with our veterans because of every-thing that they have already given this country, and the drive, and the deter-mination, and the will, and the intes-tinal fortitude inside of our veterans to want to go out there and find the next greatest thing in life, the next greatest way to serve. That is the difficult challenge that we find ourselves trying to overcome. In having so many veterans reach out to me, I have learned this about vet-eran suicide. Each of them who were prevented from taking their life have said that there was nothing I could do, if somebody else didn’t reach out to them. Because I could have not known anybody else that they could have told, that they didn’t tell, they wouldn’t have known. It is in that that I believe it is impor-tant that we as veterans make a com-mitment to one another about being there for one another; about the fact that we had an oath that we never leave a fallen comrade. We always used to say, we always place the mission first, and that mission doesn’t end when we take off that uniform. That mission, that commitment to one an-other, has to continue. As veterans, we make it a point to put the most important things that we care about in word, in verse, things that we memorize. Whether it is the Soldier’s Creed, or the Ranger Creed, or the Special Forces Creed, or some other ethos that we recognize as part of our service. We put it in words and we speak about it, and we say it time, and time, and time again. And that is why I believe that it is important that we as veterans make known in word our commitment to one another; that we are never going to let one of our brothers or sisters be left be-hind; that our commitment to one an-other never ends; that we are never going to allow one of them to bring harm to themselves; that our love for each other never ends. That willingness of what we would go out there and do for one another on the battlefield has no time limit on it, has no fuse. It will never be a wick that burns down. That has to be our com-mitment to one another, to dem-onstrate that kind of love and caring for each other as veterans. It is the only solution that I have been able to

find in my life toward helping with this one veteran, one person at a time, one commitment at a time, a commitment that never ends, and a commitment that has no limits to it. I believe all of our veterans want that and are capable of that, and I am proud of every one of them for that commitment that I know they have in-side of them. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-woman from Arizona (Ms. S
INEMA ) for holding this Special Order. Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker, I want to take a moment to thank my colleague and friend, Congressman M
AST. While he spoke very eloquently about his fel-low veterans, and commitment to serv-ice, and leaving no man behind, he is very humble, and didn’t share all of his own experiences. Congressman M
ASTserved as a staff sergeant in the United States Army and has earned a Bronze Star, Purple Heart, and many other awards for his bravery during battle. And when Con-gressman M
ASTjoined Congress, I will never forget the first time we had a few moments to spend together, and I asked him about his own experiences in the military and since then, and the change that happened in his life after he was injured in battle defending our country. I will never forget Congressman M
AST’s response, which is one of such strength and character, and, I believe, provides such inspiration to other men and women in our country, both those in uniform and those who have re-turned to civilian life as veterans. I want to thank him for his service and for his incredible dedication to helping his fellow men and women who have returned home from battle as well. Earlier in our Special Order, I men-tioned the story of a young veteran in my district. His name was Sergeant Daniel Somers. Sergeant Somers was an Army veteran of two tours in Iraq. He served on Task Force Lightning, an intelligence unit. He ran over 400 com-bat missions as a machine gunner in the turret of a Humvee. Part of his role required him to interrogate dozens of terror suspects. His work was deemed classified. Like many veterans, Daniel was haunted by the war when he returned home. He suffered from flashbacks, nightmares, depression, and additional symptoms of post-traumatic stress dis-order, made worse by a traumatic brain injury. Daniel needed help. He and his family asked for help, but, unfortunately, the VA enrolled Ser-geant Somers in group therapy ses-sions, which he could not attend for fear of disclosing classified informa-tion. b1645 Despite requests for individualized counseling, or some other reasonable accommodation to allow Sergeant Somers to receive appropriate care for his PTSD, the VA delayed providing Sergeant Somers with support and ap-propriate care. Like many, Sergeant Somers’ isola-tion got worse when he transitioned to civilian life. He tried to provide for his family, but he was unable to work due to his disability. Sergeant Somers struggled with the VA bureaucracy. His disability appeal had been pending for more than 2 years in the system without resolution. Ser-geant Somers did not get the help he needed in time. On June 10, 2013, Sergeant Somers wrote a letter to his family. I share a part of his letter every year here on the floor, in memory of Daniel’s pain and in love for his family. In this let-ter, Daniel said: ‘‘I am not getting bet-ter, I am not going to get better, and I will most certainly deteriorate further as time goes on.’’ He goes on to say: ‘‘I am left with ba-sically nothing. Too trapped in a war to be at peace, too damaged to be at war. Abandoned by those who would take the easy route, and a liability to those who stick it out—and thus de-serve better. So you see, not only am I better off dead, but the world is better without me in it. ‘‘This is what brought me to my ac-tual final mission.’’ No one who returns home from serv-ing our country should ever feel like he or she has nowhere to turn, which is why I am committed to continuing to work on both sides of the aisle to en-sure that no veteran ever feels trapped like Sergeant Somers did and that all of our veterans have access to appro-priate mental healthcare. But Sergeant Somers’ story is too fa-miliar to many military families. His parents, Howard and Jean, were dev-astated by the loss of their son, but they bravely shared Sergeant Somers’ story and created a mission of their own. Their mission is to ensure that their son’s memory brought to light Amer-ica’s deadliest war: the 20 veterans that we lose every day to suicide. Many of my colleagues here in Wash-ington have met with Howard and Jean. They are working with Congress and the VA to share their experiences with the VA healthcare system and find ways to improve care for veterans and their families. We worked very closely with Howard and Jean to develop and sign into law the Sergeant Daniel Somers Classified Veterans Access to Care Act. This is a law that ensures that veterans like Daniel, who have had classified or sen-sitive experiences, can access appro-priate mental health services at the VA. Our law directs the Secretary of the VA to establish standards and proce-dures to ensure that any veteran who participated in classified missions or served in a sensitive setting may ac-cess mental healthcare that fully ac-commodates his or her obligation to not improperly disclose classified in-formation. The law also directs the Secretary to disseminate guidance to employees of the Veterans Health Administration, including mental health professionals, on standards and procedures about how to best engage veterans during the course of mental health treatment with respect to classified information. Finally, our law directs the Sec-retary to allow veterans with classified experiences to self-identify, so they can quickly receive care in an appro-priate setting. But that victory is just one small step forward. We still have so much work left to do. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for joining us this evening to talk about the scourge of veteran suicide. This is our sixth year of hosting this Special Order in a bipartisan way to-gether. I look forward to the year when we do not need this Special Order be-cause we have ended the crisis of vet-eran suicide in our country. Until such time, I pledge to continue working with my colleagues to not just tell the stories of veterans who are struggling, veterans who have made it, or veterans we have lost, but to cele-brate our victory of overcoming this crisis and ending this scourge. Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Arkan-sas (Mr. HILL), my friend, who is going to share some of his thoughts and close out our Special Order hour. I thank Congressman H
ILLfor joining us this evening. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. S
INEMA ), my good friend, for yielding. She and I have the pleasure of serving on the House Financial Services Com-mittee together and cooperating on many legislative measures and regu-latory measures that benefit our econ-omy, so I thank her for that work. I greatly appreciate her stepping up and reaching out across the aisle on the subject of suicide, particularly during Suicide Prevention Month, and letting all of us have an opportunity to share our perspective on this national trag-edy. Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States. There is an average of 123 suicides per day. What could be more tragic than that? Yet, I don’t see nearly the people on the floor tonight that there should be, because this affects all our districts so tragically. One in five are suffering with some form of mental illness in our country, a problem that has disrupted so many families, caused too much vio-lence and pain, and caused far too many lives. Representative S
INEMA and I talk about this every time the subject comes up. When I was a high school senior, I can’t remember a friend that was a vic-tim of suicide. But, Mr. Speaker, my kids just turned 19 and 21, and within 4 or 5 years of their ages, I can think of six families who have lost a child to suicide—different reasons, same trag-edy. So our families are hurting from the scourge of suicide.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH8254 September 13, 2018 
In Congress, this is an area where we work together, the 21st Century Cures Act, where we attacked the first com-prehensive approach to mental illness treatment in decades, where we say we want people with mental illness and who need treatment to get it. We worked together most recently on the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention Act for American veterans, and the National Suicide Hotline Improvement Act— small steps, but concrete steps that call attention to suicide, particularly in our veterans community. The VA is helping on this issue and marked Suicide Prevention Month with its Be There campaign. This campaign highlights the risk factors and warning signs for suicide, provides information about VA mental health and suicide prevention resources, and helps indi-viduals and organizations start the conversation around veteran mental health in their communities. Our VA employees must have the necessary resources to offer guidance to veterans while providing essential suicide prevention services. This is a together thing. This is an ‘‘all of us in this together’’ thing. Mr. Speaker, I have a chair in my front office in my district office in Lit-tle Rock that was hand-painted to raise money for suicide awareness and suicide prevention. On that chair, it says: ‘‘We Are The 22.’’ This is a non-profit organization in my community started by veterans helping veterans, because it is not an ‘‘us and they’’ thing. It is an ‘‘us’’ thing. It is a ‘‘we’’ thing. We are all in this together. We are the 22, the number that we have as the estimate of veterans who are taking their own lives. So I want to echo the Speaker pro tempore this afternoon, a distinguished American and distinguished veteran and brave, heroic representative of our Armed Forces, our patriots, the people who defend our liberties, when he said we don’t leave people behind. We don’t leave a sailor, a marine, or a soldier on the battlefield. We bring them home. Just last week, we honored John McCain on the floor of this House. And S
AMJOHNSON , leaving the House this year—Representative S
CHWEIKERT was there—he was in the Hanoi Hilton with John McCain. We don’t leave a man or woman behind on the battlefield. But when they come home, we equally should not leave them behind. I really commend the Speaker’s com-ments that the mission is not over. All of us have that partnership and sense of duty to carry that mission forward on the home front when we are out of harm’s way and out of theater. To me, it is that buddy system that we all learn, whether it is in boot camp or swim team, you team up; you check in on each other; you don’t leave peo-ple alone. That is the secret, I think, to preventing suicide. I lost a good friend of mine, a frater-nity brother, a partner in a law firm in Houston, Texas. He never once inti-mated to his wife, to his children, or to his law partners that anything was wrong, and they got the call that he had been found. Check in: How are you doing? So we are the 22. We are on the buddy system. We don’t leave our warriors be-hind. The mission continues here. All those things are true. I carry in my wallet, Mr. Speaker, the veterans crisis hotline as a re-minder to me that we want our vet-erans to reach out if there is a moment of crisis. If somebody is watching this or hear-ing the words of brave BRIAN MAST, or the emotional content and leadership of Representative K
YRSTEN SINEMA  from Arizona, and you are having that moment now as a veteran, I urge you to call 1–800–273–8255 for yourself, for a friend, for a neighbor. We, in Congress, are fighting to make sure that that veterans hotline is a value, that it is answered, and that we are part of that thin thread of connectivity between all of us that keeps us right on the moment. Mr. Speaker, I see my friend from Ar-izona is here. It was a pleasure to have both of my friends from Arizona talk about their senior Senator last week, John McCain, and what he meant to each of us and what he has meant to our country. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. S
CHWEIKERT ), my friend, now on the House Ways and Means Committee, for-merly of the best committee in the House, the House Financial Services Committee. Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. H
ILLfor yielding. And to the gentlewoman from Arizona, I thank her for doing this every year. This is one of those moments where you are walking toward the micro-phone because we just got out of votes in Ways and Means, and you are sort of discussing in your head whether you ultimately tell the personal story. I have two I want to share. My reason for doing this is, if some-one is watching, we have someone in our life, and you are having self-de-structive thoughts, please, please reach out, get the help, and understand the devastation that happens and the pain that happens when someone takes their life. My two stories. When I very first got elected in the Phoenix-Scottsdale area, one of the very first constituent meet-ings I had was with a mom. Her son had been part of the Phoenix VA. She al-ways felt that the prescriptions he was given put him into an emotional spiral. They kept trying to get him mental health services. They felt all that he was receiving was more prescriptions and a future date for mental health services. And he took his life. That mother, the pain, the tears, the crushing blow, what the loss of her son’s life meant to that family. I believe now, a few years later, the Phoenix VA is better. They have learned a lot, they understand how to be almost a quick reaction force in helping an individual. But we need to make sure these things never happen again. Now for the personal one that I have never told in public. b1700 I was born in an unwed mothers’ home in L.A. I was adopted. It turns out the gentleman who adopted me had multiple sclerosis. But he was a vet-eran, and he was receiving his medical treatments from VA. This is a long, long time ago, but this is about the pain that comes when a veteran takes his or her life. Because of the pharmaceuticals he was given, the lack of emotional coun-seling, and the failure to properly diag-nose his disease, he put himself in a car in a garage, turned on the motor, and took his life. That was my dad. Some time later, my mother remar-ried Mr. Schweikert. I got readopted, and I was blessed to grow up in a won-derful household that had brought me to Arizona. Many years later when I was a young adult, my mom sat me down and told me the story. You could tell there was still that burning hole in her heart of finding her husband, my dad, dead in that car, having taken his own life, be-lieving it was the failure of the very services he was receiving from the VA. Now it is decades later, and I believe we have learned a lot. This body has tried as hard as it can to get their heads around: Are we allowing too many pharmaceuticals to be pre-scribed? Are we not providing emo-tional services? Do we need to put re-sources into having that communal get-together, the quick reaction force? I believe it is getting better. But understand the pain that Mom shared with me when I was first elected about the loss of her son. Even these many, many years later, it is still part of our family’s legacy of that pain. If this body can do anything, if we can find ways to make that pain come to an end, then we will have done some-thing very honorable and very power-ful. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. H
ILLfor yielding to me. Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for partici-pating, and I thank his colleague, Rep-resentative S
INEMA , for her heartfelt tribute that she has carried on since she has been in the House to bring at-tention to suicide prevention. I also commend the House for the ef-forts that it has taken on mental health and on suicide prevention, par-ticularly for our veterans. Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of one of Arkansas’ marketing and public rela-tions geniuses and a dear friend, Mr. Ron Robinson, who recently passed away at the age of 75. Born and raised in my hometown of Little Rock, Ron had a natural talent for media and journalism at a very young age. As a teenager, he worked as a sports writer for the Arkansas Ga-zette and was paid $1 an hour. After graduating from the University of Arkansas with a degree in jour-nalism, Ron joined the Air Force, serv-ing as a public information officer. He quickly rose to the rank of captain and earned a Bronze Star for his service in Vietnam and the Air Force Commenda-tion Medal in 1969 for his support of the Apollo 11 mission to the Moon. A year later, he joined Cranford Johnson Robinson Woods, CJRW, as di-rector of public relations. He would eventually become chairman and CEO until his retirement in 1996. Ron received many awards for his contributions to Arkansas and the journalism industry. He was honored in 2005 as a distinguished alumnus of the J. William Fulbright College of Arts and Sciences and inducted into the Lemke Journalism Society Hall of Honor in 2016. Ron was a role model and friend for many across the State of Arkansas, and I extend my respect, affection, and prayers to his friends, his family, and his many, many mentees during his years of service. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF DAVID W . MULLINS , JR. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I come to the House floor today to honor the life of a longtime work colleague and friend, David W. Mullins Jr., who recently passed away at the age of 72. David had a remarkable career of public service, including working in both the Department of the Treasury and as a member of the Federal Re-serve Board of Governors. It was a pleasure to work with him in Domestic Finance at the Department of the Treasury under President George H.W. Bush. David’s journey began in Fayette-ville, Arkansas, where his father was president of the University of Arkan-sas. David attended Fayetteville High School before graduating from Yale University with a degree in administra-tive sciences. He then pursued graduate work at MIT, and there he completed his Ph.D. in economics and finance. David’s public service began shortly after the stock market crash in 1987, and his expertise proved vital toward the rejuvenation of the economy and the resolution of the savings and loan crisis under the Reagan and Bush ad-ministrations. Mr. Speaker, he was a thoughtful leader, a friend to many, and I extend my respect, affection, and prayers to his friends, family, and loved ones. HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF MR . DON 
ZIMMERMAN  
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of one of Arkansas’ statewide leaders, Mr. Don Zimmerman, who recently passed away at the age of 75. Don worked as executive director for the Arkansas Municipal League for over four decades and was there at the time of his death. A graduate of the University of Ar-kansas with a degree in business ad-ministration, Don first joined the Ar-kansas Municipal League back in 1966 as a field representative before work-ing his way up to the executive direc-tor position in 1974. Two years ago, he became the first State Municipal League employee to be recognized by the National League of Cities for 50 years of service. Don also served two terms on the board of direc-tors of the National League of Cities. Mr. Speaker, he was a friend to many across our State of Arkansas, and I ex-tend my respect, affection, and prayers to his friends, family, and loved ones. 
RECOGNIZING OLAN WAGES , ONE OF ARKANSAS ’ 
FINEST  
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize one of Arkansas’ finest, Olan Wages, who recently died at the age of 95. A veteran of the Army, who served in World War II, Olan Wages was at the Battle of the Bulge. Mr. Wages’ story is one that makes all Arkansans proud. For his service, he was awarded two Purple Hearts with oakleaf cluster, four Bronze Stars, a Good Conduct Medal, a World War II Commemorative Medal, a Normandy Jubilee of Liberty Medal, and a French Legion of Honor Medal, among others. Mr. Wages is survived by his three loving daughters, Brenda, Marcia, and Kay. Mr. Speaker, Olan’s example is one all Americans and Arkansans can ad-mire, and I extend my respect, affec-tion, and prayers to his friends, family, and loved ones. 
RECOGNIZING THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF KEVONTAE  
CARTER  
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-ognize the achievements of Kevontae Carter, a junior at Philander Smith College in my hometown of Little Rock. I am pleased to announce that the White House Initiative on Histori-cally Black Colleges and Universities has named him an inaugural Competi-tiveness Scholar. Competitiveness Scholars are students who have exhib-ited exceptional academic achieve-ment, engagement with their commu-nities, and an entrepreneurial spirit. Kevontae, who is majoring in biology and minoring in mathematics, was per-sonally nominated for this honor by Philander’s president, Dr. Roderick Smothers. A leader on campus, he serves as a student ambassador for the United Negro College Fund, of which Philander is the only member in the State of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I honor Kevontae’s commitment to excellence and com-mend him on being named to this dis-tinguished fellowship. RECOGNIZING MS . ANNIE ABRAMS  
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, it gives me a lot of pleasure today to recognize a dear friend and a civil rights icon from Arkansas, Ms. Annie Abrams, and wish her a very, very happy 87th birthday. Ms. Abrams has served her State and country tirelessly throughout her ca-reer, from her involvement in the de-segregation of Central High School to her role with the Arkansas Teachers Association, including becoming the first African American PTA president at Central High. Born in Arkadelphia, Ms. Abrams moved to Little Rock at the age of 13 to pursue a better education, and she graduated from Dunbar High School and later Philander Smith College with a degree in special education. She continues to be involved in many local community service organizations, including the Little Rock Central High Integration 50th Anniversary Commis-sion, a commissioner for the Fair Hous-ing Commission, and treasurer of the Arkansas Democratic Black Caucus. As a local educator and civic and community leader, Ms. Abrams has en-riched the lives of countless Arkansans and Americans. She is the busiest woman I know, particularly for some-one on the cusp of an 87th birthday. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to our next opportunity to be together, and I thank her for her lifetime of service to our community. 
RECOGNIZING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE  
CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL INTEGRATION  
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, 61 years ago today, all eyes were on South Park Street that fronts the beautiful facade of Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas. Just days before, the Arkan-sas Governor, Orval Faubus, had called out the National Guard to prevent nine Black students from entering that school on September 4. Central High and its beautiful neigh-borhood had become ground zero in the march to end the five-decade legacy of Plessy v. Ferguson, separate but equal. Now, just over 3 years after the Brown v. Board of Education decision, it was time for action. In a few days, on the 25th of this month, we will celebrate the successful integration of Central High School when the Little Rock Nine entered the school, escorted by the 101st Airborne Division. It is fitting today, Mr. Speaker, that we pay tribute to the Little Rock Nine, their defenders, and the successful end to separate but equal. I am proud to recognize this important milestone today on this House floor and remem-ber passing the bill 1 year ago that I authored that expands the park bound-ary of the National Historic Site at Little Rock Central High School. This is a historic and an important touch-stone for all those modern-day history travelers retracing the steps of the civil rights movement.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH8256 September 13, 2018 
The National Historic Site Visitor Center was opened in 2007 on the occa-sion of the 50th anniversary of Central High’s integration. My bill extended the park boundaries to take in the houses that fronted the school along South Park Street so that future gen-erations will be able to picture that street just as it was and reflect on those 21 days of trauma back in 1957. Bringing the properties into the boundary of the site provides the Na-tional Park Service with more tools and flexibility for partnering with the homeowners to historically preserve their front facade and the yards of those homes. Together with the school, the seven homes across the street from Central High will now stand as a living monument to the civil rights move-ment in Arkansas and the United States. I want to thank the National Park Service superintendent at that site, Robin White, for her leadership and her persistent work with the community to enhance it as an educational resource and a key stop on the Civil Rights Trail. The Little Rock Nine’s brave actions integrating Little Rock Central High will forever be remembered for their unparalleled role in ending so-called separate but equal. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize the 61st anniver-sary of these brave actions by those young people. b1715 
RECOGNIZING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF WOMEN  
THROUGHOUT HISTORY  
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the important accom-plishments of women throughout his-tory and to call attention to the mil-lions of women across the globe who lack access to education and are denied access to opportunity. Small businesses are the engines of our economy in Arkansas and across our entire Nation. They create and sup-port jobs within our local communities and employ approximately half of all private-sector workers in the United States. According to the Small Business Ad-ministration, 30 million small busi-nesses in the U.S. make up over 99 per-cent of our Nation’s businesses; and of those, 11.4 million are women-owned businesses, employing nearly 9 million people. They are centers of innovation, discovery, and opportunity, empow-ering and equipping Americans for suc-cess. Everyone should have the oppor-tunity to rise, but in America, women entrepreneurs face barriers to certain business resources that many males with similar aspirations don’t. We have got to work hard for our hardworking Americans and our hard-working American families. In Arkan-sas, Winrock International is doing just that through its Arkansas Wom-en’s Business Center. The Arkansas Women’s Business Center provides training, counseling, and access to cap-ital for women who want their business to grow and become competitive. Though obstacles to entrepreneur-ship and opportunity also exist outside the U.S., there are entities, including Winrock, supporting solutions that promote prosperity and provide a means for women to flourish around the world. I had a chance to visit with a very hardworking, enterprising, caring young woman from my hometown of Little Rock, recently, whose innova-tive efforts were to eradicate hopeless-ness and give hope to those in poverty by lifting them up and aiding their pur-suit of happiness and promoting the fruits of the dignity of work. Anna Taylor is the founder of the clothing company Judith & James of the nonprofit James127 Foundation. She started her remarkable journey during her family’s mission work in Af-rica. Inspired by the desire and drive of the Kenyan women she encountered, Anna set out to work with them to en-sure that they have the opportunity to provide for their loved ones and them-selves. Today, her foundation provides practical and hands-on sewing training to Kenyan widows, offering hope and a future to women whose communities have been ravaged by poverty and dis-ease. When you empower women, you em-power their communities. For too long, too many young girls and women throughout the world con-tinue to be denied an effective edu-cation. We must continue to work to address this injustice and ensure that all women are provided fundamental freedoms in the political, social, cul-tural, economic, and civic fields. So I would like to applaud the House on its recent passage of H.R. 5480, the Women’s Entrepreneurship and Eco-nomic Empowerment Act, and com-mend my fellow Arkansan, Senator J
OHN BOOZMAN , for introducing its companion in the Senate. As the proud father of a daughter studying hard in college—I hope she is studying hard—I believe that it is crit-ical that we all support all of our aspir-ing young women. I urge the Senate to act quickly on this important legisla-tion. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
f 
ISSUES OF THE DAY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-uary 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. G
OHMERT ) for 30 minutes. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, our thoughts and prayers will continue for the folks who are in harm’s way with the hurricane coming ashore. I am grateful for all of those who are serv-ing, State, Federal, and local officials, trying to keep people safe. They will continue to be in our thoughts and prayers. I am very grateful that President Trump hasn’t waited. They mobilized. They have got Federal folks on the ground ready to go. I am also glad it got downgraded to some extent, but it is still going to be a rough go for folks, their homes, and their goods. So we will continue to re-member them. I am grateful for those first responders out there ready to serve. We just remembered 9/11 this week. Those of us who were old enough to know what happened that day will never forget what happened. We will never forget where we were. I will never forget the next day, Sep-tember 12. In my hometown of Tyler, just like in hundreds of thousands of towns and cities around the country, people came together and we prayed to-gether. We sang hymns together. We held hands and sang together. It was a powerful day. And I will always remember there were people from all different races, ages, both genders, people of all walks of life, but we gathered there in soli-darity. What I noticed that day was that there were no hyphenated Ameri-cans. We were just Americans. That is what everybody said, and that is what everybody was. It was an incredible day that an act of sheer hatred, evil, wanting to de-stroy freedom and the freest country with the best founding document that would allow freedom, they wanted it all destroyed. But there was a lot of love that next day. It is unfortunate that, 17 years later, we don’t see that kind of harmony. It used to be that, in this body, we would disagree, but, as the House rules require, we wouldn’t call into question any other elected official’s motivation, intentions. We would say we all want is what is best for the country. We all want to keep our oath to the Constitu-tion. But it appears that some don’t want to follow those rules anymore. In fact, some of the very people who have been in this room, in the Senate, here in Washington, in front of the press around the country, people who have demanded that the Federal Govern-ment get involved and stop bullying at all levels, including threatening, harassing little children in elementary school because the Federal Govern-ment felt like it had to intervene and prevent bullies even at such an early age, yet some of those same people who have been calling for Federal interven-tion to stop bullying have become the biggest bullies in the United States of America. It is unbelievable how people would be encouraged by elected officials to bully, harass people with whom they disagree. If you can find them in public anywhere, intimidate, scream at them, run them out. Don’t let them eat. Don’t let them do anything. Don’t let them shop. Bully them until you drive them out and you intimidate them so much that they are afraid to express

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8257 September 13, 2018 
their political opinion or to continue to work in a Republican administra-tion or as a Republican in the House. It is just unbelievable. It has, clearly, in-cited people to go out and commit bul-lying and sometimes physical assaults. But you also look at some of the other things that have gone on: people who are completely disloyal to the President for whom they work will go to the extent of committing crimes be-cause they don’t like the President, even to the extent of, as a former judge, what I would call committing a fraud upon the FISA court. That is the way it appeared to me. The FISA judges granted four dif-ferent warrants to surveil people in the Trump campaign and administration, one of whom, Rod Rosenstein, I have asked him if he even read the applica-tions and affidavits. He never would answer the question, which, as we know from Watergate days, that is a nondenial denial. Clearly, when they would not admit that Rosenstein had read the application, he said: I didn’t know how things work. Well, I know how they are supposed to work. If you come before a judge and you sign a document in an effort to get that judge to encroach on the constitu-tional rights of American citizens, you better know what you are doing. Rosenstein defrauded the court. But the reason they possibly did not de-fraud the court is if the court was en-gaged in fraud itself. The only reason I would raise that is because the FISA judges who were granting warrants based on false infor-mation, incomplete information, mis-leading information, it is possibly be-cause they were okay with helping to use the color of the law to violate American citizens’ rights. Maybe there is a 1983 civil rights ac-tion there against judges and those who participated. Who knows. I can’t help but wonder about the integrity of judges who are not upset that lawyers came in from the Justice Department and manipulated them into signing a warrant four times when it should never have been signed once. Then we find out this guy, Halper, who is supposed to have identified Mike Flynn and the relationship with Russians, it turns out he had gotten contracts from the Defense Depart-ment—I think one was over $600,000, another over $400,000—and it was flagged by a very dedicated, devoted employee of the Defense Department whose job it was to analyze contracts to make sure they were legitimate and people were doing what they were sup-posed to. His name is Adam Lovinger. He saw those contracts and thought: This is very strange, two contracts worth over a million dollars to one per-son and there doesn’t appear to be any-thing that he is getting. Well, he was being paid by the Fed-eral Government to set up somebody in the Trump campaign as someone who had been dealing with Russians, who had been paying Russians to come speak at his conferences or seminars, who had an ongoing relationship with Russians, so he would later say: Gee, this guy from the Trump campaign was getting too cozy with the Russians, so I quit. You mean the guys that you had this ongoing relationship with and paid them to come and speak at your con-ferences, you were concerned about someone from the Trump administra-tion or who worked with Trump in the campaign actually speaking to the peo-ple you have been hiring for a number of years? b1730 It is just fraudulent what they were doing. Incredible. And I had hoped, when Christopher Wray took over at the FBI—well, I don’t really know him—but maybe he’ll help clean up the disaster that was created by the weaponization of the Department of Justice, and particularly the FBI, by Comey, McCabe, Strzok, Page, so many of those—Bruce Ohr—who were work-ing at DOJ or FBI. But we got a solid piece of evidence that Christopher Wray is not the an-swer; he is part of the problem. And that came as was reported in this story Wednesday, August 29, 2018. As the headline from Newsmax says: ‘‘FBI: No Evidence Clinton Server Hacked De-spite Trump Tweet.’’ Well, Christopher Wray had to ap-prove that, and either he is completely, objectively incompetent or he intended to slap the President with a fraud by omission and also to slap—figuratively speaking—our Intel community. It wasn’t the FBI that found that Hil-lary Clinton’s server had been hacked and that over 30,000 of her emails—all but 4, and the 4 really didn’t amount to anything—all went to a foreign coun-try’s intelligence apparatus. They had hacked it, put instructions on there. So then, we know that because the Intel community has made—they knew with 100 percent certainty that that had happened. They found it. They found the anomaly. They found the em-bedded instruction that was placed when her server was hacked. And I know there have been allega-tions that perhaps Hillary Clinton’s classified information that went through the unclassified private server may have gotten some of our under-cover people killed in China. I don’t know if that is what got them killed or not, but it certainly wouldn’t have helped. Nonetheless, the Intel community in-spector general, who back then was Chuck McCullough, and Investigator Frank Rucker are the ones who found that. And I haven’t talked to Mr. Coats, but this was a slap at the Intel community, basically saying, Hey, we at the FBI didn’t find any evidence her private server was hacked, so anybody who says they did is just totally wrong because, if the FBI doesn’t find it, no-body in the Intel community of the United States is competent enough to find such a hacking. Well, Chris Wray and whoever fed him this statement to put out publicly were wrong. Our Intel community was good enough. They did find that her private server was hacked. And the emails did not go to Russia or any rep-resentatives or agency affiliated with Russia. Richard Pollock wrote that he had confirmed that it went to China. I didn’t say that when I questioned Mr. Strzok, but that has been reported. If Mr. Wray is going to continue in his efforts to slap—fraudulently, real-ly—at the President and our Intel com-munity, he really ought to just volun-tarily step down. The FBI has had so many thousands and thousands of honest, ethical, up-right FBI agents, because I have known many. And they need somebody who will help the FBI get its reputation back. When the current FBI director engages in this kind of fraud by omis-sion, then he is not the answer; he is trying to salvage a great reputation that has been destroyed during the Obama administration, and he is not going to get it back by misrepresenta-tions, by omissions. Hopefully he’ll do the right thing and let us get somebody to replace him soon who will clean things up. In the meantime, that is a little scary. Now, I also had noted an article I had never noticed before and a friend point-ed it out. I had never heard of this. I had to go back and look. A New York publication by Chris Smith, October 20 of 2003. The byline under it says: ‘‘Mr. Comey goes to Washington.’’ Byline says: ‘‘Just as his terrorism and cor-porate-corruption cases here are heat-ing up’’—apparently in New York— ‘‘United States Attorney James Comey is heading south to become John Ashcroft’s deputy. What’s a nice, non-partisan prosecutor going to do in a Justice Department like that?’’ Well, it doesn’t sound like they were big fans of John Ashcroft, who is really a fine, dedicated, upstanding indi-vidual. He must have been feeling a lit-tle bit giddy. He is going to be the dep-uty, Department of Justice. And so he said far more than was good for his rep-utation. It says, in the fourth paragraph: ‘‘Comey has been savaged by William Safire and lauded by C
HUCK SCHUMER ; just what kind of Republican is he, anyway? This sets Comey howling again.’’ Then the quote from Comey. He says: ‘‘I must be doing something right. In college, I was left of center, and through a gradual process I found my-self more comfortable with a lot of the ideas and approaches the Republicans were using.’’ The article says: He voted for Carter in 1980, but in 1984, Comey said: ‘‘I voted for Reagan.’’ These are Comey’s words: ‘‘I’d moved from Communist to whatever I am now. I’m not even sure,’’ Comey says, ‘‘how to characterize my-self politically. Maybe at some point I’ll have to figure it out.’’ It says in the article: ‘‘On the surface it’s an odd pairing: Comey—who cites

liberal theologian Reinhold Niebuhr as a formative influence,’’ which is a lit-tle disturbing, ‘‘and who can sing along with Good Charlotte pop-punk hits— and Ashcroft.’’ But anyway, that was interesting. I did not know that Comey had admitted to being a commie, but Comey the commie is no longer in charge of the FBI. And it still boggles the mind that Rod Rosenstein would do a memo-randum telling the President: You need to fire Comey. He hasn’t been intellec-tually honest. You need to fire him. Causes are all here. So the President relies on Rosenstein and fires Comey; and then, what, the next day Rosenstein turns around and says: Oh, well, there is cause to appoint a special counsel to investigate the President for supposedly obstruction of justice for firing Comey, because the President followed Rosenstein’s rec-ommendation. The mere fact that Rosenstein would appoint a special counsel to investigate the President for doing what Rosen-stein said should have been enough to get him fired back then. What kind of manipulative little demon would say, ‘‘Fire Comey,’’ and then the advice is followed and then he appoints a pros-ecutor to try to disrupt him and re-move him from office. I mean, it is like some kind of game: Oh, I know. I will set up the President. I will tell him to fire Comey, and then we can use that to investigate him for the rest of his time as President. Well, hopefully—and I have been hop-ing for a long time that Rosenstein’s days are numbered. Of course, he was the U.S. attorney who was in charge of the investigation investigating Russia and their illegal efforts to obtain American uranium. He would also be the same person, along with FBI Direc-tor Mueller and a guy named Weissmann, who is currently working for Mueller, who made sure that their undercover guy who was gathering in-formation to show how illegally Russia was acting, make sure he signs a non-disclosure agreement. They threaten him, we are told, that he either sign the nondisclosure or they would prosecute him. So he signs it. Because they did not want anybody talking about how illegally Russia was acting because, if they had, then the committee that had to approve foreign investments in the United States, CFIUS, they could not have voted to allow Russia to get a hold of 20 or so percent of American uranium. And if they were not allowed to get hold of that much uranium, then, of course, there would not have been the $145 mil-lion or so that went into the Clinton Foundation. Then we get this reporter from FOX News: ‘‘John Kerry slammed for ‘shameful’ shadow diplomacy after ad-mitting to meetings with Iran.’’ Now, I think there is a word for it, but when someone goes and tries to un-dermine the United States President’s administration from protecting the country, America, from the biggest supporter of terrorism in the world, I don’t know what you would call that, but it seems like, if you have a Presi-dent, in President Trump, trying to protect America from terrorist attacks that would be funded by the biggest supporter of terrorism in the world, Iran, and you have somebody else from America go over and try to save the deal that was going to help Iran be more of a threat to America—gee, that seems like people used to get pros-ecuted about things like that. Seemed like there was somebody named Rosenstein or Rosenberg back there that was not a help to the United States. I think back then they were hanging traitors. But, in any event, in-teresting. Also yesterday, committee chair R
ICHARD BURR from North Carolina, who has bent over backwards, done ev-erything he can to get Justice and In-telligence to produce any kind of evi-dence whatsoever showing Trump or his administration colluded with the Russians, he comes out yesterday and says the panel has found ‘‘no hard evi-dence of collusion’’ between the Trump campaign and Russia. So it is just amazing. It sounds like we still need a housecleaning at the FBI at the very top. And this out today from the New York Post that Strzok and Page texts are a disaster and embarrassment to the FBI, DOJ. And it has this tweet from the Presi-dent: ‘‘More text messages between former FBI employees Peter Strzok and Lisa Page are a disaster and em-barrassment to the FBI and DOJ. ‘‘This should never have happened, but we are learning more and more by the hour. ‘Others were leaking like mad’ in order to get the President.’’ b1745 ‘‘In the lengthy exchange, the two ex-lovers talk about a leak operation for ‘political’ purposes. ‘‘‘Oh, remind me to tell you tomor-row about the Times doing a story about the RNC hacks,’ Page wrote to Strzok, who replied, ‘And more than they already did? I told you Quinn told me they pulling out all the stops on some story . . . ’ ‘‘‘Quinn’ could be referring to Rich-ard Quinn, chief of the Media and In-vestigative Publicity Section in the FBI’s Office of Public Affairs. . . . ‘‘Strzok then texted Page, ‘Think our sisters have begun leaking like mad. Scorned and worried, and political, they’re kicking into overdrive.’ ‘‘It’s unclear,’’ the story says, ‘‘whom he was referring to as ‘sisters,’ but re-tired FBI Special Agent John Iannarelli told Fox it could be another government agency. ‘‘Earlier this week, a report from Rep. M
ARKMEADOWS . . . a member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said a new Strzok- Page text from April 2017 showed them discussing a ‘media leak strategy’.’’ So this is serious stuff. And, appar-ently, we don’t have somebody at the top of the FBI who will get this cleaned up. There are plenty of FBI agents across the country that could get things cleaned up. We know there is at least one here in Washington, D.C., that is good at coverups, but most of the rank-and-file FBI agents are classy, honorable, decent, upright in-vestigators who honor their oath every day, and, who, I keep hearing from dif-ferent times, different places, are real-ly upset with the damage that the peo-ple like Comey, Strzok, Page, Ohr, the damage they have done to their reputa-tion for what used to be a sterling FBI. So it is time to clean house. Rosen-stein has got to go. Chris Wray needs to be replaced by somebody that is not going to try to keep slapping the Presi-dent when he is wrong about the FBI. Hopefully, we are going to see that come in the next few weeks. We will see. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. f

ICHARD J. D URBIN  (Except Senate re-ceding on Senate section 252), Managers on the Part of the Senate. JOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT OF THE COMMITTEE OF CONFERENCE The managers on the part of the House and Senate at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 6157) making appropriations for the Department of De-fense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and for other purposes, submit the fol-lowing joint statement to the House and Senate in explanation of the effect of the ac-tion agreed upon by the managers and rec-ommended in the accompanying conference report. This conference agreement includes the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2019, the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019, and the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019. The Senate amendment included the Senate version of the Defense Appropriations bill (S. 3159) and added the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education and Related Agencies bill (S. 3158). The House bill in-cluded the House version of the Defense Ap-propriations bill (H.R. 6157) only. H.R. 6157 was passed by the House on June 28, 2018 and used as the vehicle for the Senate amend-ment, which passed the Senate on August 23, 2018. The agreement also includes continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2019. Section 1 of the conference agreement is the short title of the bill. Section 2 of the conference agreement dis-plays a table of contents. Section 3 of the conference agreement states that, unless expressly provided other-wise, any reference to ‘‘this Act’’ contained in any division shall be treated as referring only to the provisions of that division. Section 4 provides a statement of appro-priations. The conference agreement does not contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits as defined by clause 9 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives. DIVISION A—DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2019 The conference agreement on the Depart-ment of Defense Appropriations Act, 2019, in-corporates some of the provisions of both the House and Senate versions of the bill. The language and allocations set forth in House Report 115–769 and Senate Report 115–290 should be complied with unless specifically addressed in the accompanying bill and statement of the managers to the contrary. 
DEFINITION OF PROGRAM , PROJECT , AND 
ACTIVITY  For the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Public Law 99–177), as amended by the Bal-anced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Reaffirmation Act of 1987 (Public Law 100– 119), and by the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (Public Law 101–508), the terms ‘‘pro-gram, project, and activity’’ for appropria-tions contained in this Act shall be defined as the most specific level of budget items identified in the Department of Defense Ap-propriations Act, 2019, the related classified annexes and explanatory statements, and the P–1 and R–1 budget justification documents as subsequently modified by congressional action. The following exception to the above defi-nition shall apply: the military personnel and the operation and maintenance ac-counts, for which the term ‘‘program, project, and activity’’ is defined as the ap-propriations accounts contained in the De-partment of Defense Appropriations Act. At the time the President submits the budget request for fiscal year 2020, the Sec-retary of Defense is directed to transmit to the congressional defense committees budget justification documents to be known as the ‘‘M–1’’ and the ‘‘O–1’’ which shall identify, at the budget activity, activity group, and sub- activity group level, the amounts requested by the President to be appropriated to the Department of Defense for military per-sonnel and operation and maintenance in any budget request, or amended budget re-quest, for fiscal year 2020. REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE  The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to follow the reprogramming guid-ance for acquisition accounts as specified in the report accompanying the House version of the Department of Defense Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008 (House Report 110– 279). The dollar threshold for reprogramming funds shall be $10,000,000 for military per-sonnel; $15,000,000 for operation and mainte-nance; $20,000,000 for procurement; and $10,000,000 for research, development, test and evaluation. Also, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is directed to continue to pro-vide the congressional defense committees annual DD Form 1416 reports for titles I and II and quarterly, spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 reports for Service and defense wide ac-counts in titles III and IV of this Act. Re-ports for titles III and IV shall comply with guidance specified in the explanatory state-ment accompanying the Department of De-fense Appropriations Act, 2006. The Depart-ment shall continue to follow the limitation that prior approval reprogrammings are set at either the specified dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or research, de-velopment, test and evaluation line, which-ever is less. These thresholds are cumulative from the base for reprogramming value as modified by any adjustments. Therefore, if the combined value of transfers into or out of a military personnel (M–1), an operation and maintenance (O–1), a procurement (P–1), or a research, development, test and evalua-tion (R–1) line exceeds the identified thresh-old, the Secretary of Defense must submit a prior approval reprogramming to the con-gressional defense committees. In addition, guidelines on the application of prior ap-proval reprogramming procedures for con-gressional special interest items are estab-lished elsewhere in this statement. 
FUNDING INCREASES  The funding increases outlined in the ta-bles for each appropriation account shall be provided only for the specific purposes indi-cated in the tables. 
CONGRESSIONAL SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS  Items for which additional funds have been provided or items for which funding is spe-cifically reduced as shown in the project level tables or in paragraphs using the phrase ‘‘only for’’ or ‘‘only to’’ are congres-sional special interest items for the purpose of the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount, as specifically addressed in the explanatory statement. 
CLASSIFIED ANNEX  Adjustments to classified programs are ad-dressed in the accompanying classified annex. 
OTHER TRANSACTION AUTHORITY  The conferees support the use of Other Transaction Authority (OTA) pursuant to section 2371b of title 10, United States Code for prototyping projects to enhance the mis-sion effectiveness of the Department of De-fense. However, the conferees are concerned with the lack of transparency surrounding the employment of OTA, particularly for fol-low-on production. Therefore, the conferees direct the Secretary of Defense to provide quarterly reports to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees not later than 30 days after the close of each fiscal quarter, detailing the Department’s execution of funds for OTA prototype projects. Such re-ports shall be submitted beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and shall in-clude a classified annex, if necessary. The re-port shall list each active OTA agreement characterized by Service or agency, major command, contracting activity, appropria-tion, budget line item, minimum and max-imum award value, vendor, obligations and expenditures to date, product service code, and period of performance. Other Trans-action Authority agreements that include an option for follow-on production shall be clearly annotated in the report and include a description of the scope of the follow-on pro-duction, including estimated cost, period of performance, deliverables, delivery dates, and source of funding. Further, the conferees direct the Comp-troller General to review the Department’s use of OTA pursuant to section 2371b of title 10, United States Code to determine whether the Department’s employment of this au-thority conforms to applicable statutes and Departmental guidelines, to include the identification of any potential conflicts with section 1301 of title 31, United States Code. As part of this review, the Comptroller Gen-eral shall also report on the extent that OTAs have been utilized since fiscal year 2016 and quantify OTA prototype agreements, in-cluding those with options for follow-on pro-duction, by Service or agency, appropriation, and other characteristics, as appropriate. The Comptroller General shall provide the congressional defense committees the assess-ment not later than 180 days after the enact-ment of this Act. INDIRECT FIRE PROTECTION CAPABILITY  In support of the Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC) program of record, the Army’s fiscal year 2019 budget includes pro-curement requests totaling $173,204,000 for AIM–9X interceptors, Multi-Mission Launch-er (MML) components, and other ancillary costs. This request is in addition to $50,056,000 of fiscal year 2018 funding that re-mains unexecuted. The request also includes $208,740,000 for continued research, develop-ment, test and evaluation of the current IFPC program of record, while prior year funding also remains available due to the de-cision not to award the IFPC milestone B Engineering and Manufacturing Develop-ment contract. The conferees note that following the sub-mission of the fiscal year 2019 budget re-quest, the Army initiated reviews of the ex-isting IFPC program of record and alternate courses of action (COA) prior to the mile-stone B decision. These alternate COA in-clude the development and integration of an alternate interceptor to the previously pro-posed AIM–9X interceptor with modifications to the MML, as well as the analysis of at least two other distinct weapons systems. The conferees further note that section 112 of the John S. McCain National Defense Au-thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 directs the Army to deploy two batteries of an in-terim, fixed site cruise missile defense capa-bility by September 30, 2020, subject to the availability of appropriations. The conference agreement supports the Army’s pursuit of this defensive capability; 
VerDate Sep 11 2014 07:37 Sep 15, 2018 Jkt 079060 PO 00000 Frm 00127 Fmt 4634 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\A13SE7.018 H13SEPT1
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH8300 September 13, 2018 
however, the conferees remain concerned that the current budget request does not sup-port any change in acquisition strategy or procurement and integration of available in-terim defense capabilities and is unexecutable as requested. The conferees di-rect the Secretary of the Army to provide a report to the congressional defense commit-tees not later than 30 days after the enact-ment of this Act that details the results of the Army’s internal review, revised acquisi-tion strategy, and resulting resourcing re-quirements. The report shall also include an analysis and recommendations on the mul-tiple COA under review; the supporting cost estimates for each COA across the future years defense program (FYDP); a program schedule for the selected COA; an analysis and recommendations for interim capabili-ties and proposed acquisition schedule; the proposed execution of prior year available balances and current IFPC resources by ap-propriation, budget line, and project across the FYDP for both the program of record and interim capabilities; and a plan to resource any identified shortfalls for the selected pro-gram of record COA and interim capabilities that will be pursued through the reprogram-ming of available resources and other means, as necessary. 
CLOUD COMPUTING  The conferees believe cloud computing, if implemented properly, will have far reaching benefits for improving the efficiency of day- to-day operations of the Department of De-fense, as well as enabling new military capa-bilities critical to maintaining a tactical ad-vantage over adversaries. The conference agreement includes a general provision di-recting the Secretary of Defense to provide a comprehensive strategy for cloud computing and to propose a plan for a budget account-ing system that provides greater trans-parency to evaluate the cost and progress of transitioning to a cloud computing environ-ment. The conferees are not suggesting that the Department implement a separate, new financial management system for cloud com-puting, but urge the Secretary of Defense to adapt the current system to provide reliable and timely data on the budgets requested and funds expended to procure cloud com-puting services, and the budgets requested and funds expended to prepare and imple-ment legacy systems for migration to the cloud environment. ADVANCED BATTLE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM  The conferees support the Air Force’s new approach to battle management, the Ad-vanced Battle Management System (ABMS), but are concerned with the near-term risks in cancelling the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System recapitalization pro-gram. The conferees direct the Secretary of the Air Force to submit a report to the con-gressional defense committees not later than 90 days after the enactment of this Act on a revised ABMS plan and execution strategy, updated costs and schedules of each activity within the ABMS plan, and a gap and threat assessment of both the ground moving target indicator and battle management command and control mission areas. This language replaces the language under the heading ‘‘Joint Surveillance Target At-tack Radar System Recapitalization’’ in House Report 115–769 and the language under the heading ‘‘Advanced Battle Management System’’ in Senate Report 115–290. 
CIVILIAN PAY RAISE  The conference agreement includes suffi-cient funding to provide for a 1.9 percent pay raise for civilian employees of the Depart-ment of Defense and other agencies funded by this Act, if authorized by another provi-sion of law. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS RESTRUCTURING  On July 30, 2018, the Secretary of Defense approved a Secretary of the Army memo-randum identifying specific actions the Army will take in support of the Administra-tion’s proposed reorganization of the United States Army Corps of Engineers’ (USACE) Civil Works Program. The reorganization in-cludes taking the Civil Works program out of the Army Corps of Engineers with naviga-tion going to the Department of Transpor-tation for infrastructure grants and the re-maining accounts to the Department of the Interior. The conferees are opposed to the reorga-nization as it could ultimately have detri-mental readiness and operational impacts on Department of Defense functions and activi-ties, to include USACE support to ongoing military operations, international partners, and support to United States military instal-lations around the world. The conferees are extremely concerned that the Secretary of the Army failed to pro-vide any notification or engage in any dis-cussion with Members of Congress, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, or their staff on an action of this magnitude, which crosses multiple jurisdictional lines and has far-reaching consequences. This type of proposal, as the Department is well aware, will require legislative language which has not been proposed or requested to date. Therefore, no funds provided in this Act or any previous Act shall be used by the De-partment or the Secretary to plan, prepare, or implement this proposal. TITLE I—MILITARY PERSONNEL The agreement provides $138,537,041,000 in Title I, Military Personnel, as follows:

MILITARY PERSONNEL OVERVIEW  The conference agreement provides the re-sources required for an additional 15,600 ac-tive forces and 800 selected reserve forces above fiscal year 2018 levels, as requested and authorized by current law, in order to meet operational needs for fiscal year 2019. The conference agreement also provides the fund-ing necessary to support a 2.6 percent pay raise for all military personnel, as author-ized, effective January 1, 2019. 
REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR MILITARY  
PERSONNEL ACCOUNTS  The Secretary of Defense is directed to submit the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414) for each of the fiscal year 2019 ap-propriations accounts not later than 60 days after the enactment of this Act. The Sec-retary of Defense is prohibited from exe-cuting any reprogramming or transfer of funds for any purpose other than originally appropriated until the aforementioned re-port is submitted to the House and Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees. The Secretary of Defense is directed to use the normal prior approval reprogramming procedures to transfer funds in the Services’ military personnel accounts between budget activities in excess of $10,000,000. 
MILITARY PERSONNEL SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS  Items for which additional funds have been provided or have been specifically reduced as shown in the project level tables or in para-graphs using the phrase ‘‘only for’’ or ‘‘only to’’ in the explanatory statement are con-gressional special interest items for the pur-pose of the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be car-ried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount as specifically addressed in the ex-planatory statement. Below Threshold Reprogrammings may not be used to either restore or reduce funding from congressional special interest items as identified on the DD Form 1414. RESERVE OFFICER TRAINING CORPS  The conferees support Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) programs at univer-sities and colleges. The ROTC program pro-vides necessary tools for young men and women to serve in the military. The House included two provisions which would ban the termination or closure of Senior ROTC or ROTC programs at Historically Black Col-leges, Hispanic or Tribal Universities/Col-leges. The Department of Defense has ad-vised the conferees that they have not initi-ated any efforts for the past several years to terminate these programs and/or units. The conferees urge the Secretary of Defense to continue to foster these programs, especially at Historically Black Colleges, Hispanic or Tribal Universities/Colleges, to ensure the best and brightest remain interested in mili-tary service. 
BLENDED RETIREMENT SYSTEM  Pursuant to sections 631 through 635 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fis-cal Year 2016, the Department of Defense began modernizing the retirement system for members of the uniformed services by imple-menting a Blended Retirement System (BRS) that incorporates Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) contributions, Continuation Pays (CP), and a reduced-rate version of the tradi-tional defined-benefit pension. Servicemembers who enter military service on or after January 1, 2018 are covered auto-matically by BRS. Those who began serving prior to December 31, 2017 are grandfathered under the legacy retirement system, with the ability to opt-in to the BRS from Janu-ary 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018, if the member has less than 12 years of service in active duty or has accumulated less than 4, 320 points for reserve members. For servicemembers separating from the mili-tary with fewer than 20 years, the new sys-tem provides for retirement benefits outside of the standing defined-benefit pension, ena-bling a larger population of servicemembers to obtain retirement benefits. The fiscal year 2018 budget submission was the Department’s first opportunity to re-quest appropriations for TSP and CP require-ments. Initial estimates were consistent across the military Services based on budg-eting assumptions informed by valuations of the military retirement system via the De-partment of Defense Office of the Actuary. Following the markup of the Department of Defense Appropriations Acts by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, the Department submitted an omnibus re-programming request identifying $1,679,947,000 in base military personnel fund-ing available for realignment to higher pri-orities, of which the Department identified $442,475,000 as excess to need due to over-estimation of BRS. In addition, another $77,000,000 was identified as BRS resources available for a future reprogramming action. The conferees understand that this new ap-proach to military retirement will take the Department time to educate and enroll par-ticipants, gather data, formulate revised as-sumptions, and more accurately inform budget projections. However, given that the fiscal year 2019 budget request was formu-lated by applying similar BRS assumptions as those used in fiscal year 2018, the Depart-ment has revised its fiscal year 2019 BRS pro-jection and identified an estimated $732,000,000 asset based on current actuals ex-perienced in the year of execution. As such, the associated reductions have been distrib-uted throughout the military personnel ap-propriation accounts and redistributed to title II in a general provision to mitigate higher than anticipated fuel costs. The con-ferees expect budgeting for the BRS will be-come more accurate over time. M

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH8368 September 13, 2018 
SECURITY ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS  The conferees recognize and appreciate the efforts made in the National Defense Author-ization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 and the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 to reform several programs that provide security assistance to international partners. Changes have touched on several Department of Defense programs, including the Coalition Support Fund, border security programs, and build-ing partner capacity/security cooperation programs. While largely supportive of these efforts, the conferees are concerned that confusion exists, within the Department of Defense and among recipient countries, about the re-maining disparate and still-changing au-thorities. The conferees are also concerned with the lack of stability, transparency, and fungibility of funds appropriated for security assistance activities and believe that changes may be needed in various appropria-tions to ensure that appropriate levels of funding are provided for each newly author-ized or modified program. Therefore, the conferees direct the Sec-retary of Defense to conduct a review of se-curity assistance programs, including, but not limited to, security cooperation pro-grams authorized in Section 333 of the Na-tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, border security assistance pro-grams authorized by Section 1226 of the Na-tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 as modified, and the Coalition Sup-port Fund authorized by Section 1223 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fis-cal Year 2008 as modified. The review should include a survey of Department of Defense security assistance requirements of each combatant command and a study of whether existing authorities are sufficient to meet the security assistance needs of the Depart-ment of Defense, including whether funding limitations inhibit security assistance re-quirements. The conferees direct that the results of the review be submitted to Congress with the fis-cal year 2020 budget request submission, and include proposals for any needed modifica-tions to security assistance authorities and appropriations funding levels or language. The conferees further direct the Director of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, in conjunction with the geographic combat-ant commanders, to provide a spend plan for fiscal year 2019, by combatant command, for security assistance funding to the congres-sional defense committees not later than 30 days after the enactment of this Act. The spend plan should be provided in a form that compares the plans for both the base and overseas contingency operations requests and provides an annual comparison for the preceding five years. A similar plan shall be provided outlining fiscal year 2020 require-ments concurrent with the submission of the fiscal year 2020 budget request. 
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS  The Administration has announced plans to wholly transfer the National Background Investigations Bureau (NBIB) to the Depart-ment of Defense. The conferees expect the Department of Defense will use the existing NBIB skilled workforce as part of the plan to maintain continuity and to support a suc-cessful transition of services. The conferees recognize the importance of this workforce in reducing the backlog of investigations and in establishing new processes for stream-lining the current system. 
DEFENSE SECURITY SERVICE  The Defense Security Service (DSS) is pre-paring to accept responsibility for all civil-ian and defense agency background inves-tigations. The conferees note with concern that DSS provided multiple and amended budget documents during the fiscal year 2019 budget cycle, which indicate changing plans and corresponding budget requirements. The conferees expect that DSS will improve its resource planning to ensure future budget re-quests support a consistent strategy. The conferees direct the Director of DSS to pro-vide quarterly execution briefings to the congressional defense committees on activi-ties related to background investigations during fiscal year 2019. COMMEMORATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE  
END OF WORLD WAR II  The United States will celebrate the occa-sion of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the end of World War II in 2020. In order to honor the nation’s veterans, educate the public, and recognize the contributions of the home front and allies during the war, the conferees urge the Secretary of Defense to evaluate ways in which the Department can support the commemoration, to include providing re-sources for related activities. 
CYBERSPACE SOLARIUM COMMISSION  Section 1652 of the John S. McCain Na-tional Defense Act for Fiscal Year 2019 estab-lishes the Cyberspace Solarium Commission to develop a consensus on a strategic ap-proach to defending the United States in cyberspace against cyber attacks of signifi-cant consequences. The conferees encourage the Secretary of Defense to provide the re-sources necessary to support this effort. O

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH8388 September 13, 2018 
REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR ACQUISITION  
ACCOUNTS  The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to follow the reprogramming guid-ance as specified in the report accompanying the House version of the Department of De-fense Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008 (House Report 110–279). Specifically, the dol-lar threshold for reprogramming funds shall remain at $20,000,000 for procurement and $10,000,000 for research, development, test and evaluation. Also, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is directed to continue to pro-vide the congressional defense committees quarterly, spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 reports for Service and defense-wide ac-counts in titles III and IV of this Act. Re-ports for titles III and IV shall comply with the guidance specified in the explanatory statement accompanying the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006. The De-partment shall continue to follow the limita-tion that prior approval reprogrammings are set at either the specified dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or research, development, test and evaluation line, whichever is less. These thresholds are cu-mulative from the base for reprogramming value as modified by any adjustments. Therefore, if the combined value of transfers into or out of a procurement (P–1) or re-search, development, test and evaluation (R– 1) line exceeds the identified threshold, the Secretary of Defense must submit a prior ap-proval reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In addition, guidelines on the application of prior approval re-programming procedures for congressional special interest items are established else-where in this statement. FUNDING INCREASES  The funding increases outlined in these ta-bles shall be provided only for the specific purposes indicated in the tables. 
PROCUREMENT SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS  Items for which additional funds have been provided as shown in the project level tables or in paragraphs using the phrase ‘‘only for’’ or ‘‘only to’’ in the explanatory statement are congressional special interest items for the purpose of the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount as specifically addressed in the ex-planatory statement. A

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH8402 September 13, 2018 
STRYKER DOUBLE -V HULL  Following the submission of the fiscal year 2019 budget request, the Chief of Staff of the Army approved an Army Requirements Over-sight Counsel (AROC) decision to upgrade and pure fleet all Flat-Bottom Hull (FBH) Stryker combat vehicles to the Double V- Hull A1 variant (DVHA1) in an effort to im-prove troop survivability and mobility. The Army’s fiscal year 2019 budget request in-cludes $21,900,000 to upgrade three FBH Stryker vehicles to DVHA1 variants. Subse-quent to the AROC decision, the Army re-quested a funding transfer of $149,390,000 to fund additional conversions. With the trans-fer, the Army can resource 53 DVHA1 conver-sions totaling $171,290,000. The conferees have also included a congressional adjust-ment of $94,000,000 for 29 additional conver-sions. The conferees note that there is a fiscal year 2018 reprogramming request to repur-pose $285,000,000 of congressionally directed funding for 91 DVHA1 conversions. If the re-programming action is approved by the con-gressional defense committees, the Army will have sufficient resources to fund conver-sions for half the vehicles in a Stryker Bri-gade Combat Team (SBCT), which is the Army’s optimal rate of modernization. The conferees support the net-zero fiscal year 2019 transfer request, reprogramming action, and additional funding for DVHA1 conversions. However, the conferees are con-cerned that the Army decision on Stryker modifications are not being synchronized with the budget cycle, are currently under- resourced, and have been subject to sudden change. The conferees direct the Secretary of the Army to submit a report outlining the revised acquisition strategy for Stryker ve-hicles, to include a resourcing strategy for funding Stryker DVHA1 conversion at a rate of one-half of a SBCT per year, an expla-nation of Stryker lethality requirements, an acquisition and resourcing strategy for field-ing required lethality modifications, and an explanation and cost estimate for any vali-dated requirements for Stryker modifica-tions. This report shall be submitted to the congressional defense committees not later than 90 days after the enactment of this Act. This language replaces the language under the heading ‘‘Stryker’’ in House Report 115– 769 and under the heading ‘‘Army Stryker Double-V Hull A1’’ in Senate Report 115–290. P

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8433 September 13, 2018 
TOMAHAWK PRODUCTION AND NEXT GENERATION  
LAND ATTACK WEAPON  The conferees are concerned by the Navy’s management of the Tomahawk missile pro-gram. In the previous two fiscal years, the Congress has added funding above the budget requests for the Tomahawk program due to the fact that the Navy has requested fewer missiles than necessary to maintain a min-imum sustainment rate of production while missiles have continued to be expended in the Central Command area of operations. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2018, provided $102,000,000 above the re-quest to procure additional munitions pursu-ant to the Navy’s fiscal year 2018 enhance-ment request following enactment of the Bi-partisan Budget Act of 2018. However, despite the request by the Navy and the direction by the Congress to procure additional muni-tions, the Navy has proposed to repurpose the congressionally provided funding for var-ious activities, negating congressional in-tent. Therefore, the agreement includes a re-scission of $115,657,000 of fiscal year 2018 funds from the Tomahawk program. The fiscal year 2019 budget request for Tomahawk does not include funding for new production of all up rounds, reflecting the Navy’s strategy to transition from new pro-duction to recertification and modernization activities. The conferees direct the Sec-retary of the Navy to conduct a full review of the Tomahawk program including the cur-rent inventory requirement and stockpiled levels of munitions; an analysis of the viabil-ity of new production in fiscal year 2020; an analysis of the capacity for concurrent new production and recertification activities within existing facilities; revised cost and schedule projections for modification and re-certification activities, to include alter-natives with and without concurrent new production; a detailed review of the execu-tion of the fiscal year 2017 and 2018 new pro-duction congressional adds; an analysis of surface and sub-surface launched land attack weapons inventory and requirements projec-tions through the Next Generation Land At-tack Weapon initial operational capability date, to include other weapons systems that may provide an interim capability. The Sec-retary of the Navy shall provide a report de-tailing the results of the review to the con-gressional defense committees not later than 90 days after the enactment of this Act. Additionally, the reporting requirements related to the Long Range Anti-Ship Missile included under the heading ‘‘Next Genera-tion Land Attack Weapon (NGLAW) and In-terim Capabilities’’ in Senate Report 115–290 are still valid. This language replaces the language under the heading ‘‘Tomahawk Production’’ in House Report 115–769 and under the heading ‘‘Next Generation Land Attack Weapon (NGLAW) and Interim Capabilities’’ in Sen-ate Report 115–290.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH8442 September 13, 2018 
FORD CLASS AIRCRAFT CARRIER PROCUREMENT  The conferees include a proviso consistent with section 121 of the John S. McCain Na-tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, which allows the Secretary of the Navy to potentially use fiscal year 2019 funds to enter into a contract for an aircraft car-rier designated CVN–81 if certain require-ments are met by the Secretary of Defense. However, the conferees note that the con-gressional defense committees have not re-ceived information justifying the validity of a proposed ‘‘two carrier block buy,’’ includ-ing an Independent Cost Estimate, an anal-ysis of the impact on other Navy ship-building programs, an updated future years defense program, or an extended planning range budget. This language replaces the language under the heading ‘‘CVN 80’’ in Senate Report 115– 290. O
THER PROCUREMENT , NAVY The agreement provides $9,097,138,000 for Other Procurement, Navy, as follows:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH8494 September 13, 2018 
REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR ACQUISITION  
ACCOUNTS  The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to follow the reprogramming guid-ance as specified in the report accompanying the House version of the Department of De-fense Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008 (House Report 110–279). Specifically, the dol-lar threshold for reprogramming funds shall remain at $20,000,000 for procurement and $10,000,000 for research, development, test and evaluation. Also, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is directed to continue to pro-vide the congressional defense committees quarterly, spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 reports for Service and defense-wide ac-counts in titles III and IV of this Act. Re-ports for titles III and IV shall comply with the guidance specified in the explanatory statement accompanying the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006. The De-partment shall continue to follow the limita-tion that prior approval reprogrammings are set at either the specified dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or research, development, test and evaluation line, whichever is less. These thresholds are cu-mulative from the base for reprogramming value as modified by any adjustments. Therefore, if the combined value of transfers into or out of a procurement (P–1) or re-search, development, test and evaluation (R– 1) line exceeds the identified threshold, the Secretary of Defense must submit a prior ap-proval reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In addition, guidelines on the application of prior approval re-programming procedures for congressional special interest items are established else-where in this statement. 
FUNDING INCREASES  The funding increases outlined in these ta-bles shall be provided only for the specific purposes indicated in the tables. 
RESEARCH , DEVELOPMENT , TEST AND  
EVALUATION SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS  Items for which additional funds have been provided as shown in the project level tables or in paragraphs using the phrase ‘‘only for’’ or ‘‘only to’’ in the explanatory statement are congressional special interest items for the purpose of the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount as specifically addressed in the ex-planatory statement. 
BLAST EXPOSURE RESEARCH  The conferees understand that further re-search is necessary regarding blast exposure on the cellular level of the brain in order to develop blast protection requirements for helmets and other personal protective equip-ment. The conferees encourage the Secretary of Defense to increase efforts to develop a predictive traumatic brain injury model for blast. Such research may help reveal the cel-lular response to blast impulses and the interaction of the human brain and protec-tive equipment related to blast exposure. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TEST AND  
EVALUATION INFRASTRUCTURE  The 2018 National Defense Strategy ad-dresses the increasingly complex global threat environment driven in part by rapid technological advancements. The fiscal year 2019 budget request proposes investments in several programs that support a more capa-ble and lethal force to prepare for this threat environment, including directed energy, hypersonics, advanced computing, big data analytics, artificial intelligence, autonomy, and robotics programs. The conferees believe that concurrent with investments in leap-ahead technological ad-vancements, an investment in the Depart-ment of Defense test and evaluation infra-structure is required to increase testing range space and availability and to ensure continued independent and objective assess-ments of weapon system capabilities. There-fore, after consultation with the Under Sec-retary of Defense (Research and Engineering) and the Director, Operational Test and Eval-uation, the conferees recommend increases for the Air Force, and Office of the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation to mod-ernize the Department of Defense test and evaluation infrastructure in areas such as hypersonics, directed energy, augmented in-telligence, machine learning, robotics, and cyberspace. The conferees direct the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering), in conjunction with the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation, and the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, to conduct an in-depth assessment of the Department of Defense test and evaluation infrastructure and to identify improvements required to ad-dress future warfighting capabilities. The as-sessment shall be provided to the congres-sional defense committees not later than with the submission of the fiscal year 2020 budget request and shall include proposed co-ordinated investments by warfighting area in priority order and with associated cost es-timates. 
F–35 JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER DEVELOPMENTAL  
TEST FLEET  The conferees agree to modify a provision proposed by the House allowing the Sec-retary of Defense to use funds appropriated in this Act for F–35 procurement and re-search, development, test and evaluation to modify up to six aircraft, including two air-craft of each variant, to a test configuration. The conferees understand that the cost of modifying each aircraft is approximately $5,000,000. The conferees direct the Secretary of Defense, with the concurrence of the Sec-retary of the Air Force and the Secretary of the Navy, to notify the congressional defense committees not fewer than 30 days prior to obligating and expending funds for this pur-pose. The notification shall contain the costs of modifying the aircraft, the sources of funding by account and the reasons for their availability, and a statement that the use of such funds will not adversely affect the F–35 operational fleet. The conferees expect that any such use of funds will not unduly hinder or harm other critical aspects of the Joint Strike Fighter program. Finally, the con-ferees direct that normal reprogramming procedures be followed as necessary to exe-cute funding for this purpose. ENERGETICS RESEARCH  The conferees direct the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) to submit a report to the congressional defense committees not later than 120 days after the enactment of this Act on current invest-ments of the Department of Defense in energetics research. The report shall include a comparison of investments in energetics among the Services as well as a strategic roadmap for future energetics research. 
HYPERSONICS RESEARCH PARTNERSHIPS  The conferees support hypersonics partner-ships between the Defense Advanced Re-search Projects Agency and the military Services and recommend fully funding these partnerships. The conferees understand that the development of hypersonic weapons will require a long-term vision, beyond the Serv-ices’ current mission needs and capabilities. Therefore, the conferees encourage the Under Secretary of Defense (Research and Engineering) to consider establishing a part-nership with one or more universities fo-cused on hypersonics research and education with the mission of developing next-genera-tion hypersonics capabilities and building a highly-skilled, technically-trained work-force.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8539 September 13, 2018 
ACCELERATED ACQUISITIONS  The fiscal year 2019 budget request in-cludes $1,402,333,000, an increase of 150 per-cent over amounts enacted in fiscal year 2018, for programs designated as accelerated acquisitions in accordance with Chief of Naval Operations and Secretary of the Navy Instructions 5000.53 and 5000.42, respectively. The conferees support efforts to rapidly de-liver capability to the warfighter in a re-sponsible manner and recommend $1,072,585,000 for these programs in fiscal year 2019. The conferees are concerned by repeated instances in which the designation as an ac-celerated acquisition program has led to im-prudent program management decisions af-fecting contracting actions and funding exe-cution. Therefore, the conferees direct the Assist-ant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Devel-opment and Acquisition) and the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Financial Manage-ment and Comptroller) to submit a report to the congressional defense committees, not later than 30 days after the enactment of this Act, on acquisition strategy manage-ment and fiscal controls in place to ensure the appropriate management of resources for Navy accelerated acquisition programs. The conferees direct the Assistant Sec-retary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) to provide the congres-sional defense committees, with the submis-sion of the fiscal year 2020 budget request, the acquisition strategy for each designated accelerated acquisition program. The con-ferees further direct the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Financial Management and Comptroller) to certify that the fiscal year 2020 budget request fully funds such acquisi-tion strategies, to include the associated test requirements identified in the detailed test approach developed for each program, as agreed to by the Chief of Naval Operations, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Re-search, Development and Acquisition), and the Director, Operational Test and Evalua-tion per previous congressional direction. The conferees reiterate previous congres-sional direction with respect to the role of the Director, Operational Test and Evalua-tion under accelerated acquisition and rapid prototyping, to include early insight into service acquisition intentions. Finally, the conferees direct the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Develop-ment and Acquisition) to identify to the con-gressional defense committees with the fis-cal year 2020 budget submission, any addi-tional training requirements levied on the acquisition workforce associated with the execution of accelerated acquisition pro-grams.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8559 September 13, 2018 
TEST AND EVALUATION SUPPORT  The conference agreement provides fund-ing as requested within the Major Test and Evaluation Investment program element for the planning and design of three military construction projects under the Defense Lab-oratory Modernization Pilot Program au-thorized by the National Defense Authoriza-tion Act for Fiscal Year 2016. These specific projects are authorized by the National De-fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, but the conferees understand that funding for construction will be requested in fiscal year 2020. This language replaces the lan-guage under the heading ‘‘Test and Evalua-tion Support’’ in House Report 115–769. 
SPACE SOLAR POWER PROGRAM  The conferees understand that the Space Solar Power Program is a priority for the Air Force but have concerns that the sub-mitted budget justification materials do not include sufficient requirements, scheduling, or cost detail to adequately judge the merits of rapid acquisition or the ability of the Space Rapid Capabilities Office to achieve it. Consequently, the conference agreement re-duces funding for the program’s air dem-onstration by $105,000,000 and designates the program as a new start and congressional special interest item. The conferees direct the Secretary of the Air Force to submit de-tailed funding plans for the Space Solar Power Program with the fiscal year2020 budget request submission. R

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8583 September 13, 2018 
REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR THE DEFENSE  
HEALTH PROGRAM  The conferees remain concerned about the transfer of funds from the In-House Care budget sub-activity group to pay for con-tractor-provided medical care and the re-programming of funds from the Private Sec-tor Care budget sub-activity group to De-partment priorities outside of the Defense Health Program. To limit such transactions and improve oversight within the Defense Health Program operation and maintenance account, the conferees direct that the In- House Care and Private Sector Care budget sub-activities remain designated as congres-sional special interest items. Any transfer of funds into or out of these sub-activities re-quires the Secretary of Defense to follow prior approval reprogramming procedures. This should not be interpreted as limiting the amount of funds that may be transferred to the In-House Care budget sub-activity from other budget sub-activities within the Defense Health Program. Additionally, the conferees direct the As-sistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) to provide quarterly reports to the congres-sional defense committees on budget execu-tion data for all of the Defense Health Pro-gram budget activities and to adequately re-flect changes to the budget activities re-quested by the Services in future budget sub-missions. 
CARRYOVER  The conferees recommend one percent car-ryover authority for the operation and main-tenance account of the Defense Health Pro-gram. The conferees direct the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) to sub-mit a detailed spending plan for any fiscal year 2018 designated carryover funds to the congressional defense committees not less than 30 days prior to executing the carryover funds. 
PEER -REVIEWED CANCER RESEARCH PROGRAM  The conference agreement provides $90,000,000 for the peer-reviewed cancer re-search program to research cancers not ad-dressed in the breast, prostate, ovarian, kid-ney, lung, and melanoma cancer research programs. The funds provided in the peer-reviewed cancer research program are directed to be used to conduct research in the following areas: bladder cancer, blood cancers, brain cancer, colorectal cancer, immunotherapy, listeria vaccine for cancer, liver cancer, lymphoma, mesothelioma, neuroblastoma, pancreatic cancer, pediatric brain tumors, stomach cancer, rare cancers, and cancer in children, adolescents, and young adults. The reports directed under this heading in House Report 115–769 and Senate Report 115– 290 are still required. 
PEER -REVIEWED MEDICAL RESEARCH PROGRAM  The conference agreement provides $350,000,000 for a peer-reviewed medical re-search program. The conferees direct the Secretary of Defense, in conjunction with the Service Surgeons General, to select med-ical research projects of clear scientific merit and direct relevance to military health. Research areas considered under this funding are restricted to the following areas: acute lung injury, antimicrobial resistance, arthritis, burn pit exposure, cardio-myopathy, cerebellar ataxia, chronic mi-graine and post-traumatic headache, con-genital heart disease, constrictive bronchiolitis, diabetes, dystonia, eating dis-orders, emerging infectious diseases, epidermolysis bullosa, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, frontotemporal degen-eration, Guillain-Barre syndrome, hemor-rhage control, hepatitis B, hereditary angioedema, hydrocephalus, immunomonitoring of intestinal transplants, inflammatory bowel diseases, interstitial cystitis, lung injury, metals toxicology, mitochondrial disease, musculoskeletal dis-orders, myotonic dystrophy, nanomaterials for bone regeneration, nutrition optimiza-tion, pancreatitis, pathogen-inactivated blood products, polycystic kidney disease, post-traumatic osteoarthritis, pressure ul-cers, pulmonary fibrosis, resilience training, respiratory health, Rett syndrome, rheu-matoid arthritis, scleroderma, sleep dis-orders, spinal muscular atrophy, tinnitus, tissue regeneration, tuberculosis, vascular malformations, and women’s heart disease. The additional funding provided under the peer-reviewed medical research program shall be devoted only to the purposes listed above. ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS  The conferees direct the Program Execu-tive Officer (PEO) for Defense Healthcare Management Systems (DHMS), in conjunc-tion with the Director of the Interagency Program Office (IPO), to provide quarterly reports to the congressional defense commit-tees on the cost and schedule of the elec-tronic health record program, to include milestones, knowledge points, and acquisi-tion timelines, as well as quarterly obliga-tion reports. These reports should also in-clude any changes to the deployment timeline, including benchmarks, for full op-erating capability; any refinements to the cost estimate for full operating capability and the total lifecycle cost of the project; and the progress toward developing, imple-menting, and fielding the interoperable elec-tronic health record throughout the medical facilities of the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The PEO DHMS is further directed to continue briefing the House and Senate Defense Ap-propriations Subcommittees on a quarterly basis, coinciding with the report submission. The conferees also direct the Director of the IPO to continue to provide quarterly re-ports to the House and Senate Appropria-tions Committees, Subcommittees on De-fense and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies on the progress of interoperability between the two Departments. Additionally, the conferees direct the Comptroller General to perform a review of the implementation of MHS GENESIS at the four currently active sites and submit a re-port to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees not later than 180 days after the enactment of this Act. The report should in-clude, but not be limited to, how MHS GEN-ESIS is addressing the concerns raised by the Initial Operational Test and Evaluation report; the performance of MHS GENESIS in meeting the demands of each of the medical facilities; underlying issues with implemen-tation; anticipated delays in implementa-tion; and the impact on the execution of funds. The conferees also direct the Comp-troller General to perform quarterly reviews of the electronic health record deployment. COMBAT READINESS MEDICAL RESEARCH  The conference agreement provides $15,000,000 for Combat Readiness Medical Re-search. The conferees direct the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) to com-petitively award this funding to support the activities described under the heading ‘‘Joint Warfighter Medical Research Program’’ of House Report 115–769. 
TRAUMA TRAINING  The conferees direct the Secretary of De-fense to submit a report to the congressional defense committees not later than 180 days after the enactment of this Act on improving trauma training for trauma teams of the De-partment of Defense, including through the use of the Joint Trauma Education and Training Directorate established under sec-tion 708 of the National Defense Authoriza-tion Act for Fiscal Year 2017. The report should include recommendations on how to best coordinate trauma teams of the Depart-ment of Defense with trauma partners in the civilian sector, including evaluating how trauma surgeons and military physicians can best partner with civilian level I trauma cen-ters that are verified by the American Col-lege of Surgeons, including those that are linked to a bum center that offer bum rota-tions and clinical experience, to provide ade-quate training and readiness of the next gen-eration of medical providers to treat criti-cally injured bum patients and other mili-tary trauma victims. 
LEAD ASSESSMENTS AND TESTING FOR INFANTS  The conferees recognize the importance of screening and testing children for elevated blood lead levels to prevent childhood lead toxicity. Therefore, the conferees direct the Secretary of Defense to provide risk assess-ments and targeted blood testing for ele-vated blood lead levels to all TRICARE bene-ficiary children during their 12-month and 24-month wellness checks or annual physical examinations.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8603 September 13, 2018 
KURDISH PESHMERGA  The Peshmerga forces of the Kurdistan Re-gion of Iraq have made, and continue to make, significant contributions to the United States-led campaign to degrade, dis-mantle, and ultimately defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in Iraq. A last-ing defeat of ISIS is critical to maintaining a stable and tolerant Iraq in which all faiths, sects, and ethnicities are afforded equal pro-tection and full integration into the govern-ment and society of Iraq. In support of counter-ISIS operations and in conjunction with the central government of Iraq, the United States should provide the Ministry of Peshmerga forces of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq $290,000,000 in oper-ational sustainment, so that the Peshmerga forces can more effectively partner with the Iraqi Security Forces, the United States, and other international coalition members to consolidate gains, hold territory, and protect infrastructure from ISIS and its affiliates in an effort to deal a lasting defeat to ISIS and prevent its reemergence in Iraq. AFGHANISTAN SECURITY FORCES FUND BUDGET  
SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS  The conferees appreciate the efforts of the Department of Defense to comply with prior year direction to provide detailed execution information concurrent with the budget re-quest and Financial Activity Plan (FAP) submissions for the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF) appropriation. However, the Department remains unable to provide an accurate accounting of current and prior year spending at the budget justification re-quest line level, which challenges effective congressional budget analysis and oversight. The conferees are also concerned that the budget flexibility allowed with the ASFF ap-propriation has led to unclear funding re-quirements and a lack of budget discipline and risks wasteful spending. Therefore, the conferees continue to direct that the Secretary of Defense shall provide budget justification materials that include the budget request amount, the prior year appropriated amount, and the actual obliga-tion amount by line item for the prior two years. In addition, concurrent with the sub-mission of each FAP, the Secretary of De-fense shall provide the congressional defense committees with line item detail of planned funding movements within each ASFF sub- activity group using line item titles from the appropriate year’s budget justification sub-mission. Any line item that did not appear in the budget justification submission shall be delineated as a new line item in the line item detail accompanying the FAP. The conferees agree to forgo the more stringent reprogramming requirements out-lined in Senate Report 115–290 in order to provide the Department more time to im-prove the ASFF budget submission. How-ever, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees intend to revisit this issue dur-ing the fiscal year 2020 budget appropriation process if budget justification material con-tinues to be deficient. P
ROCUREMENT  The agreement provides $12,627,028,000 for Procurement, as follows:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8643 September 13, 2018 
NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING  
TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCES  Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA).—The conferees provide $559,736,000 for the CTSA program, an increase of $17,025,000 above fiscal year 2018. Cures Acceleration Network.—The conferees provide up to $80,000,000 for the Cures Accel-eration Network. 
OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR (OD)  Frontotemporal Degeneration (FTD). —The conferees encourage NIH to maintain and ex-pand a multi-site infrastructure and network of clinical sites to extend the study of ge-netic and sporadic FTD cohorts. By sup-porting this research, researchers may in-crease our knowledge of the natural history of the disease and build an infrastructure for biomarker discovery and clinical trials in de-fined FTD cohorts. A key component of this will be to leverage recent advances in infor-mation technology to create an infrastruc-ture for FTD research that will collect and record data and samples in a uniform man-ner, incorporate patient-reported data, and take advantage of new technologies that en-able remote monitoring. Development of a data biosphere that supports broad sharing of robust datasets, generated with powerful -omic platforms, will enable the broader community of researchers, including young-er investigators and scientists from a wide array of fields, to bring their expertise and intellectual curiosity to bear on the chal-lenges currently confronting the Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias disorders. In this way, the conferees hope to accelerate the understanding of basic disease mecha-nisms that may be common across forms of dementia and speed the translation of this information into much-needed therapeutics. Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act. — The conferees continue bill language for spe-cific funds authorized by the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act (P.L. 113–94) within the Common Fund to support the fifth year of the 10-year Pediatric Research Initiative. The conferees request an update in the fiscal year 2020 Congressional Justification on this effort as described in the House and Senate Reports. OIG Oversight.—The conferees direct the OD to transfer $5,000,000 to the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) to support increased oversight of NIH’s grant programs. These funds are in addition to the resources OIG currently dedicates to oversight of NIH. The conferees direct the Inspector General to submit a comprehensive audit plan for its oversight of NIH for fiscal years 2019 and 2020 to the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and the House Com-mittee on Energy and Commerce not later than 60 days from the date of enactment of this Act, and to brief the Committees on its implementation. In particular, the conferees direct the OIG to examine NIH’s oversight of its grantees’ compliance with NIH policies, including NIH efforts to ensure the integrity of its grant application evaluation and selec-tion processes. The conferees also direct the OIG to examine the effectiveness of NIH’s and grantee institutions’ efforts to protect intellectual property derived from NIH-sup-ported research. Portfolio Analysis.—The conferees direct the NIH Director to conduct a comprehen-sive study and submit a report to Congress not later than one year from the date of en-actment of this Act that: (1) includes a port-folio analysis of current funding levels for mental health and substance use disorder, and (2) identifies the process by which the NIH set funding priorities for mental health and substance use disorder programs, includ-ing how NIH takes into account newly devel-oped public health needs, disease burden, emerging scientific opportunities, and sci-entific progress. Executive Employee Performance Bonuses. — The conferees direct the NIH Director to pro-vide the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate with information not later than ten days from the date of enactment of this Act show-ing the bonus that each NIH executive em-ployee was eligible to receive in fiscal years 2015, 2016, and 2017, and the portion of that bonus that each executive ultimately re-ceived in each of those three years. In addi-tion, the conferees direct NIH to list all of the employees who report directly to the Di-rector, and describe the formal and informal processes the Director uses to provide reg-ular feedback to his direct reports and assess their performance. Finally, the conferees di-rect NIH to describe the process it relies upon to ensure executive performance plans are as much as possible based upon specific performance results and measurable out-comes. Trisomy 21.—The conferees applaud the NIH for significantly increasing its investment in Down syndrome research and for the NIH Di-rector’s leadership in advancing the trans- NIH initiative the Committees included in the fiscal year 2018 appropriation. The con-ferees direct NIH to continue to make in-vestments in Down syndrome research that prioritize funding for both research grants and early-stage investigators that will ex-pand the current pipeline of Down syndrome research, as well as the implementation of the new trans-NIH initiative. In addition, the conferees encourage NIH to prioritize funding for research for emerging scientific opportunities to improve the health and neurodevelopment of individuals with Down syndrome and typical individuals at risk for immune system dysregulation, Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and autism. Valley Fever.—The conferees understand that based on the recommendation of the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for the Valley Fever Random-ized Controlled Trial (RCT), NIAID has halt-ed enrollment in the RCT due to lack of pa-tient enrollment, primarily those with Val-ley Fever. In light of this, the DSMB rec-ommended revising the study protocol. Ac-cordingly, the conferees direct NIAID to re-vise expeditiously the study design to ad-dress the critical need for effective treat-ment of Valley Fever in order to restart en-rolling patients before the end of 2018, in-cluding increasing the number of partici-pating healthcare provider enrollment sites. Furthermore, the conferees direct NIAID to work with stakeholders to develop and im-plement a plan to maximize the number of health care provider patient enrollment sites and raise awareness of this study with the broader public with the goal of increasing patient enrollment. The conferees direct NIAID to provide updates on the Valley Fever RCT revisions on a quarterly basis to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate until patient enrollment is restarted, as well as a report on maximizing health care pro-vider enrollment sites and public awareness plans to increase patient enrollment in the revised RCT within 90 days from the date of enactment of this Act.

PROMOTING SAFE AND STABLE FAMILIES  Kinship Navigator Programs.—The conferees continue $20,000,000 in temporary bridge funding for kinship navigator programs in fiscal year 2019 because the Department has not yet identified which evidence-based pro-grams are eligible for funding or issued other guidance to States about how to claim the IV–E matching funds for this purpose. The conferees expect HHS to identify eligible ap-proaches and issue guidance in time for States to use IV–E funds for kinship pro-grams. Regional Partnership Grants.—The conferees include $20,000,000 for Regional Partnership Grants to improve the coordination of serv-ices for children and families affected by opioid and other substance use disorders. The conferees strongly encourage ACF to prioritize applicants who will focus on pre-paring programs to qualify as evidence-based foster care prevention services under the Family First Prevention Services Act (P.L. 115–123), to include family-focused residen-tial treatment programs, which help families remain together safely while parents receive treatment.

In such notice for State grants, the conferees direct the Department to uphold the long-standing guidance that States may only administer one active State GEAR UP grant at a time. The Secretary is directed to provide written guidance in the Federal Reg-ister notifying applicants that only States without an active State GEAR UP grant, or States that have an active State GEAR UP grant that is scheduled to end prior to Octo-ber 1, 2019, will be eligible to receive a new State GEAR UP award funded in whole or in part by this appropriation. Federal TRIO Programs.—The conferees re-iterate concerns communicated in both the House and Senate reports related to the allo-cation of the fiscal year 2018 funding for TRIO programs. The Department’s plan dis-regarded House direction to allocate funding in the same ratio as the prior fiscal year. In addition, there is also concern that the De-partment may be placing burdensome re-quirements for the existing awardees in order for them to receive any additional funding. The conferees direct the Depart-ment to include in its fiscal year 2020 Con-gressional Justification information about how these additional funds were awarded, in-cluding a detailed budget justification. Addi-tionally, the conferees expect plans for fund-ing allocations by activity within the TRIO programs to be included in the operating plan required under section 516 of this Act.

The conferees recommend that the application deadline for the notice invit-ing grant applications for fiscal year 2019 be not less than 60 days from the date the no-tice is published. Further, any tools, tech-nologies, or other resources that are created, developed, or improved wholly or in part with Pilot funds for use with an open text-book must be licensed under a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, and irrevocable license to the public to exercise any of the rights under copyright condi-tioned only on the requirement that attribu-tion be given as directed by the copyright owner.

NIVERSITY CAPITAL FINANCING PROGRAM  The conferees include additional funding for the deferment of outstanding loans for private historically Black colleges and uni-versities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H8647 September 13, 2018 
The conferees reiterate concern expressed in Senate Report 115–289 regarding the De-partment’s responsiveness to technical as-sistance requests and continues to note that it expects the Department to comply in a timely manner with its requests for tech-nical assistance and information, consistent with past practice including timely answers that respond to any specific inquiries. Computer Science Education.—The conferees agree that computer science education pro-grams, including coding academies, can pro-vide important benefits to local industries and the economy and help meet in-demand workforce needs. Therefore, the Departments of Labor and Education should work to-gether with industry to improve and expand computer science education programs and opportunities, including through apprentice-ships. Reorganization.—The conferees acknowl-edge the Department’s efforts to brief con-gressional committees on its reorganization plans. However, concerns remain that the views of stakeholders are not being ade-quately addressed. In particular, the con-ferees recognize the value of the Office of English Language Acquisition and the Office of Career, Technical and Adult Education (OCTAE) and are concerned that the elimi-nation or consolidation of either office will undermine the ability of the Department to fulfill not only its mission, but also congres-sional directives to implement relevant pro-grams and purposes. Further, the conferees note that OCTAE is authorized expressly in statute and cannot be consolidated or reor-ganized except by specific authority granted by Congress.

PUBLICATION OF BUDGETARY MATERIAL 
REVISIONS TO THE STATEMENT OF COMMITTEE  
ALLOCATIONS , AGGREGATES , AND OTHER  
BUDGETARY LEVELS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019  H
OUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , C
OMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET , Washington, DC. Mr. Speaker, I hereby submit for printing in the Congressional Record revisions to the aggregates and allocations set forth in the Statement of Committee Allocations, Aggre-gates, and Other Budgetary Levels for Fiscal Year 2019 published in the Congressional Record on May 10, 2018 pursuant to section 30104 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–123). The revision is for new budget authority and outlays for provisions designated for Overseas Contingency Oper-ations/Global War on Terrorism pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA), contained in the conference re-port to accompany H.R. 5895, the Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appro-priations Act, 2019. The Statement of Committee Allocations, Aggregates, and Other Budgetary Levels for Fiscal Year 2019 set the base discretionary 302(a) allocation to the Committee on Appro-priations at $1.244 trillion, which is the sum of the fiscal year 2019 discretionary spending limits under section 251(c) of BBEDCA. Sec-tion 251(b) of BBEDCA allows for adjust-ments to the discretionary spending limits for certain purposes including Overseas Con-tingency Operations/Global War on Ter-rorism, disaster relief, and program integrity initiatives. The conference report to accompany H.R. 5895, the Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Vet-erans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2019, con-tains $921 million in budget authority for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism. Accordingly, I am submitting an adjustment for an additional $921 million in budget authority to accommodate Over-seas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism funding contained in the con-ference report to accompany H.R. 5895. After making this adjustment, the conference re-port to accompany H.R. 5895 is within the fis-cal year 2019 discretionary spending limits under section 251(c) of BBEDCA, in addition to the aggregates and the 302(a) allocation to the Committee on Appropriations estab-lished by the Statement of Committee Allo-cations, Aggregates, and Other Budgetary Levels for Fiscal Year 2019 filed on May 10, 2018. Budget enforcement provisions of H. Con. Res. 71 (115th Congress) have been deemed to be in force by section 30104(f) of the Bipar-tisan Budget Act of 2018. This revision rep-resents an adjustment for purposes of enforc-ing sections 302 and 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. For the purposes of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, these re-vised aggregates and allocations are to be considered as aggregates and allocations in-cluded in the budget resolution, pursuant to the Statement published in the Congres-sional Record on May 10, 2018, as adjusted. Sincerely, STEVE WOMACK , Chairman.

RECOGNIZING THE 40TH ANNIVER-SARY OF CANTON WOODS SEN-IOR CENTER 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 40th anniversary of Canton Woods Senior Center. Located in Baldwinsville, New York, Canton Woods has been diligently serving the Central New York senior community for many years. Canton Woods Senior Center was founded in 1978 when a group called The Senior Club purchased the old Baldwinsville medical cen-ter, which was built ten years prior. Addition-ally, the Onondaga County Department of Aging and Youth aided The Senior Club with the purchase. Canton Woods began serving three municipalities once it was established: Baldwinsville, Lysander and Van Buren. The facility has undergone two major renovations to expand the dining, kitchen and recreation areas since the original purchase. Today, Canton Woods is operated by full- and part-time staff, as well as several devoted volunteers. Many services are available through the center including defensive driving education, an extensive library and various senior exercise classes. Canton Woods is unique in that any resident of Baldwinsville, Lysander or Van Buren who is at least 60 years of age may utilize its services free of charge. Furthermore, any senior residing in Onondaga County may visit Canton Woods for meals and participate in overnight trips. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House to join me in celebrating Canton Woods’ 40 years of contributions to senior citi-zens. We must also applaud the efforts of caregivers, career and volunteer, around the nation. Seniors are an important part of the Central New York community and it is my hope facilities like Canton Woods continue to thrive throughout the country.

UPON THE RETIREMENT OF MICHAEL THERIAULT 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise along with Democratic Leader N
ANCY PELOSI , to com-mend the extraordinary service of Michael Theriault, the retiring Secretary-Treasurer of the San Francisco Building and Construction Trades Council, after 13 years of service to the council and many years of service to the San Francisco Bay Area. Mike graduated from St. John’s College in Santa Fe, New Mexico. He became an Ap-prentice in Ironworkers Local 377 in 1985 and in that position was named Apprentice of the Year. He was so successful as an apprentice and journeyman that in 2001 Local 331 se-lected him to be the Business Representative, and then elected him to the position in 2003. He would later remark that his skill at negoti-ating agreements came in large part from his understanding of the day-to-day realities of working at a job site. As he noted, ‘‘Under-standing of the work, the flow of work, is more important to union leaders in the trades than in most other unions . . . you come to union leadership after actually having run work.’’ In addition to serving as a delegate to the San Francisco Building and Construction Trades Council, Mike represented his local as a delegate to councils in San Mateo, Marin, Sonoma-Lake-Mendocino and Humboldt-Del Norte counties. For any of you who know the geography of California, you would instantly realize that Mike has been a busy man. It’s 350 miles and a 61⁄2hour drive between San Francisco and Crescent City in the most north-ern county of California. It takes the fortitude of an ironworker to make that trip on a regular basis, representing the interests of members whose livelihoods depend upon Mike’s skills and dedication to their wellbeing. These counties are also the core counties comprising the Golden Gate Transportation District, the entity that built and manages the Golden Gate Bridge. Mike was appointed a di-rector of the bridge district in 2011. The bridge itself is a testament to the skill of his members from generations ago through to our times. In addition to serving on these other entities, Mike served on the Executive Board of the San Francisco Labor Council, the Executive Board of the California State Building and Construction Trades Council, on the Executive Committee of the San Francisco Housing Ac-tion Coalition, and as a member of the SPUR Board of Directors. In the depths of the Great Recession, Mike fought hard for work via the American Recov-ery and Reinvestment Act so that the 40% un-employment rate in his hall would be dramati-cally reduced. He noted to us and to our staff that people were losing their homes and their hopes. Over $400 million in federal funding was delivered to help construct the new Transbay Terminal. That Act, championed by then-Speaker N
ANCY PELOSI and supported by the entire Bay Area delegation, literally cre-ated the foundation of the project. Other poli-cies created by the City of San Francisco also contributed mightily to a resurrection of the local economy. Today, construction cranes are as numerous on the skyline of the City and County of San Francisco as are cable cars on its streets. In an interview published just before his re-tirement, he noted that he was able to nego-tiate a string of project labor agreements that will give jobs to families for a generation to come. He cited projects on Treasure Island, Hunters Point/Candlestick Point, the city’s wastewater system, and the new Transbay Terminal, among many projects transforming the city’s streets and skies. He also noted his goal that housing be created for all income groups, but particularly for middle and work-ing-class residents who are his and our neigh-bors and friends. Another key tool to keep middle class families in San Francisco is to offer middle class jobs. Mike Theriault was in-strumental in getting shop classes reestab-lished in the high school system. From these shop classes will come future Mike Theriaults, apprentices of the year. As he retires, he says that he’s going to work in his garden and will write bad poetry. We seriously doubt that he will write bad po-etry and we hope that his garden flourishes. He deserves time to contemplate the skyline and the hopes that he built across 33 years of union membership, and definitely more time to spend with his wife, Diana, and their two boys, Josquin and Eugene. It’s been said that hope springs eternal, but in truth it takes great leadership to keep hope alive across a generation. Mike has earned the gratitude of his membership and his com-munity for keeping hope alive throughout these years. Like the Golden Gate Bridge cre-ated by prior ironworkers, Michael Theriault is truly one for the ages. f 
RECOGNIZING MR. LORENZO CANDELARIA 
HON. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM 
OF NEW MEXICO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Lorenzo Candelaria, whose family’s farm has played an integral role in our community’s food system and culture for over 300 years. Mr. Candeleria is the owner of Cornelio Candelaria Organics, located in the South Val-ley. Mr. Candelaria’s family has lived in New Mexico for 500 years and farmed in the Atrisco Valley for seven generations over the course of 300 years. Originally, the Candeleria family farm produced crops such as corn, beans, squash, and New Mexico’s world fa-mous chiles. Mr. Candelaria has expanded to make other produce like cucumbers, melons, asparagus, and blackberries. Mr. Candelaria has also certified his land as USDA Organic, a significant investment that il-lustrates his desire to pass the farm down to future generations. He uses an acequia sys-tem to irrigate his land, an especially sustain-able process that restores the underground water tables. Rather than focusing on only one crop, Mr. Candelaria is committed to respon-sible farming practices like crop rotation, which is healthier for soil fertility. Mr. Candelaria is also dedicated to teaching farming skills and life lessons to young people in our community. Every summer, he invites interns to work on the farm in order to learn about his responsible agricultural practices as well as how to operate the equipment. He also regularly invites student groups from local

schools to learn about agriculture and nutrition issues. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Lorenzo Candelaria for all the valuable contributions him and his family have made to our commu-nity. His organic produce has been a wonder-ful option for local shoppers and restaurants looking for healthy options, and his warmth and generosity have helped shape the lives of so many young people in the Albuquerque area.

HONORING THE VALLEJO BRANCH OF THE NAACP 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Vallejo Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) on its 100th anniver-sary. The Vallejo Branch of the NAACP received its Charter on July 8, 1918. It was the second Branch established in California, after the Sac-ramento Branch. Since its founding, the Vallejo Branch has worked tirelessly with com-munity and religious leaders to fulfill the prom-ise of equality to all Americans. Early in its ex-istence, the Vallejo Branch collaborated with prominent African-American professionals, members of the clergy and business leaders on anti-lynching legislation, desegregation and political rights. The Vallejo Branch later ex-panded its focus to include advocacy for better jobs and pay for people of color on Mare Is-land and desegregation of the federal housing projects in Vallejo. Most recently, the Vallejo Branch of the NAACP has worked to address the high rate of sexually transmitted diseases and infections (STDs and STIs) among African Americans aged fourteen to twenty-five in Solano County, and Vallejo specifically. The Vallejo Branch has also been focused on educating, testing, and treating STDs and STIs and secured $250,000 to work towards this goal. The Branch’s Legal Redress team has been active in the litigation of numerous discrimination issues involving housing, school, and employ-ment injustices in Vallejo. Its Education Com-mittee is actively involved in Vallejo’s school system to guarantee that all students have equal access to quality education. In addition, the Vallejo Branch encourages its members to exercise their hard won right to vote. Mr. Speaker, the Vallejo Branch of the NAACP has been an important institution in our community for 100 years. The Vallejo Branch has worked continuously to improve the lives of African Americans in our commu-nity. It is therefore fitting and proper that we honor it here today.

RECOGNIZING THE DAUGHTERS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the week of September 17th through the 23rd as Constitution Week and acknowledge the Daughters of the American Revolution for their dedication to upholding the importance of the Constitution. This year marks the 231st anniversary of the framing of the Constitution of the United States of Amer-ica and the 62nd observance of Constitution Week. Constitution Week began after the Daugh-ters of the American Revolution petitioned President Eisenhower in 1955. They petitioned the President to annually set aside the week of September 17th through the 23rd as a week of observance of the Constitution. After being signed into law on August 2nd, 1956, Constitution Week has served as a time of emphasis on citizen’s responsibilities to pro-tect the Constitution, inform the public on the importance of the Constitution, and encourage the study the history that led to the framing of the Constitution in 1787. In Central New York, the members of the Owasco Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution have championed the ideals of the Constitution since their founding on April 28, 1897 in Auburn, New York. Since then, they have been exemplary in their com-mitment to education, community service, equality, and patriotism throughout the region. The Constitution is the foundation of our country and grants us all the freedoms that we enjoy today. As we celebrate this year’s Con-stitution Week, I want to honor the Daughters of the American Revolution for playing such a pivotal role in creating this tradition and recog-nize the importance the Constitution as a de-fining part of our country’s history. f

J. FRANK DOBIE HIGH SCHOOL CELEBRATES 50 YEARS 
HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a great school, J. Frank Dobie High School in Houston, Texas on 50 years of molding the young minds of the South Belt- Ellington area. Named for Texas folklorist and former Uni-versity of Texas professor J. Frank Dobie, Dobie High school opened with 980 students in 1968 to address the growing population boom in the South Belt area. The original high school, located on Beamer Road, was a sig-nificant achievement in its construction alone, being the first district high school designed to be completely air conditioned. With the excep-tion of the gyms, the building had no windows, making it an ideal shelter for tornados. The school moved to a new building in the fall of 2003, served as a critical emergency shelter during Hurricane Harvey and helped save many lives. Throughout the years, Dobie High School has been a leader in many areas, pro-ducing national championship Academic De-cathlon teams, countless district victories in sports, music and agriculture. Dobie High School demonstrates an unparalleled commit-ment to enhancing the education of students in the South Belt-Ellington area. On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-sional District of Texas, congratulations again to J. Frank Dobie High School on 50 years of academic excellence. f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF CLARENCE JORDAN 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to re-member the life of Clarence Jordan, who passed away on September 8, 2018 at the age of 88. Clarence dedicated his life to aiding the underprivileged throughout the Central New York community. Over the last five dec-ades, Clarence raised more than $100 million to support those who needed it the most in the region. Clarence Jordan was born in Fall River, Massachusetts and grew up during the Great Depression. His childhood was not an easy one. His father was an alcoholic who abused him and, by the time he was 11 years old, both his parents passed away due to tuber-culosis. Clarence spent his adolescent years without a stable home, living in California and Massachusetts. He became close to Jesus Christ during this time and the church commu-nity became his new family. Clarence studied at Barrington College and intended to work as a missionary in China, but those plans were cancelled after communists established their control in the country. He in-stead served as Associate Director at Goodwill Industries in Bridgeport, Connecticut and was the Associate Pastor of Calvary Evangelical Church. In 1959, Clarence moved to Syracuse to serve as Director of Men’s Social Services at the Rescue Mission. This move marked the beginning of Clarence’s philanthropy in Central New York. After serving in his new position for just a year, Clarence was promoted to Executive Di-rector at the Rescue Mission. The Rescue Mission rapidly became one of the most ex-tensive social service groups in Central New York with Clarence at the head of the organi-zation. During his tenure from 1960 to 2000, Clarence grew the Rescue Mission to 333 em-ployees and a budget of $10 million, as well

as established multiple programs addressing poverty, hunger and addiction. Additionally, Rescue Mission received the Eleanor Roo-sevelt Community Services Award in 1985, New York State’s high award for a voluntary agency. Clarence left Rescue Mission in 2000 and continued to fundraise for several commu-nity projects, including the creation of the Clar-ence L. Jordan Vision Center in 2012. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues in the House join me to honor the remarkable life of Clarence Jordan. He was truly a model citizen for the Central New York community and dedi-cated his life to the well-being of others. His many contributions impacted hundreds of lives and will not be forgotten.

CELEBRATING MATHER FIELD’S 100TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. AMI BERA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-ognize Mather Field as they celebrate their centennial anniversary in Sacramento County. During World War I the Army activated Mills Air Field, east of Sacramento. It was renamed Mather Field in honor of 2nd Lieutenant Carl Spencer Mather, killed in 1918 during a train-ing flight collision in Texas, at the request of his classmates. Following World War I, Mather was temporarily shut down as a military base but reopened in 1925 and hosted the first an-nual ‘‘Aerial Circus’’, featuring 90 airplanes demonstrating aerobatic stunts and displays. Two years later, Charles Lindbergh and the fa-mous The Spirit of St. Louis visited Mather Field following his first solo transatlantic flight. In 1930, Mather was reactivated as a train-ing center for the U.S. Armed Forces and later played an important role preparing the Army for the fight in the Pacific Theater. With an Al-lied victory in sight, Mather Field’s training ac-tivities ended in 1944 and it became a major stopover point for troops and aircraft headed to and from the Pacific. Following U.S. victory in the Pacific, Mather returned to its status as a training base and ownership was transferred to the U.S. Air Force as part of the Air Train-ing Command. The Department of Defense moved all of its navigator training to Mather AFB in 1964 and navigator training became Mather’s specialty for several decades. In 1976, the Interservice Undergraduate Navigator Training was estab-lished at Mather to serve Navy, Marine and Coast Guard students and trained the first fe-male navigators. While Mather AFB was decommissioned in 1993, Mather Field continues to support the Sacramento region. The Former base now hosts Sacramento’s Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Mather Business Park and Mather Air-port, which is an important regional cargo hub. I am incredibly proud to represent Mather and the surrounding community. As Mather Field celebrates its 100th birthday at the 2018 California Capital Airshow, I ask my col-leagues to join me in honoring this historic landmark for all it has provided our region and our country over the last century. CELEBRATING HONOWAI ELEMEN-TARY SCHOOL’S RECOGNITION AS A GREEN RIBBON SCHOOL HON. COLLEEN HANABUSA 
OF HAWAII  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Ms. HANABUSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Honowai Elementary School in Waipahu, Hawaii, and all its achievements in being designated a Green Ribbon School by the Department of Education. As many of my colleagues know, Green Ribbon Schools are awarded for mitigating their environmental impacts, improving health and wellness within their communities, and pursuing effective environmental and sustain-ability education. The purpose of the award is to inspire schools, districts, and post-sec-ondary institutions to pursue sustainable prac-tices and education for the twenty-first century. State education officials nominate their top schools to be considered for this award. It is important to note that close to half of all Green Ribbon Schools honorees educate majority disadvantaged student populations. Honowai Elementary has pursued the stand-ards and values of the Green Ribbon Schools award through an interactive, community-ori-ented process. Not only has Honowai installed solar photovoltaic modules that reduce the school’s carbon footprint, but the data col-lected on this array is used in classrooms to teach students about renewable energy. Stu-dents are taught and encouraged to spread green practices that conserve energy and re-duce their carbon footprints. Through profes-sional development and new curricula for fac-ulty, the physical improvements to the school, which include aquaponics and hydroponics systems, extend learning beyond the class-room and to the campus and broader commu-nity. At the same time, Honowai Elementary situ-ates traditional and Native Hawaiian practices and concepts of sustainability within our con-temporary economy and society. The lo‘i patch on campus provides a sustainable source of taro for food while teaching students the unique practices and values of Hawaii’s indig-enous heritage. Students understand diverse cultures and histories through a curriculum fo-cused on oral history, which in turn helps them forge stronger personal values and identities and connect with their communities. These accomplishments cannot be under-stated for a community consisting of single family and low-income housing and in which sixty-six percent of students qualify for free or reduced price lunch. Through its efforts, not only has Honowai Elementary given much to the local community and all its members, but the school has also represented Hawaii well on the national stage. I am proud of what the students, parents, faculty, and staff have come together to accomplish, and I look forward to their continued success as a school and com-munity. Mr. Speaker, I ask my distinguished col-leagues to join me in congratulating Honowai Elementary School, its students, faculty, and staff for their achievements, as well as all Green Ribbon Schools for what they con-tribute to our communities. IN RECOGNITION OF MS. ASCHLEY SCHILLER, PROFESSIONAL STAFF, HOUSE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS HON. JOHN ABNEY CULBERSON 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Aschley Schiller, a member of the professional staff of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on the Departments of Com-merce, Justice, Science, and Related Agen-cies, who plans to pursue other opportunities after eight outstanding years of Federal gov-ernment service. Aschley started her Federal career in 2010 as a Presidential Management Fellow after re-ceiving a bachelor’s degree in history from Texas A&M University in 2008 and a Master’s degree in public policy from the University of Michigan’s Gerald Ford School of Public Pol-icy in 2010. The Presidential Management Fel-lows program is a highly selective, prestigious two-year training and development program for recent graduates with advanced degrees. As a Presidential Management Fellow, she worked for the Small Business Administration to improve its acquisition processes and for the Office of Management and Budget ana-lyzing proposed business loan subsidy rates and agency activities for inclusion in the yearly President’s budget request. After completing her fellowship, Aschley worked as a strategic advisor to the Chief Fi-nancial Officer of the Small Business Adminis-tration. There, she evaluated government-wide budget and procurement policy changes and reviewed agency budgets, programs and per-formance. Aschley came to the House Appropriations Committee in 2013 where she worked as an analyst for the Surveys and Investigations of-fice conducting oversight of military construc-tion and veterans affairs programs. She con-ducted reviews of several multi-billion dollar programs to identify weaknesses and recom-mending changes in program funding levels, policies and reporting requirements. In addi-tion, Aschley helped improve the operations of the Surveys and Investigations office by re-ducing the time required to issue reports and improving communications with subcommittee staff. I met Aschley in 2015 when she became a professional staff member of the Commerce, Justice, Science House Appropriations Sub-committee. Since that time she has done an outstanding job supporting the Subcommittee, the Federal government and the American people. Aschley is expert in the operations of the Departments of Commerce and Justice. She has provided me with analysis of their ac-tivities and budget requests, prepared me for hearings with agency heads and Cabinet sec-retaries, advised me on how to respond to funding and reorganizations proposals, and provided constant oversight of agency activi-ties. Aschley has written several Appropria-tions bills, advised me how to respond to amendments during Full Committee meetings and House Floor consideration, and she has negotiated several Appropriations bills with the Senate and the Minority party. Aschley should be proud that her intelligent and hard work for the House Appropriations

Committee has improved our nation’s ability to forecast the weather, study the ocean, support the nation’s fishing industry, protect intellectual property rights, respond to natural disasters, and improve the course of justice. Aschley will be missed by the Committee. We wish her well, thank her for her years of service, and know that she will excel at what-ever future endeavors she pursues.

RECOGNIZING MS. MELINDA DYE FOR RECEIVING A PERSONAL ACHIEVEMENT AWARD FROM THE HEALTHSOUTH REHABILITA-TION HOSPITAL OF ALTOONA 
HON. BILL SHUSTER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mindy Dye, one of the winners of the 25th annual Personal Achievement Award from the HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital of Altoona. This award is given to encourage and recognize those who have made an out-standing effort to deal with or overcome a dis-ability. This year, Mindy has earned that dis-tinction. Mindy suffered a major stroke in December 2017 that affected her speech and body. She could not walk, talk and lost all muscle control on her right side. Every day was a struggle in therapy as she tried to regain her strength, balance, ability to walk and her ability to speak. Another setback occurred a few months later during her cranium replacement surgery when she ended up with an infection that required an emergency procedure and several months of antibiotics. Ultimately, Mindy resumed her therapy, was always will-ing to do her best, maintained a positive atti-tude, and was motivated to get better. Today, Mindy has made an amazing recov-ery through her hard work and determination. Her extremity strength, balance and functional mobility have returned, and she continues to make progress in therapy. She is now able to enjoy gardening, hiking and spending time with her family. I am humbled to recognize the truly impres-sive recovery Mindy has made. Her strength and positivity in the face of such adversity is remarkable. As such, it is my pleasure to wish Mindy the best as she continues to reclaim her health and life.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 20th Anniversary of Inter-national Association of Fire Fighters Local 3886 of Spotsylvania, a brave group of men and women who every day put their service to the community above self. Additionally, I would like to recognize that this year is the 100th anniversary of the IAFF: celebrating a century of progress through unity. IAFF Local 3886 is made up of over 125 full-time members who help to keep and pro-tect the citizens of Spotsylvania County, Vir-ginia. To accomplish this incredible task, Local 3886 operates 24/7 out of six fire stations throughout the county and 13/5 at an addi-tional four. With advanced life support and specialty equipment, the men and women of this proud organization provide a service for which mere thanks is never enough. As pro-fessional firefighters, they are true to the name; professionalism, dependability, and dis-tinction underlies the entirety of their work. The IAFF as a whole provides firefighters for many different operations, including to help protect the men and women of our armed forces. The services of the IAFF extend to fire-fighting crews for military bases throughout the country and around the world. Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me in recog-nizing the accomplishments of the IAFF and IAFF Local 3886. Words alone cannot express our gratitude. May God bless the operations of the IAFF and Local 3886, and I look forward to seeing their excellence for many years into the future.

REVIEWING CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN ETHIOPIA 
HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, yesterday we held a hearing at the Sub-committee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organiza-tions, which I chair. Our first order of business was to note that today many Ethiopians are celebrating the start of the New Year under the Ethiopian cal-endar. To our Ethiopian friends who observe the new year, I wish to say ‘‘Enkutatash’’— Happy New Year. Many of the hearings that this subcommittee holds are hearings of condemnation—for abuses of human rights, for failures of govern-ance, and for holding accountable those who betray the public trust. Yesterday’s hearing, however, struck a dif-ferent tone—one not of condemnation, but of commendation for the great strides Ethiopia has made since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed assumed authority in April of this year. Consider where we were just over a year ago. A State of Emergency existed, and thou-sands of political prisoners languished in jail. A cold war standoff existed between Ethiopia and its neighbor Eritrea. As this subcommittee pointed out in a hear-ing we held in March of 2017, ‘‘increasingly re-pressive policies have diminished political space and threaten to radicalize not only the political opposition but also civil society by frustrating their ability to exercise their rights under law.’’ In response to this, I introduced, along with original cosponsors KAREN BASS and M IKE C
OFFMAN , H. Res. 128, a resolution ‘‘Sup-porting Respect for Human Rights and En-couraging Inclusive Governance in Ethiopia.’’ The resolution set forth milestones which needed to be met, and passed thanks to the leadership of many—including Chairman E
D R
OYCE who guided the Resolution through Foreign Affairs Committee markup and Leader K
EVIN MCCARTHY , who scheduled a vote on H. Res. 128 that passed the House unopposed and sent a clear message of Congressional resolve on the need for civil and political re-form in Ethiopia. But success of this measure was due in largest part to the efforts of the Ethiopian dias-pora community in the United States, which came together to demand that egregious human rights abuses immediately cease, and that fundamental human rights must be pro-moted and protected for all in Ethiopia. Indeed, one of the greatest collateral bene-fits brought about by passage of H. Res. 128 is the political effectiveness of the Ethiopian American community, which provided a text-book civics lesson for all of us to admire. It is thanks to their tireless efforts of contacting your congressional representatives, of making your case in a persistent and respectful man-ner that helped spur Congress to action. Since assuming office, Prime Minister Abiy has begun to implement some of the very re-forms that H. Res. 128 called for. He has re-leased thousands of political prisoners, and lifted the state of emergency, for example. But he has also reached out to the diaspora community, catalyzed an end to a schism that had plagued the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, and initiated an historic peace deal between Ethiopia and Eritrea this past July. Indeed, it is hoped that his domestic reforms will also in-spire Eritrea, which remains a repressive re-gime, to undertake similar internal reforms. Just a few weeks ago, Ranking Member K
AREN BASSand I visited the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, where we met with Prime Minister Abiy and a broad array of individuals and groups, including His Holiness, Abune Mathias I. One impression I had—was of a profound feeling of change and optimism. For what he has accomplished in less than half a year, Prime Minister deserves praise and encouragement. Yet we still must keep in mind that expectations have been raised, and the reforms he has begun must continue. For example, the notorious Charities and Society Proclamation and the Anti-Terrorism Proclamation, both passed in 2009, remain on the books and thus retain the potential to stifle legitimate civil society organizations and polit-ical speech. Many former prisoners and torture victims still demand justice. Ranking Member B
ASS and I met with a group of torture victims in Addis Ababa, and what they described as hav-ing been done to them was horrific. One re-frain we heard, including from the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, is that there is a need for Truth and Reconciliation in order for the coun-try to move forward.

There also needs to be an opportunity for people who have been displaced to return home. Catholic Bishop Abaraham Desta of Meld recently brought to my attention that over two and a half million people are internally dis-placed and require the government’s imme-diate attention, especially by providing edu-cation for displaced children, as the school year has already started. The economy needs to grow to provide jobs for the many youth, including those who par-ticipated in protests and civic disobedience. Reforms in the economic sector, including lib-eralization and deregulation as well as an opening of economy to ethnic groups that have not been fully enfranchised, needs to continue. It has also been said that the reforms begun by Prime Minister Abiy represent a ‘‘once-in-a generation opportunity for Ethiopia.’’ It is thus absolutely crucial that this opportunity not be squandered. With this in mind, the United States must re-main a partner Ethiopia can call upon. We col-laborate on counter-terrorism measures, we support and are grateful for Ethiopia’s con-tribution to peace keeping missions—indeed, with 12,000 troops deployed, Ethiopia is the largest contributor to UN peacekeeping mis-sions worldwide—and we must continue to en-courage Ethiopia to participate in our IMET military professionalization programs. I do believe, having met the man and had an opportunity to engage in substantive dis-course with him, that Prime Minister Abiy is the right man at the right time, and is therefore deserving of our support.

RECOGNIZING MR. GARY GREEN FOR RECEIVING A PERSONAL ACHIEVEMENT AWARD FROM THE HEALTHSOUTH REHABILITA-TION HOSPITAL OF ALTOONA 
HON. BILL SHUSTER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Gary Green of Huntingdon, PA, one of the winners of the 25th annual Per-sonal Achievement Award from the HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital of Altoona. This award is given to encourage and recog-nize those who have made an outstanding ef-fort to deal with or overcome a disability. This year, Mr. Green has earned that distinction. Mr. Green suffered a stroke in October of 2017 that affected his speech and body. Among his many challenges were numbness and weakness on the left side of his body, dif-ficulty in performing daily tasks, and impaired memory. Mr. Green, aided by a positive atti-tude and the strong support of his wife, fol-lowed the therapy plan established at HealthSouth with tremendous success. Today—nearly a year later—he is able to walk, complete his daily living skills, speak clearly and swallow safely. It is my honor to congratulate Mr. Green on his remarkable progress and promising im-provements, as I believe that it is through role models like him that we all can learn to over-come our hardships. Furthermore, I am happy to recognize him for his perseverance, and I wish him the best as he continues to over-come this adversity. RECOGNIZING RETIREMENT OF CHIEF DANNY BOWMAN HON. DOUG COLLINS 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a servant leader in my district who has made a tremendous dif-ference in the lives of thousands in Forsyth County, Georgia. For more than half a cen-tury, Chief Danny D. Bowman has served as a Georgia firefighter displaying the values of selflessness, honor, and patriotism. Chief Bowman is an Atlanta native and vet-eran of the United States Air Force. He began his career as a firefighter in Atlanta in 1968. After serving with the Atlanta Fire Department, he joined the Fulton County Fire Department in 1977. Bowman came to Forsyth County as a divi-sion chief in 2001 and began serving as the county’s director of emergency management in 2002. He took the reins as Fire Chief in 2003. Forsyth County Commission Chairman Todd Levent credits Chief Bowman with ‘‘mak-ing the local department what it is today.’’ Chief Bowman will officially retire this Octo-ber, and I commend him for a career of sacrifi-cial service to Forsyth County and the great state of Georgia.

CELEBRATING DONI MILLER’S 25 YEARS OF PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recog-nize the life profession of Doni Miller of To-ledo, Ohio. Doni has given herself to the prac-tice of public health administration and is being recognized in a silver anniversary cele-bration tomorrow evening. After serving as an administrator in a public hospital, Doni took over the helm of Toledo’s then-struggling Federally Qualified Health Center in 1993. Under her able leadership and steady guidance, Doni was able to turn around the ailing system within a few years and turn it into a premiere organization which is a model for others. Now, 25 years later, the Neighborhood Health Association is a con-glomerate of fourteen clinics in neighborhoods throughout Lucas County, Ohio serving well the health care needs of thousands of people. Its clinics are a medical home for some of the most vulnerable among us and the services provided are life changing and life altering. It is impossible to separate the growth and success of the Neighborhood Health Associa-tion from Doni Miller. Her skill at selecting the right person for the job, providing opportunity and accomplishment, has been an important part of the organization’s incredible achieve-ments. Doni Miller has sacrificed and per-severed to bring the agency to the outstanding organization it is today. She has initiated cre-ative and unique approaches to continue to develop the Neighborhood Health Association, and nurtures talent along with her. Because of her intimate knowledge of health care delivery, Doni’s counsel is sought after by many, including myself. Her knowledge and advice is respected and well-earned. She is equally known for her ardent support of the rights of women and people who are under-privileged. In addition to her role as CEO of the Neighborhood Health Association, Doni Miller also served as President of the Toledo Lucas County Port Authority, is a founding member of the Black Women’s Democratic Caucus, and has served on several other Boards and Commissions. She has been a political analyst for local television including Conklin and Company and Toledo Up-front. For several years she has hosted Bridges, a local public affairs television program focusing on important social and economic issues fac-ing our community and nation. Just a few of the recognitions awarded to her include the Chamber of Commerce ATHENA Award, the YWCA Milestones Award, the state Demo-cratic Women’s Caucus Award, the African American Legacy Award and the 2016 NAACP Freedom Fund Award. Her most important role is that of mother to a young woman successful in her own right. Doni Miller is a true community leader. Her abilities, compassion and leadership have lift-ed up community. She notes she is most in-spired by Nelson Mandela’s quote, ‘‘The elimi-nation of poverty is not charity, it is justice.’’ Doni Miller truly lives this creed and I am so proud to join our citizens in paying tribute to her. f 
COMMEMORATING THE 100TH ANNI-VERSARY OF WILLIAM WOOD EL-EMENTARY SCHOOL 
HON. MICHAEL CLOUD 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Wil-liam Wood Elementary School, an educational mainstay in the Victoria community. The school’s namesake, Mr. William Wood, was born in 1861 and died of pneumonia in 1900 at the age of 39. He married Nellie Borland on June 17, 1890. They owned and operated a ranch east of Telferner, Texas where they were prominent residents of the community. Their 5 children were Nellie, Frank P., Margaret, Corine, and Jessie. Upon his passing, his wife donated ten acres of land for the site of William A. Wood Memorial High School. It’s assumed that being a former teacher herself had something to do with her choice of commemoration. Construction began in 1918 and took two years to complete. On September 13, 1918, The Victoria Daily Advocate wrote: ‘‘The schoolhouse is beginning to go undercover as Mr. Gruy is putting up the framework of the roof’’. The building consisted of four class-rooms with two rooms on either side of a large hallway. Construction of the school was not finished until 1920. William A. Wood Memorial High School was added to the Shiller-Hood School District, which consisted of several small neighborhood schools. By the late 1940s, however, William A. Wood High School became the Shiller- Hood District’s only school. In 1956, the Shiller-Hood School District ceased to exist, and the Victoria Independent School District

adopted William A. Wood High School. Even-tually, the Victoria Independent School District transformed the high school into an elemen-tary school to address a growing need for ele-mentary education in the community. On April 14, 1944, 21-year-old 2nd Lieuten-ant Thomas J. Flynn, an instructor at nearby Foster Field (now the Victoria Regional Air-port), heroically gave his life to save the chil-dren of William Wood. Flynn was flying his plane over the school on a combat training mission when he encountered engine trouble. Knowing that abandoning the aircraft could cause it to hit the school, Lt. Flynn remained in the plane so that he could guide it away from the school. Because of Lt. Flynn’s ac-tions, countless lives were saved that day, and the school embraced a new mascot, the ‘‘Avi-ators’’, in Lt. Flynn’s honor. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to recognize the 100th anniversary of such a historic institution that has shaped Texas young minds for a cen-tury. I want to extend my sincerest gratitude to all the educators that helped make William Wood such an impactful institution.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Michael Kline, one of the win-ners of the 25th annual Personal Achievement Award from the HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital of Altoona. This award is given to en-courage and recognize those who have made an outstanding effort to deal with or overcome a disability. This year, Dr. Kline has earned that distinction. Dr. Kline has been serving the community as a primary-care physician for more than two decades. In this capacity, Dr. Kline is known for his attentive care for his patients. However, he was admitted to HealthSouth Rehab Hos-pital for Physical Therapy in April of this year with a long list of problems that prevented him from being able to walk unassisted. These in-cluded pelvic fractures, multiple rib fractures, leg weakness and decreased balance. Dr. Kline maintained a positive attitude and work ethic, and displayed the determination for recovery he has always encouraged with his patients. Through these efforts, he has re-gained his ability to walk without any devices, is driving once again and recently returned to work. It is my pleasure to congratulate Dr. Kline on his successful progress. His accomplish-ments are a testament to us all that with hard work and persistence, we can overcome any hardship. I honor him for his perseverance, and I wish him the best as he continues to overcome this setback. TRIBUTE TO CARMEN AND JIM LUNDBERG HON. DAVID YOUNG

Mrs. Dixon has been a resident of Elbert County since August 24, 1918.

Blanford, Mr. George Dixon, Mr. Oscar Dixon, and Mr. Neal Dixon. In addition to raising a family, Mrs. Dixon in-vested her local community through her work for the Elberton Recreational Department dur-ing baseball and football seasons. She regu-larly attended basketball games at Elbert County Comprehensive High School until just last year. This August 24, Mrs. Dixon celebrated her centennial birthday during a party at the local Masonic Lodge. Surrounded by family and friends, Mrs. Dixon oversaw the cutting of a very special birthday cake. I celebrate a century lived in Northeast Georgia and wish Mrs. Dixon a joyful year ahead. f

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jerre Sell of Imler, PA, a winner of the Patient Advocate Award from the HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital of Altoona. Jerre’s son, Troy, endured a catastrophic event in 2016 when he suffered both Anoxic and Traumatic Brain Injuries. Throughout this immensely challenging time, Jerre has always supported his son and has been heavily in-volved with his care—all while continuing to work at his present job that he’s held for more than 40 years. He has been with Troy during his inpatient stays, transported him to every Outpatient therapy visit, and has pushed for the many medication changes and ongoing therapies for his son. Jerre, himself, recently underwent back sur-gery, but is back to work and continuing to be Troy’s caregiver. He has displayed a strong character and stayed positive despite the many challenges he has overcome. While his son’s efforts to recover are worth celebrating in their own right, there can be no doubt that Jerre has provided exemplary care. Given his admirable actions in support of his son and family through a time of tremendous hardship, Jerre is unquestionably deserving of this recognition. As such, it is my honor to help celebrate his having received this award.

INTRODUCTION OF THE TROUBLED NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS COM-MUNITIES ASSISTANCE 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Troubled Nuclear Power Plants Communities Assistance Act. This bill seeks to mitigate the human casualties that result from the upheaval of the energy industry, where we see many nuclear power plants struggling to remain afloat as other sources of energy have become cheaper and cheaper. The impact on local economies due to the potential loss of jobs and the tax base when nuclear power plants close can be severe. In my district, if the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Plant closes, it will mean the loss of 700 high-ly paid skilled 900 megawatt nuclear industry workers. And for every 100 nuclear power

plant jobs, 66 related jobs are created in the local community. These plants are among the largest tax-payers in their communities, typically contrib-uting tens of millions of dollars in local taxes. For years, the Davis-Besse plant in my Dis-trict, generated $20 million a year in tax rev-enue for Ottawa County, of which $12.1 mil-lion went to the school district. This bill proposes to offer these commu-nities adjustment support to soften the blow of the significant revenue losses that will harm local communities by infusing federal pay-ments on a gliding path over eight years to eli-gible local governments—should the worst happen. The funding will provide 80 percent of the lost revenues during the first year and will decrease by 10 percent per year for the re-maining years of eligibility. Let me be clear. We are not giving up on Davis-Besse, nor should we easily give up on other nuclear power plants around the country. Nuclear power provides the large majority of clean energy in this country. And from a na-tional security perspective, we must consider the impact of the anticipated closure on our Nation’s nuclear supply chain—that absolutely includes highly trained people and tech-nologies. Ohioans don’t give up. It is in our history. During the Battle of Lake Erie, Commander Oliver Hazard Perry, who is memorialized at Perry’s Monument just a few miles from Davis- Besse, unfurled a flag that read ‘‘Don’t Give Up the Ship.’’ Well we are not giving up and we plan to keep fighting for the community and those impacted by the future of Davis- Besse. But should the worst happen, I urge my col-leagues to support this bill, and to consider the toll this will have on communities. Schools, roads, law enforcement and other fundamental civil services that people need will be gutted. This is not an isolated problem facing the peo-ple of Northern Ohio, but dozens of other communities are facing the prospect of clo-sures of plants across this nation. We owe them our best effort to provide a pathway for recovery should the worst hap-pen.

UCAS , in introducing the Hidden Figures Con-gressional Gold Medal Act. The contributions of women mathematicians and engineers to the warfighting effort during World War II and the nation’s space program have for too long gone unrecognized. While hundreds of women helped bring about one of the nation’s crown-ing technological achievements, landing the first man on the moon, their names are largely lost to history. From the 1930s to the 1970s, women at NASA and its precursor organization, NACA, submitted their work anonymously, were paid less than their male peers, and had few op-portunities for career advancement. In addi-tion, women of color working in the West Area Computing Unit were initially subjected to the indignity of segregated bathrooms, dining fa-cilities, and water fountains. The popular book by Margot Lee Shetterly, entitled Hidden Figures, and the subsequent film adaptation, have finally helped bring their incredible and inspiring stories to light. Despite the numerous challenges they faced, women like Katherine Johnson, Mary Jackson, Doro-thy Vaughan, and Christine Darden per-severed. Their accomplishments will, I hope, inspire young girls to consider careers in STEM fields. The positive attention being paid to their individual stories and the stories of the hundreds of women working alongside them is well deserved and long overdue. This bill will bestow Congress’s highest civil-ian honor in appreciation of the achievements of Katherine Johnson, Mary Jackson, Dorothy Vaughan, Christine Darden, and all the women mathematicians and engineers at NACA and NASA who devoted their talents in service to the nation during this important time in our history. I want to thank Senator COONS for his lead-ership in championing the effort to honor these women in the Senate with his legislation, S. 3321. Our bill builds on Senator C
OONS ’ bill by extending the honor to the hundreds of lesser- known women who worked alongside the four women made famous by the Hidden Figures book and movie. While I am grateful that this book and movie have shone a light on these women and their experiences, I think it’s important to acknowl-edge that the term Hidden Figures is a bit mis-leading. These women and their talents were never hidden from us. As is far too often the case when women—and especially women of color—are involved, we as a society chose to overlook them. I urge my colleagues to join us in rectifying this oversight and help us give these women the recognition they deserve.

RECOGNIZING THE CAPTAIN AND CREW OF THE ‘‘CARNIVAL ELA-TION’’ 
HON. FREDERICA S. WILSON 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay special tribute to the captain and crew of the Carnival Elation for their incredible bravery during the rescue of a fishing boat stranded in the Gulf of Mexico during Hurri-cane Irma last year. Their mettle will be hon-ored this week by the Association for Rescue at Sea. While undergoing routine maintenance and the replacement of its bridge navigation sys-tem in Freeport, Bahamas, the Carnival Ela-tion began monitoring a storm developing off the coast of Western Africa. When the storm quickly grew to a Category 5 hurricane and it became clear that its path would likely lead di-rectly over the Bahamas, the decision was made to move the ship and seek shelter in the Gulf of Mexico. While sailing away from Hurricane Irma’s path, the Elation received a relayed distress message from the U.S. Coast Guard alerting them that a fishing boat, the Captain Eddie, was taking on water approximately 60 nautical miles to their east and that two crewmembers were in dire need of assistance. Elation Cap- tain Gaetano Gigliotti and his crew imme-diately set out to assist in the rescue, while the Coast Guard planned to provide a heli-copter in support of the effort. The Elation navigated through treacherous conditions, fac-ing 15–20-foot waves and sustaining winds of 40 knots, gusting at times to well over 60 knots. Despite these conditions, and without normal comprehensive bridge systems and communications equipment due to their early evacuation, the Elation stayed the course, only to be informed shortly before arriving at the struggling fishing boat that the USCG could no longer provide helicopter assistance due to the dangerous wind conditions. Nearing the fishing boat, Captain Gigliotti decided it was too dangerous to allow an Ela- tion rescue ship to pick up the fishermen and instead chose to move the Elation closer to the life raft to facilitate a rescue through a sin-gle open door in the hull. The Captain skillfully maneuvered the 70,000+ ton, 260+ meter Ela- tion at slow speed in the heavy winds and seas, successfully positioning the ship along-side the life raft. Ignoring the potential risk to their own lives, several Elation deck team members were able to successfully bring the sole survivor on board using a harness and hoisting line. Unfortunately, the Elation crew quickly learned from the survivor that his fel-low crewmembers had refused to abandon ship and were lost when the fishing vessel rapidly sank. The Elation medical team took excellent care of the survivor, facilitated con-tact with his family and coordinated with the U.S. embassy to ensure his timely return to the United States after the ship returned to the Bahamas. We thank Captain Gigliotti and the entire Elation crew for their bravery in coming to the rescue of this fishing boat and its crew. Their courage in the face of extreme conditions, even placing their own lives at risk to save the lives of others, stands as an example of true heroism. I am pleased their efforts have been recognized by the Association for the Rescue at Sea and that they have been awarded the 2019 Cruise Ship Humanitarian Assistance Award. They also were honored by the Inter-national Maritime Organization with its 2018 Award for Exceptional Bravery at Sea. As a founder and chair of the Florida Ports Caucus and proud representative of PortMiami, which is known as the ‘‘Cruise Capital of the World,’’ it is my honor to recog-nize the captain and crew of the Carnival Ela-tion.

HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital of Altoona. This award is given to encourage and recog-nize those who have made an outstanding ef-fort to deal with or overcome a disability. This year, Mr. Summers has earned that distinc-tion. Matt was involved in a motorcycle accident in September 2017 that left him with multiple fractures, a spinal cord injury and a Traumatic Brain Injury. Since the fateful day of that crash, he has made tremendous gains in his recovery. During his time in rehab, Matt was dependent on a wheelchair due to little muscle activity in his legs as well as nerve damage in his right arm from a vertebrae fracture. How-ever, he worked hard in therapy to overcome many of his challenges, and regained his abil-ity to walk and complete his daily activities independently. Matt returned to work in the construction industry in June, and continues to push himself to new limits. I am honored to celebrate Matt’s impressive efforts, as I believe that his dedicated and positive attitude is something many of us can learn from as we attempt to overcome the hardships in our lives. Furthermore, I am happy to recognize Matt for his perseverance, and I wish him the best as he continues on the road to full recovery.

HONORING SANTA ROSA JUNIOR COLLEGE’S 100TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Santa Rosa Junior Col-lege on the 100th anniversary of its founding. Santa Rosa Junior College (SRJC) is a vital pillar of our community and a leader of junior colleges in higher education. Santa Rosa Jun-ior College was founded by community lead-ers. The original student body was comprised of nineteen individuals and they shared re-sources with the local high school. During the Great Depression, SRJC secured land to build its permanent campus. Santa Rosa Junior College has expanded over the years to in-clude a campus in Petaluma, the Southwest Santa Rosa Center, the Public Safety Training Center, and Shone Farm. SRJC has educated 1.7 million students in its 100 year history and enrolls approximately 28,000 students of all ages each semester. Santa Rosa Junior College, in conjunction with the SRJC Foundation, is committed to making education accessible for all and working to en-sure that all their students succeed. In addition to outstanding academics, the school has over 40 clubs, including conference-winning athletic teams, nationally ranked speech and debate teams, and outstanding theater, dance, and music programs. Santa Rosa Junior College is the third larg-est employer in Sonoma County. Approxi-mately 3,000 faculty and staff work at SRJC and devote their careers to helping students and our community. Additionally, the local eco-nomic impact of the college is $1.6 billion an-nually, which has brought 26,000 jobs to the surrounding area. The SRJC Foundation raises funds for students and education pro-grams at the college. The foundation is ranked number one among California community col-lege foundations for endowment size and scholarship distribution, an honor it has worked hard to earn. Mr. Speaker, Santa Rosa Junior College provides excellent opportunities for the mem-bers of our community. It is therefore fitting and proper that we honor it here today. f 
HONORING MRS. NANCY SCHO¨N 
HON. JOSEPH P. KENNEDY III 
OF MASSACHUSETTS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Nancy Scho¨n, a lifelong resident of the Fourth District of Massachusetts and a re-nowned sculptor, on the occasion of her 90th birthday on September 24, 2018. Born in 1928, Nancy’s interest in art began at a young age. Nancy graduated from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts with Hon-ors in Sculpture in 1952, and her early work was inspired by her family, which has grown to include four children, many grandchildren, and a great grandchild. Later in her career, Nancy began creating Public Art with a focus on teaching lessons. Her most famous piece, ‘‘Make Way for Ducklings,’’ can be found in the Boston Public Garden and has a theme of promises kept and family values. This focus on lessons con-tinues in her other pieces, such as the ‘‘Tor-toise and Hare’’ sculpture at the finish line of the Boston Marathon and the ‘‘Winnie-the- Pooh and Friends’’ sculptures at the Newton Free Library. Art has led Nancy many places, including the former Soviet Union, where she joined First Lady Barbara Bush to present her copy of ‘‘Make Way for Ducklings’’ to Raisa Gorba-chev as part of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). Nancy is active with non- profit organizations, and helped get the Lynch Family Skate Park built in Cambridge. Nancy is also an author, her memoir; ‘‘Make Way for Nancy’’ was published in 2017. Across Massachusetts, we are proud to call Nancy Scho¨n our neighbor and are grateful for her continued creativity. Mr. Speaker, I wish Nancy Scho¨n a very happy 90th birthday. I am deeply humbled to represent her in Congress, and I hope her 90th year is the best one yet. f 
TALLULAH RIVER ROAD 
HON. DOUG COLLINS 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank residents of Tate City for advocating for people who live in and visit Northeast Georgia. These Georgians alerted me to the unsafe conditions of Tallulah River Road, which runs through Towns and Rabun Counties. This road is the sole route to Tate City and provides access to campgrounds, fishing streams, and destinations in the Chat-tahoochee National Forest and Appalachian Trail. I wrote to the U.S. Forest Service request-ing road repair and maintenance, and would like to thank them for making timely improve-ments to Tallulah River Road. Following that letter, the talented Forest Service team, including a bulldozer driver named Brad, went to work clearing out ditches, removing roadside vegetation, man-aging potholes, and leveling and adding sig-nificant amounts of gravel to the road. Resi-dents of Tate City have since reported that Tallulah River Road is easier to navigate and the surrounding area has benefited from the improvements. None of this would have been possible with-out the advocacy of concerned citizens. I would like to thank the many residents of Tate City who reached out to help me represent the interests of Towns and Rabun County, includ-ing Larry Hample, the Harrisons, the Lovvorns, the Masseys, the Gilsons, the Penlands, the Shrivers, the Van Camps, Robin Fisher, Brantley DeLoatche, the Lisicias, Steven Sickmond, Anne Taylor, the Jareks, Nikolai Len, the Eriksons, William Giordano, Steve Harvey, and the Foremans.

HONORING JANET BAGLIERI 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Ms. MENG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today during National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month to honor my constituent and ovarian cancer sur-vivor, Janet Baglieri. For as long as Janet can remember, she’s had a sour stomach. That’s why in 2010, when she experienced prolonged periods of abdominal bloating and cramping, she initially didn’t think much of it and simply chalked it up to her long history of stomach sensitivity. Eventually, after months of discomfort, she went to the doctor who referred her to a gas-troenterologist for a colonoscopy. It was during this routine colonoscopy that doctors discov-ered Janet’s ovarian cancer, and in August of that year she was diagnosed with stage 3c ovarian cancer. After undergoing surgery, doc-tors removed two large masses from her ova-ries and performed a full hysterectomy. During Janet’s battle with ovarian cancer, she received genetic counseling and testing and discovered that she carries a BRCA2 ge-netic mutation. In contrast to other cancers, there is a much stronger hereditary compo-nent in ovarian cancer. Inherited genetic mutations cause roughly 20–25 percent of ovarian cancer cases compared to 5–10 per-cent of cancer cases overall, and BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the commonly inherited genetic mutations that cause ovarian cancer. While genetic information is ideally applied in the context of cancer risk management and prevention, it increasingly plays a role post-di-agnosis in guiding treatment options. Such is the case with Janet, who recently began tak-ing PARP inhibitors after being diagnosed with a recurrence. PARP inhibitors are an emer-gent class of targeted therapies that work by blocking the growth of cancer cells and are typically taken long-term. For BRCA positive women with ovarian cancer like Janet, PARPs have proven to be a lifeline. Today, Janet is an 8-year survivor. She has experienced the ups of remission and the downs of recurrence, all the while showcasing bravery and strength throughout her journey and never missing a beat in taking care of her family. Sharing stories like Janet’s is an important way to spread awareness not only this month, but every month. Awareness is particularly impactful when it comes to ovarian cancer be-cause there is no effective screening tool. It is notoriously hard to diagnose and progresses quickly and aggressively, often with vague or altogether absent symptoms. As a result, most ovarian cancer cases are diagnosed in the late stages, when treatment options are limited and chances for survival are diminished. Less than 50 percent of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer live five years beyond their di-agnosis. Janet is beating the odds and serves as an inspiration to all of us. In honor of Janet and every other woman who has faced an ovarian cancer diagnosis, I support designating Sep-tember as National Ovarian Cancer Aware-ness Month. HONORING HANA STITH HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mr. BANKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Hana Stith. Hana was a fixture in the greater Fort Wayne area and played an integral role in uni-fying our community. A truly dedicated citizen of Fort Wayne, Hana devoted her life to the service of others and to the preservation of history. As one of the first African American teachers hired by Fort Wayne Community Schools, Hana was a trailblazer. She took it upon herself to ensure a brighter future for those who would follow her. She refused to leave any child behind and took the time to give attention to students struggling with reading and math. In addition to preparing children for the fu-ture, she worked to help ensure that her com-munity did not forget the past. As a co-founder of the African/African American Historical Soci-ety of Allen County, she worked tirelessly to preserve the heritage of all citizens in the greater Fort Wayne community. Her pioneering efforts with the Fair Housing Group, the Panel of American Women, and the Fort Wayne Board of Safety, reminds us all that one individual truly can make a dif-ference in the lives of those around them. Throughout her entire life, she remained steadfast in her faith as a member of the Tur-ner Chapel A.M.E. Church, director of the Commission on Christian Education, and a longtime Sunday School instructor. Hana Stith spent her life aiding, educating, and inspiring others. Her impact on Fort Wayne will continue to be felt for generations to come.

RECOGNIZING HARVEY T. LEWIS ON THE OCCASION OF HIS 100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. G.K. BUTTERFIELD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and honor a great American, Mr. Harvey T. Lewis, on the occasion of his 100th birthday. Mr. Lewis has led a life of service to his country, to his community, and to others. Harvey T. Lewis was born on September 15, 1918 in Richmond, Virginia to Alberta Graves Lewis and John Edward Lewis. He is one of sixteen children raised by his parents. Mr. Lewis also had a twin sister, the late Eve-lyn Alberta Lewis. Mr. Lewis attended Arm-strong High School in Richmond, Virginia. After his father’ s passing, Mr. Lewis left school to work and help support the family. A true man of service, Mr. Lewis served his country in the United States Army Air Corps during World War II as a sergeant. He went on to hold various positions in the federal gov-ernment. After 28 years of government serv-ice, Mr. Lewis retired as Special Assistant to the Secretary for the U.S. Department of Com-merce where he was a trusted aide. Mr. Lewis is known for his work ethic and entrepreneurial successes. He worked as a Pullman porter and was a member of the Brotherhood of the Sleeping Car Porters. He has owned and operated several businesses throughout his lifetime, including a neighbor-hood delicatessen in Prince George’s County, Maryland and a cleaning service in Richmond, Virginia. Mr. Lewis was a cab driver in Wash-ington, D.C. for many years and later became a licensed limousine driver. This led to the es-tablishment of his limousine business, Limelighter Limousine Service. For 35 years, Mr. Lewis and his team provided limousine services to clients ranging from company ex-ecutives to business owners to performing art-ists. In addition to his work, Mr. Lewis is a long-time civic leader. In the 1960s, he was a civil rights advocate and used his familiarity as a professional driver in Washington, D.C. to pro-vide scores of free rides to those attending the 1963 March on Washington. Rosa Parks re-quested Mr. Lewis as her driver to the United States Capitol for her Congressional Gold Medal Ceremony. Mr. Lewis truly believed in the value of being involved in our democracy. He was an active volunteer on numerous local, state, and presidential campaigns span-ning from John F. Kennedy to Barack Obama. In 2008, at 89 years old, Mr. Lewis was one of the oldest active campaigners for Barack Obama. Upon meeting President Obama in 2012, just days after his 94th birthday, he was still an active campaigner. The most important thing to Mr. Lewis has always been his family. He is married to his wife of ten years, the former Linda Ivey. He has one daughter Dr. Freda C. Lewis-Hall son-in-law Dr. Emerson R. Hall, Jr. three grandchildren Erin, Justin, and Austin and two great-grandchildren Michael, II and Emerson. Mr. Lewis has been recognized for his out-standing service throughout his lifetime how-ever, those who know him simply refer to him as ‘‘a good man.’’ To some, Mr. Lewis is a dedicated member of his community, to oth-ers, a hardworking businessman. To his friends and family, Harvey T. Lewis is a man of faith and a devoted family man. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring and celebrating Mr. Harvey T. Lewis on his 100th birthday. May God con-tinue to bless him and his family.

Mr. Speaker, most of us know the story of Johnny Appleseed. I grew up hearing about his travels across the country—an American folk hero, who was said to wander barefoot while wearing a tin pot hat and carrying a sack of apples with him to help promote the growth of apple trees everywhere he went. What many people do not know is that Johnny Appleseed’s story is based on the life of a real man—John Chapman.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1252 September 13, 2018 
On September 26, 1774, John Chapman was born in Leominster, Massachusetts. Taught by his father from a young age, Chap-man became an orchardist and nurseryman. Since frontier law allowed anyone to lay claim to land through the development of a permanent homestead, Chapman traveled over 100,000 square miles. All the while, he planted apple seeds as he walked. At the time of his death on March 11, 1845, John Chapman owned over 1,200 acres of land from Massachusetts all the way to Illinois. Every year since 1993, thousands of people have gathered in Leominster to celebrate the life and work of John Chapman. Through live music, and of course, apple crisp, the festival aims to inspire and educate the public about Johnny Appleseed’s important ties to Central Massachusetts. And just as im-portantly, it offers a chance for our community to come together and celebrate our shared heritage. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of all the commu-nities in Central Massachusetts, I’d like to offer a sincere ‘‘thank you’’ to the hardworking vol-unteers and organizers—who make this event such a success every year. I’d especially like to thank Leominster City Councilor Rick Marchand, who has organized the event for the last 20 years. Johnny Appleseed is a treasured national figure that we in Central Massachusetts are proud to share. I commend the Johnny Appleseed Festival on its 25th anniversary and am proud of all they do to make this such a beloved annual event.

Warden Kozicki has been steadfast in her work to protect California’s wildlife over the past 29 years. She led an investigation of the illegal development practices, which threat-ened two endangered species. Warden Kozicki lent her expertise by testifying during the trial and the developers were fined $1 mil-lion for destroying endangered species habitat, among other violations. Her tireless efforts have resulted in the preservation of hundreds of acres of land and millions of dollars in fines. Warden Kozicki also collaborated with the Fish and Wildlife Committee to secure over $1 mil-lion from the Annual Contra Costa County Fish and Wildlife Propagation Grant to for community projects that benefit fish and wild-life in our community. Warden Kozicki has been recognized for her incredible work on multiple occasions. In 2017, she received both the California Department of Fish and Wildlife Officer of the Year Award and the Pogue-Elms Wildlife Law Enforcement Officer of the Year, the latter being the highest honor given by the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies. Warden Kozicki was named the Officer of the Year by Safari Club International in 2016. Mr. Speaker, Nicole Kozicki has dedicated her career to preserving and protecting Cali-fornia’s precious fish and wildlife. Therefore, it is fitting and proper that we honor her here today. f 
HONORING DR. MICHAEL A. BASTON 
HON. NITA M. LOWEY

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Michael A. Baston on his inaugura-tion as Seventh President of Rockland Com-munity College (RCC) in Suffern, N.Y. on Sep-tember 13, 2018. Dr. Baston began his career as a public in-terest lawyer, representing educational and social justice organizations and this work led him to pursue a career in academia. He joined RCC from LaGuardia Community College in Queens, part of the City University of New York, where he held several key leadership positions, including Vice President for Student Affairs and Associate Provost. Known for his work in integrating student success initiatives to advance college completion through guided pathways, Dr. Baston also helped grow LaGuardia’s grant funding with a special focus on diverse and underserved student popu-lations. During his distinguished career, Dr. Baston’s work has been featured in the Chronicle of Higher Education, Atlantic, Diverse Education, Community College Times, Education Advi-sory Board, MSNBC, and Handbook for Stu-dent Affairs in Community Colleges. Dr. Baston was selected as a member of the inau-gural class of Aspen Institute Presidential Fel-lows for Community College Excellence where he explored systemic issues impacting the educational access pipeline and student suc-cess. He holds a BA from Iona College, a JD from Brooklyn Law School, and an EdD from St. John Fisher College. Named by Diverse Issues in Higher Education magazine among the most Notable Education Leaders of 2017, Dr. Baston is an extraordinary man whose dedication and determination have inspired all who know him. Mr. Speaker, Dr. Baston’s numerous accom-plishments have left a lasting impact on the communities he has served and he has pledged to broaden the scope, reach and in-fluence of RCC in the years ahead.

SUPPORTING THE REAL ID ACT MODIFICATION FOR FREELY AS-SOCIATED STATES HON. AUMUA AMATA COLEMAN RADEWAGEN 
OF AMERICAN SAMOA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for the REAL ID Act Modification for Freely Associ-ated States Act (H.R. 3998). When Congress passed the REAL ID Act in 2005, no reference was made to the Freely Associated States (FAS) of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau— trusted U.S. allies and friends. Instead, in a true technical glitch, the law defined ‘‘State’’ to include the ‘‘Trust Territories of the Pacific Is-lands,’’ a legal entity that has once included the FAS but has not existed since 1994. This anachronistic reference to the Trust Territories of the Pacific clearly demonstrates congres-sional intent to include FAS citizens in the law. As a consequence of the law’s wording, FAS citizens today are denied anything more than a temporary ID or driver’s license valid only for one year. This makes it extraordinarily difficult for them to maintain employment and otherwise contribute meaningfully to society. This problem must be resolved and our House Dean, Congressman D
ONYOUNG of Alaska and my good friend Congresswoman T
ULSI GABBARD of Hawaii have devised the right Bi-Partisan solution in crafting H.R. 3998. The Republic of the Marshall Islands, Palau and the Federated States of Micronesia are some of the U.S.’s closest allies and great friends and neighbors in the Pacific to Amer-ican Samoa. They vote with us consistently and reliably at the United Nations. They send their sons and daughters to fight with us, side by side, in the United States Armed Forces. The RMI in particular, which was once my home, is also home to The Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Test Site on Kwajalein Atoll, which I recently visited on a CODEL, and all three nations play a key critical role in U.S. national defense and strategy in a threatening part of the world, close to North Korea and China. Congress needs to make this technical cor-rection and enable those from the Freely As-sociated States to fully contribute to the Amer-ican communities in which they live. I urge my colleagues to please vote yes on final pas-sage of H.R. 3998.

grown from its original 160 members and today represents more than 7,400 industry professionals. The Country Music Association preserves the industry’s rich heritage and time-honored traditions. This organization’s tireless advocacy has brought the appreciation for and the excellence of country music to new heights. Country Music is the story of America, and the Country Music Association shares this story around the world. The Country Music As-sociation celebrates life by connecting those near and far and making global connections through the gift of music. Country music cre-ates a place for everyone by evoking celebra-tion and pain, joy and sorrow, love and loss. The country music industry is as charitable as it is talented. The Country Music Associa-tion Foundation, the organization’s charitable group, has invested more than $21 million in improving and sustaining music education pro-grams across the nation. Thanks to these ef-forts, students from everywhere are gaining skills and knowledge to help them succeed in all facets of their lives. The power of country music is boundless, and the Country Music Association ensures that its genius is reaching every corner of this world and will continue to do so for genera-tions to come. I am honored to represent the home of the Country Music Association in Nashville, Ten-nessee, and am proud to recognize its 60th anniversary.

RECOGNIZING BENJAMIN BRUNSVOLD, ANDREW DROBECK, AND BLAKE MEYERS 
HON. GREG GIANFORTE 
OF MONTANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, during National Blood Cancer Awareness Month, to honor firefighters Benjamin Brunsvold, Andrew Drobeck, and Blake Mey-ers who helped the Missoula Fire Department team finish first in the Scott Firefighter Stairclimb. The 2018 Scott Firefighter Stairclimb brought together 2,000 firefighters from over 330 fire departments to compete. The stairclimb, which raised a record $2.61 million in 2018, benefits the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (LLS) and its efforts in the fight against different types of blood cancer. The Scott Firefighter Stairclimb is the world’s largest on-air stair climb competition. Held at the Columbia Center in Seattle, the competition features firefighters in full gear climbing 69 flights of stairs, or 788 feet. I congratulate Brunsvold, Drobeck, and Meyers who were the three top finishers for the Missoula Fire Department, helping it claim top team honors for the seventh consecutive year. Brunsvold finished third in the individual competition; Drobeck, a six-time individual winner, placed fourth; and Meyers finished 26th. I also commend the 77 Montana firefighters from 26 departments who took part in the 2018 challenge. With the support of their com-munities, they raised more than $97,500. Since 2009, Montana firefighters have raised more than $800,000 for LLS. While I congratulate Montana’s outstanding firefighters for their performance, the Scott Firefighter Stairclimb is about raising aware-ness about blood cancer and raising needed resources for research and patient services. Josh Charles, a Bozeman firefighter and a Montana Ambassador for the Scott Firefighter Stairclimb, says, ‘‘It’s rewarding to know that fire departments across Montana have em-braced the Scott Stairclimb, honoring the cause and the people affected by cancer who fight every day for normalcy. There’s nothing better than when a patient or survivor says, ‘Thanks for helping me fight leukemia.’ ’’ Mr. Speaker, for their excellence in training and performance, service in protecting our communities, and dedication that exceeds the call of duty, I recognize Benjamin Brunsvold, Andrew Drobeck, and Blake Meyers for their spirit of Montana. f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF RETIRED THIRD JUDICIAL DISTRICT CIR-CUIT COURT JUDGE HENRY LACKEY 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of retired Third Judicial District Circuit Court Judge Henry Lackey. Judge Lackey passed away on August 17, 2018, at Baptist Memorial Hospital in Calhoun City, Mississippi. Judge Lackey distinguished himself in every facet of his life, devoting him-self to family, the community, and to all those who placed their faith in him. According to an obituary published in the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal, Judge Lackey was raised in Calhoun City. In 1952, he graduated from Calhoun City High School. Judge Lackey earned a Bachelor of Science degree in business administration at Mis-sissippi College in 1956. Upon graduation, he operated the family business following his fa-ther’s death. He also answered the call to serve in the U.S. Army when his National Guard unit was activated from 1961 until 1962. In 1966, Judge Lackey embarked on a ca-reer that would become his path in life—public service. Following graduation from the Univer-sity of Mississippi School of law, Judge Lack-ey was elected to serve as the Calhoun Coun-ty Prosecuting Attorney. After serving a four- year term, Judge Lackey was appointed to serve as Mississippi’s first public defender. In addition to operating a private law practice, Judge Lackey also served as the board attor-ney for the Calhoun County Supervisors. In 1993, former Mississippi Governor Kirk Fordice appointed Judge Lackey to the Third Circuit Court District, serving Lafayette, Mar-shall, Tippah, Benton, Chickasaw, Union, and Calhoun Counties. Judge Lackey remained in office for four consecutive terms. Following his final term as a circuit court judge, he served as a senior status judge for seven years. Judge Lackey earned the trust of his col-leagues during his long and distinguished ca-reer, serving in numerous leadership roles. According to the Associated Press, Judge Lackey was a former president of the Calhoun County Bar Association and the Third Circuit Bar Association. He was a fellow of the Mis-sissippi Bar Foundation. In 2008, he was se-lected to receive the Supreme Court’s Chief Justice Award. In 2009, Judge Lackey was named Mississippi College’s Alumnus of the Year. He previously served as a member of the Mississippi College Board of Trustees. Mississippi Supreme Court Justice Bill Waller, Jr. praised Judge Lackey for his unwill-ingness to be swayed by a bribe in an article published by The Oxford Eagle. ‘‘He was one of the most outstanding jurists in the history of the state,’’ Justice Waller said. ‘‘His coura-geous acts in the bribery investigation were done without regard to his health and safety, for the preservation of the integrity of the judi-ciary. He is one of my heroes.’’ I will forever admire Judge Lackey’s honesty and integrity, qualities that made him the out-standing public servant that he was. He was a man who made a true and lasting impact on the field of law and more importantly, on the lives of so many of his fellow citizens. Judge Lackey is survived by his devoted wife of 60 years, Helen Rose James Lackey; and one son, Kevin Lackey. f 
SPECIAL ENVOY TO MONITOR AND COMBAT ANTI-SEMITISM ACT OF 2018 
SPEECH OF  
HON. STENY H. HOYER 
OF MARYLAND  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, September 12, 2018 Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I want to add my voice to those of my colleagues who have ex-pressed strong support for this bill, H.R. 1911. It is imperative that the United States leads in the effort to stamp out anti-Semitism both at home and around the world. That’s why we need an ambassadorial-level special envoy to monitor and combat anti-Semitism. In recent years, we’ve witnessed a dis-turbing rise in attacks against Jews and Jew-ish communities all around the world. Ameri-cans were deeply shaken last year by the viru-lent anti-Semitism on display in our own coun-try during the white-supremacist rally in Char-lottesville, Virginia. I continue to be alarmed by attacks on Israel and its policies that employ rhetoric historically associated with anti-Semi-tism and that repeat old patterns of singling out the Jewish State in ways that mimic an-cient biases. There must be no place for such rhetoric or activities in our country or any-where that calls itself a free and democratic society. I commend Ranking Member E
NGEL of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, along with Reps. L
OWEY , S CHNEIDER , D EUTCH , and V
EASEY , for their hard work with the bill’s Re-publican cosponsors to ensure bipartisan pas-sage of this legislation. I hope it will send a strong message throughout the world that the United States will never waver in its effort to end the scourge of anti-Semitism and defend our ally Israel.

IN RECOGNITION OF LIEUTENANT COMMANDER RYAN CHAMBERLAIN 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Lieutenant Com-mander Ryan Chamberlain on his separation from the United States Navy after 12 years of faithful service to our country. An esteemed and respected member of the U.S. Navy, Lieu-tenant Commander Chamberlain most recently served as a Liaison in the Navy’s U.S. House of Representatives Liaison Office. In this ca-pacity, he oversaw and led many Congres-sional and staff delegations to naval installa-tions throughout the United States and around the world. These trips helped members and their staffs achieve a greater understanding of the issues facing our Navy and its Sailors. LCDR Chamberlain attended Southern Illi-nois University where he earned a bachelor’s degree in Aviation Management and was com-missioned as an Ensign in the U.S. Navy in 2006. He would later go on to earn his ‘‘wings of gold’’ and qualify as a Naval Aviator in 2008. LCDR Chamberlain deployed on both the USS Nimitz and USS John C. Stennis in support of operations Enduring and Iraqi Free-dom. He has accumulated more than 1,400 flight hours and 300 carrier arrested landings in the F/A–18E Super Hornet. Prior to joining us here on the Hill, LCDR Chamberlain served as a Blue Angel from 2012 to 2016. An esti-mated 11 million spectators view the Navy’s Flight Demonstration squadron during air shows each year. Additionally, the Blue An-gels visit more than 50,000 people per show season at schools and hospitals across the country. LCDR Chamberlain’s awards and decora-tions include the Meritorious Service Medal, Air Medal—Strike Flight (two awards), Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal (two awards), and other personal, campaign, and service ribbons. As LCDR Chamberlain embarks on a new chapter in life, it is my hope that he may re-call, with a deep sense of pride and accom-plishment, the outstanding contributions he has made to the United States Navy. I would like to send him my best wishes for continued success in his future endeavors.

RECOGNIZING LEGENDARY CIVIL WAR HISTORIAN EDWIN ‘‘ED’’ BEARSS 
HON. ROBERT A. BRADY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize legendary Civil War historian Edwin ‘‘Ed’’ Bearss. Mr. Bearss will be hon-ored next month by the General Meade Soci-ety of Philadelphia for his contributions to Civil War history. Ed’s interest in the Civil War began at an early age. As a young man in Billings, Mon-tana, Ed grew up listening to the stories of Civil War veterans in his home town. Fol-lowing in their footsteps, he enlisted in the Ma-rine Corps in 1942 . He would participate in the Guadalcanal and Russell Islands cam-paigns before suffering a near-fatal wound in the Battle of Cape Gloucester. After a two year long recovery process, Ed left Montana to pursue higher education. He received his bachelor’s from Georgetown University before earning a master’s degree in history from Indi-ana University. After several years working for the United States Hydrographic Office, a visit to the Shi-loh Battlefield inspired Ed to make a career change. Beginning in 1955 as a park historian at the Vicksburg National Military Park, he quickly gained a reputation as an engaging and theatrical battlefield guide. His research led to the 1956 discovery of the USS Cairo, a Union ironclad gunboat sunk during the Yazoo Pass Expedition. Ed would later be elevated to Chief Historian of the National Park Service, a position he would hold from 1981 to 1995. Fol-lowing his retirement, Ed received the title of Chief Historian Emeritus. The General Meade Society of Philadelphia is only the latest organization to recognize Ed for his work. His honors include the Harry S. Truman Award for Meritorious Service in the field of Civil War History, the Department of the Interior’s Distinguished Service Award, and the American Battlefield Trust’s Lifetime Achievement Award. Most impressively, de-spite turning 95 in June, Ed continues to lead battlefield tours to this day. Mr. Speaker, I ask that all of my colleagues join me in honoring Ed Bearss on receiving this important honor. f 
REMEMBERING THE DESEGREGA-TION OF STRATFORD HIGH SCHOOL IN NASHVILLE, TEN-NESSEE 
HON. JIM COOPER 
OF TENNESSEE  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mr. COOPER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Stratford High School and the Nashville community on the55th anniversary of the school’s desegregation. On that remark-able day, four twelve-year-old girls coura-geously walked into Stratford High School pre-pared to change history and open the doors of opportunity for all. The lessons of Nashville’s involvement in the Civil Rights Movement are still teaching us how to build a more perfect union. In a 1960 speech in Nashville, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said, ‘‘I came to Nashville not to bring inspira-tion, but to gain inspiration from the great movement that has taken place in this com-munity.’’ Equal access to quality education, like that provided at Stratford, is vital to grow-ing leaders who will inspire generations to come. In 1963, just a few days after Dr. King was murdered, Bernadine Price Rabathaly, Beverly Page Ward, Brenda Harris Haywood, and Pamela Franklin walked into school and were greeted with hate. With the help, encourage-ment, and protection of the school’s Assistant Principal, Ronald Webb, the students over-came obstacles that no students should face and helped change our nation forever. As we reflect on the past, let us remember and thank these heroic individuals for their re-lentless efforts in making our community a stronger place, and realize we still have a lot of work to do. f 
RECOGNIZING MRS. JUNE LUCILLE DOWELL ROUSEY 
HON. JAMES COMER 
OF KENTUCKY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recog-nize Mrs. June Lucille Dowell Rousey who is celebrating her 90th birthday today. A resident of Casey County in the First District of Ken-tucky, she grew up in a household where ev-eryone was welcome around the table and where compassion and love of family were treasured values. Mrs. Rousey spent her child-hood working in the family store where she learned the value of hard work and serving others. In March of 1947 she married Mr. Robert Rousey, a member of the U.S. Navy who would later become President of the Casey County Bank. Together they had three chil-dren—Barbara, Connie, and Barry—who brought them many joyous occasions and a lively extended family. She spent her time teaching Sunday School, serving as a 4–H leader, and a devoted homemaker and mother who viewed her home as a gathering place for all those who needed a loving presence. Mrs. Rousey also began to manage her parents’ store—then Dowell’s Furniture—which still op-erates in downtown Liberty under the super-vision of her youngest son, Barry. Throughout her marriage to Robert she was a devoted and loving wife who steadfastly cared for her husband throughout his bouts of illnesses be-fore his passing. Mrs. Rousey always enjoyed vacationing and being outdoors with her fam-ily, leading her and Robert to build a cabin at the old Rousey homeplace in Butchertown. Together they forged trails, collected and planted wildflowers, and created a family re-treat which they shared with school groups, their church, and their fellow community mem-bers. This location continues to be a haven for gatherings and events where their loving leg-acy lives on. Mrs. Rousey stays active as a member of the Casey County Explorers Hiking Group and continues to travel internationally and domesti-cally with tour groups. At the age of 80, she even rode in a hot air balloon. She is an ac-tive member of the First Christian Church, maintains her garden, continues to investigate health issues and keeps up with current events. She enjoys attending family events and stays busy with the many weddings, grad-uations, plays, and birthdays of her grand-children and great-grandchildren. Mrs. Rousey is a treasured member of the local community and I join with her family and friends to celebrate this milestone birthday. I hope the upcoming year is filled with family, friends, and many blessings for her.

HONORING CATHEDRAL HIGH SCHOOL’S CENTENNIAL ANNI-VERSARY 
HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Cathedral High School in celebration of its 100th anniversary. The people of Indiana’s 5th Congressional District are forever grateful for Cathedral High School’s commitment to preparing all students to be successful, competent, concerned, re-sponsible, and ethical members of society. It is a pleasure to congratulate Cathedral High School in Indianapolis, Indiana in celebration of this special occasion. Cathedral has been an integral part of the Indianapolis community since its founding by the Indianapolis Catholic Diocese on Sep-tember 13, 1918. Founded as an all boys Catholic high school, Cathedral has seen tre-mendous growth, from 90 students in 1918 to nearly 1,200 today. Originally on the second floor of Cathedral Grade School at 13th and Pennsylvania, the school moved in 1927 to 14th and Meridian, where it stayed for 50 years. Today the school operates under the direction of the Cathedral Trustees, Inc. as an independent private institution located at 56th Street and Emerson Way. In 1988, girls were integrated into the student body for the first time. Today, Cathedral is a premier Catholic high school in the Holy Cross tradition. The school draws students from Marion County and nine other central Indiana counties. Before attend-ing Cathedral, students attended approxi-mately 130 different schools. According to its mission, Cathedral ‘‘transforms a diverse group of students spiritually, intellectually, so-cially, emotionally, and physically to have the competence to see and the courage to act.’’ This mission is carried out both in and out of the classroom by students, parents, teachers, administrators, and coaches through various academic programs and over 120 co-curricular activities. The Fighting Irish have a long his-tory of excellence earning over 60 state cham-pionships across all their sports teams. With a 13:1 student-teacher ratio, Cathedral has a highly personalized, faith-based approach to learning. This approach has resulted in 100 percent of graduating seniors being accepted into colleges and universities across the coun-try. Cathedral’s commitment to its students and their success was recognized by the U.S. Department of Education in 1988, 2004 and again in 2016, when Cathedral earned the dis-tinction as a ‘‘Blue Ribbon School of Excel-lence.’’ The school’s personalized approach to edu-cation has made Cathedral home to a robust alumni network, with previous graduates num-bering among some of the most accomplished business, community, government, and reli-gious leaders in the state and country. These graduates strive to distinguish themselves as scholars, servant leaders and role models who are culturally competent, engaged in the glob-al society, sound in mind and body and spir-itually active. It is important to our nation’s future to en-courage and raise a new generation of Ameri-cans who have the skills, knowledge, and compassion to succeed both in and out of the classroom. Students like those at Cathedral give me hope that we will accomplish this vital mission. Their outstanding work is an inspira-tion to students, educators and parents across the nation. Congratulations on 100 years of excellence in the academic and religious edu-cation of Indiana high school students.

CELEBRATING CONGRESSMAN JACK EDWARDS ON HIS 90TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. BRADLEY BYRNE 
OF ALABAMA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate my friend and predecessor, Congressman Jack Edwards. Congressman Edwards proudly and ably served Alabama’s First Congres-sional District in the United States House of Representatives from 1965 to 1985. Congressman Edwards has served our country and Southwest Alabama in numerous ways over the course of his life, starting in our nation’s military. After graduating from high school, Congressman Edwards enlisted in the Marine Corps and served during the Korean War. After graduating college and law school and a short time teaching at the University of Ala-bama, he moved his family to the Mobile area in 1954 and opened his own law firm. Con-gressman Edwards quickly became an active member of the Mobile community. He served as general counsel for the Gulf, Mobile, and Ohio Railroad and was active on the Mobile City Planning Commission. He was elected to Congress in 1964 as a Republican. In Congress, he established him-self as a very effective legislator, forming in-valuable relationships with many of his col-leagues thanks to his kind and friendly person-ality. Many of those relationships continue to this day. One of his most notable accomplishments in Congress was his steadfast support for our nation’s military. He used his position on the Appropriations Committee to advocate for the rebuilding and strengthening of the U.S. mili-tary. He also made transportation a top pri-ority, and he played a key role in advancing the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway project and other projects that benefited Southwest Alabama and our state as a whole. As a sign of his success and popularity as our Congressman, Jack Edwards was re-elect-ed nine times, and he never faced any serious opposition. He established a proud tradition of having strong constituent services in his Con-gressional office, and helped countless resi-dents navigate the federal bureaucracy. After leaving Congress, Congressman Edwards returned to Mobile and held various roles in the local community, including his work as Chairman of the Mobile Area Cham-ber of Commerce and on the Mayor’s Water-front Advisory Committee. He deserves much of the credit for helping rebuild and revitalize Mobile, and it was his efforts that paved the way for the economic success we are experi-encing today. He also served on the Board of Trustees for the University of Alabama System from 1988 to 1999. He eventually held the position of President Pro Tempore of the board before his retirement. Jack Edwards has long-served as a mentor to me, and I value our friendship. He was the one who first sparked my interest in public service and encouraged me to get involved in improving public education in Mobile County. As Congressman, I still am fortunate to benefit from his advice and guidance. My wife, Re-becca, and I consider him and his wife, Jolane, as dear friends. On behalf of Alabama’s First Congressional District and the United States House of Rep-resentatives, I want to wish Congressman Edwards a very happy birthday. I look forward to celebrating many more in the years ahead. f 
UNITED STATES-ISRAEL SECURITY ASSISTANCE AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2018 
SPEECH OF  
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, September 12, 2018 Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 2497, the Ileana Ros- Lehtinen United States-Israel Security Assist-ance Authorization Act of 2018, introduced by two of my fellow Floridians, the Chair and Co- Chair of the House Foreign Affairs Commit-tee’s Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa, Reps. I
LEANA ROS-LEHTINEN (R– FL) and T
EDDEUTCH (D–FL). This legislation takes a number of steps to reaffirm American commitment to Israel, one of our nation’s closest allies and partners in security. Two years ago, the House of Rep-resentatives passed H. Res. 729, affirming Israel’s status as a major strategic partner of the United Sates, reaffirming our policy of en-suring Israel Qualitative Military Edge (QME), and calling for the expeditious finalization of a new Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between our governments. A new MOU was signed soon after, providing Israel with $3.3 billion in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) grant assistance every year for the next dec-ade. While I personally hoped that this figure would reach $4 billion annually, the new MOU nevertheless reflected our commitment to Israel’s security and our numerous cooperative programs in missile defense, cyber-defense, and aerospace. The legislation we are debating today codi-fies this MOU into law, ensuring that it is the policy of the United States to provide assist-ance to the Government of Israel in order to support funding for cooperative programs to develop, produce, and procure missile and other defense capabilities to help Israel meet its security needs, and to help develop and enhance the defense capabilities of the United States. This legislation expands Israel’s ac-cess to precision guided munitions for self-de-fense in the event of a sustained armed con-frontation with armed groups such as Hezbollah or the terrorist organization Hamas. S. 2497 extends stockpile authority for war re-serves in Israel, extends American loan guar-antees, modifies the procedures for rapid ac-quisition and deployment of defense supplies, and takes important steps to improve upon Israel’s QME, including new assessments of Israel’s ability to effectively defend itself

against military threats from regional non-state actors, risks posed by the unauthorized trans-fer or proliferation of equipment for use against Israel, and risks posed by unmanned vehicles and systems through air, land or water, and cyber and other asymmetric enti-ties. This bill goes even further, enhancing co-operation between our countries by estab-lishing new partnerships for cybersecurity re-search and development and commercializa-tion of cybersecurity technology and ensuring the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) continues to work with the Israel Space Agency to identify and cooperatively pursue peaceful space ex-ploration and science initiatives in areas of mutual interest. Finally, this bill grants the Ad-ministrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) authority to enter into a MOU with Israel in order to ad-vance common goals on energy, agriculture and food security, democracy, human rights and governance, economic growth and trade, education, environment, global health and water sanitation, with a focus on strengthening mutual ties and cooperation with nations throughout the world. For more than half a century, the United States and Israel have shared the common bond of democracy. This bond remains as strong today as it was when President Harry Truman first recognized the creation of a Jew-ish State in 1948, and we must continue to strengthen it whenever possible, including en-gaging the region and commit to finding a fair solution that enables both Israel and her neighbors to live in security and prosperity. I urge support for this legislation.

RECOGNIZING THE TRANSIENT RE-ACTOR TEST FACILITY RESTART 
HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON 
OF IDAHO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I along with my colleagues Senator M
IKECRAPO and J AMES  R
ISCH, I rise today to call attention to an im-portant event taking place today at the U.S. Department of Energy’s, DOE, 890-square mile site in Idaho. Today, Idaho National Lab-oratory, INL, personnel ran the first experi-ments in the Transient Reactor Test, TREAT, facility in nearly a quarter century. Idaho National Laboratory is our nation’s lead nuclear energy research, development and demonstration laboratory, the place where 52 original nuclear reactors were constructed and demonstrated. One of those reactors was the TREAT facility, which operated from 1959 to 1994, and remained fully fueled while on standby status. Transient testing focuses upon testing nuclear fuel under accident conditions. TREAT is one of the most capable and flexible transient test reactors in the world. Following the accident at the Fukushima- Daiichi Power Plant in Japan seven years ago, Congress directed the DOE to develop reactor fuels that could better withstand accident con-ditions. During TREAT’s 35 operating years, the reactor performed 6,604 reactor startups and 2,884 transient irradiations. Given this his-tory, it made more sense to restart the facility than build a new reactor. That decision paid off when, on Aug. 31, 2017, the Resumption of Transient Testing Program was completed more than one year ahead of schedule and approximately $17 million under budget. This highly successful restart at the TREAT facility was recognized in August, when a joint DOE–INL team won the Secretary of Energy Award. This award recognizes DOE employ-ees or contractors who accomplish significant achievements. It is the highest non-monetary internal recognition that can be achieved at the DOE. U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry highlighted the TREAT restart team’s effort and efficiency, and recognized the importance of the facility to nuclear energy scientists and engineers as they work to develop advanced nuclear fuels and reactor technologies. Congratulations, INL and DOE, on the TREAT restart and for bringing back online an important national asset in the effort to de-velop the advanced nuclear reactors so vital to our economy, environment and national secu-rity. f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF RETIRED UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS GUNNERY SERGEANT (GYSGT) WILLIAM VERNON ‘‘BUSTER’’ PORTER, JR. 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of retired United States Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant (GySgt) Wil-liam Vernon ‘‘Buster’’ Porter, Jr., who passed away on September 3, 2018. Mr. Porter was devoted to the service of our nation and equally devoted to his family and friends. Mr. Porter was born in Corinth, Mississippi, on November 13, 1949, to William and Jessie Porter. He graduated from Easom High School in 1968 and joined the United States Marine Corps with four of his closest friends. Nebra Porter, Mr. Porter’s devoted wife of 36 years, recently said that her husband served in the Vietnam War from December 1968 until Janu-ary 1970. Injuries he sustained while helping his fellow Marines earned him the Purple Heart. In addition to his combat duty, he served in a number of roles during his military service, including drill instructor, recruiter, and a AV–8B Harrier technician. In 1982, Mr. Porter was serving as a U.S. Marine Corps recruiter in Toledo, Ohio, when he met his future wife. Mrs. Porter said that she entered the recruiting station to enlist in the U.S. Navy. ‘‘I planned to serve in the U.S. Navy,’’ Mrs. Porter said. ‘‘I accidentally ran into William in the hallway and we began talk-ing. Being the consummate recruiter, he want-ed me to join the U.S. Marine Corps. We eventually decided to get married instead!’’ Mrs. Porter said her husband became her soulmate. ‘‘He was my best friend and we thought alike. William was a good person and everyone he met was positively impacted by him. He never met a stranger. The neighbor-hood kids would ask if he could come out to play and he would gladly and enthusiastically share his knowledge and skills. Whatever he decided to do, he did and did well. William was also civically active in every community he lived. He was also an active and lifelong member of the American Legion,’’ said Mrs. Porter. According to Mr. Porter’s obituary published in the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal, he was described by friends and family as a jack of all trades and master of all. He was an en-trepreneur who pursued photography, real es-tate, and automobile sales. Mr. Porter also served as a Yuma County Deputy Sheriff in Arizona. It was during that time that Mrs. Por-ter served as a defense attorney while her husband was a jailor. ‘‘Eventually, people fig-ured out we were married,’’ Mr. Porter said. ‘‘Inmates would say my husband puts them in jail and I get them out.’’ In 2000, Mr. and Mrs. Porter moved to Mis-sissippi. They lived in Corinth, West Point, and Tupelo. During those years, they enjoyed spending time with their children and grand-children in a loving and fun atmosphere. Mr. Porter was known to be mischievous and en-joyed playing tricks on friends and family. Dewayne Porter, Mr. Porter’s nephew, said everyone loved his sense of humor. Dewayne most admired Mr. Porter for his military serv-ice. ‘‘I joined the military because of him,’’ Dewayne said. ‘‘He offered me advice and en-couraged me to enlist. It was the best thing that I ever did.’’ Frederick Porter, Mr. and Mrs. Porter’s youngest child, said his father was always there for him. ‘‘He was a great man,’’ Fred-erick said. ‘‘He was always there for me. He was a great father. He was also a wonderful grandfather to all of his grandchildren. He made everyone feel special. Even those who met him for the first time walked away with a great impression of this kind and thoughtful man.’’ Family and friends gathered for Mr. Porter’s memorial service at the Grayson-Porter’s Mor-tuary on Thursday, September 6, 2018. During the service, Frederick read aloud a poem he wrote titled, ‘‘Chose To.’’ 
He didn’t have to raise me, but he chose to. He didn’t have to give me life, but he chose to show me how to live. He could’ve treated me like a stepson, but chose to treat me like his own son. He didn’t have to teach me anything, but he chose to be my greatest teacher. He didn’t have to love me, but he chose to show me how to love. He didn’t have to be my father, but he chose to be the greatest father in the world. I’ll never forget this decision he decided to make, for he made me into the man I am today. Because of that, I chose to love you with all my heart and soul. I chose to live my life in the path he has guided me. Thank you, God, for choosing this man to be my father. I love you, Dad.

PARITY FOR U.S. TERRITORIES UNDER THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT 
HON. MADELEINE Z. BORDALLO 
OF GUAM  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, the Violence Against Women Act, signed by President Clin-ton 24 years ago today, is a landmark federal law that provides critical support to women and children who face domestic violence and assault nationwide. However, Congress must do more to protect victims and survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence, especially in the territories. The Sexual Assault Services Formula Grant Program, authorized under VAWA, provides funding to support rape crisis centers and as-sist individuals who have been sexually as-saulted. While each State, Puerto Rico, and the Dis-trict of Columbia receive 1.5 percent of total funding under current law, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands receive just 0.25 percent each. This disparity is unacceptable, especially considering Guam has one of the highest rates of rape per capita in the United States. That is why today, I am introducing legisla-tion to double the minimum amount of Sexual Assault Services Formula Grant Program funding made available to the territories under VAWA. My bill builds upon the work of my col-league, Congressman S
ABLAN (D–MP), who introduced similar legislation (H.R. 840) during the 113th Congress. This additional funding will provide critical federal resources for community programs that provide direct intervention services in cases of rape, sexual assault, domestic violence, and abuse. As Congress looks to reauthorize the Vio-lence Against Women Act, I urge my col-leagues to include my bill to provide greater parity for American Samoa, Guam, the North-ern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Is-lands. We must strengthen current laws to ensure that all women across the United States feel safe and secure, including women and chil-dren of the territories. I stand ready to support that effort in any way that I can.

SPECIAL ENVOY TO MONITOR AND COMBAT ANTI-SEMITISM ACT OF 2018 
SPEECH OF  
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, September 12, 2018 Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1911, the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism Act of 2018. This important legislation would elevate the position of Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism to the rank of Ambas-sador, reporting directly to the Secretary of State; as the primary advisor and coordinator for U.S. government efforts to monitor and combat Anti-Semitism and Anti-Semitic incite-ment in foreign countries. Many notable groups support this initiative, including the American Jewish Committee, the Anti-Defama-tion League, and The Jewish Federations of North America, and I am proud to stand with them to ensure that the United States con-tinues to play a leading role in combatting Anti-Semitism across the globe. Those of us who have served on the U.S. Helsinki Commission have taken efforts to combat anti-Semitism at the international level. As Ranking Democratic Member of the United States Helsinki Commission, I have long worked with representatives of governments throughout Europe to highlight the resurgence of Anti-Semitism and elevate efforts to push back against this despicable resurgence through education, outreach, and improved se-curity. Mr. S
MITH, Mr. H OYER , Senator C ARDIN  and I have all chaired the Helsinki Commis-sion, and together, we have worked with sev-eral other Members of both the House and Senate, as well as with parliamentarians par-ticularly from Germany and Canada, to have the Parliamentary Assembly of the 57-country OSCE condemn the escalation of anti-Semitic violence in Europe. We first did this at the Assembly’s 2002 an-nual session in Berlin, Germany, and have kept it on the agenda there ever since, sug-gesting measures to counter anti-Semitic statements and acts of violence alike. I pushed it strongly while serving as President of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly from 2004 to 2006, and then as chairman of the Commission from 2007 to 2008. We suc-ceeded in getting OSCE institutions, officials and diplomatic representatives to incorporate efforts to combat anti-Semitism and other forms of intolerance into their ongoing work. I know Mr. Smith continues to raise the issue in the Assembly as the current co-chair of the Helsinki Commission, and Senator C
ARDIN  serves as the Assembly’s Special Representa-tive on Anti-Semitism, Racism and Intolerance. Ensuring that our country continues to lead in the fight against Anti-Semitism is a priority that we should all embrace. I fully support this measure and urge my colleagues to do the same. f 
HONORING MR. GEORGE WAYNE DANIEL, SR. 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to honor the life of a dear friend, Mr. George Wayne Daniel, Sr. Mr. Daniel was born in Chicago, Illinois on November 10, 1948, but was raised in Bolton, Mississippi by his grandparents, Melvin and Fannie Moore. He attended Tougaloo College earning a bachelor’s degree in political science and a master’s degree in guidance and counseling from Jackson State University. He served as an academic counselor for over twenty years at Jackson State before tak-ing on the roles of Police Chief of the Bolton Police Department and City Manager. I had the pleasure of knowing Mr. Daniel for many years. We were childhood friends, high school and college classmates, and neighbors. From Hinds AHS, Tougaloo College, and Jackson State University, we have been with each other every step of the way. He was truly a dear friend who left an everlasting impres-sion on my life. Mr. Daniel passed on Sep-tember 10, 2018, at the University of Mis-sissippi Medical Center. He is survived by his son, George Wayne Daniel, Jr., his grandson, George Austin Dan-iel, and his sister, Diane Daniel. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the life and memory of my dear friend, Mr. George Wayne Daniel, Sr.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF SHERIFF BUDDY EAST 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of one of Mis-sissippi’s most devoted citizen and public servants, Sheriff Buddy East. Sheriff East, a native of Lafayette County Mississippi, passed away on Saturday, September 8, 2018. Sheriff East was the longest serving county sheriff in Mississippi history. He faithfully served as Lafayette County Sheriff for 46 years. Under his leadership he saw the growth and development of his department and his community, striving to make it the best it could be every day. Buddy’s humble heart and will-ingness to help anyone in need touched the lives of all he encountered. Former Oktibbeha County Sheriff Dolph Bryan said, ‘‘Buddy East was such a nice easy-going man. If you needed something picked up or if you needed some help you called Buddy, and Buddy would be glad to do it for you.’’ Sheriff East’s leadership and love for his community was recognized in 1991 by being named Oxford Citizen of the Year. For some sheriffs, their leadership stops where their

county line ends but, this was not true for Sheriff East. Buddy served two terms as the president of the Mississippi Sheriff’s Associa-tion from 1989 to 1990 and 1999 to 2000 helping lead the direction of every county in our great state. Throughout Sheriff East’s long career, he was recognized for many awards, titles, and medals. Among these awards, Buddy was most honored by receiving the Silver Star for Bravery from the American Law Enforcement Association. Most recently, in 2015, Buddy was honored by the Lafayette County Law En-forcement and Officers Association with the Medal of Valor and unselfishness in the Face of Danger. Buddy’s love for his community was sur-passed by only one thing, his love for his fam-ily. Even during his busiest times, Buddy was ever present in the life of his grandchildren at-tending all their school and sports events. Buddy was especially proud of his time as a little league baseball coach. Before passing away, Sheriff East ex-pressed his gratitude to the community of La-fayette County for allowing him to serve the people he loved. Sheriff Buddy East’s pres-ence will be missed by all. Sheriff East is survived by his wife, Mary Hall East of Oxford; five children, Melissa Westbrook and her husband, Billy, Joey East and his wife, Kimberly, Shannon Lomax and her husband, Max, Steve Lewis and his wife, Melanie, all of Oxford and Scott Lewis and his wife, Brandi of Dallas, TX; a sister, Nona Tutor of Oxford and thirteen grandchildren.

HONOR FLIGHT OF SOUTHERN OREGON 
HON. GREG WALDEN 
OF OREGON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recog-nize the eight World War II veterans and sev-enteen Korean War veterans from Oregon who are visiting their memorials on the Na-tional Mall on Saturday, September 15th, 2018, through Honor Flight of Southern Or-egon. Every time I have the chance to meet one of these heroes, I am reminded of the poignant words of General Dwight D. Eisen-hower. In a message to Allied troops just be-fore D-Day, he said, ‘‘The eyes of the world are upon you. The hopes and prayers of lib-erty-loving people everywhere march with you.’’ He was right then, of course, Mr. Speaker. But over seventy years later, liberty-loving people everywhere continue to owe these he-roes for their extraordinary service and their incredible stories of sacrifice and bravery on behalf of our country. That’s why it is my privi-lege to include their names in the CONGRES -
SIONAL RECORD today. The veterans on this Honor Flight from Or-egon are as follows: Robert Ashmead, Navy; AI Axtell, Army Air Force; Joseph Bieber, Ma-rine Corps; Dean Bosche, Air Force; Kenneth Brookhart, Navy; Joseph Browell, Navy; Al Carter, Army; Jack Cox, Navy and Army Na-tional Guard; Dale Dexter, Air Force and Ma-rine Corps; Ron Duke, Army; William Evans Jr., Marine Corps; John Garbini, Army Air Force; Neil Haga, Army; Dale Heath, Navy; Charles Hewitt, Navy; Leonard Leach, Navy; Edwin McCurry, Army Air Force; Edward Parkes, Navy; Ruth Parks, Navy; Jack Rentz, Navy; William Staunton, Navy; Gerhard Tank, Navy; Dale Templeman, Navy; Fred Warren, Marine Corps; and Whitney Woodburn Jr., Navy. These twenty-five heroes join over 200,000 veterans who have been honored through the Honor Flight Network of volunteers nationwide since 2005 . I would also like to recognize the twelve guardians traveling on this trip who have also served our country: Michael Boehme, Navy; Melissa Candy, Army National Guard; Mark Collier, Navy and Coast Guard; Robert Fleischman, Navy; David Haines, Navy and Air Force; Terry Haines, Navy; Charles Hang-er, Army; Evan Hanson, Air Force; Ron Kohl, Army Air Force; Pete Pringle, Navy; Charles Sharpes, Army; and Tanya Wilson, Navy. Mr. Speaker, at the height of the Civil War in 1863, President Abraham Lincoln wrote, ‘‘Honor to the Soldier, and Sailor everywhere, who bravely bears his country’s cause.’’ Each of us in this chamber and in this nation should be humbled by the courage of these brave veterans who put themselves in harm’s way for our country and way of life. As a nation, we can never fully repay the debt of gratitude owed to them for their honor, commitment, and sacrifice in defense of the freedoms we have today. My colleagues, please join me in thanking these veterans and the volunteers of Honor Flight of Southern Oregon for their exemplary dedication and service to this great country.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF DOCTOR JOHN ALEXANDER 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Doctor John Gil-bert Alexander. Doctor Alexander, a native of Union, Mississippi, passed away on Tuesday, August 21, 2018 at the age of 90. John Gilbert Alexander graduated from Union High School in 1946. He continued his education at Millsaps College where received his Bachelor of Science Degree. In 1954, he went to Tulane University where he received his Doctor of Medicine. This was the start of Dr. Alexander’s great life of service. Shortly after graduating from Tulane, Dr. Alexander joined the United States Air Force where he was stationed at Shaw Air Force Base in South Carolina as a Captain. After completing his three years of service from 1955–1958, Dr. Alexander returned to Union where he began his long partnership with Laird Hospital/Family Medical Group. Of his 60 years of practicing medicine, one date that stands out in particular is March 1st, 1966, at Laird Hospital in Union where Dr. Alexander was helping my mother, Barbara Kelly, deliver me. Dr. Alexander not only served his patients but also served as a member of the Mis-sissippi Academy of Family Practice, Mis-sissippi Medical Association, and Southern Medical Association. He was also selected as ‘‘Physician of the Year’’ in 1997 by the Mis-sissippi Chapter of the American Family Prac-tice Association. In 2006, Dr. Alexander helped establish the J.G. Alexander Nursing Home. The nursing home, located in Union, has 60 beds and ac-cepts Medicare and Medicaid patients. In 2008, Dr. Alexander retired from his clinic du-ties but, remained active on the Laird Hospital staff as Senior Medical Advisor. His career as a doctor is not the only factor that defined him. Dr. Alexander loved his com-munity and was extremely active in it. He was a member of First Presbyterian Church of Union where he served as an Elder and a Clerk. He also served as a member of the Union Lion’ s Club, Union Chamber of Com-merce, and the Union School Board. In 2005, the Union Chamber of Commerce named Dr. Alexander as ‘‘Citizen of the Year.’’ The Union Chamber of commerce went on to present him with the ‘‘Lifetime Achievement Recipient Award’’ in 2014. Dr. Alexander’s life was on of service, grati-tude, love for his family, and community. He will be dearly missed by all he encountered. Dr. Alexander is survived by his four chil-dren Karen, David, Ross and Mike, his seven grandchildren and four great grandchildren.

TRIBUTE TO CALVIN WRIGHT 
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a constituent and long-time friend, Calvin Wright, who has dedicated his life to our nation through activism, civic en-deavors and military service. Mr. Wright is being honored on September 20th for his more than 50 years of public service to Orangeburg County, South Carolina, and the nation. As a high school student, Mr. Wright was among the hundreds of protestors in the ‘‘ Orangeburg Movement’’ who were arrested and jailed for civil disobedience. Mr. Wright continued his activism as Vice President of the State NAACP Youth Conference. His experi-ences with seasoned leaders of the Movement undergirded his activism and reinforced his commitment to social justice. Mr. Wright was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1965, just after his graduation from Wilkinson High School. He earned the rank of Sergeant in less than 10 months and was deployed to Vietnam in 1968. Mr. Wright resolutely dis-charged his duties and was awarded a Certifi-cate of Military Combat by the 18th Military Police Brigade, 93rd Military Police Company for outstanding service in Vietnam. Once back in Orangeburg, Mr. Wright chal-lenged the lack of opportunity facing his fellow African Americans, veterans, the poor, and disenfranchised. He became a foot soldier in President Lyndon Johnson’s ‘‘War on Pov-erty.’’ Mr. Wright served on the Board of Di-rectors for the Orangeburg Area Committee for Economic Progress (Orangeburg-Calhoun- Allendale-Bamberg [OCAB] Community Action Agency, Inc.)—the local Community Action Program. Mr. Wright resigned his seat in 1977 to become Deputy Director of the Agency. He became the agency’s Executive Director in 1983. Along with the block grant programs that are the core of OCAB, the agency has a long-run-ning HIV Prevention Peer Education Project, a Non-Traditional Occupational Training for Women, and an employment opportunity pro-gram for mothers receiving public assistance. Mr. Wright created the OCAB Community De-velopment Association which constructed the Ujima Village Apartments for low income el-derly and disabled residents. He also directed the construction of new Head Start Centers in Allendale, Bamberg, and Orangeburg. Mr. Wright’ s years of service have touched many lives. All his experiences as an advo-cate and soldier have enabled him to effec-tively serve his community. He has been a leader for civil rights, community service and humanitarianism and has received numerous honors and awards for these efforts. Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my colleagues to join me in recognizing this barrier-breaking public servant, and to wish him Godspeed and continued success. IN RECOGNITION OF MAYOR BOB ANDREWS HON. SUZANNE BONAMICI 
OF OREGON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Mayor Bob Andrews, who has served the City of Newberg, Oregon with dis-tinction and dedication for the past 12 years. The first time I met Mayor Andrews was shortly before I was elected to Congress. He told me he wanted to build and sustain a posi-tive working relationship; and we did just that. For the past six and a half years, I have thor-oughly enjoyed working with Mayor Andrews— a steady, forward—thinking, principled prag-matist with an unsurpassed commitment to Newberg and its residents. When Phase I of the Newberg–Dundee By-pass opened earlier this year, it culminated a decades-long progression of vision and advo-cacy to make Newberg and Dundee more liv-able communities for residents who were con-stantly stuck in gridlock and congestion. The project was painstaking at times with numer-ous setbacks, but Mayor Andrews and his dogged determination never wavered. For a decade, with steadfast devotion, Bob attended nearly every meeting and hearing—including those in Salem and the occasional trip to Washington, D.C.—to advocate for resources and support. Although a handful of people pushed this project over the finish line, Mayor Andrews is first among equals. That same level of persistence and commit-ment also characterized Mayor Andrews’ sup-port for Special Olympics Oregon, which held its Summer State Games in Newberg for six years. He worked to make sure that the city rolled out the red carpet, and he was a cham-pion for the athletes and their families. In addi-tion, Mayor Andrews served on a number of nonprofit boards and helped orchestrate a faith-based emergency preparedness plan to help the city prepare for a Cascadia earth-quake. For his achievements, the Oregon Mayors Association awarded him with the 2018 Mayors Leadership Award—the highest honor among his peers. Newberg is a better place because of the selfless service of Mayor Andrews. His com-mitment to the people of Newberg is unparal-leled, and his goals as a public official always transcended himself—qualities all leaders should aspire to. In a time of deep cynicism and political division, Bob embodies the true meaning of ‘Civil servant.’ I am honored to have worked alongside Mayor Bob Andrews and consider him both a fantastic mayor and a friend. I wish him the very best in his second retirement, and hope he enjoys some well-deserved time with his wife, children, and grandchildren.

RECOGNIZING STEVE M CCLURE 
HON. GREG WALDEN 
OF OREGON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 13, 2018 Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my good friend Steve McClure for his many years of service to Union County. Steve dedicated 28 years of his life to faithfully serving Union County, and he spent two years serving our great nation in the Vietnam War. I’d like to pay tribute to Steve’s dedication to Union County and his leadership for eastern Oregon. Steve was born in Elgin, Oregon, and grad-uated from Elgin High School in 1964. In 1968, Steve was drafted into the Army and served his country in Vietnam, where he re-ceived a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. Fol-lowing his time in Vietnam, Steve was in the service as both an active reserve and an inac-tive reserve until 1974. Throughout his life, Steve has always shown a willingness to sac-rifice for the betterment of other people. Steve moved to Florida, where he started his family. His daughter Jennifer was born in 1973, and has now decided to follow in her fa-ther’s footsteps of public service by serving as the Mayor of Weston, Oregon. His son Mi-chael was born in 1976 and is now a com-puter programmer. The family lived in Florida until 1978 when they moved back to Oregon, and Steve worked on the family farm. In 1990, Steve was appointed to the Union County Board of Commissioners, and was first elected to the role in November of that same year. He has gone on to serve six four-year terms for a total of 28 years. During that time, Steve’s commitment and loyalty to Union County and his friends across eastern Oregon has earned him the deep respect of his col-leagues. Many people, including myself, have

relied upon Steve’s thorough knowledge of for-estry and natural resource issues. In fact, Senator Bill Hansell remembers deferring to Steve on forestry issues when Hansell was a Umatilla County Commissioner, saying ‘‘if Steve was for it, that’s all we needed to know.’’ Steve has a knack for public policy and is famous for his ability to get things to move for-ward. Both skills have been assets towards helping him effectively serve Union County and the region for many years. Understanding the challenges that we face in rural Oregon and how hard it can be for us to compete with metropolitan parts of our state, Steve took ac-tion. He rallied his colleagues, and maybe even twisted a few arms, to form the Eastern Oregon Counties Association to pool the re-sources of rural counties on common issues like improving the management of our public lands. Steve has shown tenacity, strength, and true leadership. Steve has always said that ‘‘democracy means you always get your say, it doesn’t mean you always get your way.’’ Steve has always lived by those words, and has been willing to listen to anyone. Steve has always displayed dignity, integrity, and respon-siveness. Union County and Eastern Oregon were lucky to have him as a public servant. Steve now has eight grandchildren, and three great-grandkids. As he retires from pub-lic service, he plans to continue serving in the capacity of a father, grandfather, and great grandfather. I am confident that Steve will im-part his wisdom and knowledge onto future generations of his family so they may carry it forward. I ask my colleagues to join me today in rec-ognizing and thanking Steve for his many years of I leadership in Union County. I wish him and his family all the best in his retire-ment.
