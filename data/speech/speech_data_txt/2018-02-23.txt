PRAYER Reverend Alisa Lasater Wailoo, Cap-itol Hill United Methodist Church, Washington, D.C., offered the following prayer: O God, at the end of this week where we have raised up great men, cele-brating the life of George Washington and mourning the death of Billy Gra-ham, focus us now on the life and death of Jesus, example to some and Saviour to others. At the start, He was tempted in the wilderness to put himself above You. Save us, Lord, from lies about our own power. At every opportunity, Jesus found the sick, the lame, and the ones over-looked by the religious and political establishments. Send us today to those without earthly power but treasured by You. At His death, He refused to pick up a weapon, and willfully loved those who meant Him harm. God, may we do the same. And at the tomb, He rose out of the impossible, empowering a few women to share the good news. May we, too, from the highest ranking Member to the newest staffer, be authentic mes-sengers of Your love. Amen and Amen. f 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to section 4(a) of House Resolution 736, the Journal of the last day’s pro-ceedings is approved.

IN HONOR OF STAFF SERGEANT DALE BEATTY 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 23, 2018 Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Staff Sergeant Dale Beatty, a husband, a father and veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom who passed away on Monday, February 12, 2018. Staff Sergeant Beatty was a true American hero and our thoughts and prayers go out to his family as they mourn the loss of this great man. When his country needed him the most, it was Staff Sergeant Beatty who answered the call to serve our great nation. While protecting our freedom, Staff Sergeant Beatty and his fu-ture business partner, John Gallina, were se-verely wounded when a mine detonated near their Humvee in Iraq. Staff Sergeant Beatty lost both of his legs as the result of this ter-rible incident. After returning to the states and living the experiences disabled veterans face, the two veterans started Purple Heart Homes. This veteran owned and operated public char-ity provides housing opportunities to service- connected disabled veterans. The success of Purple Heart Homes earned Staff Sergeant Beatty the cover of Time Magazine, among many other accolades and commemorations. His work in the community made certain that the sacrifices of those disabled in battle were not forgotten, and it is that legacy which we celebrate today. While we may have lost this great man, his legacy will live on and we will never forget the sacrifices made by Staff Sergeant Beatty and his family. Mr. Speaker, please join me today in com-memorating the life of Staff Sergeant Dale Beatty for his service to God and country.

RECOGNIZING BOB BECKER OF SCHENECTADY 
HON. JOHN J. FASO 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 23, 2018 Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, it is with great re-spect and admiration that I rise today to rec-ognize the prestigious achievements of Mr. Bob Becker for being named the recipient of the Four Chaplains Brotherhood Award. This designation recognizes those special individ-uals who dedicatedly serve the community without regard to the ethnicity, values, or be-liefs of others. It is a true testament to Mr. Becker’s continued legacy of acceptance, pa-triotism, and steadfast commitment to improv-ing the lives of veterans. A man of uncommon devotion and admi-rable selflessness, Mr. Becker faithfully served our country for over twenty years in the United States Marine Corps as a supply chief and platoon sergeant in the Second Marine Divi-sion and in the USMC Reserve, retiring as a distinguished first sergeant. Having served as the New York State Commandant of the Ma-rine Corps League and as National Com-mandant in the Marine Corps League, Mr. Becker is an esteemed and clarion voice for veterans’ affairs, both locally and nationally. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating Mr. Becker on receiving the Four Chaplains Brotherhood Award. His lifetime of hard work and dedicated service to the United States is inspirational, and I am grateful for his contributions to New York State. f 
CONGRATULATING THE CONGREGATION OF BETH SHALOM 
HON. JEFF DENHAM 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 23, 2018 Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and honor the Congregation of Beth Shalom on the momentous occasion of their 100th year anniversary. The Congrega-tion, originally recognized as the First Hebrew Congregation, was established on February 14, 1918 in the heart of the Central Valley, Modesto, CA. In 1963, the congregation moved to its ex-isting location on Sherwood Avenue and was renamed Congregation Beth Shalom, meaning ‘‘house of peace.’’ It became affiliated with the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism. Congregation Beth Shalom is the single Jew-ish congregation in Stanislaus County and the greater area. Congregation Beth Shalom has been served by the inspiring leadership of many rabbis, and is currently served by Rabbi Shalom Bochner. The Congregation provides a pleth-ora of cultural, educational, holiday, and social programs for the diverse Jewish population and the local community. Congregation Beth Shalom’s contributions have enriched the cul-ture and diversity of the Central Valley. Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring and congratulating Congregation Beth Shalom on their first 100 years, and wish them many more successful years to come.

CONGRATULATING FIRST SER-GEANT SHAJN CABRERA FOR RE-CEIVING THE 2018 GREATER FAY-ETTEVILLE CHAMBER AMBAS-SADOR OF THE YEAR 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 23, 2018 Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize First Sergeant Shajn Cabrera as the recipient of the 2018 Greater Fayetteville Chamber Ambassador of the Year Award. With over 21 years of service in the Army as an Interrogator and Source Operator, 1st SGT Cabrera has served our country with dis-tinction. I want to take this opportunity to thank 1st SGT Cabrera for his service to our coun-try. It is because of men and women like him we are able to enjoy the freedoms that we have. As an Ambassador at the Greater Fayette-ville Chamber, 1st SGT Cabrera is responsible for member retention, recruitment and commu-nication. The connections he has made through this program enable him to continue his selfless service to our community by as-sisting numerous nonprofit organizations. Cur-rently, 1st SGT Cabrera is the president and Senior Broker for Centurion Insurance Group. 1st SGT Cabrera is most deserving of this award, and I wish him success as he con-tinues to be a selfless servant to our commu-nity. Mr. Speaker, please join me today in cele-brating First Sergeant Shajn Cabrera on win-ning the 2018 Greater Fayetteville Chamber Ambassador of the Year. f 
POSTHUMOUSLY HONORING DEP-UTY U.S. MARSHAL CHRIS-TOPHER HILL OF PENNSYL-VANIA ON HIS SERVICE TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND HIS CAREER IN LAW EN-FORCEMENT 
HON. SCOTT PERRY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 23, 2018 Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, today I extend my heartfelt condolences to the family, loved ones and peers of my constituent, Deputy U.S. Mar-shal Christopher Hill, who was killed in the Line of Duty on Thursday, January 18, 2018. We grieve his passing, and are indebted for his selfless, tireless and devoted years of service as a law enforcement officer. I’ve long admired the commitment of people who devote themselves selflessly to serving our Nation and communities. Christopher served our Country as a U.S. Army Ranger, and over 11 years with the U.S. Marshals Service and its Special Operations Group. More importantly, though, he was best known for his devotion to his loving family. I joined throngs of compatriots at Chris-topher’s memorial service on January 25, 2018, and saw firsthand the results of his tire-less dedication, professionalism and sacrifice touched the lives of countless people. He set the standard for all others to follow, and though his legacy will endure in ways too nu-merous to count, his loss will continue to be felt in myriad and significant ways. On behalf of Pennsylvania’s Fourth Con-gressional District, I offer my heartfelt condo-lences to Deputy U.S. Marshal Christopher Hill’s family, friends and colleagues on our tragic loss. I thank Christopher and Godspeed, Brother. He’ll remain in my heart and prayers.

SUPPORT FOR THE BIPARTISAN BUDGET ACT OF 2018 
HON. JOHN J. FASO 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 23, 2018 Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in sup-port of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. This budget deal is a step forward that al-lows Congress to move on and tackle the problems Americans sent us here to solve. It includes a number of provisions that are wins for New Yorkers, including strengthening the state of our military readiness, improving care for our veterans, critical hospital investments, and providing more funding to fight the opioid crisis. Additionally, I want to express my support for the special committees organized to pro-pose genuine reform to the congressional budget process and another to address the funding crisis for multi-employer pension plans. For far too long, Congress has gov-erned from funding crisis to funding crisis, in-hibiting its ability to tackle our nation’s most pressing problems. This bipartisan agreement also includes fixes for several lingering health care related issues, including a two-year reauthorization of the Community Health Center Fund, a two- year elimination of the medical device tax, and an extension of the Medicare Love-Volume Hospital adjustment. This Medicare fix trans-lates to millions of dollars for several Upstate hospitals. Finally, I am thrilled to see my legislation improving the John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence Program included. This pro-gram is critical in assisting older former foster youth transition to an independent life, includ-ing providing education and training vouchers. This improvement increases the age the states can provide assistance from 21 to 23. It should also be noted that the nation faces a looming debt crisis which is not made better by this legislation. My support for the bill was overwhelmingly influenced by the critical de-fense funding gaps affecting military readi-ness. Secretary Mattis has been very persua-sive in his arguments as to the impacts of the budget sequester on our troops and the need to rebuild core aspects of our national de-fense. I trust his judgement in this regard. While there is still much work to be done, I applaud my colleagues for coming together to draft this bipartisan measure, and I am proud the President signed this legislation into law on February 9, 2018.

HONORING THE CAREER OF NANCY MAZZA 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 23, 2018 Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the career of Nancy Mazza and her service to the people of North Carolina. I’ve known Nancy for many years, and watched her succeed at every opportunity she was given. She got her start when she joined the National Federation of Republican Women in 1980. Since then, she has served the peo-ple of North Carolina in many capacities, in-cluding the 6th Congressional District Vice Chair and 13th Congressional District Chair for the North Carolina Republican Party, Presi-dent of the Greater Greensboro Republican Women’s Club, President of the North Caro-lina Federation of Republican Women, Board of Directors and leadership for the National Federation of Republican Women, and North Carolina Ballot Director for Governor George W. Bush. Over the years, Nancy has dedicated her life to helping constituents who have fallen on hard times and need help cutting through bu-reaucratic red tape at all levels of government. I first met Nancy back in 1996 when I was fresh out of college and she was working for Congressman Howard Coble in North Caro-lina’s 6th District. Since that time, I’ve seen firsthand her commitment and passion for service, leading Congressman Coble’s con-stituent services team for many years. After Congressman Coble retired in 2015, Nancy took her talents to Senator THOM TILLIS, where she has continued her dedicated service man-aging Senator T
ILLIS’ constituent service oper-ations for the Piedmont. Nancy was inducted into the North Carolina Republican Party Hall of Fame in 2007 and re-ceived the Order of the Long Leaf Pine—the highest award a North Carolinian can re-ceive—in 2016. I am extremely grateful for Nancy’s service to North Carolina, and I wish her continued success in her well-deserved re-tirement. Mr. Speaker, please join me today in com-memorating the career of Nancy Mazza.

HONORING RYAN HOLETS 
HON. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM 
OF NEW MEXICO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 23, 2018 Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Albuquerque Police Officer Ryan Holets and his wife Rebecca for their act of kindness and compassion in adopting a homeless mother’s opioid-addicted newborn while also supporting her recovery. While on patrol, Ryan found a homeless woman with a companion, taking opioids in the form of heroin. He soon realized that the woman was pregnant. While talking to the woman about the harm that her actions would bring to her unborn child, she became emo-tional and told Ryan that she knew what she was doing was wrong. Immediately, Ryan knew it was an oppor-tunity for him and his wife to adopt the baby and add a new member to their family. He showed the woman a photo of his wife, Re-becca, and their four children and offered to adopt the baby. When he shared the news with Rebecca, she immediately agreed that this was meant to happen and was a wonderful opportunity given to them by God. They did not have any hesi-tation to show compassion and love to this un-born child. On October 12, 2017, the baby was born and the Holets family named her Hope. Since Hope’s birth, the Holets family has continued to give support to her parents and encouraged them to seek treatment at a rehabilitation facil-ity in Florida. Ryan has become an incredible spokes-person for the opioid epidemic. His perspec-tive as an officer who sees the effects of drug abuse and homelessness is key to under-standing these issues and identifying solutions that are compassionate and effective. This heart-warming act of kindness was selfless and inspiring. I wish the very best to the Holets family and health to their new addi-tion, Hope. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF GEORGE G. DODGE INTERMEDIATE SCHOOL 
HON. DAVID P. JOYCE 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 23, 2018 Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I would like to acknowledge an exceptional school in my district, the George G. Dodge Intermediate School in Twinsburg, which has been recog-nized by the Ohio Department of Education as an Ohio School to Watch and a National Forum School. An Ohio School to Watch is a school that exceeds in academic excellence, developmental responsiveness, social equity, and organizational structures and processes. Students who attend George G. Dodge Inter-mediate School get one of the best hands-on education experiences in the nation. The teachers and administrators go above and be-yond their normal duties to educate and influ-ence young minds to succeed academically, socially, and in their future professions. There is no greater cause than educating the minds of the future. As a father, I know the amount of trust parents put into the hands of our edu-cators. Knowing our school districts are ex-ceeding in efforts for our children to succeed creates a closer, more positive community for the students, parents, and all involved in the surrounding neighborhoods. George G. Dodge Intermediate School’s mission is to create an environment of pride for one’s education while engaging with parents, administration, and fel-low students to grow in civic engagement and extracurricular activities. This recognition is all due to the hard work by George G. Dodge In-termediate School Principal Reggie Holland, his staff, Twinsburg City School District Super-intendent Kathi Powers, and Twinsburg City School District School Board members Matt Cellura, Rob Felber, Mark Curtis, Tina Davis, and Angela DeFabio. The dedication and lead-ership of these men and women is remarkable and unmatched. I am truly proud to have such a great education system in Ohio’s fourteenth district and congratulate George G. Dodge In-termediate School on this well-deserved dis-tinction.

Barbara grew up in Niagara Falls, New York, the oldest of five children, and has been politically active since high school. Marrying a soldier curtailed her opportunity to run for pub-lic office, but after twenty-seven years in the U.S. Army traveling and living overseas and across the United States, they came to the state of Georgia and became active in Repub-lican politics. Barbara and her husband, Jim, moved to Cobb County in 2001 and reside in Mableton. Barbara and Jim have four children and four grandchildren. Among her many ac-complishments, Barbara founded The Eti-quette School of Atlanta, where she teaches classes and workshops to enhance personal effectiveness for adults and children. She has served as a consultant at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., the United States De-partment of Agriculture, and as a Master Trainer for the Army Family Team Building Program. Barbara has served her community and state tirelessly as an integral part of many organizations, such as the South Cobb Busi-ness Association, Cobb County Chamber of Commerce, the Georgia Federation of Repub-lican Women, Cobb County Republican Wom-en’s Club, and the Cobb County Republicans, among others. On behalf of the people of Georgia’s 11th Congressional District and the United States House of Representatives, I commend Barbara Hickey for her many years of outstanding, dedicated and effective serv-ice.

CONGRATULATING AND HONORING THE CITY OF CERES 
HON. JEFF DENHAM 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 23, 2018 Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and honor the City of Ceres, lo-cated in the California Central Valley, on a tre-mendous milestone—the completion of its first centennial. As the City of Ceres enters into its 100th year, they wish to honor and mark its history of a community working together to bring a cityhood of achievement into existence. The name ‘‘Ceres’’ was selected by Elma J. Carter in 1871 to honor the warehouses and granary of her grandfather; the name meaning health, beauty, fruitfulness, and wholesomeness. Daniel Whitmore is accredited with building the City’s first house in 1870 and served as the first cartographer of the land on February 20, 1875. Ceres emerged as a township in January of 1910, consequent to the formation of the Ceres Judicial District. Simultaneously, the citizens of Ceres worked to assimilate as a city in California. It was not until February 25, 1918 that the inhabitants decided to incor-porate as a general law city of the State of California. Mr. Speaker, please join me in commemo-rating and congratulating the City of Ceres on the completion of its first centennial, and wish them a myriad to come.

Dur-ing this Black History Month, we honor her timeless dedication and almost 50 year record of honorable service to our community. A Tampa native, Attorney Stewart graduated from the University of South Florida with a Bachelor of Arts in History and Social Science Education.

Under her lead-ership, AKAs have volunteered over 6 million hours of service and impacted the lives of 26 million people in communities all over the globe.

an organization committed to engaging our community, especially youth, in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathe-matics. The Air Force Research Laboratory’s STEM Outreach Program in New Mexico organizes several programs that encourage students, from elementary through graduate school, to pursue careers in STEM fields. In 2017, the Laboratory’s outreach efforts were aimed at expanding the number of student’s served—a goal they’ve undoubtedly achieved. Their pro-grams, such as Mission to Mars, DoD STARBASE, and the Robotics Challenge, reached over 2,700 students last year. Sev-enty three percent of the participants were mi-nority or underrepresented students, and half were female. While incredibly dedicated to their own work, the Air Force Research Laboratory rec-ognizes the value of collaborating with the community. Through marketing, financial, and organizational support, the Laboratory strengthened the Discovery Festival which in-troduced fun, interactive STEM exhibits to over 1,400 students in New Mexico. Additionally, by creating a formal STEM matching program with school districts and their foundations across New Mexico, the Lab-oratory increased staff volunteer hours to pro-vide quality classroom instruction and projects in ways that are tailored to teachers’ cur-riculum and individual classroom needs. The Air Force Research Laboratory of New Mexico’s participation in my district office’s Congressional App Challenge, a competition that encourages children to code, enriched the overall experience for local students. Labora-tory staff took part in judging the submissions and provided live demonstrations for the stu-dents and their families during the awards re-ception. Last but certainly not least, in order to pro-mote the importance of STEM learning, Air Force Research Laboratory is hosting New Mexico’s premiere Excellence in STEM Awards. The ‘‘STEMys’’ will celebrate the ac-complishments of students, teachers, schools, organizations, businesses, and volunteers de-voted to STEM learning in New Mexico. I am incredibly proud of the work the Air Force Research Laboratory of New Mexico has done for the state’s students. Their agen-cy has inspired young minds to dream big, seize their future, and make the world a better place. I look forward to see the Laboratory’s influence grow as they continue to educate and inspire New Mexicans.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 23, 2018 Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Maple Leaf Farms on cele-brating 60 wonderful years. This family-owned operation has been a staple in northern Indi-ana and the U.S. duck industry since 1958. Donald Wentzel set out not only to be a successful business owner in northern Indi-ana, but also to be a trailblazer in duck farm-ing across the country. He believed in local, sustainable, and cost-efficient farming that would produce the highest-quality products for his customers. Four generations later, the family’s values and vision live on as the busi-ness continues to expand. While 60 years of successful operation is a tremendous accomplishment, Maple Leaf Farms’ expansion, production capabilities, and newest global ventures speak volumes to the dedication and ingenuity of the Tucker family. I am proud to learn of the strong business model and outstanding leadership of the Tuck-ers that has led Maple Leaf Farms to handle 10 million ducks a year and supply products worldwide. It is truly an honor to represent such pas-sionate and committed Hoosier farmers as the Tuckers, and I am grateful for the positive contributions they’ve made to our community. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of 2nd District Hoo-siers, I want to thank Maple Leaf Farms for strengthening Indiana’s farming community and wish them all the best in their next 60 years.

She reported with wisdom, wit and a sure eye for hyperbole on many issues, in-cluding housing, political campaigns, open space, historic preservation, and extending BART to San Jose. She wrote about the ‘‘Year of the Woman’’ and advocated for the ‘‘Era of Women.’’ She lauded the #MeToo movement and noted social media’s part in making this movement so powerful. She wrote poignantly that ‘‘When women have a fail’ share of the power, and the support to stand up to it, the world will be better for everyone. Our sons as well as our daughters.’’ Barbara Marshman will not go quietly into retirement. She will continue to live in San Jose and will lend her voice in different ways to the causes and concerns in our community. Whatever pulpit she chooses, we can be sure that hers will be a strong, effective and elo-quent voice for what is right and sensible. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Barbara Marshman and her ex-traordinary career that enlightened so many.

RECOGNIZING THE INTER-NATIONAL CAMPAIGN TO ABOL-ISH NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
HON. JAMIE RASKIN 
OF MARYLAND  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 23, 2018 Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the International Campaign to Abol-ish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), which was awarded the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize for its powerful and invaluable work to make the world a safer and more peaceful place. The organization is a coalition of non-governmental organizations (NGO) that pursues one of the continuing great imperatives of our time: the control and eventual elimination of nuclear weapons. ICAN sought to build on the notable suc-cess of the Ottawa Treaty, which 163 signato-ries have signed agreeing to ban the use and possession of landmines. Previous inter-national agreements have banned cluster mu-nitions and the use of biological and chemical weapons, but no such agreement prohibits the use of nuclear weapons. By combining the ef-forts of hundreds of NGOs in 100 countries, ICAN draws international attention to the horri-fying humanitarian consequences of armed conflict and the devastating specific threat posed by nuclear weapons. After its founding in 2007, ICAN coordinated efforts around three international con-ferences—in Oslo, Nayarit, and Vienna—that considered the effects of nuclear detonation and worked toward a binding international agreement. After the Vienna agreement, ICAN worked with more than 100 governments on a nuclear humanitarian pledge to cooperate on efforts to ‘‘fill the legal gap’’ in the international regime governing the use of nuclear weapons. This effort helped the United Nations develop the first legal framework for nuclear prohibi-tion. Thus far, 122 governments have signed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weap-ons, the first binding international agreement of its kind. Through ICAN’s efforts, the world is moving forward in the campaign to eliminate some of the most inhumane and destructive weapons ever created. The existential threat of nuclear conflict looms ever larger in our daily lives. Although anti-proliferation efforts have dramatically re-duced the number of state-held nuclear arms, the 15,000 nuclear weapons that remain con-tinue to pose an unparalleled and complete threat to the future of humankind. The con-sequences of nuclear war are devastating and irreversible. We must do everything in our power to prevent such a calamity. I commend ICAN for its tireless advocacy for a strong and effective nuclear weapons ban treaty, and applaud its essential work to make the world a safer place for us all human-ity.

RECOGNIZING GIRL SCOUT TROOP 2672 
HON. NYDIA M. VELA´ZQUEZ 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 23, 2018 Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Girl Scout Troop 2672 and espe-cially Samantha Roberts, Elena Marquez, Dahlia Sussman, and Zola Coppa for raising money to help children in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. Their event was a big suc-cess, and I applaud them for their creativity and dedication. Puerto Rico needs all the help it can get—and these young leaders are to be commended for helping the Island’s residents during these difficult times. By engaging fellow students to raise money at a bowling event, Troop 2672 was able to rally a community around an important cause. It is inspiring to see young people identifying a purpose and then taking meaningful steps to help. Puerto Rico and New York City have long shared a powerful bond, and it is too often for-gotten that the people of Puerto Rico are American citizens. The efforts of these dedi-cated Girl Scouts are an important reminder that we cannot turn our backs on the Island. It is great to see young women taking lead-ership roles and making a difference in both their local communities and for Puerto Rico. My best wishes to Troop 2672 as they con-tinue the school year and Girl Scout activities and projects. I am heartened by their resolve and inspired by their desire to lend a helping hand. These young leaders make all New Yorkers proud. f 
CONGRATULATING MARILYN DANIS FOR RECEIVING THE 2018 GREATER FAYETTEVILLE CHAM-BER ATHENA AWARD 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 23, 2018 Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Marilyn Danis as the recipient of the 2018 Greater Fayetteville Chamber Athena Award. The Athena Award is presented to the man or woman who has contributed to the support and success of professional women in the greater Fayetteville region. Marilyn has dem-onstrated her passion for the advancement of professional women throughout her career in the real estate and mortgage industry, along with her commitment to numerous community service programs. As the former owner and broker of a Century 21 real estate franchise, Marilyn mentored her female employees—pri-marily military wives—as they honed their skills in the industry. Currently, Marilyn is the owner of Residential Mortgage Corp., the longest locally-owned mortgage lender in Fay-etteville. Over the years, Marilyn has been a tireless advocate for local programs which support fur-thering the careers of women. As a sponsor of the InnovateHER Project, she helped put to-gether a competition which gives local women the venue to showcase the services and prod-ucts that can empower women and their fami-lies. Marilyn is deserving of this award, and I wish her success as she continues to advance not only her own career, but those of other women in our community. Mr. Speaker, please join me today in cele-brating Marilyn Danis on winning the 2018 Greater Fayetteville Chamber Athena Award. HONORING THE REVEREND BILLY GRAHAM HON. MARK WALKER 
OF NORTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 23, 2018 Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, Reverend Billy Graham was the premier example of how faith, hope and love can transcend political parties, backgrounds, cultures and affiliations. Rev. Graham preached to tens of millions. He preached Christ. His death and resurrec-tion. Despite holding favor and serving as a spir-itual advisor to presidents, kings and queens—and having a world renowned impact and legacy—Graham always remained grounded in humility. That speaks to his character. But it speaks to Christ’s spirit in Rev. Graham. Even as he preached to stadiums filled with tens of thousands, you knew that Rev. Gra-ham cared about you as an individual, your life and your future. Earning the titles ‘‘America’s Pastor’’ and ‘‘North Carolina’s favorite son,’’ a small-town pastor from North Carolina, who grew up on a dairy farm, preached the love and name of Jesus Christ. Never wavering, he changed the world—bringing thousands of lives to salvation and eternal life. For me, Rev. Graham will always be re-membered for his focus on redemption and the idea that there is limitless hope, oppor-tunity and freedom for every human life. Though I am not worthy to carry the old worn out Bible of Billy Graham, I am honored to be presenting the resolution to authorize Rev. Graham’s body to be the fourth American to lie in honor at the United States Capitol, the epicenter of our government. For almost a century, Rev. Graham changed lives and influ-enced our nation for the better. Though Reverend Graham never chased the honor of men, next week he will lie in honor for two days. We take comfort knowing that Rev. Graham has entered paradise and lives forever to honor the name above all names, the name of Jesus.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 23, 2018 Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to recognize the tremendous and meaningful work of Rosalyn Crawford Frazier, Chief Executive Officer of Broward Community and Family Health Centers.

millions in our country—especially for minori-ties and our most vulnerable populations. Ms. Frazier oversees the successful oper-ations of four clinical practice sites and one dental site located in Broward County, Florida. Broward Community and Family Health Cen-ters provides comprehensive medical, behav-ioral and dental health services across all lifecycles, helping to increase access to care and reducing health disparities in Broward County. The center’s mission is ‘‘to provide accessible, comprehensive, high quality pri-mary care services to all persons with dignity and respect.’’ In addition to managing the day-to-day oper-ations of several individual centers, Ms. Frazier is also at the forefront of health policy advocacy, from the grassroots to the highest levels of government. She has played an inte-gral role in policy development, having testi-fied before legislative committees, and serving on various policy planning councils. For her commitment, she has received several out-standing service and leadership awards from various federal, state, local, community and national agencies and organizations. Ms. Frazier received a Bachelor of Science Degree in Business Administration from DePaul University, a certification in Financial Management and Executive Development from the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, and a certification in Health Care Execu-tive Management from the University of Cali-fornia, Los Angeles. She is also an adjunct professor at Nova Southeastern University for its Master of Public Health Program. Rosalyn Frazier is a selfless, compas-sionate, and thoughtful citizen whom I am proud to call my friend. I applaud her work to ensure that families in Broward have access to quality affordable health care and thank ev-eryone at Broward Community and Family Health Centers for improving the lives of those in Florida’s 23rd Congressional District.

OF NORTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 23, 2018 Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Henry Tyson as the recipient of the 2018 Greater Fayetteville Chamber Young Professional of the Year Award.

BLACK HISTORY MONTH—JOLI COOPER-NELSON 
HON. KATHY CASTOR 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 23, 2018 Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a lifetime of professional and personal achievements of an outstanding busi-ness leader in the Tampa Bay community, Joli Cooper-Nelson. Ms. Cooper’s commitment to her work and our community has truly made her a role model for women everywhere. That is why, in honor of Black History Month, I rec-ognize her selfless dedication and honor her invaluable contributions to Tampa Bay. A native of Mobile, Alabama, Ms. Cooper at-tended McGill-Toolen Catholic High School before she began her impressive business ca-reer at the University of Notre Dame, where she earned a Bachelor of Business Adminis-tration in Finance. Ms. Cooper then earned a Master of Business Administration from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business, where she was honored in 2002 as Alumnae of the Year. After starting her professional career on Wall Street, Ms. Cooper transitioned into the consumer products industry as an Associate Brand Manager at Nestle in Los Angeles, Cali-fornia. During her time there, Ms. Cooper was influential for expanding the brand past our borders, including conducting business in Latin America and the United Kingdom and she was also responsible for boosting sales by more than 15 percent in areas of the company. When she moved to Tampa in 1998, Ms. Coo-per served as the President and Chief Oper-ating Officer of Pasco Brands, at that time the largest private label juice beverage company in the United States. Just as she has been dedicated to her busi-ness career, Ms. Cooper has dedicated her time and resources to make a difference in the lives of children in the Tampa Bay community. She has served on several non-profit boards including the United Way of Tampa Bay; The Greater Tampa Chamber of Commerce; Junior Achievement and The Children’s Home. Cur-rently, she serves as a member on the board of trustees of the Jack and Jill of America Foundation, the organization’s philanthropic arm and the Academy Prep Center of Tampa. The Academy Prep Center of Tampa is a tui-tion-free, independent school for middle-school aged children who qualify for need-based scholarships. Additionally, she is a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., where she has certainly embodied their mission of, ‘‘Serv-ice to All Mankind’’. Now, Ms. Cooper serves as the 25th Na-tional President of the premier organization for African-American families, Jack and Jill of America, Inc. As a member of the Greater Tampa Chapter in the Southeastern Region, she previously served as the National Vice President, Regional Director, Regional Sec-retary-Treasurer and two-term Regional Pro-gram Chair. In addition to being awarded the Wharton Alumnae of the Year, an award that recog-nizes distinguished Wharton alumnae who have demonstrated professional success and who serve as role models for women in busi-ness, Ms. Cooper has earned The Network Journal’s 25 Influential Black Women in Busi-ness Award, and was featured in the publica-tion, Beverage Industry and Working Mother. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Tampa Bay community, I am proud to recognize Joli Coo-per-Nelson for her outstanding success in her business endeavors encouraging supportive environments for women in business, and her dedication to serving all of our children throughout the years. Ms. Cooper’s hard work should be an inspiration to us all, and it is my honor to recognize her during this Black His-tory month.
