AMERICANS BENEFIT FROM 
LOWER ENERGY PRICES 
(Mr. POLIQUIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) 
Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, com-
pared to last summer, hardworking Maine families are saving $20 with every fill-up of their vehicles. The $1,000 annual savings is buying almost 2 months of groceries for a family of four. 
This winter, many of our families are 
saving an additional $1,000 because the cost of heating oil has plummeted. That is another 2 months of groceries. 
Last week, I was proud to join House 
Republicans and Democrats to finally approve the construction of the Key-stone XL pipeline. Our families will have more money, have more jobs, and enjoy more freedom when America in-
creases the production and transpor-tation of all forms of domestic energy and do it in an environmentally sen-sitive way. 
Increase production, and drive down 
price. 
Now, the House has done its job to 
approve the Keystone pipeline. I re-spectfully ask the Senate to do the same; then together, we must ask the President to do his part. 
It is the right thing to do for more 
jobs, fatter paychecks, and more secu-rity.

DON’T DEREGULATE WALL 
STREET AGAIN 
(Mr. ELLISON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I come 
to the floor today to remind my col-leagues on both sides of the aisle who are about to cast votes on a bill that I believe will make Wall Street a little freer to make risky bets for a few more years: Where were we 6 years ago? 
Well, let me just give you a blast 
from the past with some headlines. From The Wall Street Journal, on Jan-uary 7, 2009, ‘‘ADP Reports 693,000 Pri-vate Sector Jobs Lost’’; CNN, January 9, 2009, ‘‘Worst Year for Jobs Since ’45’’; Bloomberg, January 8, 2009, ‘‘Decem-ber’s Job Loss Was Bad. But How Bad?’’; in The New York Times, Feb-ruary 14, 2009, ‘‘Job Losses Pose a Threat to Stability Worldwide.’’ 
President Obama hadn’t been in of-
fice. This was other stuff, mistakes

that had happened in the past con-
nected to deregulation of Wall Street. 
We were staring down the worst re-
cession since the Great Depression. Today, we are about to embark back down that path to deregulate Wall Street again. Don’t do it.

REMEMBERING ROBERT JORDAN 
(Mr. WESTMORELAND asked and 
was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Speaker, 
I come before you today to honor my friend, lifetime Fayetteville resident and entrepreneur, Robert Jordan, who passed away on December 16, 2014. 
In 1952, Robert got his first job in re-
tail at the age of 17 at the old Travis Hardware store in downtown Fayette-ville. During his visits to various ware-houses around town, Robert noticed items seemingly not for sale and placed off to the side. Eventually, he realized he could cheaply buy some of those dis-carded items, take them back to down-town Fayetteville, and sell them for a profit, while still offering his cus-tomers a good deal. 
By the early 1970s, Robert was giving 
full-time attention to buying and sell-ing salvage merchandise and became well-known for his wheeling and deal-ing. If you wanted to know anything about the community in Fayette Coun-ty or if you wanted to win an election, you went to see Robert Jordan. Robert was the guy to go to. 
Jordan Sales and Salvage became 
popular and profitable, and it is a fine example of what American entrepre-neurship is all about. The way Robert ran his business and treated customers as his friends is a true statement of the compassion and faith involved in all the aspects of his daily life, especially the big love he had for his family. 
Joan and I send our condolences and 
prayers to the Jordan family, espe-cially his wife of 60 years, Nellie, dur-ing this difficult time, and I am thank-ful to have met Robert and to have vis-ited his store from time to time, but I am especially lucky to call him my friend. 
Robert, until we meet again, we miss 
you. 
f 
DON’T PLAY GAMES WITH HOME-
LAND SECURITY APPROPRIA-TIONS 
(Mr. TAKANO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to stand against the tactics used by the House Republicans for their par-tisan fights. I find it unconscionable that the House Republicans would threaten the funding of the Depart-ment of Homeland Security over the President’s executive action on immi-gration. 
We just saw what happened to our 
friends in France, and now, they are going to play games with our national 
security and threaten its funding. This executive action isn’t an election strat-egy or a scheme to grow the Federal Government; it is a moral imperative. 
The President acted because this 
House refused to even vote on the bi-partisan comprehensive immigration bill. It was widely expected that a vote on that bill would have succeeded. 
Our broken immigration system has 
forced millions to live their lives in fear. The President’s action is the right thing to do, is the humane thing to do. 
I oppose the defunding of this execu-
tive action, Mr. Speaker, and I oppose the threatening of the funding of the Department of Homeland Security and, by extension, our national security.

CONGRATULATIONS TO PENN 
STATE WORLD CAMPUS 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute and to re-vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Penn State World Campus on being ranked number one in the Nation for the best online bachelor’s programs in the country. 
The recognition was given by the 
U.S. News & World Report’s 2015 Best Online Programs and marks the high-est ever ranking for the university; fur-ther, Penn State ranks in the top 10 for the best online graduate programs in business, engineering, education, and computer information technology. 
The assessment criteria included stu-
dent engagement, faculty credentials and training, peer reputation, student services, and technology. 
Penn State World Campus, which 
provides high-quality online education to meet the needs of busy adults who want to advance their careers, cur-rently has 10,805 students enrolled in 119 degree and certificate programs. 
The third year that U.S. News & 
World Report has ranked online degree programs, almost 300 institutions that offer online bachelor degrees are in-cluded in the rankings. 
Mr. Speaker, I commend my alma 
mater for this esteemed recognition, including the talented staff and the in-novative educators at Penn State Uni-versity. 
f 
DON’T PICK POLITICS OVER 
COUNTRY 
(Ms. SEWELL of Alabama asked and 
was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) 
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, today, I rise in support of our Na-tion’s continued safety and national se-curity. Recent world events vividly re-mind us of the importance of sup-porting and maintaining a strong and robust homeland security policy. 
Today, we are going to vote on H.R. 
240, the Department of Homeland Secu-rity Appropriations Act, and it pro-
vides for critical, important funding to the Department, including vital sup-port for essential law enforcement ac-tivities and programs. 
I had hoped that my Republican col-
leagues would bring this bill, a clean bill, to the floor; instead, we have more politics as usual. A bill that would ac-tually be signed into law by the Presi-dent is what this country needs; how-ever, what we have is not that case today. 
It is unfortunate and extremely up-
setting that the Republicans are now threatening to shut down the Depart-ment of Homeland Security, endan-gering the security of our entire coun-try and appeasing the most extreme anti-immigration reform fringes of their party. 
This is simply politics over country 
and should not be a part of the debate surrounding our critically important appropriations bills for Homeland Se-curity. 
The five amendments that the Re-
publicans plan to attach to the bipar-tisan Homeland Security bill represent some of the most extreme anti-immi-gration legislation. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to reject these amendments, reject this partisan gamesmanship that threatens our national security, and call on the majority to vote on and pass the original version of H.R. 240. 
f 
MENTAL ILLNESS AND THE 
HOMELESS 
(Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania asked 
and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, last week, the wind chill in Buffalo, New York, was 20 below zero. Dead of hypothermia was Ronald Hun-ter. He was 21 and had untreated schiz-ophrenia. 
A third of the Nation’s 750,000 home-
less are so severely mentally ill that they cannot take care of themselves. They starve, they freeze, they live in their own squalor. 
Had Ronald had some other brain dis-
ease like Alzheimer’s, he might very well be alive today, but because he had a mental illness, the system refused to help. 
Ronald’s father told The Buffalo 
News: 
‘‘When he was living with us, I found 
him curled up in a ball in the corner of the bedroom,’’ and I said, ‘‘What is wrong, baby?’’ 
He replied to his dad, ‘‘I am hearing 
voices telling me to kill myself.’’ 
Ronald’s parents called Crisis Serv-
ices, but as his stepmom said, ‘‘Because he was 18, it was up to him if he wanted help.’’ In other words, we let him die with his rights on. 
Don’t you understand, America, that 
this is a brain disease; it is not a choice? 
I will soon be reintroducing the Help-
ing Families in Mental Health Crisis

AMERICA’S IMPROVING ECONOMIC 
OUTLOOK 
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of 
New York asked and was given permis-sion to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, in 2014, the Amer-ican economy had the strongest job growth it has had since 1997. That is 18 years ago. We have had private sector jobs growth for 58 straight months. That is the longest stretch on record. 
Our economy has once again become 
the envy of the world. Inflation is tame. Gas prices are low. The deficit is falling, and the stock market is up. 
Consumer sentiment is now at its 
highest level since the early years of 2007. The economic outlook looks good, but it could and should be better. This success has been based on sound public policy. 
If we stop the politicking and work 
together, we can make our growing economy work for all Americans.

IMMIGRATION 
(Mr. GUINTA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to the President’s continued use of executive action to bypass Congress and the American peo-ple in order to move forward with his own agenda. In the Granite State, we believe deeply in the rule of law and separation of powers, and the Presi-dent’s abuse of executive authority runs counter to these principles. 
The United States is a very generous 
country to those who come here seek-ing a better life for themselves and their family. Every year, countless seek solace on our shores in search of economic and political freedom. 
Unfortunately, our laws have not 
kept up with our needs. Our current economic system is broken. Instead of encouraging legal immigration, streamlining the process, and reform-ing our visa system, the President has intentionally refused to enforce the laws already on the books. The Presi-dent’s DACA order has encouraged thousands of children to take a per-ilous journey, ripping them from their families and placing their well-being with those who seek to exploit them. 
Mr. Speaker, our Nation cannot send 
a signal that we won’t enforce our laws or hold those responsible for breaking them. Our immigration system can be better. Compassion for people and care to faithfully execute our laws are not mutually exclusive. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SE-

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 27, the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. A
DERHOLT ) and a 
Member opposed each will control 10 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Alabama. Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chairman, I 
want to thank the chairman of the Ap-propriations Committee (Mr. C
ARTER ) 
for his leadership in putting a great bill and a comprehensive bill before us this morning that deals with pro-tecting the homeland. 
I am presenting today, along with my 
distinguished colleagues—in par-ticular, from South Carolina (Mr. M
ULVANEY ), and also Mr. B ARLETTA  
from Pennsylvania—an amendment that defunds the President’s unconsti-tutional executive actions on illegal immigration. 
As it has been noted here last night 
and this morning, back in December, the House voted to fund the Federal Government for this fiscal year, FY15, but we kept funding for the Depart-ment of Homeland Security on a con-tinuing resolution. By doing so, we were making a promise to the Amer-ican people. It was a promise that once we had a Republican Senate, we would work together as a Congress to ensure the President’s unconstitutional and unilateral actions would not go un-checked. Today, this promise has been kept with this amendment before us today. 
At this time, I would like to yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. C
ARTER ), the chairman 
of the Homeland Security Sub-committee on Appropriations. 
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Chair-
man, I rise in support of this amend-ment. The executive actions of Novem-ber 20, 2014, and the Morton memos of 2011 and 2012 are in direct contraven-tion of congressional intent and have no standing in current law and must be dismantled. 
Apparently, the President learned 
nothing from the devastating results of his previous executive amnesty, De-ferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA, which led to nearly 70,000 chil-dren arriving on our southern border last summer at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars to the American taxpayer. 
This amendment turns back the 
President’s shortsighted executive overreach, and for that reason, I strongly support its passage. 
Mr. Chairman, we will also consider 
four additional amendments today. All of them seek to correct many of the dangerous actions the President has taken on this issue and restore the rule of law. I plan to support all of these amendments and urge my colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chair, I claim the time in opposition. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is 
recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may utilize. 
Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposi-
tion to this poison pill amendment, which is a laundry list of attacks on anything the executive branch has done to improve immigration and bor-der security policy. It caters to every whim of the Republican Conference’s 
most extreme elements. It would defund the Secretary’s Southern Bor-der and Approaches Campaign designed to unify border security efforts. It would defund policies to improve em-ployment-based immigration, to bring highly skilled workers into our coun-try. It would defund the policy to pa-role in place family members of citi-zens or lawful permanent residents who seek to enlist in the U.S. military, a policy supported by the Department of Defense. Incredibly, it would defund the Department’s provision of tem-porary relief to individuals who were brought to this country illegally as children—those covered by the DREAM Act—and to the parents of U.S. citizens who meet certain criteria. 
Of course, it would defund the Sec-
retary’s policy of setting immigration enforcement priorities. Every pros-ecutor in this country exercises some level of discretion to make the most of limited resources. We want our police to pursue murderers over traffic viola-tors. We also should want DHS to focus enforcement efforts on illegal immi-grants who pose a threat to our com-munities. 
Now, it would be preferable—as the 
President is the first to acknowledge— to pass comprehensive immigration re-form to address our country’s festering immigration challenges. But in the face of House Republicans’ failure to act, the President has taken well-con-sidered steps, each of them well- grounded in law and precedent. If the Republican majority wishes to change the law in some way to deny him such authority, they should introduce legis-lation to do so. But adoption of this amendment would sabotage the Home-land Security funding bill and under-mine our Nation’s security at a time of great danger. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues 
to oppose this amendment, and I re-serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chairman, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. M
CCARTHY ), the major-
ity leader of the House of Representa-tives to speak, and thank him for his leadership. 
Mr. M
CCARTHY. I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding. 
Mr. Chairman, when the President 
was asked about his deportation policy early in 2013, President Obama said: 
I am the President of the United States of 
America. I am not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed. 
Mr. Chairman, a few days earlier he 
said: 
I am not a king. I am the head of the exec-
utive branch of government. I am required to 
follow the law. 
Twenty-two times, Mr. Chairman, 
the President said he couldn’t ignore immigration law and create new laws by himself. But now, Mr. Chairman, President Obama has done exactly what he said he could not do. What changed between then and now? Noth-ing. Our Constitution is exactly the

same, and Congress still retains the 
sole power to legislate. 
Mr. Chairman, Presidents do not 
have the right to rewrite any law in any instance. This fact is explicitly clear in regards to immigration. Actu-ally, when it comes to immigration, the Supreme Court stated: 
Over no conceivable subject is the legisla-
tive power of Congress more complete. 
This is not a battle between Demo-
crats and Republicans or a battle be-tween pro-immigration and anti-immi-gration. It doesn’t matter whether, Mr. Chairman, you like the results of what the President did or not. This is about resisting the assault on democratic government and protecting the con-stitutional separation of powers. 
Let me be clear. This bill funds the 
entire Department of Homeland Secu-rity, so that is not an issue here. So when we vote today, there is only one question to ask: Do we weaken our Constitution by allowing the Executive to legislate, or do we defend the most fundamental laws of our democracy? There is no middle ground. 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-tlewoman from New York (Mrs. L
OWEY ), our ranking member on Appro-
priations. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, the 
114th Congress started 1 week ago with Republican leadership saying they wanted to work together and govern maturely. Well, it only took a week for Republican leadership to fold to its rightwing. Instead of compromise, we see confrontation. 
Make no mistakes. The amendments 
being debated this morning would stop the bill, would kill the bill, hurt those who were brought here as children and know no other country than the United States, prevent the Department of Homeland Security from prioritizing the deportation of national security threats and dangerous felons, and are little more than a collection of polit-ical sound bites. 
If you don’t agree with the Presi-
dent’s enforcement actions, which are legal and similar to steps taken by sev-eral Republican Presidents, then let us have a serious debate about com-prehensive immigration reform, then bring an immigration bill to the floor. 
Mr. Chairman, the President’s execu-
tive actions will grow the economy by $90 billion to $210 billion over the next 10 years and raise average wages for U.S.-born workers by $170 a year. The House Republican proposal would not only eradicate these gains, but harm numerous security initiatives. After the tragic events in Paris, it is appall-ing that some would jeopardize our na-tional security by adding these irre-sponsible amendments. 
Let’s vote against these poison bills 
and move forward with a solid, bipar-tisan Homeland Security bill supported by Democrats, Republicans, the House, and the Senate. 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chairman, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Virginia (Mr. G
OOD-
LATTE ), the chairman of the House Ju-
diciary Committee. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding and for his leader-ship on this issue. 
The Acting CHAIR. Mr. Chairman, I 
urge my colleagues to support the Aderholt-Mulvaney-Barletta amend-ment. The amendment will completely defund President Obama’s unconstitu-tional power grab granting deferred ac-tion status and work authorization to over 4 million unlawful aliens. This policy threatens the separation of pow-ers between Congress and the executive branch and violates President Obama’s obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. 
In addition to barring the use of ap-
propriated funds to carry out this pol-icy, the amendment will also bar Presi-dent Obama from using immigration user fees to accomplish his executive fiat. 
Mr. Chairman, the amendment also 
defunds the Obama administration’s so-called prosecutorial discretion memos that have gutted immigration enforcement within the United States, and the amendment defunds the ability of illegal aliens to receive any Federal benefit based on these policies. 
Finally, the amendment makes clear 
that the defunded programs have no statutory or constitutional basis and, therefore, have no legal effect. 
I again urge my colleagues to support 
this very good amendment.

Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-tleman from Illinois (Mr. G
UTIE´RREZ ), 
the chairman of the Immigration Task Force of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. 
Mr. GUTIE ´RREZ. Wow, time flies 
when you are playing politics with peo-ple’s lives. Just a year ago, as the Re-publican majority was rushing off to their retreat, they had a very different story. Here it is: 
House immigration reform, 2013. Good-
latte-Cantor working to give legal status to kids. House GOP leaders embrace immigra-tion fix that includes status for undocu-mented. Republicans see the light on immi-gration reform. 
And what are the headlines today? 
Behold the Republican immigration strategy: mass deportation. 
One year ago—this is the difference 
in the headlines that your party’s pub-lic policy on immigration has caused. But wait, let’s see what you said in your principles: 
It is time to provide an opportunity for 
legal residence and citizenship for those who were brought to this country as children through no fault of their own, those who knew no other place as home. 
Citizenship, legal residence for the 
undocumented youth—that was your idea, one that we applauded and we ac-cepted and we cheered on. And 1 year later, you want to take away from 600,000 DREAMers their right to live in this country and to live legally. You 
want to deport them all. What hap-pened? What happened? 
The Acting CHAIR. The Chair would 
remind the gentleman to direct re-marks to the Chair and not to other Members. 
Mr. GUTIE ´RREZ. Well, then let me 
say this. I just think if that is what happened in 1 year, what are you going to come up with next year? What is your game plan for next year if this is the kind of position you have taken from one year to the next? 
But let me just say this. The action 
you take today I know you believe will cause fear and confusion and con-sternation in the immigrant commu-nity throughout this Nation, thereby causing the failure of the President’s executive order because no one will sign up. 
But let me tell you something. The 
fruits of your action today will cause only anger and outrage and the mobili-zation of an immigrant community throughout this Nation that will be the death knell of the future of your party as a national institution. That is what you will reap today with this. 
Tonight, I will be with Congressman 
C
ICILLINE , and I will be there standing 
with the Catholic Diocese, with evangelicals, with men of faith in Providence, Rhode Island, and people will come forward. Where will the Re-publican Party be? Simply telling them that we cannot do anything. 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chairman, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. B
ARLETTA ), the cosponsor of this 
amendment, who has been very helpful in crafting this amendment. 
Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Chairman, I 
rise in support of my amendment which I coauthored with my col-leagues. Its purpose is simple. We defund President Obama’s unlawful ex-ecutive amnesty program for illegal immigrants. As we know, the President announced it only 2 months ago. But we also know that is not when this ex-ecutive amnesty truly began. It began in 2011 with the Morton memos. Those memos told officials not to pursue cer-tain broad categories of illegal immi-grants. 
Our amendment defunds the enforce-
ment of those memos, and that goes to the heart of the amnesty program. In short, these memos told immigration officers to view the law the way Presi-dent Obama wished it had been written rather than how Congress actually wrote it. That is the crux of this. 
In the United States, we still have a 
legislative branch of government. Our amendment defends it. 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-tlewoman from California (Ms. L
INDA 
T. S A´NCHEZ ), the chair of the Congres-
sional Hispanic Caucus. 
Ms. LINDA T. SA ´NCHEZ of Cali-
fornia. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to 
speak against H.R. 240, the venomous and dangerous Republican appropria-tions bill for the Department of Home-land Security.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H377 January 14, 2015 
This bill and its amendments pander 
to those in the Republican Party who are unhappy with President Obama’s executive action on immigration. It is malicious and foolishly puts our coun-try at risk. Republicans brought this legislation under the guise of defending the Constitution, but the President’s actions are constitutional. The ob-struction and political games that Re-publicans are playing are the true be-haviors that need to be condemned. 
Republicans aren’t interested in of-
fering solutions or working to tackle the most pressing issues facing our country. How do I know? Because in-stead of offering a long-term solution to fix our broken immigration system, Republicans have opted to hold hostage funding for one of the most critical agencies in our government. As they peddle their malice about immigrants to pander to their base, they put our national security at risk. We should be doing everything we can to provide our security agencies with the support and the resources they need to prevent at-tacks like the one that occurred in France last week. Instead, Republicans are willing to withhold funding our na-tional security in order to send a mes-sage to the President. 
And as if that weren’t juvenile 
enough, this bill also attacks the most vulnerable in our society. Republican amendments seek to revictimize those who have suffered domestic violence, picking on one of the groups least able to defend themselves. When I was a kid, we just called that bullying. 
Republicans are consciously tar-
geting millions of families who work hard, who contribute to their commu-nities and are just trying to give their children a chance at the American Dream. You know, that same dream that many of our parents and grand-parents had when they came to this country. 
Mr. Chairman, with this bill, Repub-
licans are not just abandoning basic humanity, they are also turning their backs on the economic benefits that come with bringing these people out of the shadows. 
We could grow our economy any-
where from $90 billion to $210 billion over the next 10 years if we allow work-ers a chance to participate in the for-mal economy. 
This is a new Congress and a new op-
portunity to work together. As a coun-try, we are better than this. Shame on you. 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chairman, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. M
ULVANEY ), who is not only a cospon-
sor of this amendment but who, again, was very instrumental in this amend-ment taking place. 
Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Chairman, I 
am going to do something I don’t ordi-narily do on this floor, which is im-plore my colleagues across the aisle to please, please, please, support this amendment. Let’s take away for at least one day the ‘‘R’’ or the ‘‘D’’ from behind the President’s name. Let’s 
take away the ‘‘R’’ or the ‘‘D’’ from be-hind our names and look at this for what it is: a President doing something he says he cannot do—make law—using the excuse that this body cannot act so that he can. That is not how the sys-tem works, and it is wrong. 
I am here today to tell you that if in 
the future a Republican President does the same thing, I will be the first to be here with you to stand against that, to fight back. 
But today I implore you to please 
support the amendment even if you are voting against the bill in order to send the message that law is not made in the White House. Law is not made be-cause Congress fails to act. Law is made in this room when we do act, and every single time any President vio-lates that, he violates all of this insti-tution. 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, may I inquire as to the re-maining time on both sides? 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from North Carolina has 2 minutes re-maining. The gentleman from Alabama has 4 minutes remaining. 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chairman, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. L
AMALFA ). 
Mr. L AMALFA. Mr. Chairman, our 
Nation’s Constitution is clear. Con-gress holds the power of the purse. There are no exceptions. There is no asterisk, and there is no fine print. The Founders designed our government in order to prevent these exact cir-cumstances—a President who ignores the law, refuses to work with Congress and intends to govern unilaterally. 
Whatever your views on the Presi-
dent’s plan, it is the responsibility of every Member of this House to support this amendment, to maintain our rep-resentative government, and to uphold the framework of our Republic. 
Our immigration system isn’t bro-
ken. It is just not being used. 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time to close. 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chairman, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. P
ALMER ), who is joining 
us from the Birmingham area and is a new Member of the House of Represent-atives. 
Mr. PALMER. Mr. Chairman, Presi-
dent Obama has created a constitu-tional crisis by taking action that in his own words ‘‘changes the law.’’ That power is not vested in the President. It is vested in Congress, along with the power of the purse, as has been men-tioned, to take action when the execu-tive branch overreaches. 
This isn’t about immigration policy. 
It is about defending and upholding the Constitution. In that regard, this amendment defunds the President’s ac-tions, and I am proud to support it. 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chairman, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. S
ENSENBRENNER ). Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Chair-
man, 8 days ago Members of this House said the following: 
I do solemnly swear that I will support and 
defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God. 
This is a question of whether this 
House and its Members fulfill that oath. We have a choice here. We can ei-ther agree with what the President did or defend the Constitution. Vote ‘‘aye.’’ 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chairman, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. W
ESTERMAN ), a new Member to this 
body. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding, and I rise in sup-port of this amendment. 
Mr. Chairman, many of my constitu-
ents are much like me. We are ready for a government that works like the one that we studied in civics class, one with coequal branches of power. 
Winston Churchill once stated that 
the price of greatness is responsibility. As members of the legislative branch, voting ‘‘yes’’ for this amendment is a responsible step in the right direction. 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time to close. 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Chairman, 
again let me just say before the gen-tleman closes, the amendment here be-fore us today prevents any funds appro-priated, or user fees collected by any Federal agency, to be used to carry out the executive actions that were an-nounced on November 20, 2014, which would grant deferred action to an esti-mated 4 million people in the country illegally and unlawfully. 
Again, this goes back to a promise 
that was made by the Republican House of Representatives at the end of last year, and we addressed this issue saying that we would work on this issue, make a commitment to address this issue of the President’s action when this bill came to the floor, and this is fulfilling that promise today. 
Again, I would ask my colleagues to 
support this amendment. 
I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
I want to close by again thanking 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle for the good work done on the underlying bill, our bipartisan, bicameral nego-tiated agreement on Homeland Secu-rity. 
It is really a shame that we are faced 
here today with an amendment that has the potential to wreck this good bill and to damage the Homeland Secu-rity Department so badly. Now, I don’t say that lightly. I think Members

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H378 January 14, 2015 
know I don’t interject terms like ‘‘poi-
son pill’’ into debates lightly; but, be-lieve me, that term applies to the amendment we are now considering. 
This amendment caters to every 
whim of the most extreme elements of the Republican Conference. It doesn’t just roll back the President’s recent executive action—which, by the way, is thoroughly grounded in law and prece-dent. It goes beyond that. It rolls back in its entirety the progress that has been made over many years on prioritizing dangerous criminals for de-portation and bringing common sense to our deportation policy. 
In pursuing this political vendetta, 
Republicans are putting at risk a full- year funding bill, worked out months ago, for the Department of Homeland Security, and they are doing that at a time of heightened alert. 
Mr. Chairman, this is an egregious 
abuse, probably the worst I have ever seen, of the appropriations process. More than that, it is a reprehensible, reckless tactic which will com-promise—has already compromised— the full and effective functioning of our Homeland Security Department and puts the security of our country at risk. 
This amendment richly deserves our 
rejection, and I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I rise in op-
position to the Aderholt-Mulvaney-Barletta Amendment to H.R. 240, the Fiscal Year 2015 Homeland Security Appropriations Act. 
I oppose the amendment because it is noth-
ing more than the Republican majority’s latest partisan attack on the President and another diversionary tactic to avoid addressing the challenge posed by the nation’s broken immi-gration system. 
The President will veto the underlying bill if 
the Aderholt Amendment is adopted so I urge my colleagues to defeat this irresponsible amendment which has the potential to put the security of our homeland at risk. 
House Republicans are playing a dangerous 
game of Russian Roulette with the security of America’s homeland by recklessly adding this ‘‘poison pill’’ to legislation needed to fund the agencies and programs charged with securing the border and protecting the homeland. 
Mr. Chair, the Aderholt Amendment seeks 
to prohibit the executive branch from exempt-ing or deferring from deportation any immi-grants considered to be unlawfully present in the United States under U.S. immigration law, and to prohibit the administration from treating those immigrants as if they were lawfully present or had lawful immigration status. 
The amendment bill seeks to make January 
9, 2015 the effective date of these prohibi-tions—thereby retroactively blocking the exec-utive actions taken President Obama to ad-dress our broken immigration system by pro-viding smarter enforcement at the border, prioritize deporting felons—not families—and allowing certain undocumented immigrants, in-cluding the parents of U.S. citizens and lawful residents, who pass a criminal background check and pay taxes to temporarily stay in the U.S. without fear of deportation. 
Mr. Chair, let me briefly discuss why the ex-
ecutive actions taken by President Obama are reasonable, responsible, and within his con-
stitutional authority. 
Under Article II, Section 3 of the Constitu-
tion, the President, who is the nation’s Chief Executive, ‘‘shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.’’ 
In addition to establishing the President’s 
obligation to execute the law, the Supreme Court has consistently interpreted the Take Care Clause as ensuring presidential control over those who execute and enforce the law and the authority to decide how best to en-force the laws. See, e.g., Arizona v. United States; Bowsher v. Synar; Buckley V. Valeo; Printz v. United States; Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB. 
Every law enforcement agency, including 
the agencies that enforce immigration laws, has ‘‘prosecutorial discretion’’—the power to decide whom to investigate, arrest, detain, charge, and prosecute. 
Agencies, including the U.S. Department of 
Homeland Security (DHS), may develop dis-cretionary policies specific to the laws they are charged with enforcing, the population they serve, and the problems they face so that they can prioritize resources to meet mission crit-ical enforcement goals. 
Executive authority to take action is thus 
‘‘fairly wide,’’ indeed the federal government’s discretion is extremely ‘‘broad’’ as the Su-preme Court held in the recent case of Ari-zona v. United States, 132 S. Ct. 2492, 2499 (2012), an opinion written Justice Kennedy and joined by Chief Justice Roberts: 
Congress has specified which aliens may be 
removed from the United States and the pro-cedures for doing so. Aliens may be removed if they were inadmissible at the time of entry, have been convicted of certain crimes, or meet other criteria set by federal law. Re-moval is a civil, not criminal, matter. A prin-
cipal feature of the removal system is the broad discretion exercised by immigration officials. Federal officials, as an initial matter, must de-cide whether it makes sense to pursue removal at all. If removal proceedings commence, 
aliens may seek asylum and other discre-tionary relief allowing them to remain in the country or at least to leave without formal removal. (emphasis added) (citations omit-ted). 
The Court’s decision in Arizona v. United 
States, also strongly suggests that the execu-tive branch’s discretion in matters of deporta-tion may be exercised on an individual basis, or it may be used to protect entire classes of individuals such as ‘‘[u]nauthorized workers trying to support their families’’ or immigrants who originate from countries torn apart by in-ternal conflicts: 
Discretion in the enforcement of immigra-
tion law embraces immediate human con-cerns. Unauthorized workers trying to sup-port their families, for example, likely pose less danger than alien smugglers or aliens who commit a serious crime. The equities of an individual case may turn on many fac-tors, including whether the alien has chil-dren born in the United States, long ties to the community, or a record of distinguished military service. 
Some discretionary decisions involve pol-
icy choices that bear on this Nation’s inter-national relations. Returning an alien to his own country may be deemed inappropriate even where he has committed a removable offense or fails to meet the criteria for ad-mission. The foreign state may be mired in civil war, complicit in political persecution, or enduring conditions that create a real risk that the alien or his family will be 
harmed upon return. 
The dynamic nature of relations with 
other countries requires the Executive Branch to ensure that enforcement policies are consistent with this Nation’s foreign pol-icy with respect to these and other realities. 
Mr. Chair, in exercising his broad discretion 
in the area of removal proceedings, President Obama has acted responsibly and reasonably in determining the circumstances in which it makes sense to pursue removal and when it does not. 
In exercising this broad discretion, President 
Obama not done anything that is novel or un-precedented. 
Here are a just a few examples of executive 
action taken by several presidents, both Re-publican and Democratic, on issues affecting immigrants over the past 35 years: 
1. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter exer-
cised parole authority to allow Cubans to enter the U.S., and about 123,000 ‘‘Mariel Cubans’’ were paroled into the U.S. by 1981. 
2. In 1987, President Ronald Reagan used 
executive action in 1987 to allow 200,000 Nicaraguans facing deportation to apply for re-lief from expulsion and work authorization. 
3. In 1990, President George H.W. Bush 
issued an executive order that granted De-ferred Enforced Departure (DED) to certain nationals of the People’s Republic of China who were in the United States. 
4. In 1992, President George H.W. Bush 
granted DED to certain nationals of El Sal-vador. 
5. In 1997, President Bill Clinton issued an 
executive order granting DED to certain Hai-tians who had arrived in the United States be-fore Dec. 31, 1995. 
6. In 2010 the Obama administration began 
a policy of granting parole to the spouses, par-ents, and children of military members. 
Mr. Chair, because of the President’s lead-
ership and far-sighted executive action, 594,000 undocumented immigrants in my home state of Texas are eligible for deferred action. 
If these immigrants are able to remain 
united with their families and receive a tem-porary work permit, it would lead to a $338 million increase in tax revenues, over five years. 
Mr. Chair, the President’s laudable execu-
tive actions are a welcome development but not a substitute modernizing the nation’s immi-gration laws. Only Congress can do that. 
America’s borders are dynamic, with con-
stantly evolving security challenges. Border security must be undertaken in a manner that allows actors to use pragmatism and common sense. 
And as shown by the success in the last 
Congress of H.R. 1417, the bipartisan ‘‘Border Security Results Act, which I helped to write and introduced along with the senior leaders of the House Homeland Security Committee, we can do this without putting the nation at risk or rejecting our national heritage as a wel-coming and generous nation. 
This legislation has been incorporated in 
H.R. 15, the bipartisan ‘‘Border Security, Eco-nomic Opportunity, and Immigration Mod-ernization Act,’’ legislation which reflects near-ly all of the core principles announced pro-fessed last year by House Republicans. 
As a nation of immigrants, the United States 
has set the example for the world as to what can be achieved when people of diverse back-
grounds, cultures, and experiences come to-gether.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H379 January 14, 2015 
It is now time to open the golden symbol-
ized by Lady Liberty’s lamp to the immigrant community of today so they can participate fully in the American Dream. 
These loyal and law-abiding persons have 
been waiting patiently for far too long for their chance. 
We can and should seize this historic oppor-
tunity pass legislation to ensure that we have in place adequate systems and resources to secure our borders while at the same pre-serving America’s character as the most open and welcoming country in the history of the world and to reap the hundreds of billions of dollars in economic productivity that will result from comprehensive immigration reform. 
President Obama has acted boldly, respon-
sibly, and compassionately in exercising his constitutional authority to enforce the immigra-tion laws in an effective and humane manner. 
If congressional Republicans, who refused 
to debate comprehensive immigration reform legislation for more than 500 days, disapprove of the lawful actions taken by the President, an alternative course of action is readily avail-able to them: pass a bill and send it to the President for signature. 
The President has shown responsible lead-
ership. The next move is for congressional Republicans to stop playing Russian Roulette with the security of America’s homeland and bring to the floor a clean Homeland Security spending bill that the President can sign into law. 
I urge all Members to join me in opposing 
the rule and the underlying bill. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-tleman from Alabama (Mr. A
DERHOLT ).

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 27, the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. B
LACKBURN ) and 
a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chair, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise today in support of my amend-
ment to freeze the President’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which was unlawfully created by execu-tive memo on June 15, 2012. 
My amendment prohibits Federal 
funding, fees, or resources from being used to consider or adjudicate any new, renewal, or previously denied applica-tion for any alien requesting consider-ation for deferred action. 
Article I, section 8, clause 4 states 
that the Congress shall have power ‘‘to establish an uniform rule of naturaliza-tion’’—Congress, not the Executive. President Obama has circumvented Congress and unilaterally rewritten immigration law from the Oval Office. 
A Federal judge in Pennsylvania said 
President Obama’s amnesty is uncon-stitutional and that, number one, ‘‘In-action by Congress does not make un-constitutional executive action con-stitutional’’; and, number two, ‘‘Execu-tive action goes beyond prosecutorial discretion. It is legislation.’’ That is the reason we bring the amendment. 
At this time, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. G
OOD-
LATTE ), chairman of the House Judici-
ary Committee. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I strongly support her amendment to H.R. 240, which prohibits Federal funding or resources from being used to adjudicate any new, renewal, or pre-viously denied application for the President’s Deferred Action for Child-hood Arrivals program. It is that sim-ple. 
The President’s DACA program, an-
nounced by the President and the Sec-retary of the Department of Homeland Security on June 15, 2012, violates the laws Congress has written and is a usurpation of the plenary authority over immigration law that article I, section 8, clause 4 of the United States Constitution confers upon the legisla-tive branch. 
For these reasons, I urge my col-
leagues to support the gentlewoman’s amendment to defund DACA. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I 
claim the time in opposition to the amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from Michigan is recognized for 5 min-utes. 
Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chair, I am very 
disturbed by the nature of this Black-burn amendment because it would pre-vent the use of Federal funds or re-sources to consider or adjudicate any new, renewal, or any previously denied application for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA, or any sub-sequently similar program. This amendment is similar to the same Blackburn bill that passed the House in August of 2014. 
This amendment clearly terminates 
the DACA program, the DREAMers, la-dies and gentlemen, my colleagues. The amendment prevents new persons from applying for DACA and explicitly prohibits further efforts to renew de-ferred action under this amendment. 
Hundreds of thousands of young peo-
ple who came forward, passed back-ground checks, obtained DACA, and have since followed the law would be deportable at the end of their 2-year deferred action period. This is serious; it is dangerous. 
The amendment is anti-immigrant 
and antifamily. This is a vote to deport DREAMers. These applicants who have applied have positive impacts on both job growth and economy. 
The amendment would leave DACA 
applicants without work authorization and would expose many of them to de-portation to a country that they don’t even know. We should be passing legis-lation to keep DACA recipients in our country because they have a net im-pact on our communities. 
The amendment is one more of the 
same anti-immigrant-type rhetoric that has dominated conservatives and is further evidence that the majority is not interested in fixing our broken im-migration system, but is only inter-ested in penalizing members of our community who seek to work, go to school, and remain with their family. 
I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, at 
this time, I yield 1 minute to the gen-tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. M
ARINO ), who is one of our Members 
who had truly a significant career as a prosecutor before coming to this Cham-ber. 
Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in 
support of the Blackburn amendment today. 
The amendment prevents funding 
from going towards the Deferred Ac-tion for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. Make no mistake about it, this program has become a magnet for drawing children from Cen-tral America, further putting thou-sands of children’s lives at risk as they embark on a very dangerous journey, which does not only include unsafe conditions, but they are also vulner-able to abuse along the way. This pro-gram must be shut down.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H380 January 14, 2015 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle are not telling the American people that Homeland Security is fully funded. As a matter of fact, it has fund-ed more than $1 billion than the Presi-dent asked for and more than $400 mil-lion from last year. 
If Homeland Security gets shut down, 
it is because the President vetoes the budget because he cannot get his way on amnesty for illegal aliens. 
Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
the balance of my time to the gen-tleman from Illinois (Mr. G
UTIE´RREZ ). 
Mr. GUTIE ´RREZ. Mr. Chairman, I 
thank Congressman C ONYERS . 
I just want to go back one moment, 
so that we can be very clear about this because I think we need to understand the difference between the rhetoric of today and the rhetoric of 1 year ago. 
This is 1 year ago: 
One of the greatest founding principles of 
our country was that children would not be punished for the mistakes of their parents. 
I didn’t write this. No one on our side 
of the aisle wrote this. I wish I would have. I am sure we would have all been proud to have been coauthors or co-sponsors of that statement. 
What happened? What happened? 
What happened to that principle? You just gave it up, it doesn’t mean any-thing to you anymore, you don’t care about children, you think children should be held responsible for the ac-tions of their parents? Because that is precisely what you are saying today, because 600,000 young people came for-ward and did exactly this. 
Then, wait a minute, it gets better 
because you said—and we were so happy because we thought we were moving forward because we thought the Republican Party was finally turn-ing a page. You said: 
It is time to provide an opportunity for 
legal residence and citizenship for those who were brought to this country as children. 
What happened? I want one of you to 
deny that this isn’t one of the prin-ciples you took into your conference last year. It is what you took. What happened 1 year later? 
Well, you know, here is what hap-
pened, I think. You guys always say the same thing: Oh, it is that K
ING 
from Iowa. He tricks us at the last sec-ond. He brings in one of these poi-sonous things, and there is nothing we can do about it. 
Well, what excuse do you have today, 
when you did it with all the premeditation and thoughtfulness and viciousness to bring this amendment forward with the support of your com-plete Conference? This is not a sur-prise. You thought this out. 
Where are you going to move the 
country forward to? 
Let me just tell you about one num-
ber—yeah, there are 600,000—it is 270, that is the electoral college. It is the number it takes to elect the President of the United States. You are out of reach there. 
The Acting CHAIR (Mrs. B
LACK ). The 
Chair would ask Members to direct their remarks to the Chair. Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Chair-
man, how much time is remaining on each side? 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman 
from Tennessee has 2 minutes remain-ing. The gentleman from Michigan’s time has expired. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Thank you, 
Madam Chairman. 
I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Let’s talk about a couple of these 
things. The Democrats like to say, Madam Chairman, that this is radical. 
Let me ask you a question, let me 
ask my colleagues a question: Is it rad-ical to support the rule of law? Is it radical to fight for American workers who are going to lose their jobs to ille-gal aliens? Is it radical to prioritize legal immigrants that are coming to this country? Is it radical to try to pro-tect children that are in this program via the Office of Refugee Resettlement? 
Democrats are over there saying that 
Republicans are playing politics with national security. Let me ask you an-other question: Why were they saying nothing this summer when the south-ern border was being overrun with all sorts of trafficking—human traf-ficking, sex trafficking, weapons traf-ficking, drug trafficking? 
Here are the facts. DACA became ef-
fective August 15, 2012. In fiscal year 2014, the Office of Refugee Resettle-ment released 53,518 unaccompanied children here in the U.S. It is a mag-net. 
Seventy-five percent of all Ameri-
cans reject the Obama executive am-nesty. Eighty percent of Americans don’t want foreign workers taking jobs from Americans. 
Those are the facts, Madam Chair-
man. 
To my colleagues, that is why we are 
here. We have two choices. We are ei-ther a Nation of laws or we are lawless. 
President Obama is turning every 
State into a border State, every town into a border town; and unfortunately, the lawless amnesty has taken Demo-crats from the party of ‘‘yes, we can’’ to acting like the party of ‘‘because we can.’’ 
With that, Madam Chairman, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Chair, I rise in 
opposition to the Blackburn Amendment to H.R. 240, the Fiscal Year 2015 Homeland Se-curity Appropriations Act. 
I oppose the amendment because it is noth-
ing more than the Republican majority’s latest partisan attack on the President and another diversionary tactic to avoid addressing the challenge posed by the nation’s broken immi-gration system. 
The President will veto the underlying bill if 
the Blackburn Amendment is adopted so I urge my colleagues to defeat this irresponsible amendment which has the potential to put the security of our homeland at risk. 
The Blackburn Amendment would prohibit 
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from using federal funds to implement enforcement guidance governing the exercise of prosecutorial discretion to ensure that scarce resources are targeted toward aliens 
who pose a danger to national security or a risk to public safety and not wasted on Dream Act children who pose no threat to our nation. 
I oppose the Blackburn Amendment be-
cause it is hypocritical, irresponsible, and mean-spirited. 
It is hypocritical because supporters of the 
amendment regularly claim that their refusal to compromise on budget issues and their sup-port for sequestration is motivated by their be-lief in the importance of setting spending prior-ities. 
Yet, the Blackburn Amendment would deny 
ICE the ability to use its limited resources in the most efficient manner to achieve its high-est priorities which are apprehend, detain, and remove aliens who pose a danger to national security or a risk to public safety. 
The Blackburn Amendment is irresponsible 
because it seeks to prevent trained, experi-enced, and professional agents and prosecu-tors from exercising their discretion and acting on the basis of what everyone knows to be true: that there is a vast difference between a terrorist bent on harming America and DREAM Act kid studying hard in school so he or she can graduate and join the Armed Services and willingly risk his or her life to defend the coun-try. 
This inefficient use of resources wastes tax-
payer dollars and does nothing to keep Amer-ica safe. 
Third, the Blackburn Amendment is mean- 
spirited because it would have ICE target its limited resources on innocent, law abiding, young people who were brought to this coun-try as children and would have them deported to a foreign land even though America is the country they know as home and the only to which they have ever pledged allegiance. 
As Member of Congress, I have traveled 
many times to Iraq and Afghanistan and al-ways the highlight of my visit was meeting the young men and women who are willingly risk-ing their lives to defend the country they love more than life. 
Right now, at this very moment, there are 
thousands of soldiers fighting for us in Afghan-istan and elsewhere who are not yet American citizens but who dream that one day they will become citizens of the nation they gladly risk their lives to defend. 
The Blackburn Amendment, however, would 
have ICE agents and prosecutors pretend to see no difference between someone like these veterans who came to this country as an un-documented immigrant and an alien engaged in or suspected of espionage or terrorism. 
The Blackburn Amendment wastes the 
money of hard-working taxpayers. 
It does nothing to make America safer. And, just as bad, it is inconsistent with 
American values of justice and fair play. 
Madam Chair, as a nation of immigrants, 
the United States has set the example for the world as to what can be achieved when peo-ple of diverse backgrounds, cultures, and ex-periences come together. 
It is now time to open the golden symbol-
ized by Lady Liberty’s lamp to the immigrant community of today so they can participate fully in the American Dream. 
Instead of passing irresponsible measures 
like the Blackburn Amendment, we should in-stead seize this historic opportunity pass legis-lation to ensure that we have in place ade-quate systems and resources to secure our

The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-peared to have it. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I de-
mand a recorded vote. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to

AMENDMENT NO . 3 OFFERED BY MR . DESANTIS  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 3 printed in part B of House Report 114–2. 
Mr. D
ESANTIS. Madam Chair, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of the bill (before the short 
title), insert the following: 
SEC. lll . (a) No funds or fees made avail-
able to the Secretary of Homeland Security by this Act or any other Act for any fiscal year may be used to implement, administer, enforce, or carry out (including through the issuance of any regulations) any policy relat-ing to the apprehension, detention, or re-moval of aliens that does not treat any alien convicted of any offense involving domestic violence, sexual abuse, child molestation, or child exploitation as within the categories of aliens subject to the Department of Home-land Security’s highest civil immigration en-forcement priorities. 
(b) The budgetary effects of this section 
shall not be entered on either PAYGO score-card maintained pursuant to section 4(d) of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010. 
(c) Notwithstanding Rule 3 of the Budget 
Scorekeeping Guidelines set forth in the joint explanatory statement of the com-mittee of conference accompanying Con-ference Report 105-217 and section 250(c)(8) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, the budgetary effects of this section shall not be estimated— 
(1) for purposes of section 251 of the such 
Act; and 
(2) for purposes of paragraph 4(C) of section 
3 of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 as being included in an appropriation Act. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 27, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. D
ESANTIS ) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Florida. 
Mr. D
ESANTIS. Madam Chair, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. R
OBY). 
Mrs. ROBY. I thank the gentleman 
for yielding. 
Madam Chair, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 240, the Homeland Security Ap-propriations Act, and to offer this 
amendment alongside my colleague, Mr. D
ESANTIS of Florida. 
If we are going to fix a broken immi-
gration law, the way to do it is to up-hold the rule of law, not undermine it. President Obama has offered amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants. That 
not only undermines the rule of law, it threatens American jobs. It is dan-gerous and irresponsible. 
I am proud to have worked alongside 
my colleagues, including Mr. A
DERHOLT  
from Alabama, to get this bill to the floor today so that we can responsibly fund the Department of Homeland Se-curity but also defund the President’s unlawful executive amnesty. 
Madam Chair, do you want a great 
example of why the President acting unilaterally to circumvent Congress is a bad idea? Well, this amendment that we offer today demonstrates that. 
Right now, illegal immigrants con-
victed of child abuse, sexual offenders, and domestic abusers, are not a top pri-ority for deportation in this country. This amendment simply makes them a priority for deportation. This is an ex-ample as to why the President circum-venting Congress is not only a bad idea, but it undermines the law. 
I ask my colleagues to not only sup-
port this very important amendment, but also to support the underlying bill that uses the power of the purse. It is Congress’ responsibility to defund the unlawful, unconstitutional acts of this President and his executive amnesty. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I claim 
the time in opposition to the amend-ment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman 
from California is recognized for 5 min-utes. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I yield 
myself 2 minutes. 
This amendment is unnecessary and 
harmful. The memorandum issued by the Department of Homeland Security already makes people convicted of these crimes ineligible for deferred ac-tion and already makes them top prior-ities for deportation. 
So, at best, this amendment is dupli-
cative, but it does something else. In the memorandum there is this proviso: 
In evaluating whether the offense is a sig-
nificant misdemeanor involving domestic vi-olence, careful consideration should be given to whether the convicted alien was also the victim of domestic violence. If so, this should be a mitigating factor. 
This amendment leaves that out. And 
so that is why so many supporters of services to domestic violence victims are opposing this amendment. That in-cludes the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the law enforcement officers group. They all oppose this amendment because they say it will make victims of domestic violence less able to seek help, less willing to call the police, and more likely to remain victims of domestic violence. 
Let me make it clear. People who are 
convicted of aggravated felonies, which includes child molestation, child por-
nography, rape, or any crime of vio-lence, are a top priority for deporta-tion. They are excluded from relief under what the President did, as are significant misdemeanors, which in-cludes convictions of domestic vio-lence. 
So this is really much simpler than it 
looks. This is trying to correct a prob-lem that does not exist, but also cre-ates a problem for domestic violence victims in the solution to a non-problem. 
Madam Chair, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. G
ENEGREEN ) 
for a unanimous consent request. 
(Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked 
and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Madam 
Chair, I rise in support of a clean Homeland Security Appropriations bill that has bipartisan support and oppose the Republican amendments. 
Madam Chair, I rise in support of passage 
of a clean Homeland Security Appropriations bill that has bipartisan support and will ensure the security of the American people and in op-position to the Republican Amendments to this legislation, most notably the Aderholt and Blackburn Amendments. 
The Aderholt Amendment would bar the use 
of any funds to expand the DACA program, which has helped thousands of young people in my district in North and East Houston and Harris County come out of the shadows and be able to go to college and get a job without fear of deportation, as well as the Administra-tion’s recently announced DAPA initiative, which would similarly help up to 5 million im-migrants who are parents and spouses of U.S. Citizens, who will be required to get right with the law and pay back taxes before receiving relief. 
The Blackburn Amendment would end the 
DACA program, deporting hundreds of thou-sands of DREAMer young people who were brought to this country as children and know no other home. 
These amendments serve as nothing more 
than poison pills that will ruin months of bipar-tisan work by the Appropriations Committee and endanger funding for the very agencies that protect our country from terrorists, drug cartels, and organized crime and harm millions of immigrants who simply want to get right with the law and a fair, transparent path to le-galization and earned citizenship. 
The whole world saw the horrific acts of ter-
rorism in Paris and France last week which re-sulted in the deaths of 17 innocent people, in-cluding 3 police officers, by 4 suspects who are believed to have connections with al Qaeda. 
In this time of heightened security concerns, 
the last thing this chamber should contemplate is another fabricated funding crisis. 
The Obama Administration has already an-
nounced its support of the bill, as introduced, and will sign this must-pass legislation into law immediately. 
I call on my colleagues to support the clean 
passage of the underlining legislation, oppose these cynical amendments, and to join me in calling for this Congress to take on com-prehensive immigration reform and fix our bro-ken immigration system once and for all.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H382 January 14, 2015 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. D ESANTIS. Madam Chair, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Vir-ginia (Mr. G
OODLATTE ), the chairman of 
the House Judiciary Committee. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding and for the work he and Mrs. R
OBYdid on this amendment. 
I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. 
Madam Chair, this amendment sim-
ply requires the Department of Home-land Security to treat any alien con-victed of any offense involving domes-tic violence, sexual abuse, child moles-tation, or child abuse or exploitation as a top priority for immigration en-forcement. Unfortunately, the current priorities created by the Obama admin-istration on November 20, 2014, treat certain aliens convicted of domestic vi-olence, convicted of sexual abuse, or convicted of exploitation as a sec-ondary priority. 
While aliens convicted of a ‘‘signifi-
cant misdemeanor,’’ such as domestic violence, sexual abuse, or exploitation, are deemed a secondary priority for re-moval, they can stay in the United States in contravention of duly en-acted law if they simply show ‘‘fac-tors’’ warranting release. 
The amendment corrects these irre-
sponsible policies of the Obama admin-istration and ensures that criminal aliens convicted of domestic violence and sexual abuse are treated as top pri-orities for removal. 
For these reasons, I urge my col-
leagues to support this amendment. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. P
ELOSI ), the Demo-
cratic leader. 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Chair, I thank 
the gentlelady for yielding and for her exceptional leadership, as well as that of the ranking member of the full com-mittee, Mr. C
ONYERS , and the work of 
your staff to bring the facts to the fore 
on this subject. 
I rise in opposition to all of these 
amendments for reasons I spelled out for half an hour last night. Not to go into them again, but I want to say how disconcerting this is after we have seen the President act with authority under the law and also according to precedent of every President, Democratic and Re-publican, since President Eisenhower. That is why it is very disturbing to see the Speaker of the House saying Presi-dent Obama has submitted his legacy of lawlessness. 
Legacy of lawlessness. Was President 
Reagan lawless? Was President George Herbert Walker Bush lawless? Was President George W. Bush lawless? I never heard him say that about any ex-ecutive actions taken by them. 
I rise in opposition to all of these 
amendments, specifically, to the DeSantis amendment. Opposition is contained in a letter from the National Catholic Conference of Bishops. On be-half of the bishops, they write to ask that we oppose immigration-related amendments in the bill. Specifically to DeSantis, they say: 
Representative DeSantis’ immigration 
amendment would prevent the Department of Homeland Security from implementing its memoranda setting civil immigration en-forcement priorities. While presented as a measure that helps domestic violence vic-tims, we fear that it actually would discour-age many such victims from reporting abuse. Immigrants face obstacles to reporting crimes that have been perpetrated against them. This amendment would perpetuate this problem. 
So I urge our colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ 
on all of the amendments, and I call to their attention the letter from the bishops urging a ‘‘no’’ vote on the amendments, which I will submit for the R
ECORD . 
COMMITTEE ON MIGRATION , 
Washington, DC, January 13, 2015. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : On behalf of the 
U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) Committee on Migration, I write to ask that you oppose immigration-related amend-ments to H.R. 240, the Fiscal Year 2015 De-partment of Homeland Security (DHS) Ap-propriations Act which are being offered by Representatives Aderholt, Blackburn, and DeSantis, respectively. I urge your opposi-tion to these amendments, which attempt to defund and block implementation of the Ad-ministration’s executive actions on immi-gration taken on November 20th to help keep immigrant families with U.S. Citizen and Legal Permanent Resident children to-gether, as well as block continued implemen-tation of the Administration’s Deferred Ac-tion for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) initia-tive. 
Representative Aderholt’s immigration 
amendment would bar the use of funds for nearly all of the Administration’s November 20th Executive Actions on Immigration and undermine numerous Department of Home-land Security (DHS) memos that outline de-portation priorities and prosecutorial discre-tion. Representative Aderholt’s amendment would place millions of hard-working immi-grant families in peril and perpetuate situa-tions of family separation. In addition, this amendment would upend existing DHS de-portation and discretion priorities and force millions of undocumented people to return to living in the shadows to avoid new draco-nian deportation priorities. Representative Aderholt’s amendment would cause immi-grant families to suffer great harm and would frustrate the existing administration of immigration laws. 
Representative Blackburn’s immigration 
amendment would effectively repeal the De-ferred Action Childhood Arrival (DACA) pro-gram by denying funds to new, previously de-nied, and renewal DACA applications. The amendment would therefore affect hundreds of thousands of hard-working ambitious im-migrant children. As you know, DACA has benefited youth who have been able to work and pursue education, thus helping them to reach their potential and contribute to our nation. Forcing these children back into the shadows and exposing them to the threat of deportation would undermine their future contributions to our nation, and treat them as criminals in the only homeland they have ever known. 
Representative DeSantis’s immigration 
amendment would prevent DHS from imple-menting its memoranda setting civil immi-gration enforcement priorities. While pre-sented as a measure that helps domestic vio-lence victims, we fear that it actually would discourage many such victims from report-ing abuse. Immigrants face obstacles to re-porting crimes that have been perpetrated against them. This amendment would per-
petuate this problem. 
In our churches and in our parishes, we see 
firsthand the devastation of family separa-tion and the family breakdown that results from such separation. For this reason, we strongly oppose these amendments and ask that you vote against them. Should any of them be agreed to, we would ask that you oppose the underlying bill. Instead, we urge you to pass just and humane immigration re-form legislation that addresses all aspects of our broken immigration system. Such legis-lation is the best solution to our currently broken system. We welcome the opportunity to work with this Congress to fix our immi-gration system through comprehensive legis-lative means. We stand ready to work with the leaders of both parties to protect poor and vulnerable people, promote human life and dignity, and advance the common good. 
Finally, we are deeply disappointed that 
the version of H.R. 240 being brought to the House floor excludes prolife language that the House has included in its draft Homeland Security appropriations bills in recent years. This provision simply maintains the long-standing ban on use of DHS funds for abor-tions, a necessary step because DHS funds are no longer covered by the abortion fund-ing ban contained in the Commerce/Justice/ Science appropriations bills. We strongly urge that this important provision be re-stored to the bill before it is taken up by the full House, or that an amendment restoring it be made in order on the House floor. 
Thank you for your consideration of our 
requests. 
Sincerely, 
M

Chairman, USCCB Committee on Migration. 
Ms. PELOSI. Again, what is dis-
turbing about this is that you may have a difference of opinion about im-migration or this or that, but don’t de-scribe the President as lawless and to use the Constitution as the basis for this debate when, in fact, the courts have upheld the rights of our Presi-dents to take executive action in rela-tionship to protecting immigrants in our country—every President, Demo-cratic and Republican, from President Eisenhower to the present. 
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on all of the 
amendments, particularly, in this case, the DeSantis amendment. 
Mr. D
ESANTIS. Madam Chair, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
The President likes to say that he 
wants to focus all of our resources on the criminals, and yet, over the last 2 years, by DHS’ own figures, this ad-ministration has released 66,000 indi-viduals who have been criminally con-victed in our country and who are ille-gally in our country. The number of crimes and the quality of crimes is stunning: some are homicides; some are rapes; some are drug trafficking. 
I think you have seen a record devel-
oped over the last several years that has put the public safety at risk, so I am perplexed why someone would op-pose this amendment. If somebody is convicted of molesting a child, maybe it doesn’t qualify under the highest pri-ority. The administration wants to dis-miss it as a significant misdemeanor. Why would we have any tolerance for child molestation? If you are not in our

country legally and you get convicted 
of an offense like that, you should be gone. 
We shouldn’t even be discussing this. 
And the fact of the matter is, as a pros-ecutor, you have to make some tough decisions. You may not be able to put a young child victim on the stand. You may have problems with evidence, and you may have to do a plea to a lesser charge because of the family’s concerns and because of what that could do to a victim. That perpetrator is no less dan-gerous to our community and to our society. 
So I think the people that are going 
to vote ‘‘no’’ on this are basically say-ing we don’t want a zero-tolerance pol-icy against child molesters and sexual offenders. I don’t care what offense it is, if you touch a child, you are here il-legally, you are gone. 
I urge people to vote in favor of this 
amendment, and I yield back the bal-ance of my time. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Maryland (Ms. E
DWARDS ). 
Ms. EDWARDS. I thank the gentle-
woman for yielding time. 
I will enter in the R ECORD a letter 
from the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence Against Women opposing the DeSantis-Roby amendment. 
NATIONAL TASKFORCE TOENDSEX-
UAL AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE  
AGAINST WOMEN , 
January 12, 2015. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE : As the Steering 
Committee of the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence (‘‘NTF’’), comprised of national leadership organiza-tions advocating on behalf of sexual and do-mestic violence victims and women’s rights, we write in opposition to the Aderholt and DeSantis amendments to the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill. These amendments are overly broad, sweep large numbers of victims into their scope and ignore the best interests of victims and their children. 
We recently celebrated the twentieth anni-
versary of the bipartisan Violence Against Women Act (‘‘VAWA’’), which has, since it was first enacted, included critical protec-tions for immigrant victims of domestic and sexual violence. The proposed amendments serve to undermine protections from re-
moval for victims of domestic and sexual vi-olence and undercut the spirit of VAWA. 
We strongly urge you to vote NO on the 
following amendments: 
DESANTIS AMENDMENT  
What it does: 
This amendment prevents ICE from imple-
menting the new detention and deportation priorities set in the November 20, 2014 Execu-tive Action memo regarding Policies for the Apprehension, Detention and Removal of Un-documented Immigrants by preventing its implementation. 
This amendment disallows funding to sup-
port implementation, administration, en-forcement, or carrying out of any policy that does not prioritize enforcement against those with domestic violence, and sexual abuse, and child abuse convictions. In par-ticular, the November 20th guidance recog-nizes that immigrant victims of domestic vi-olence may be convicted of violence them-selves, and the amendment removes DHS dis-cretion to consider the facts underlying the conviction. How it affects victims of domestic and sex-
ual violence: 
Victims of domestic violence often do not 
seek help when they know that the con-sequences to the perpetrator (for example, a spouse or parent, or perhaps other family member) may result in the perpetrator’s de-portation. This often takes place due to their financial dependence, and even close rela-tionship to the perpetrator. As a result, this amendment will discourage victims from seeking help, reducing reporting and pros-ecution of crimes, creating communities that are less safe and in which victims are more likely to endure abuse. 
Immigrant victims are vulnerable to being 
arrested and prosecuted for domestic vio-lence, even when they are not the primary perpetrator of violence in the relationship. This frequently happens due to language and cultural barriers. Often, victims are des-perate to be released and reunited with their children upon arrest and/or during trial. These factors—combined with poor legal counsel, particularly about the immigration consequences of criminal pleas and convic-tions—have in the past and will likely con-tinue to lead to deportation of wrongly ac-cused victims who may have pled to or been unfairly convicted of domestic violence charges. 
The vast majority of sexual abuse, child 
exploitation and domestic violence convic-tions already fall within the highest prior-ities for enforcement; this amendment re-moves DHS discretion to consider the needs of victims. 
ADERHOLT AMENDMENT  
What it does: 
Among other things, the amendment pre-
vents the use of funds or fees for all of the November 20, 2014 Executive Action man-dates by the president, including the renewal and continuation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program for young people who arrived in the United States as children, and hinders the ability to implement the Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA) program, which pro-vides protection for parents of U.S. citizen and Legal Permanent Resident children. These programs grant immigrants who are not priorities for removal some protection from removal. 
The amendment also prevents the use of 
‘‘funds or fees’’ to carry out prior DHS guid-ance, including ICE Director Morton’s pros-ecutorial discretion memos (2011), USCIS re-ferrals of Notices To Appear (2011), ICE re-sponse to Secure Communities Task Force (Apr. 2012), detainers (Dec. 2012), and adjust-ment of status under visa waiver program (Nov. 2013). 
The amendment prohibits any ‘‘substan-
tially similar’’ policy changes to these memos in the future. 
The amendment also prohibits the use of 
funds or fees to ‘‘grant any Federal benefit’’ to any noncitizen pursuant to any of the pol-icy changes in these memos. 
The amendment reinstates the Secure 
Communities Program. 
Impact on victims of domestic and sexual 
violence: 
This amendment increases the vulner-
ability to abuse for immigrants by increas-ing: (1) fear of deportation and (2) financial dependence on abusers. 
Eliminates DHS prosecutorial discretion 
to consider the needs of victims of domestic and sexual violence, including the trauma they have experienced, in prioritizing en-forcement activities. 
Increases victims fear of deportation as a 
consequence of reporting crimes committed against them as a result of local law enforce-ment entanglement with ICE in imple-menting the Secure Communities Program. 
As a result, many violent crimes will go un-reported. 
We strongly urge members to prioritize the 
needs of immigrant victims of domestic and sexual violence, and reject these amend-ments. These recommendations are endorsed by the Immigration subcommittee and the steering committee of the National Taskforce to End Sexual and Domestic Vio-lence, including The Asian Institute on Gen-der Based Violence, ASISTA Immigration Assistance, Casa de Esperanza: National Latin@ Network for Healthy Families and Communities, Futures Without Violence, Na-tional Immigrant Justice Center, the Na-tional Network to End Domestic Violence, and the Washington State Coalition Against Domestic Violence. 
If you have any questions, please contact 
us for further information through Grace 
Huang, Washington State Coalition Against Domestic Violence or Andrea Carcamo, Casa de Esperanza. 
Ms. EDWARDS. As the founder and 
former executive director of the Na-tional Network to End Domestic Vio-lence, I join the network of every State domestic violence coalition and the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence Against Women in opposing this amendment. 
The issue really is very simple. 
Often—too often—in cases of domestic violence, law enforcement show up at a home, they can’t figure out what hap-pened, both parties are arrested, and down the line both plead to mis-demeanor domestic violence offenses. This happens all the time all around the country. For the victim, it may be because she just wants to get it out of the way to get back to her children or she has been threatened with further violence by her abuser or with her im-migration status held over her head. 
Whatever the reason, it turns out 
that in too many of these cir-cumstances, no one—not law enforce-ment, prosecutors, judges, or even her attorney, if she is fortunate to have one—tells her that by pleading to the misdemeanor, her immigration status is threatened and she faces deporta-tion. 
So this is not about fault. It just 
means that we still have a lot of work to do when it comes to domestic vio-lence. It is why we reauthorized the Vi-olence Against Women Act in the last Congress. 
Here is the harm. This amendment 
would prevent immigration authorities from looking beneath the surface in circumstances only of domestic vio-lence offenses to make absolutely cer-tain that we are not victimizing the victim twice by subjecting her to de-portation. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on 
this dangerous amendment that could result in additional violence and undoing what successive Congresses and Presidents, Republicans and Demo-crats, have done for 20 years—afford fairness and protection for vulnerable immigrant women who are victims of domestic violence. 
And so let’s get the facts straight. 
This is not about shielding perpetra-tors. It is about protecting victims.

The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-tleman from Florida (Mr. D
ESANTIS ). 
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-peared to have it. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I de-
mand a recorded vote. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to

AMENDMENT NO . 4 OFFERED BY MR . SALMON  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 4 printed in part B of House Report 114–2. 
Mr. SALMON. Madam Chairman, I 
have an amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of the bill (before the short 
title), insert the following: 
SEC. ll. (a) The Congress finds that— 
(1) under the Patient Protection and Af-
fordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148), many individuals and businesses are required to purchase health insurance coverage for themselves and their employees; 
(2) individuals who were unlawfully present 
in the United States who have been granted deferred action under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program undertaken by the Executive Branch and who then receive work authorization are exempt from these requirements; 
(3) many United States employers hiring 
United States citizens or individuals legally present in the United States are required to either offer those persons affordable health insurance or pay a penalty of approximately $3,000 per employee per year; and 
(4) an employer does not have to provide 
insurance, or in many instances pay a pen-alty, if they hire individuals who were not lawfully present but who have been granted deferred action under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program and work au-thorization. 
(b) It is the sense of the Congress that— (1) this disparate treatment has the unac-
ceptable effect of discouraging the hiring of United States citizens and those in a lawful immigration status in the United States; and 
(2) the Executive Branch should refrain 
from pursuing policies, such as granting de-ferred action under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program and work au-thorization to unlawfully present individ-uals, that disadvantage the hiring of United States citizens and those in a lawful immi-gration status in the United States. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 27, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. S
ALMON ) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Arizona. 
Mr. SALMON. Madam Chairman, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. T
HOMPSON ), the co-
author of this amendment. Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Thank you for yielding. Thank you to the chairman, and to my colleague from Arizona, Congressman S
ALMON , 
for your work on this legislation and this amendment. 
Madam Chair, I rise in support of the 
Salmon-Thompson amendment. 
President Obama’s recent expansion 
of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, protects a large number of unlawfully present aliens from deportation. 
In addition to constitutional con-
cerns and national security implica-tions, Madam Chair, the action poses a range of unintended consequences. 
Case in point: the President’s policy 
creates an incentive to hire illegal im-migrants over lawfully present work-ers. Illegal aliens who are granted de-ferred action are exempt from being counted under the 2010 health care law’s employer mandate, which re-quires employers with 50 or more em-ployees to offer health insurance or pay a penalty. 
Essentially, the President has cre-
ated a situation where employers face a penalty for hiring Americans over il-legal aliens. 
Madam Chairman, the President’s 
current deferred action expansion pro-motes the hiring of individuals who have broken the law over the men and women who have come through legal channels, worked hard, and played by the rules. 
Congressman S
ALMON and I are proud 
to offer this commonsense amendment. The amendment merely states that it is the sense of Congress that this ad-ministration should not pursue any ac-tions that put the interests of illegal immigrants before U.S. workers. 
I encourage all my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the Salmon-Thompson amendment. 
Mr. BECERRA. Madam Chair, I rise 
in opposition to the amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from California is recognized for 5 min-utes. 
Mr. BECERRA. Madam Chair, I yield 
myself 2 minutes. 
Madam Chairman, the barbaric kill-
ing in Paris last week of 17 innocent human beings, including two police of-ficers, is a stark reminder of the high price we sometimes pay to exercise our freedoms, including our freedom of speech. 
Here in this House, we exercise that 
freedom every day on this floor, but that freedom comes with a responsi-bility. We are all entitled to our own opinions, and we can express them here, but we are not entitled to our own set of facts. 
This sense of Congress fails in that 
responsibility. First, it misappro-priates the facts, but worse, it mis-represents the facts. 
The Affordable Care Act prohibits 
the precise activity and conduct by em-ployers that this sense of Congress says it is trying to prohibit. In fact, the Af-fordable Care Act has explicit lan-guage, and I will, for the R
ECORD , sub-
mit 29 U.S. Code, section 218(c), protec-tions for employees, which specifically prohibits an employer from discrimi-nating against an American citizen who works for that employer for the purposes of hiring someone who doesn’t have a right to work and, therefore, will not get insurance. 
So the worst part of this sense of 
Congress is that it tries to mislead the American people to think something is going on that isn’t. And if it is going on then, in the time that the gen-tleman has to push his amendment, I would urge him to name a name of an employer who is doing this to an Amer-ican citizen who should be allowed to work. 
29 U.S. CODE §218C—PROTECTIONS FOR  
EMPLOYEES  
(a) Prohibition 
No employer shall discharge or in any 
manner discriminate against any employee with respect to his or her compensation, terms, conditions, or other privileges of em-ployment because the employee (or an indi-vidual acting at the request of the employee) has— 
(1) received a credit under section 36B of 
title 26 or a subsidy under section 18071 of title 42; 
(2) provided, caused to be provided, or is 
about to provide or cause to be provided to the employer, the Federal Government, or the attorney general of a State information relating to any violation of, or any act or omission the employee reasonably believes to be a violation of, any provision of this title (or an amendment made by this title); 
(3) testified or is about to testify in a pro-
ceeding concerning such violation; 
(4) assisted or participated, or is about to 
assist or participate, in such a proceeding; or 
(5) objected to, or refused to participate in, 
any activity, policy, practice, or assigned task that the employee (or other such per-son) reasonably believed to be in violation of any provision of this title (or amendment), or any order, rule, regulation, standard, or ban under this title (or amendment). 
(b) Complaint procedure (1) In general An employee who believes that he or she 
has been discharged or otherwise discrimi-nated against by any employer in violation of this section may seek relief in accordance with the procedures, notifications, burdens of proof, remedies, and statutes of limitation set forth in section 2087(b) of title 15. 
(2) No limitation on rights Nothing in this section shall be deemed to 
diminish the rights, privileges, or remedies of any employee under any Federal or State law or under any collective bargaining agreement. The rights and remedies in this section may not be waived by any agree-ment, policy, form, or condition of employ-ment. 
Mr. BECERRA. Madam Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SALMON. Madam Chair, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. G
OODLATTE ), chairman of the full 
Committee on the Judiciary. 
Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Chairman, 
I urge my colleagues to support this amendment by Representatives S
ALM-
ONand T HOMPSON . 
The amendment expresses the sense 
of Congress that U.S. workers should not be harmed by President Obama’s unilateral executive action programs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H385 January 14, 2015 
These programs absurdly give Amer-
ican employers a financial incentive to hire unlawful aliens over American citizens and legal immigrants. 
The fact is, in many cases, a business 
now has a $3,000 incentive to hire an unlawful immigrant who benefited from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. This is because, under ObamaCare, many businesses face a $3,000 per employee penalty if they do not provide health insurance to their workers. 
However, unlawful immigrants grant-
ed DACA relief and, most likely, those benefiting from President Obama’s new deferred action program are not eligi-ble for ObamaCare. Thus, in many cases, employers will not have to pay this penalty if they hire deferred ac-tion recipients rather than legal work-ers. 
It is simply indefensible public policy 
for the Obama administration to give unlawful aliens a leg up over legal workers. Yet, that is the result of the President’s unilateral actions. I urge my colleagues to support this good amendment. 
Mr. BECERRA. Madam Chair, I yield 
1
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. P ASCRELL ), who is on the 
Ways and Means Committee. 
Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Chair, I just 
want to report to the other side that you are already on retreat. As a party, you have retreated from our solemn oaths, camouflaged by pious, empty, pyrrhic acclamations of patriotism and liberty. 
These are not stick people you are 
talking about. These are real people. They are not despots. They are not moneychangers. They are not felons. They are human equals to you and me. 
You have a bumper sticker mentality 
without the bumper. 
For years and years, all we heard is 
‘‘read the bill.’’ Well, we have read the bill and, in fact, I helped write the ACA. I am proud of that. 
There is nothing in the ACA or the 
President’s executive order that treats people who have temporary status under DACA differently than U.S. citi-zens for the purposes of triggering the employer mandate. 
The whole purpose of this amend-
ment is to play into fears that, by al-lowing immigrants to come out of the shadows and work legally and pay taxes, you are undermining American workers. That is a lie. Admit it. 
Nothing in this ACA incentivizes em-
ployers to hire undocumented immi-grants over American citizens. In fact, just the opposite, as you heard the speaker before me. Specifically, it pro-hibits employers from firing a citizen employee because they receive a pre-mium tax credit. Read the bill. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle are simply trying to obscure what the President did here with this executive order: provide responsible so-lutions to prevent families from being torn apart even further. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this 
amendment—and have a nice retreat. Mr. SALMON. Madam Chairman, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-sume. 
Madam Chairman, they say sunlight 
is the best disinfectant. We are trying to shed a little sunlight on some of the problems with the President’s uncon-stitutional and illegal executive order of last year. 
I am incredulous that the leader of 
the opposition has now encouraged the Members of the opposition to vote, en bloc, against all these commonsense amendments defending the American worker, protecting the American work-er, cracking down on the molesters and sex offenders, and making sure that they don’t have a haven here in Amer-ica, and making sure that those who want legal immigration are the first and foremost that we consider in this process, and that those who cheated the system have to get behind those folks that are doing it legally before their paperwork can be processed. 
It is incredulous that the other side 
would oppose such commonsense meas-ures that I believe most of America is crying for. People are hurting out there. Maybe they haven’t gotten the memo, but I think most of us have. 
The other thing that is incredulous is 
that when you hear a lot of squealing, you know when you have hit a raw nerve; you know there is some truth to what is being spoken. 
This amendment is simply a sense of 
Congress that we don’t give a $3,000 benefit to those who have cheated the system, that we don’t give a $3,000 ad-vantage to them over hardworking, tax-paying American citizens who have been out of work for quite some time. 
As we know, President Obama re-
cently issued a series of memos that would essentially grant legal status to millions of people residing illegally within the borders of the United States. Unfortunately, this is not the first time that such action has been taken by this administration, and his-tory has a habit of repeating itself. 
Under Deferred Action for Childhood 
Arrivals, DACA, up to 1.7 million indi-viduals were granted legal status and were allowed to cut in line, being given preferential treatment over those who respected our laws and waited pa-tiently for their immigration cases to be processed. 
Furthermore, while these individuals 
who were given legal status under DACA were initially required to pur-chase health insurance under ObamaCare, they were later exempted from that requirement. With this ex-emption, those given legal status under DACA are not required to purchase in-surance. 
We just don’t want that to happen 
again, and I would urge the other side to stand up for the American worker. That is why we are here. 
Madam Chairman, I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Chair will re-
mind Members to refrain from im-proper references to the President. Mr. BECERRA. Madam Chair, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. C
ROWLEY ), vice chairman of 
the House Democratic Caucus. 
Mr. CROWLEY. Madam Chair, I 
think my Republican colleagues take the American people for fools. 
Madam Chair, I lost too many con-
stituents and friends on 9/11. I lost peo-ple who I loved on 9/11. And in the years since then, New York City has been the focus of attempted terror plots too numerous to name. 
Homeland Security funding is some-
thing that I take very seriously be-cause it is so much a part of a New Yorker’s life. And frankly, I would ex-pect my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to take it as seriously as well. 
But this is not a serious effort by any 
stretch of the imagination. You know what’s good for our national security? 
Bringing people out of the shadows so 
that we know who is in our country, fo-cusing our limited enforcement re-sources on true threats to our country and not holding up needed funding for security and law enforcement programs to make a political point. 
It is a political point they are trying 
to make. If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle genuinely think our immigration system should deport par-ents instead of true criminals, if you want to destroy all our economic gains and throw a sucker punch to our econ-omy by deporting 11 million people, then you know what? Bring a bill up on the floor, and let’s have a real debate on all those issues. 
Don’t walk in here and tell me and 
the American people that this garbage belongs in the Homeland Security funding bill. Don’t tell the American 
people that. They are not suckers and they are not fools. They know what you are doing. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Chair would 
ask Members to address their remarks to the Chair. 
Mr. BECERRA. Madam Chairman, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
I asked if the proponents would name 
the name of an American who has been discriminated against, the name of an employer who has discriminated against an American worker. They gave none. This is all anecdotal. These are all stories. They don’t have any-thing to do with the fact that we need to pass the Homeland Security bill be-cause we are jeopardizing the funding for our security. 
Are people tone-deaf to what hap-
pened in Paris that they would do these types of amendments at a time when we need to support our men and women who protect us through Home-land Security? 
This is wrong, and that is why we op-
pose this senseless sense of Congress amendment. 
Madam Chairman, I yield back the 
balance of my time.

AMENDMENT NO . 5 OFFERED BY MR . SCHOCK

Mr. SCHOCK. Madam Chair, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of the bill (before the short 
title), insert the following: 
SEC. lll . It is the sense of the Congress 
that the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Im-migration Services (USCIS) should— 
(1) stop putting the interests of aliens who 
are unlawfully present in the United States ahead of the interests of aliens who are fol-lowing proper immigration laws and proce-dures by adjudicating petitions and applica-tions for immigration benefits submitted by aliens unlawfully present in the United States. When USCIS adjudicators and re-sources are used to adjudicate petitions and applications for aliens who are unlawfully present, the time it takes to process peti-tions and applications submitted by other aliens is significantly increased and a back-log is created. In addition, it is unfair to use the fees paid by other aliens to cover the costs of adjudicating petitions and applica-tions for aliens unlawfully present in the United States; and 
(2) use the funds available under existing 
law to improve services and increase the effi-ciency of the immigration benefits applica-tion process for aliens abroad or who are lawfully present in the United States. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 27, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. S
CHOCK ) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Illinois. 
Mr. SCHOCK. Madam Chair, there 
are currently 4.4 million people ready to enter this country through legal channels. Many of them have been waiting for years. They have saved their money. They have filled out all of the proper forms. They have paid their fees. 
This amendment is about doing right 
by them and their families. It is about making sure the men and women who play by the rules receive the fair treat-ment that they were promised. 
Congress must send a clear message 
to the administration and the Amer-ican people that we are committed to fixing what is broken about our immi-gration system but not at the expense of law-abiding immigrants. 
In recent weeks, I have worked with 
The Heritage Foundation to identify seven failing programs at the USCIS that are in most need of improvement. One of the most egregious examples is of the $792 million that the USCIS spent between 2008 and 2012 to create an online system for applicants to file forms and pay fees. After $700 million 
spent and 4 years of time, only two forms out of 100 and one out of 73 dif-ferent fees can be processed online. 
The administration’s repeated inabil-
ity to build a Web site that works— well-documented as it is by now—is compounded by its eagerness to bypass the Constitution and break the law. 
Had the President wished to show 
real leadership on immigration reform, he could have used his executive au-thority to promote greater efficiency and cost-saving measures within the system. Had he done so, I suspect there would have been overwhelming support in this Congress, but, regrettably, that is not the course he chose, and it is why this Congress must act. 
We have a responsibility to American 
taxpayers and to millions of immi-grants to establish spending priorities at the USCIS, and eliminating wasteful spending in the immigration system is an important component of our respon-sibility and is a first great step in achieving comprehensive reform. En-suring that the fees paid by lawful ap-plicants are not used to fast-track those who break the law strikes at the heart of our oath of office. 
During my time in Congress, the 18th 
District of Illinois has welcomed more than 2,600 new citizens, many of whom have faced a long road to get here, but there are still thousands more who are waiting. It is not because their paper-work isn’t in order, not because they have something in their records, and not because of anything other than there being a broken system. 
Take Charles from Peoria. He has 
been trying to get his fiancee to join him here in the United States since January of 2012. For more than 2 years, Charles has waited. He has struggled with the financial support require-ments. He has been unable to travel to see her. He had his application post-poned time and time again. Why? Be-cause Charles is a quadriplegic on dis-ability. 
Take Danny from Jacksonville, Illi-
nois. He works two shifts at a meatpacking facility. He applied and paid for his green card on October 4 of 2013. His green card was mailed to the wrong address, even though it was properly done on his paperwork, and it was in order. 
Danny lost his job because he 
couldn’t show his green card to his em-ployer. After many months of lost wages, the USCIS admitted to my of-fice and to Danny that they screwed up and made a mistake. Now, more than a year later, Danny finally received his green card, and he went back to work, but not before our broken system cost him a year’s worth of wages. 
Madam Chair, these stories could be 
repeated hundreds of time in my con-gressional office alone—tens of thou-sands of times across this body in Re-publican and Democrat districts alike. The system is failing our constituents, their families, and their loved ones. It is failing businesses in our districts. It is failing daycare facilities and major 
manufacturers. 
Yes, Mr. President, the system is bro-
ken, but the way to fix a broken sys-tem is not to overload the system by fast-tracking 5 million more people. 
Madam Chair, it is as if these hard-
working taxpayers—these hardworking people—are sitting at a toll booth. 
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Will the gen-
tleman yield? 
Mr. SCHOCK. Madam Chair, how 
much time is remaining? 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from Illinois has 15 seconds remaining. 
Mr. SCHOCK. I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I claim 
the time in opposition. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman 
from California is recognized for 5 min-utes. 
Ms. LOFGREN. I yield myself 2 min-
utes. 
Madam Chair, this amendment is pre-
mised on a mistake in the under-standing of how USCIS actually works. Here is a fact that some people may not know: the USCIS is funded not by the taxpayers, it is funded by the fees of the applicants. 
The amendment seems to assume 
that, if you are out of status, somehow, somebody else is paying for you—the taxpayers or some other applicant. That is not the case. Each applicant pays enough money to cover the cost of processing his own fee, and it does not delay others. 
What this amendment would do 
would not just deal with DACA appli-cants; it would impact people whom I don’t think we want to delay in terms of the processing of their petitions. For example, people who are victims of tor-ture can come to the United States and make a case—a plea—for political asy-lum. They file petitions to do that. This amendment would say that their petitions can’t be heard. 
There are people who are victims of 
domestic violence. We created a visa category that allows domestic violence victims to petition so that they can be free to leave their abusers. Those peti-tions could not be heard in a timely manner. 
Victims of sex trafficking are eligible 
for a T visa. That is something we cre-ated in law. According to this amend-ment, people who apply—sex traf-ficking victims—would not be eligible to have their petitions processed in a timely manner. 
Here is something else: most of the 
petitions that are adjudicated are fam-ily-based. If you have your American citizen daughter marry somebody from another country, she can petition so that her husband can become a legal resident of the United States. If that husband is out of status, that petition would not be petitioned. 
I don’t think we want to do what this 
amendment suggests we should do. 
I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SCHOCK. Madam Chair, I reserve 
the balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H387 January 14, 2015 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I yield 
for a unanimous consent request to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. C
AROLYN B. M ALONEY ). 
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of 
New York asked and was given permis-sion to revise and extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Chair, I am in opposition to this amendment and to others who play politics with the security and safety of America. 
Madam Chair, this bill plays politics with the 
security and safety of America while holding up vital investments that will create jobs. 
The House GOP refused to take action on 
immigration reform last year, and now they’re trying to make up for that mistake by attaching poison pill amendments to the bill that funds homeland security. 
They accuse the President of being lawless, 
but they know the real problem is their own failure to offer constructive solutions to fix our immigration system. 
We should be debating comprehensive im-
migration reform, not hosting a politically moti-vated charade that will harm our ability to deter, detect, and defend from a terrorist at-tack. 
This could not be more poorly timed. Last week our strong ally, France, was at-
tacked and terrorized. People died. 
I am deeply concerned about the impact this 
delayed funding may have on my own con-gressional district. 
New York City continues to remain a high 
risk area and the City relies on the federal funds it receives to protect critical infrastruc-ture, sustain anti-terrorism programs, and en-hance emergency preparedness and re-sponse. 
These not only protect our people but they 
put people to work. 
On behalf of New Yorkers I plead with my 
colleagues to stop holding hostage this criti-cally important funding. 
The inclusion of these dangerous amend-
ments poisons the bill and threatens our cru-cial homeland security needs and hurts our economy. 
We must reject these amendments and 
pass a clean Homeland Security funding bill. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I yield 
1
1⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. J ACKSON LEE), my colleague 
and compatriot on the Judiciary Com-mittee. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gen-
tlewoman for her leadership and the ranking member for his leadership. 
Madam Chair, this is a full force as-
sault on immigrants. It is an assault on the integrity of this Nation which was built upon the investment and the love of this country by immigrants from all over the world. 
As I look to the landscape of what we 
now confront—2,000 dead in Nigeria by Boko Haram, little girls dressed with suicide bombs, and Homeland Security being held hostage by an assault on im-migration—let me say to you that the Constitution has given the President the authority under the ‘‘take care’’ provision, so this assault of amend-ments that is trying to chip away at these executive actions is a false premise in order to attack the ideas and the values of this Nation. In my own State, if the actions of the 
President’s are in place, we will gain $8.2 billion in gross domestic product and $19.2 billion over 10 years, a decade. Do you think we need the underlying amendment or amendments? Pastors and religious leaders—the Episcopal bishops—have indicated that they sup-port the executive actions. The Catho-lic bishops support the executive ac-tions. 
The Aderholt amendment wants to 
attack those young DREAMers who want to invest and young soldiers. The Blackburn amendment wants to take away, if you will, the childhood arriv-als. 
Mr. D
ESANTIS wants to misrepresent 
to victims of human trafficking and domestic violence. Mr. S
ALMON , in his 
amendment, wants to suggest that workers are being hired over American workers; then Mr. S
CHOCK wants to ig-
nore the investment of this particular language into this Nation. 
Let me end by saying this is an at-
tack on immigrants. Let’s oppose all of these. 
Mr. SCHOCK. Madam Chair, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I be-
lieve I have the right to close, so I re-serve the balance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from Illinois has the right to close. The gentleman has 15 seconds remaining. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Chair, I yield 
the balance of my time to the gen-tleman from Michigan (Mr. C
ONYERS ), 
the ranking member of our full com-mittee. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from Michigan is recognized for 1
1⁄2 
minutes. 
Mr. CONYERS. Madam Chair and 
members of the committee, I oppose the Schock amendment for many of the numerous reasons that have already been stated by our colleagues, but I want to make sure that we are all per-fectly clear on what is occurring on the House floor today. 
The majority is, unfortunately, play-
ing politics with the lives, safety, and security of the American people. The ideologues are holding funding hostage for the Homeland Security Department here today. That is not right. They would rather deport DREAMers—the kids and their parents—rather than fund the Department of Homeland Se-curity. 
In the wake of the recent Paris trag-
edy, we need to remain vigilant with smart enforcement policies that pro-tect Americans. The Department of Homeland Security plays a central role in our fight against terror, and we must fully fund the efforts as soon as possible. We should not be attaching poison pill amendments to this impor-tant legislation. 
I urge all of my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle to really join us and govern with a sense of far more re-sponsibility. 
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the 
gentleman has expired. The gentleman from Illinois is recog-
nized for 15 seconds. 
Mr. SCHOCK. Madam Chair, I yield 
the balance of my time to the distin-guished gentleman from Ohio (Mr. B
OEHNER ), my friend. 
Mr. BOEHNER. Let me thank my 
colleague for yielding, and let me thank all of my colleagues who have worked to put this bill together. 
Madam Chair, today, I rise—and the 
House rises—to support and defend our Constitution. We do not take this ac-tion lightly; but, simply, there is no al-ternative. This is not a dispute be-tween the parties or even between the branches of our government. 
This executive overreach is an af-
front to the rule of law and to the Con-stitution itself. I appreciate all of the efforts of those working to fix our bro-ken immigration system, especially since I am one of them. 
What we are dealing with is a Presi-
dent who has ignored the people, who has ignored the Constitution, and even his own past statements. In fact, on at least 22 occasions, he said he did not have the authority to do what he has done. 
Before he became President, on 
March 31, 2008, the President said: ‘‘I take the Constitution very seriously. The biggest problems that we’re facing right now have to do with the Presi-dent trying to . . . not go through Con-gress at all, and that’s what I intend to reverse when I’m President.’’ 
On May 19, 2008, the President said, 
‘‘I believe in the Constitution, and I will obey the Constitution of the United States.’’ 
After he was President, on May 5, 
2010, the President said, ‘‘Anybody who tells you . . . that I can wave a magic wand and make it happen hasn’t been paying attention to how this town works.’’ 
b1045 
On July 1, 2010, the President said: 
‘‘There are those . . . who have argued passionately that we should . . . at least ignore the laws on the books . . . I believe such an indiscriminate ap-proach would be both unwise and un-fair.’’ 
On October 14, 2010, the President 
said: ‘‘I do have an obligation to make sure that I am following some of the rules. I can’t simply ignore laws that are out there.’’ 
On October 25, 2010, the President 
said: ‘‘I am President. I am not king. I can’t do these things just by myself. . . . I can’t just make the laws up by myself.’’ 
On March 28, 2011, the President said: 
‘‘America is a nation of laws, which means I, as the President, am obligated to enforce the law.’’ 
On April 20, 2011, the President said: 
‘‘I can’t solve this problem by myself. . . . I can’t do it by myself.’’ 
On April 29, 2011, the President said: 
‘‘Some here wish that I could just by-pass Congress and change the law my-self. But that’s not how democracy works.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H388 January 14, 2015 
On May 10, 2011, the President said: 
‘‘They wish I could just bypass Con-gress and change the law myself. But that’s not how a democracy works.’’ 
On July 25, 2011, the President said: 
‘‘The idea of doing things on my own is very tempting. . . . But that’s not how our system works. That’s not how our democracy functions. That’s not how our Constitution is written.’’ 
On September 28, 2011, the President 
said: ‘‘We live in a democracy. You have to pass bills through the legisla-ture, and then I can sign it.’’ 
On September 20, 2012, the President 
said: ‘‘What I’ve always said is, as the head of the executive branch, there’s a limit to what I can do.’’ 
On October 16, 2012, the President 
said: ‘‘We’re . . . a nation of laws ....  
And I’ve done everything that I can on my own.’’ 
On January 30, 2013, the President 
said: ‘‘I’m not a king. I am the head of the executive branch of government. I’m required to follow the law.’’ 
On January 30, 2013, the President 
also said: ‘‘I’m not a king. You know, my job as the head of the executive 
branch ultimately is to carry out the law.’’ 
On February 14, 2013, the President 
said: ‘‘The problem is that I’m the President of the United States. I’m not the emperor of the United States.’’ 
On July 16, 2013, the President said: 
‘‘I think that it is very important for us to recognize that the way to solve this problem has to be legislative.’’ 
On September 17, 2013, the President 
said: ‘‘My job in the executive branch is supposed to be to carry out the laws that are passed. . . . But if we start broadening that, then essentially I would be ignoring the law.’’ 
On November 25, 2013, the President 
said: ‘‘The easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do some-thing by violating our laws. . . . That’s not our tradition.’’ 
On March 6, 2014, the President said: 
‘‘And I cannot ignore those laws any more than I could ignore . . . any of the other laws that are on the books.’’ 
And on August 6, 2014, the President 
said: ‘‘I’m bound by the Constitution; I’m bound by separation of powers.’’ 
To think that the President of the 
United States actually studied con-stitutional law is one thing. But he didn’t just learn constitutional law, he taught it as well. But now his actions suggest that he has forgotten what these words even mean. 
Enough is enough. By their votes last 
November, the people made clear that they wanted more accountability from this President; and by our votes here today, we will heed their will, and we will keep our oath to protect and de-fend the Constitution of the United States of America. 
Mr. SCHOCK. I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

So the amendment was agreed to. 
The result of the vote was announced 
as above recorded. 
The Acting CHAIR. There being no 
further amendments, under the rule, the Committee rises. 
Accordingly, the Committee rose; 
and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms. F
OXX) having assumed the chair, Mrs. 
BLACK , Acting Chair of the Committee 
of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 240) making appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015, and for other purposes, and, pur-suant to House Resolution 27, she re-ported the bill back to the House with sundry further amendments adopted in the Committee of the Whole. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the rule, the previous question is or-dered. 
Is a separate vote demanded on any 
further amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the Chair will put them en gros. 
The amendments were agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the third time. 
MOTION TO RECOMMIT  
Mr. ISRAEL. Madam Speaker, I have 
a motion to recommit at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the 
gentleman opposed to the bill? 
Mr. ISRAEL. I am in its current 
form. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion to recom-mit. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Israel moves to recommit the bill H.R. 
240 to the Committee on Appropriations with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amend-ment: 
Page 2, line 10, strike the dollar amount 
and insert ‘‘$129,573,000’’.

short title. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ISRAEL. Madam Speaker, this is 
the final amendment to the bill. It will not kill the bill or send it back to com-mittee. If adopted, the bill will imme-diately proceed to final passage, as amended.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H392 January 14, 2015 
that we must be vigilant and every day 
we must be prepared. Madam Speaker, I represent Long Island, New York. Hundreds of my constituents were killed on 9/11. Almost every day, an-other recovery worker from Ground Zero is losing his or her life all these years later. 
On that day, on 9/11, those of us who 
were in this body, as the sun set over Washington, we took to the steps. We held hands and we sang ‘‘God Bless America.’’ We committed ourselves to working together to strengthen our homeland security, not as Republicans, not as Democrats, but as Members of Congress whose constituents expect us to keep them safe—whose constituents expect us to put aside whatever dis-agreements we have on whatever other issues there may be and at least agree on their fundamental right to be safe. That is the expectation. 
And now, Madam Speaker, we have a 
bill that should not be controversial, that should fund our homeland secu-rity, but it has been turned into a divi-sive political strategy on immigration. 
b1145 
Madam Speaker, let’s face it. This 
bill is not about homeland security; this bill is about Republican political security. It is an injustice to those who suffered on 9/11 and still remember that. 
Members are entitled to whatever 
view they may have on the President’s executive order. They are entitled to whatever view they may have on immi-gration. They are entitled to votes on those issues. 
But to force those views on a bill 
that funds grants to first responders, that helps those first responders hire additional personnel and purchase pro-tective equipment, that assists our State and local governments in pre-venting and responding to terrorist at-tacks and other disasters, that secures essential cyber networks, that simply puts ugly politics ahead of the safety of the American people. 
This bill goes too far. For the first 
time in history, they are holding our security hostage to the politics of im-migration. 
My motion gives every Member here 
a fundamental choice. It allows you to pursue whatever agenda you may have on immigration without undermining our homeland security. It would ensure passage of a clean Homeland Security bill, with an additional $3 million for fusion centers. 
Madam Speaker, this is The 9/11 Com-
mission Report, the report that every Member of Congress said that we would heed and pay attention to, that we would not allow politics to be injected into. This report calls for fusion cen-ters, which are located in every State, to gather, receive, analyze, and share threat information among Federal, State, and tribal law enforcement and other public safety partners. 
Unity of effort and information shar-
ing, this report says, is a key necessity in protecting our homeland; and our fu-
sion center networks are critical in our response to that recommendation. 
This motion to recommit makes a 
further investment in these fusion cen-ters, so that we don’t have a repeat of what happened in France a week ago. 
This is the choice, Madam Speaker. 
It is clear, and it is stark. You can vote ‘‘yes’’ on this motion to recommit and strengthen fusion centers, or you can vote ‘‘no’’ and have weakened them. How will you explain your vote ‘‘no’’ if a disaster occurs? 
You can vote ‘‘yes’’ and stand for full 
and immediate funding of DHS without Washington politics, or you can vote ‘‘no’’ and tell your constituents that being against immigration is more im-portant to you than being for their homeland security. How will you ex-plain that ‘‘no’’ vote to them if dis-
aster occurs again? 
Republicans are saying that anti-im-
migration riders on this bill are part of a political compromise. Madam Speak-er, we all understand compromise, we all support compromise, but homeland security is the last thing in this body that should be subject to a political compromise—not after the attacks on France, not after 9/11 when we pledged to keep the American people safe, not after we stood on the steps of this building committing ourselves to bi-partisan cooperation and to do the right thing for our homeland security. 
Do the right thing, my colleagues, 
and vote for this motion to recommit and take the politics, the ugly politics, out of keeping the American people safe. 
I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to the mo-tion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, may I remind my colleague from New York that we put $300 mil-lion in those fusion centers in the bill. 
At this time, because this is clearly 
primarily about the amendments that are on this bill, I yield to the gen-tleman from South Carolina (Mr. G
OWDY ). 
Mr. GOWDY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank his honor. 
President Obama announced one of 
the largest extraconstitutional power grabs ever by a Chief Executive. He de-clared unilaterally that almost 5 mil-lion undocumented aliens will receive deferred action under some newfangled definition of ‘‘prosecutorial discre-tion,’’ Madam Speaker. 
Not only that, not only escaping con-
sequences, he has decided to bestow benefits such as work authorization and immigration benefits—this, Madam Speaker, despite the fact that the very same President over 20 dif-ferent times said he lacked the power to do what he just did, and he repeat-edly said he is not a king. 
Now, Madam Speaker, his position 
may have changed after the election, I hasten to add, but the Constitution has 
not. That document is clear, time-test-ed, and true, and it says that this body passes laws, and it is the responsibility of the Chief Executive, Madam Speak-er, to make sure that those laws are faithfully enforced. 
If this President’s unilateral 
extraconstitutional acts are not stopped, Madam Speaker, future Presi-dents will no doubt expand that power of the executive branch and threaten the constitutional equilibrium. 
But, Madam Speaker, this is not a 
fight between Republicans and Demo-crats; it is not even a fight over immi-gration reform. This is a fight over whether this branch of government will ever find the courage to stand up for itself. 
The same document, the same docu-
ment that this and all Presidents swear to defend, gives this body certain tools, tools like the power of the purse. It is about damn time we used that tool. 
I would ask you to oppose this mo-
tion to recommit and support the un-derlying bill. 
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend from the Judiciary Committee. 
I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the previous question is or-dered on the motion to recommit. 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion to recommit. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. 
Mr. ISRAEL. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 5- minute vote on the motion to recom-mit will be followed by a 5-minute vote on the passage of the bill. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 184, nays 244, not voting 5, as follows:

So the bill was passed. 
The result of the vote was announced

f 
PROMOTING JOB CREATION AND 
REDUCING SMALL BUSINESS BURDENS ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, further consideration of the bill (H.R. 37) to make technical corrections to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, to enhance the ability of small and emerging growth companies to access capital through public and private markets, to reduce regulatory burdens, and for other purposes, will now resume. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
MOTION TO RECOMMIT  
Mr. MOULTON. Madam Speaker, I 
have a motion to recommit at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the 
gentleman opposed to the bill? 
Mr. MOULTON. I am opposed in its 
current form. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion to recom-mit. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Moulton moves to recommit the bill 
H.R. 37 to the Committee on Financial Serv-ices with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith, with the fol-lowing amendment: 
Page 3, before line 1, insert the following: 
SEC. 3. BAD ACTOR DISQUALIFICATIONS. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—A person may not make 
use of the regulatory exemptions under this Act if such person— 
(1) has been convicted of providing assist-
ance, either directly or indirectly, to a ter-rorist organization or a state sponsor of ter-rorism; 
(2) has been made subject to any judicial or 
administrative decree or order arising out of a governmental action that determined that the person provided assistance, either di-rectly or indirectly, to a terrorist organiza-tion or a state sponsor of terrorism; or 
(3) is affiliated with another person who 
has been convicted of providing assistance described under paragraph (1) or who has been the subject of a decree or order de-scribed under paragraph (2). 
(b) R
EGULATORY EXEMPTIONS UNDER THIS 
ACTDEFINED .—For purposes of this section, 
the term ‘‘regulatory exemptions under this Act’’ means the following: 
(1) The exemptions provided under section 
4(s)(e)(4) of the Commodity Exchange Act and section 15F(e)(4) of the Securities Ex-change Act of 1934, as added by title I. 
(2) The exceptions for affiliates provided

(3) The registration threshold for savings

Page 30, line 2, insert after the period the

providing assistance, either directly or indi-rectly, to terrorist organizations or state sponsors of terrorism; or 
(2) a judicial or administrative decree or 
order arising out of a governmental action, including a decree or order that determined that the person provided assistance, either directly or indirectly, to terrorist organiza-tions or state sponsors of terrorism. 
Mr. HENSARLING (during the read-
ing). Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Texas? 
There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Massachusetts is recognized for 5 min-utes in support of his motion. 
Mr. MOULTON. Madam Speaker, this 
is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final pas-sage as amended. 
From Paris to Boston, New York to 
London, we have seen in recent weeks and years that the threat of terrorism in our world remains constant. All Americans must remain vigilant, and this Congress must do everything in its power to prevent another terrorist at-tack. 
History shows that leveraging Amer-
ica’s economic strength is one of our Nation’s best tools to combat the scourge of terrorism. We have forced rogue regimes like Iran to the negoti-ating table with strong economic sanc-tions. We have punished bad actors in Russia and North Korea by cutting off their access to global financial mar-kets. And we ought to ensure that no one convicted of aiding and abetting terrorists, or state sponsors of terror, can take advantage of our financial system. 
That is what my amendment does. It 
simply makes clear that no one who has been convicted of providing assist-ance, either directly or indirectly, to a terrorist organization or a state spon-sor of terrorism can make use of the exemptions in the underlying bill. 
The bill before us today is complex. 
It is a complex piece of legislation that includes measures that previously passed this House with large bipartisan support as well as other more con-troversial provisions. 
The American people did not send us 
to Congress to find areas where we dis-agree. Our constituents sent us to Con-
gress to get things done for all Ameri-cans. We could have moved forward today with a legislative package that includes commonsense reforms that protect consumers and create the con-ditions for economic growth. Reason-able people may disagree on the merits of this bill, but we should all be able to agree that those who support terrorists and state sponsors of terrorism should never use our financial system to their benefit. My amendment prevents this from happening. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the motion to 
recommit, and I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Speaker, 
I rise in opposition to the motion to re-commit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HENSARLING. Madam Speaker, 
I listened carefully to the motion to re-commit. I suppose I have some good news for the gentleman who offered it, and that is there are numerous bad actor provisions already within our Federal securities law. So, with the possible exception of the unconstitu-tional power grab of our President in granting amnesty and possibly allow-ing new bad actors to enter our coun-try, I think that the motion to recom-mit is probably largely irrelevant. 
Let’s get down to the substance of 
the matter, and that is, Madam Speak-er, here is an idea that is worthy of the American people. That idea is: Why don’t we work on a bipartisan basis to promote job creation and reduce small business burdens? 
That is exactly what H.R. 37 does. We 
all know it is a rollup of 11 simple, modest bills, all of which have passed this body with huge, huge bipartisan support. H.R. 634 passed 411–12; H.R. 5471 passed by voice vote; H.R. 801 passed 417–4; H.R. 2274, 422–0, Madam Speaker. 
So this passed in the last Congress. 
Unfortunately, Senator R
EID didn’t 
take it up. Maybe one of the reasons that his party lost the last election is because of the obstruction that the former Senate majority leader imposed on the American people. 
Last week, it came within a dozen 
votes of passing. It would have passed, Madam Speaker, but so many of my friends on the other side of the aisle apparently were for it before they were against it, and they changed their vote. So why the change of heart? Madam Speaker, there was a change of heart because the left hand doesn’t know what the far left hand is doing. 
Three of these bills represent very 
modest clarifications or modifications of the 2,000-page Dodd-Frank Act. And to the ultraleft, the ultraliberal friends, Dodd-Frank is no longer pol-icy. It is no longer philosophy. It is an article of religious faith. It is sacred text. It was chiseled in stone. It came down from Mount Sinai. 
Meanwhile, the community banks 
and the Main Street businesses that

are trying to put America back to 
work are suffering under the sheer weight, load, volume, complexity, and cost of the regulatory burden that has been imposed by our friends on the left. 
The left aims their rhetoric at Wall 
Street, but they vote against Main Street. The hardworking American families and those who want to work become collateral damage. Main Street doesn’t want to occupy Wall Street; they just want to quit bailing it out. And that is what we need to do, Madam Speaker. 
So it is time to get America back to 
work. It is time to work on a bipar-tisan basis. It is time to grow this economy from Main Street up, not Washington down. Reject the MTR. Vote in favor of promoting job creation and reducing small business burdens. 
I yield back the balance of my time.

ADJOURNMENT TO FRIDAY, 
JANUARY 16, 2015 
Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 4 p.m. on Friday, January 16, 2015, and, further, when the House ad-journs on that day, it adjourn to meet on Tuesday, January 20, 2015, when it shall convene at noon for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative busi-ness. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there

There was no objection.

DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND 
SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS 
(Mrs. BLACK asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) 
Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, last year, 
I promised my constituents that, in the new year, we would bring the fight on illegal immigration and act to restore the separation of powers that was up-ended by President Obama’s lawless overreach, and I meant it. That is why I proudly voted for the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act and the attached amendments. 
This bill is simple. It fully funds— 
yes, it fully funds—the DHS while en-suring that no dollars are made avail-able for the President’s executive am-nesty. 
I am especially pleased that this 
measure contained key provisions of my bill, the Immigration Compliance Enforcement Act, which will defund the Obama administration’s ‘‘public advocate’’ to lobby on behalf of illegal immigrants. 
Mr. Speaker, we still have three co-
equal branches of government, and when the President oversteps his bounds, we are compelled to respond. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will remind Members to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President.

TRADE 
(Mrs. DINGELL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
this afternoon regarding Fast Track authorization. 
There are many reasons to oppose 
Fast Track, but the first and foremost is that Fast Track is an abdication of Congress’ fundamental responsibilities.

deal was negotiated by the administra-
tion, in secret, without the proper input or oversight from the Congress. The grapevine tells us—because they are not talking to us directly—that it will do nothing to address currency manipulation, the mother of all trade barriers. 
Just one consequence is an $8,000 cost 
advantage to a Japanese vehicle sold in the United States, which is then used to subsidize parts, advertising, or to 
undercut the cost of a vehicle in the marketplace. In fact, Toyota made more in profits last year from currency manipulation than Ford made last year in its entire worldwide operations. 
What I know about the domestic auto 
industry is that they can outcompete any of their competitors in the world, but they cannot outcompete the Bank of Japan or the Japanese Government. 
Those who care about the constitu-
tional responsibilities of Congress should oppose Fast Track.

FULLY FUND HOMELAND 
SECURITY 
(Mr. ENGEL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
express my deep disappointment in the votes that were just taken by the House. 
We should be fully funding Homeland 
Security in this country. In light of what went on in Paris, in light of Sep-tember 11, in light of the fact that there are terrorist cells, we need the Department of Homeland Security to be fully funded. 
If there are differences of opinion 
with the President on the immigration bill, then that should be fought in an immigration bill, but we shouldn’t mix apples with oranges. 
My mother used to say, ‘‘You 
shouldn’t cut off your nose to spite your face.’’ That is exactly what this House did just before: we cut off our nose to spite our face. 
To prove a point of dissatisfaction 
with the President, we cut funds for Homeland Security. That is an irre-sponsible act, and I really wish it would be reversed. We need to fully fund Homeland Security. The fight on immigration is the fight on immigra-tion. Let’s not mix apples with or-anges, to quote another metaphor. 
I am terribly disappointed, and I say 
to my colleagues that the Department of Homeland Security needs to be fully funded. We should be adding funds to keep our people safe, not pulling them away.

COMMITTED TO FIGHTING THE 
WAR ON TERROR 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
started out this week to remind Ameri-cans of the difficult times in which we 
live. Sadly, today, rather than passing a clean Homeland Security Appropria-tions bill upon which Americans are depending to secure this land, we had a political fight. 
I want to remind those around the 
world that America still stands strong and committed to fighting the war on terror. In joining with our friends in Africa against the horrific actions of Boko Haram and the suicide bombings that they are forcing 10-year-old chil-dren to do, we stand with our friends in Europe and around the world. 
Most of all, what we must do is find 
a way to steer the young lives that are being captured by the Internet and on-line brutality away from these kinds of dastardly acts. 
I think it is important that we find a 
way to educate the young boys and girls in Nigeria and in countries around the world and to be able to say to them that there is a greater and better life of opportunity and humanity. 
I am committed, as we move in this 
legislative process, to focus on remov-ing the dastardly acts of these terror-ists and on saving our boys and girls.

COSPONSORING LEGISLATION— 
CHANGES IN POLICY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-uary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Wash-ington (Mr. S
MITH) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the minor-ity leader. 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I will only take a few minutes and then yield the bulk of the time to Mr. C
LYBURN . 
I rise about a particular situation 
that has happened to me and, I am sure, has happened to other Members that you might not be aware of. Other Members can sign you on to a piece of legislation without your consent, and that happened to me just this week. 
Representative D
IANE BLACK signed 
me on to H.R. 217, which is a particu-larly strong anti-choice bill and a bill that I would never support. Now, it was an honest mistake. 
My name is A
DAM SMITH. Regret-
tably, there is an A DRIAN SMITH, who 
serves—well, not ‘‘regrettably.’’ A DRI-
ANis a very nice man, but he is some-
one who has a name very close to mine, ‘‘A
DRIAN SMITH.’’ She thought it was 
ADRIAN SMITH she was signing on to 
the bill. She signed me on to the bill instead, and that creates two problems and two things that I would urge this body to change. 
First of all, nobody should be able to 
sign you on to a bill without your sig-nature. Now, I know we do that, and that speeds up the process, but it cre-ates a situation where anyone can put you on any bill. In this case, I was put on a bill that is polar opposite to my personal beliefs and my 18-year record in Congress. 
The second thing that is really prob-
lematic about this is you would as-sume—well, okay—there is a simple 
fix: just take it off. To her credit, as soon as she noticed the mistake, Con-gresswoman B
LACK did just that—she 
had my name removed as a cosponsor— but that is not what happens. 
On the bill that is out there with the 
original cosponsors, my name does not simply disappear. A line is drawn through it, and it is said next to it ‘‘withdrawn’’ as if, at some point, I did cosponsor the bill and then changed my mind. 
I don’t know how we change this 
rule, but when this happens—when it is clear that someone signs you on to a bill you had no intention of being on— your name should be removed. Period. End of story. It was never really there in the first place. 
Now, as a part of my permanent 
record, there is my name as having been on a bill—to all appearances as my own choice—that, in a million years, I never would have cosponsored. 
I rise to make that point clear to my 
constituents, first of all. I never signed on to it, and I never had any intention. Second of all, as I will do in a letter that I will send to the Speaker and to the minority leader, I would urge us to at least change that second policy. 
Once it is clear that you never in-
tended to sign on to a bill, your name should simply be removed. It should not be there with a line through it as if you did intend to sign on to the bill at one time. I think this is potentially damaging to a lot of Members. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

ONE RIVER, ONE BOAT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-uary 6, 2015, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. C
LYBURN ) is recognized 
for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the minority leader. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank my friend, Mr. S
MITH, for al-
lowing me to share this time with him. 
Mr. Speaker, in keeping with the tra-
dition of the First Amendment—a law deeply ingrained in the core of Amer-ican values—I would like to put into the C
ONGRESSIONAL RECORD the poem 
‘‘One River, One Boat.’’ 
This poem was written by South 
Carolina’s poet laureate, Marjory Wentworth, in anticipation of reading 
it at today’s gubernatorial inaugura-tion. It illustrates the history of my home State and ponders a look at the path the State seems to be embarking upon going forward. 
Ms. Wentworth has recited a poem at 
the last three gubernatorial inaugura-tions, but she will not be reciting a poem at today’s. She was told that her participation would make the program too lengthy. 
Now, Mr. Speaker, I have attended 
several inaugurations of South Caro-lina’s Governors. Some were shorter than others. None were allotted a spe-cific amount of time. South Caro-linians are proud of their poet laure-ates, but all have not always agreed

with the import of their writings. I be-
lieve it is wrong to not include this prolific, artistic expression in this year’s ceremony. 
Recently, individuals across the 
globe are living in fear of censorship when free speech and expression should be a fundamental right. We have even seen cowardly individuals use their own beliefs to badger, batter, and even murder those whose views and expres-sions they have found discomforting. 
We have seen many instances of arbi-
trary actions against the powerless by the powerful when words and actions threaten their comfort levels. Such ac-tions should not be. 
I applaud Ms. Wentworth for her 
touching words, and I am reading her poem today in hopes that the people of South Carolina, across the country, and peoples around the world are as touched by her words as I have been. 
ONERIVER, ONEBOAT 
(By Marjory Wentworth, poet laureate of 
South Carolina) 
Because our history is a knot 
we try to unravel, while others try to tighten it, we tire easily and fray the cords that bind us. 
The cord is a slow moving river, 
spiraling across the land in a succession of S’s, splintering near the sea. 
Picture us all, crowded onto a boat 
at the last bend in the river: watch children stepping off the school bus, parents late for work, grandparents 
fishing for favorite memories, 
teachers tapping their desks with red pens, firemen suiting up to save us, nurses making rounds, 
baristas grinding coffee beans, 
dockworkers unloading apartment size containers of computers and toys from factories across the sea. 
Every morning a different veteran 
stands at the base of the bridge holding a cardboard sign with misspelled words and an empty cup. 
In fields at daybreak, rows of migrant 
farm workers standing on ladders, break 
open 
iced peach blossoms; their breath rising and resting above the frozen fields like 
clouds. 
A jonboat drifts down the river. 
Inside, a small boy lies on his back; hand laced behind his head, he watches stars fade from the sky and dreams. 
Consider the prophet John, calling us 
from the edge of the wilderness to name the harm that has been done, to make it plain, and enter the river and rise. 
It is not about asking for forgiveness. 
It is not about bowing our heads in shame; because it all begins and ends here: while workers unearth trenches 
at Gadsden’s Wharf, where 100,000 
Africans were imprisoned within brick walls awaiting auction, death, or worse. Where the dead were thrown into the water, 
and the river clogged with corpses 
has kept centuries of silence. It is time to gather at the water’s edge, and toss wreaths into this watery grave. 
And it is time to praise the judge 
who cleared George Stinney’s name, seventy years after the fact, we honor him; we pray. 
Here, where the Confederate flag still flies beside the Statehouse, haunted by our past, 
conflicted about the future; at the heart of it, we are at war with ourselves 
huddled together on this boat 
handed down to us—stuck at the last bend of a wide river splintering near the sea. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time.

RADICAL ISLAM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-uary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. G
OHMERT ) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the majority leader. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it has 
been an interesting short week. And with all the drills in the world going on, it is important that we deal with our Department of Homeland Security. And I am proud the House has taken quick action to pass such a budget and passed it handily. 
Homeland Security needs to be fund-
ed, and the President needs to sign the bill. We have finished that today and are sending it to the Senate. Hopefully they will work quickly and deal with this issue because, as people in Amer-ica know, we have crises all around us. We have threats to our security all around us that require immediate at-tention. 
The world is watching as we play golf 
while they come together, millions at a time, to stand against radical Islam and Islamic terrorism. 
So it has been interesting to see the 
White House as the only significant international capital where the ulti-mate leader of the country cannot bring himself and, therefore, his spokespeople cannot bring themselves, to say the words ‘‘radical Islamic ter-rorism,’’ because that is what we are talking about. 
And for an administration to dimin-
ish the seriousness of radical Islamic terrorists wanting to destroy Western civilization is worse than having our leadership’s head in the sand, or wher-ever their head is. It is important to wake up and recognize what the world has recognized, what our Muslim friends have recognized—that radical Islam is a threat to our very existence and way of life. 
The Weekly Standard has an article, 
January 13, by Daniel Halper, which says: ‘‘The White House won’t be call-ing jihadists adherents to ‘radical Islam.’ At least, that’s the reasonable takeaway from this extraordinary ex-change the White House press sec-retary had today with a reporter.’’ 
And I will jump down to a statement 
by President Obama’s chief spokes-person: 
Mr. Earnest: I think the reason is twofold. 
One is I certainly wouldn’t want to be in a position where I’m repeating the justifica-tion that they have cited that I think is completely illegitimate, right? That they have invoked Islam to try to justify their at-tacks. And the reporter said: 
But to call it radical Islam you feel would 
be playing into their hands. 
Mr. Earnest: Well, I think what I’m trying 
to do is I’m trying to describe to you what happened and what they did. These are indi-viduals who are terrorists. And what they did was they tried to invoke their own dis-torted deviant view of Islam to try to justify them. 
And I want to stop there. The Presi-
dent’s mouthpiece says that he is not going to call it ‘‘radical Islam’’ or ‘‘Is-lamic terrorism’’ because that is a de-viant view. Well, if you look at the def-inition of ‘‘deviant,’’ that is what devi-ates from what most people do or say or think. 
So it would appear, Mr. Speaker, that 
the deviant thought process is not what the reporters had and not what 
the major countries in the world have and not what our Muslim leader friends in the world have. It is what this White House has. Theirs is the deviation from what is truth, because the truth is—as much as this President doesn’t want to say it, and he doesn’t allow his spokespeople to say it, I will say it, Mr. Speaker: this is radical Islamic ter-rorism, and it is a threat to Western civilization. 
And the more our leaders refuse to 
recognize it for what it is, the worse it gets because the radical Islamic terror-ists realize they are winning. And the Organization of the Islamic Con-ference, the OIC, composed of the Is-lamic states in the world, all 57—I know it gets confusing to some in this country’s leadership whether we have 57 States and they have 50 or they have 57 and we have 50. But they have 57 be-cause they include one that is not ac-tually a state. But they are the ones that started the campaign after 9/11 of calling anyone who expresses concern about radical Islamic terrorism ‘‘Islamophobes.’’ 
I fear God. I don’t fear any man. I am 
not a phobe of anything. But it is time to recognize truth, and that is that radical Islamic terrorists want to de-stroy our life and kill us. It is very simple. 
And what is remarkable—and I think 
it is very important that both Demo-crats and Republicans have the oppor-tunity to travel around and speak to world leaders in their own countries because when you are there in their country talking to them, as some of us on both sides of the aisle have done in those Middle Eastern countries, led by moderate Muslims who don’t believe they need to have an explosive jihad, they recognize that the terrorism that is a threat to them, as moderate Mus-lims, and the terrorism that is a threat to us and Western civilization, is rad-ical Islam. They recognize that it is a religion. 
And they recognize that when people 
in the name of Allah and Islam take territory and claim they are their own caliphate, their own government, then you had better understand who they are and what they are. And in this case, the Islamic State has enough

strength and enough power to be taken 
seriously so that they are totally de-feated and wiped off the map, whether it is in Syria, northern Iraq, wherever they find themselves, because they are at war with us. 
And I mentioned it before, Mr. 
Speaker, but as we have had this ad-ministration do a cleansing—not nec-essarily a book-burning but a burning, in essence, of parts of the training books that talk about radical Islam, that tried to educate our FBI, our State Department, our intelligence communities, all of our government workers on what radical Islam is, what it believes, the intelligence officer said: We have blinded ourselves of the abil-ity to see our enemy. And that has never been more apparent than it has been this week, with the radical Is-lamic jihad terrorist attack in Paris and in Nigeria. 
Even though there weren’t reporters 
killed in Nigeria, those lives were every bit as much precious—around 2,000 lives. Somehow, much of the mainstream media had trouble report-ing that. They were concentrating on the horrors of the journalists killed in Paris, and rightfully so. But they should not be neglecting the horrors for those villagers, so many of them Christian, who have been killed be-cause they did not believe in radical Islam. 
And one of the reasons, I would sub-
mit, that we should have had a Presi-dent there in Paris—and I know it would have been difficult for this President, but he should have been there locked arm-in-arm with Prime Minster Netanyahu. Words keep leak-ing out about things that are said, about strained relations that this ad-ministration has with the Netanyahu administration. There is a leader whose eyes are clear and his vision is clear, and he can see exactly who is at war against him, who is helping him and the nation of Israel and who is not helping him and the nation of Israel. 
And as we know from history, any-
time a nation’s enemies see that na-tion’s strongest ally pulling away, it is provocative. And the more the United States distances itself from Israel, from those who recognize that radical Islamic terrorism is a threat to West-ern civilization, then the more radical Islamists win. 
b1300 
I really, honest to goodness, didn’t 
think we would be 6 years in to Presi-dent Obama’s administration with him still not willing to acknowledge that radical Islam is a threat, is at war with us. 
It is a religion. This administration 
may not like it, but it is a religion. It is a radical form of Islam. I hope one day that our top leaders in this coun-try will have the courage of President al-Sisi in Egypt and that will reflect, as General al-Sisi has, the will of the people of their country. 
If the story is properly written about 
Egypt—and one day it will be. It won’t be by people at The New York Times. 
It will be by people who are not trying to twist and turn and create history the way they want it. It will be by his-torians that are really looking at what has happened. 
They will see that in the last 6 years 
that, besides Israel, the country that has been most fearless—and by ‘‘coun-try,’’ I mean the people of the coun-try—most fearless in standing up for freedom and against radical Islamic terrorism, unfortunately, has not been the United States because of our lead-ership. It has been the nation of Egypt. 
Certainly, Israel has stood strong and 
fearless. Their nation has been under attack nonstop. God bless them and protect them. Egypt was not under at-tack other than by the radical form of Islam, the religion of radical Islam, and this administration helped oust one of this country’s allies. 
Like him or not, there were plenty of 
agreements signed by this country with President Mubarak, and this ad-ministration disregarded them. That is a problem for other countries and other leaders who want to sign agreements with this administration, but they don’t know that our country can be trusted anymore. 
As people see the decline of respect 
for America around the world, they should understand that it is being cred-ited to the lack of reliability of the United States to keep its word, to sup-port its friends, not to turn its back on its friends. This Nation’s leaders have begun repeatedly appearing more help-ful to our enemies than to our own friends. They don’t know who to trust. 
I mentioned to Secretary Kerry that 
I have talked to people in the Middle East, Muslim leaders, who say: We talk among ourselves, we are all worried we may be the next ally to be thrown under the bus. 
He wanted to know who said that. 
Well, obviously, I couldn’t tell him be-cause he would throw them under the bus. 
For many of us that have traveled 
around the Middle East and talked to leaders in the Middle East, we under-stand what they feel. Maybe they are not able to be as open and candid with this administration for fear of it turn-ing on them the way it does anybody within the administration here in America or outside the administration. 
God help the whistleblowers. If you 
want to stand up for truth, justice, and the American way in this administra-tion and point out massive problems that could subject our country to at-tacks, to terrorism, God help you be-cause this administration is coming after you. They will use the Justice De-partment, they will use the EPA, they will use the IRS. 
This administration has been 
weaponized to go after anybody that dares to stand up, especially within the administration. People that want to stand up and tell the truth, they are attacked, they are threatened with prosecution. If someone like General Petraeus, 
who has defended the administration— but this administration knows that General Petraeus has information that would virtually destroy any credibility that the administration might still have nationally and internationally— so what else would this administration do but leave over his head, for over a year-and-a-half, the threat: We are going to prosecute you, so you better keep your mouth shut. 
They actually know just the threat 
of prosecution helps diminish potential credibility. So if you wonder why Gen-eral Petraeus has not come out in the last year and a half and said, ‘‘No, those weren’t our talking points, some-body that created them needs to be prosecuted, it was a fraud on the Amer-ican people,’’ he is not going to say that. 
He has got this administration hang-
ing a prosecution over his head. What do you expect? I doubt he will ever be able to say it without worrying about something over his shoulder coming after him. 
Here he is. He has been defensive of 
the administration. He has been a good soldier. He has said what they wanted him to say. He hasn’t told all he could say, and they are going to make sure he doesn’t—or if he does, he pays a heavy criminal price. That is where we are now in America. 
It may have been the kind of admin-
istration Richard Nixon dreamed of, but he knew he could never get there. He couldn’t weaponize the IRS. He ap-parently dreamed of it. This adminis-tration has done it. 
For the President, for his 
spokespeople not to be able to call the terrorism a result of radical Islamic terrorism, it weakens our country, it emboldens our enemies, and as we have seen, you may take out Osama bin Laden, but when you withdraw our troops prematurely before Iraq soldiers are ready to stand on their own and you have blinded ourselves of the abil-ity to recognize that any believers like Khamenei or Ahmadinejad, the former President of Iran, if you have blinded yourself of the ability to learn and edu-cate our administration on what they believe, then you are going to fall prey to everything they decide to do toward you and about you because you don’t understand where they are coming from. 
I repeatedly reflect on that scene in 
the movie ‘‘Patton,’’ and although he didn’t know Rommel was not there with his tank division, he yells out in the movie after his tanks have defeated Rommel’s: Rommel, you magnificent fatherless—I am paraphrasing—father-less man, I read your book. 
If you read and learn and educate 
yourself about your enemies, you have got a better chance of defeating them, but this administration continues to make it more and more difficult to un-derstand who our enemies are. All of this backing up and crawfishing, well, you know, this isn’t all Islam.

Of course, it is not all Islam. That is 
how I can go to Afghanistan and hug dear Muslim friends, we have the same enemies—and a big old bear of a man who led the Northern Alliance to de-feat the Taliban by February of 2002 in the initial defeat is now the Vice Presi-dent, and thank God he is. 
Some of us that just met with the 
new leadership recently—and I have known General Dostum for a while and met with my good friend the Honorable Massoud. 
President Ghani basically has gath-
ered around him people a bit like what Lincoln did. He took people who op-posed him, ran against him, but be-cause he clearly cares deeply about Af-ghanistan, he gathered around him a team of rivals, and the good thing is, unlike the current administration here, he is not afraid of having people with opposing viewpoints around him. 
He is just like Lincoln. Lincoln had 
rivals all around him, and he listened to their input. He got their opinions, and it helped him make better deci-sions. This administration here needs to do what President Ghani in Afghani-stan is trying to do, and it is not easy because our U.S. administration here has been reaching out for the Taliban. 
Initially, the Taliban are defeated, 
and then this administration comes in—and I know the prior administra-tion started the massive occupation of Afghanistan with tens of thousands of troops. 
This President comes in, and in his 
campaign, he said that was the real war. Well, yeah, but once you defeat your enemy in that part of the world, you don’t help yourself by becoming an occupier—you add over 100,000 troops to the country that is so thrilled that you relieved them of radical Islamic leadership, then you become an enemy because, now, you are an occupier. We didn’t do ourselves any favors. 
There are people, unlike the Iraqis 
who threw down weapons and ran, turned them over to the Islamic State, in Afghanistan, the Northern Alliance was willing to fight the Taliban ini-tially, and they are still willing to fight. 
In fact, before President Ghani was 
elected—that was so much uncertainty: Is President Karzai going to try to have another term, even though it is against the constitution? Are they in for a civil war? 
There was a great deal of trepidation 
on the part of the Northern Alliance that fought against the Taliban on our behalf with less than 500 American spe-cial ops and intelligence people embed-
ded. 
They knew we withdrew, and the 
Taliban were able to take over the na-tional government. Then they were in for a war, and one of them told me: Look, since you have taken back the weapons, you don’t support us any-more, and you are doing everything you can to help the Taliban—that is this administration—we realize the odds are that we will lose our lives, but we are not going down without a fight. Well, fortunately, they have got a 
team of rivals leading the country. Prayers are with them. They are mod-erate Muslims that I trust, and they want the best for Afghanistan. 
According to the military leaders I 
have talked to repeatedly in Afghani-stan and others, the country of Paki-stan has been the biggest supplier and supporter of the Taliban. The Taliban didn’t do themselves any favors when they just, in such evil fashion, at-tacked a school and killed 140 or so pre-cious people, including children. 
There are many more in Pakistan 
that are saying: You know what, it is time to stop supporting the Taliban, it is time to worry about Pakistan. 
Some have even started saying it is 
time to quit persecuting the Baloch people. 
b1315 
The arbitrary lines that were drawn 
many decades ago put probably the bulk of the Baloch people in southern Pakistan where most of their minerals are. It put the Baloch people within the arbitrary lines drawn for a country called Iran. In fact, the Baloch area ac-tually is where the Straits of Hormuz are. It is where much of the oil and gas is. 
I have grown to admire and love 
many of the Baloch people. I wouldn’t mind seeing them having an inde-pendent Balochistan. I wouldn’t mind seeing an independent Kurdistan in northern Iraq, because unlike what is portrayed in much of the mainstream media, the Kurds never threw down their weapons and ran away or turned them over to the Islamic State. They are people we can trust. 
Mr. Speaker, a solution to our prob-
lem there would be to announce that we are going to provide weapons di-rectly to the Kurds. We don’t have to go through Baghdad, because Baghdad 
doesn’t want them to have the equip-ment they need. They are afraid of them. Let them have the equipment they need to defeat the Islamic State. Yes, I know, that would not make Tur-key happy, but Turkey has said: Not only are we not fighting the Islamic State—even though we have pledged in our NATO alliance that we will help fight any enemy of our fellow NATO signatories—we are not going to help, and we are not going to let you use any of the NATO bases or U.S. bases here in Turkey. You are on your own. 
Well, Mr. Speaker, if Turkey is not 
going to fight them and they are a threat to all Western civilization, then we are just going to have to supply the Kurds and let them take them out. 
It has been an honor to be over there 
numerous times and spend time there even when the State Department said it was too dangerous to go. D
ANAROHR-
ABACHER and I went and spent 3 days 
when the State Department was telling us it was too dangerous to be there. But I knew that there was no way their leaders were going to let anything hap-pen to us. And they didn’t. They were trustworthy. Mr. Speaker, one of the problems this 
administration has is figuring out whom we can trust and whom we can’t. I know that this administration con-tinues to talk about these moderate, vetted Syrian Army soldiers that we can really help. Well, if they were there 3 or 4 years ago, most of them are ready to throw in with the Islamic State or with al Qaeda subsidiaries. In fact, they have done that very thing. They have fought together. 
I don’t know if ‘‘naivete’’ is the prop-
er word, but when this administration started supplying their so-called free, vetted moderate Syrian Army per-sonnel and the equipment, they kept ending up in the Islamic State’s posses-sion. They even suspended sending 
them more weapons and equipment for a while, but then some months later they picked it back up. I don’t know why, what made them feel they were more believable than they were before, but amazingly, they started sending it, and it started ending up in Islamic State hands. 
It is heartbreaking to be, as a few of 
us have, in northern Iraq in the Kurdistan area with real, patriotic Kurds who love their people and who have fought not just for themselves, but they have fought for other groups, Shi’a and Sunni, without throwing down their weapons. They have fought and died. But to look in their eyes and see the hurt as they say: Couldn’t you give us some Humvees, some up-ar-mored vehicles? Because we are fight-ing against the Islamic State, and they are using American Humvees. They are using American armored personnel car-riers. They are using American tanks. We don’t have anything that can pene-trate your American tanks or your per-sonnel carriers. Those are invulnerable almost completely to IEDs because you up-armored them and gave them to the Syrian Army that gave them to ISIS, or you gave them to the Iraqi soldiers that left them for ISIS. 
The commander who had lost soldiers 
said: You don’t know what it is like to see a big, armored vehicle that is going to be used for a suicide bombing com-ing at your soldiers who have weapons that can’t possibly penetrate those ve-hicles. And they are shooting. They are doing everything they can to try to stop them, but because they are the best America has in the way of fighting vehicles, we can’t stop them, and we know my guys are going to get blown up as this American vehicle gets close, and it has been set up to be a suicide bomb. 
Mr. Speaker, since this administra-
tion has not been effective in fighting IS for so long, for too long they looked at them as the junior varsity, the JVs, shouldn’t we at least help those who are fighting to help us, along with themselves, by giving them vehicles that could match up against the vehi-cles we provided to the Islamic State? It seems like the least we can do. It really does. 
This administration was going to be 
the most transparent in history. There

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H401 January 14, 2015 
is a story out this week from PJ Media. 
Josh Earnest doesn’t think President Obama is upset about missing the soli-darity gathering of world leaders. The world leaders see that our way of life is at risk, and our leadership doesn’t see it. He thinks if we give a good enough speech, we coddle, we offer to buy of-fices in Qatar, or we release more of their murderers, that surely they will recognize how truly wonderful, kind, and generous we are and they will stop their evil ways of killing innocent peo-ple. It is not going to happen. 
I have Christian friends that say: 
Yes, but as Christians, we are supposed to turn the other cheek. That is as in-dividuals. Individual Christians should live out the beatitudes as Christ gave them. But the government has a dif-ferent role. If you do evil, you should be afraid because the government, within the bounds of Christianity—Ro-mans 13:4—is supposed to punish the evil, eliminate the evils, and protect your people. I don’t try to convert any-body using my position in government, but for those who misunderstand Chris-tian teaching, you need to read Ro-mans 13. 
We have an Attorney General still 
holding on, Holder the Holdover. He said he is concerned about the so-called lone wolf attacks in the United States—one of the things, Mr. Speaker, I don’t think, again, that this adminis-tration understands. They talk about these lone wolf attacks, and yet when you get down to the bottom of it, you find out, gee, they had talked to al- Awlaki, the man born in the United States so he gets an American birth certificate, an American passport, and American citizenship because his par-ents came over and had him while they were here, so he is an American citizen. He is radicalizing people. 
These weren’t lone wolfs. They got 
information, they got advice, and they got radicalization from somebody else. It is tough to find anybody self- radicalized because apparently there are plenty of imams in this country that are not the general rank-and-file imams. They are imams that are ready to radicalize those—and twist and con-vert into evil—that would kill innocent children, women, and men. 
Mr. Speaker, we need to recognize 
the threat that is upon us, and you can’t do that when an administration will not even call the evil for what it is. I know indications are, gee, the economy is getting so much better. We still have over 90 million people that are not counted as unemployed because they just finally gave up looking for a job. To me, that is unemployed. But we don’t count them in our statistics. And this staggering story came out today, written by Wyton Hall: 
In a stunning Tuesday report, Gallup CEO 
and Chairman Jim Clifton revealed that ‘‘for the first time in 35 years, American business deaths now outnumber business births.’’ 
I can’t help but think that has some-
thing to do with the massive overregu-lation by this administration con-tinuing to set records in the number of 
regulations it sets. How in the world can businesses keep up with over 70,000 new pages of regulations year after year? They did it again in 2014, over 70,000 pages of new regulations, and they are expected to follow them and manage to keep a business. You don’t have to look very far to find CEO after CEO or a person that started a busi-ness, no matter how massive, who said: In looking at all the regulations now, it is a good thing I started my business when I did, because if I were trying to start it now, I never could. I couldn’t overcome all of the massive govern-ment overregulation. 
Now, Mr. Speaker, we see ObamaCare 
continuing to fail and continuing to provide less care for more money. But not to worry. A lot of your good health care dollars are going to fund naviga-tors who will never put a Band-Aid on anybody or never even blow on a cut to make it feel better. No. They will never even pat somebody on the back. They are bureaucrats. They are not in the health care business, nor are the thou-sands and thousands and thousands of new IRS agents who are not looking out for your health. They will probably give you ulcers. But they are part of the health care dollars now. 
So people keep asking me: L
OUIE, I 
don’t understand. My deductible is higher. I am paying more money than ever. I am getting less care. I am get-ting turned down for things. I don’t get to choose my doctor. I sure don’t have the insurance policy I wanted. I don’t understand. 
I have to explain: Well, that is be-
cause you are paying for a lot of gov-ernment workers that don’t really help in anybody’s health problems at all. They create health problems, more likely. 
With all of this as a background, all 
of the failures of the Federal Govern-ment, the Federal Government, in fact, is intruding in people’s private lives. As they access email and gather phone logs of every call to and from American individuals, we were assured that would not happen when the PATRIOT Act was extended. I was not here when it was passed. We were told it was only if you were a foreign terrorist, a known foreign terrorist, or you had ties to for-eign terrorists would you be even eligi-ble to have your phone logs gathered, emails checked. ‘‘Only’’ we were told. Well, that turned out not to be true. That was just an outright lie. It is time to stop the government intrusion into people’s private lives unless the gov-ernment has a warrant. 
As a judge, I had no problem signing 
a warrant if there was probable cause spelled out in the affidavit. There were times I would turn away law officers and say: You have plenty of specula-tion there that sounds good, but you don’t have facts that get you to prob-able cause. 
That should be in there, under the 
Constitution, before the government can start invading your privacy. Then when the House and Senate 
were controlled by the Democrats, President Obama is in the Oval Office, they passed a bill creating this Con-sumer Financial Protection Bureau that apparently is out there thinking they need to be able to monitor everybody’s debit and credit card records so that they can see if anybody is being taken advantage of. 
b1330 
Well, how about following the Con-
stitution and not getting anybody’s bank records or credit card or debit card records unless you have probable cause or unless the person gives per-mission. 
I am hoping that is going to be a bill 
that we pass because I have talked to enough Republicans and know how we feel, and there are Democrats who feel the same way. Of course, they are the ones that created this monster, but that needs to be reined in. And now with that as a backdrop, we have the story: ‘‘Obama backs government-run Internet.’’ 
And I know there was somebody who 
wrote into the Longview paper that they want net neutrality. They love the idea of the government playing more of a role in the Internet. Well guess what? When the government takes control of the Internet in the name of neutrality, it will probably not be neutral, according to most Ameri-cans’ opinions. 
So I hope Americans are not fooled. I 
hope Americans don’t buy into this be-cause when the United States Govern-ment takes control of the Internet, then we are going to start having the same problems they have in China, in Russia, and other parts of the world where their government does control their Internet, and they control your freedom to search for what you want or to say what you want. 
I know of numerous occasions where 
people said they were in China typing, and they mention anything about the government, even if it is not terrible what they said about the government, they start typing again, and they have lost their Internet connection. They 
have learned not to say anything about the government, let it go, and they keep their Internet connection better. 
Mr. Speaker, I just want to also 
touch on this because we passed the funding for the Department of Home-land Security. I hope the President doesn’t veto the bill. I hope the Senate will pass what we passed. There are some things in there I would have liked to have been different, but I read the bill totally. There are some parts that aren’t great, and there are some parts that are great. I am very proud—my friend J
OHN CARTER has some great 
language in there. I know he has worked very hard on language that is very good. 
As I was reading the bill this week-
end, I said, that was J
OHN CARTER ’s 
specific language from an earlier bill. Overall, it was a good bill. The amend-ments helped it. I voted for the bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H402 January 14, 2015 
And now hopefully the Senate will do 
the right thing and pass it, and we will send it to the President and we will fund the Department of Homeland Se-curity without all of the amnesties he has unconstitutionally created. 
But if the President wants another 
way of doing things, I haven’t heard anyone else suggest this, but I brought it up with some friends this morning. Perhaps we go ahead, if he doesn’t think that he likes that and we are not able to override a veto, maybe it is time to start setting goals for the ad-ministration, and when they don’t meet them, we just take that money from them and block grant it out to State and local law enforcement. 
There are some jail cells open. We 
don’t have to provide the hundreds of millions of dollars to hold people being detained. The local law enforcement is tired of holding people on behalf of the Federal Government and not being re-imbursed. Let them do the job they are supposed to do of enforcing the law. 
I know the Arizona case said, the Su-
preme Court said Arizona could not be enforcing immigration law, that was a Federal job, but we certainly have the authority to say, you know what? Let’s block grant that money out and let State and local government do that, enforce our laws for us. I think we will get a whole lot better job done. So that may be something else to consider. If the President is not going to sign a bill that funds homeland security, maybe we need to fund it, and if they can’t meet their goals, block grant it out to local authorities. 
In the time I have left, I wanted to 
touch on a significant article by Pat-rick Poole of PJ Media, because, as he says, it is a look back on this year’s parade of failure, and expect more in 2015. 
His article is titled, ‘‘The National 
Security ‘Not Top 10’ of 2014.’’ So my paraphrase is the top 10 failures in na-tional security by this administration. 
Number one: befriending ‘‘moderate 
al Qaeda’’ in Syria. Patrick Poole said: 
‘‘There are some ideas so at war with 
reason and reality they can only exist in the fetid Potomac fever swamps of D.C. think tank and foreign policy community. Such was the case in Jan-uary when three of the best and bright-est from those ranks published an arti-cle in Foreign Affairs (the same publi-cation that in 2007 brought us the ‘moderate Muslim Brotherhood’) con-tending that the U.S. needed to be-friend the Syrian jihadist group Ahrar al-Sham as some kind of counter to more extreme jihadist groups, like ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra. The prece-dent they cited was the U.S. failure to designate the Taliban after 9/11. 
Mind you, at the time they wrote 
this, one of Ahrar al-Sham’s top lead-ers was a lieutenant for al Qaeda head Ayman al-Zawahiri, who openly de-clared himself a member of al Qaeda. After most of their leadership was wiped out in a bombing in September, they have gravitated closer to the jihadist groups they were supposed to 
counter and their positions have been bombed by the U.S., much to the con-sternation of other vetted moderate rebel groups. So ridiculous was their proposition that the original subtitle of their article, ‘An al Qaeda Affiliate Worth Befriending,’ was changed online to ‘An al Qaeda-Linked Group Worth Befriending’ in hopes of minimizing the absurdity of their case.’’ 
But this administration bought into 
it. 
And I understand there may be a Re-
publican Senator or two that buys into it. It doesn’t make it any less prepos-terous. 
Number two of the top 10 national se-
curity failures: 
Obama administration deploys three 
hashtag divisions in response to Rus-sian invasion of Ukraine. 
Some folks may remember that the 
response of this administration to help the Ukrainian people that I hold so dear, having lived with them for a sum-mer back as a college student, the re-sponse of this administration was to launch a Twitter war that Russia wasn’t terribly concerned about. 
The number three failure of national 
security was Obama calling ISIS the ‘‘JV team.’’ 
I am sure Americans remember, and 
Patrick Poole discusses it, but to call the Islamic state a JV team betrayed his failure to get his security briefings as he should have to really understand what is happening in the world, be-cause I don’t believe for a minute, hav-ing talked to different intelligence peo-ple, I don’t believe for a minute that our intelligence people did not know how dangerous the Islamic state was. 
The number four failure of national 
security was the State Department of-ficial denying that Boko Haram tar-geted Christians. 
Having been over there and having 
hugged and wept with those parents of daughters who were kidnapped and ter-rorized and made sex slaves, unlike the 
State Department official who says it wasn’t about them being Christians—if you go hug them and weep with them and talk to them and their pastors, as I have, you find out it was precisely be-cause they were Christians. Please, somebody in this administration, wake up. Radical Islam is at war with the United States and any Western civili-zation, and specifically with Chris-tians. 
When I asked these mothers whose 
daughters are still held kidnapped, probably sold into sex slavery by now— and this administration has not done enough because they don’t see it as a war against Christianity—I asked, just to be sure, I said: Did they attack— Boko Haram, these radical Islamist terrorists—did they attack your daugh-ter’s school because they were girls, be-cause they don’t believe girls should be educated? 
They said: Oh, no, they don’t believe 
girls should be educated, but they at-tacked it because it is a Christian school. That is precisely why they attacked 
it. 
Number five: Homeland Security ad-
viser’s pro-caliphate tweet used by ISIS recruiters. I had been warning about this pro-caliphate Homeland Se-curity top adviser in Janet Napolitano’s regime in Homeland Secu-rity, a guy that has spoken, was a list-ed speaker to pay tribute to the Aya-tollah Khomeini as a man of vision of the 20th century, who blasted the pros-ecution of the Holy Land Foundation, the largest terrorist support prosecu-tion in American history, and he de-fended the convicted defendants, and he tweets out. Finally, it was enough to show the administration what most of us who had eyes and ears under-stood. He tweeted out, after ISIS killed more innocent people, that the caliph-ate was inevitable so just, you know, get ready. And then ISIS used that to help recruit. 
Number six failure of 2014 of national 
security in this administration: Obama and the State Department give shout- outs to Islamic cleric who okayed the fatwa authorizing the killing of Ameri-cans in Iraq. And Patrick Poole lays out exactly what it involved. Not once but twice, as I understand it, he gave a shout-out to this Islamic cleric who au-thorized the killing of Americans in Iraq. 
Number seven: Obama administra-
tion gives heavy weapons to ‘‘vetted moderate’’ Syrian rebel groups; they promptly turn up in hands of ISIS and al Qaeda. 
Number eight: The White House de-
fends the Muslim Brotherhood’s ‘‘com-mitment to nonviolence. And that is what some of the moderate Muslim leaders in the Middle East have said, different countries saying, Why are you helping the Muslim Brotherhood? Do you not understand they are at war with you? 
Number nine: The Obama administra-
tion defends U.S. Islamic groups brand-ed as terrorist groups by the UAE. 
The UAE is run by moderate Mus-
lims. Perhaps this administration could learn something by listening to them and who they recognize to be ter-rorist groups. 
And number 10: Having banned dis-
cussions of ideology driving Islamic terrorism, the Pentagon says it can’t understand the ideology of ISIS. 
Well, duh. It is no wonder they can’t 
understand it when you are not allowed to be educated about what these people believe. But there are people around this town that have been banned from teaching about radical Islam who per-haps should be unbanned. 
In conclusion, I just want to ref-
erence the vote this week for Speaker. The vote is behind us. It is done. The Speaker was reelected. But one of the big concerns I had has not gone away, and it still needs to be addressed. 
Those 4 years that Democrats con-
trolled the House and the Senate, they set a record for the most bills brought to the floor where no amendments by

anybody were allowed. They wouldn’t 
let us participate in the legislative process. And we railed against that. We said, You put us in the majority, we won’t do that. And it breaks my heart that under the current Speaker, a new record broke N
ANCY PELOSI ’s record of 
more bills brought to the floor with no amendments allowed, a closed rule. That has got to change. 
Some have said our effort had no 
chance. If all those who said they would have voted with us but it had no chance had voted with us, then it 
would have been overwhelming. 
b1345 
One of the Speaker’s supporters came 
up to me yesterday on the floor and handed me this and said, ‘‘This is from an old novel.’’ I think it is called ‘‘The Lion’s Den.’’ He said, ‘‘This applies to you,’’ and I appreciate it more than he would know. 
The quote is this: 
No matter how the espousal of a lost cause 
might hurt his prestige in the House, Zim-mer had never hesitated to identify himself with it if it seemed to him to be right. He knew only two ways; the right one and the wrong, and if he sometimes made a mistake, it was never one of honor: he voted as he be-lieved he should, and although sometimes his voice was raised alone on one side of a ques-tion, it was never stilled. 
There were 24 such people that spoke 
this week, and I hope they will be hon-ored and not belittled. 
With that, I yield back the balance of 
my time.

BOYERTOWN MUSEUM OF 
HISTORIC VEHICLES 
HON. RYAN A. COSTELLO 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Wednesday, January 14, 2015 
Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Boyertown Museum of Historic Vehicles as it celebrates 50 years of educating countless visitors about the important role Berks County and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania played in the development of America’s auto-mobile industry. 
Before Detroit became the automobile cap-
ital of the world, Berks County was at the fore-front of America’s transportation revolution. Horse-drawn carriages yielded to electric and gasoline-powered vehicles test driven on the steep slopes and hairpin curves leading to the summit of Mt. Penn in Reading and other roads in the region. 
Thanks to the outstanding dedication and 
hard work of its staff and volunteers, as well as the generosity of its members and sup-porters, the Museum chronicles the ground- breaking contributions of automobile manufac-turing pioneers such as Charles Duryea, who along with his brother, Frank, is credited with designing and producing the country’s first hill- climbing, gasoline-powered vehicle and the first commercially-produced automobile in 1900. 
Founded by Paul R. Hafer and his wife, Er-
mine, in 1965, the Museum is home to fas-cinating exhibits and dozens of automobiles, trucks, and motorcycles that were manufac-tured in Pennsylvania. The community will help the Museum kick off a year-long celebra-tion of the 50th anniversary on Saturday, Jan-uary 17th during a Golden Gala. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join 
me in recognizing the Boyertown Museum of Historic Vehicles as it celebrates this memo-rable milestone and continues telling the uniquely American story of how hard work, in-genuity and craftsmanship helped Berks County and the Commonwealth of Pennsyl-vania revolutionize how all of us travel.

TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF THE LIFE 
OF CONSTANCE KEND EISENSTAT 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Wednesday, January 14, 2015 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
pay tribute to an extraordinary woman and cherished constituent, Constance Eisenstat, who died on December 23, 2014, at the age of 83. Born in New York City to Lee and Cecile (Meyer) Kend, Connie spent the first half of her life as a New Yorker, and then as a Californian in the Bay Area. 
Connie made the world better with all she 
did and was. A unique, tasteful, funny, smart, intuitive, wise and fully decent woman, she 
consistently made herself available to help those who needed her, whether it was ward-robe guidance, new shopping opportunities, or exclusives on upcoming sales! Her notable travel and fine dining tips, favorite recipes, re-views of movies, art, and theatre were offered free of charge, and everyone trusted Connie’s judgment and good taste. But most impor-tantly, Connie was truly at her best when coaching others through their illnesses, their difficult personal times or their life’s chal-lenges. Connie was a courageous woman. She inspired others through her inner strength, fighting off her own illnesses countless times, yet never allowing them to get her down. 
Inspired by a program established at Sloan 
Kettering Hospital in New York, Connie and a friend launched the Patient to Patient Program at Stanford Hospital. They and their group of carefully trained volunteers paid visits to pa-tients who had undergone breast cancer sur-geries. Introducing themselves as breast can-cer survivors, they offered information and support services to hospital patients with gentleness and sensitivity. When the Commu-nity Breast Health Project (CBHP) was created in 1993, Connie once again offered her serv-ices to help launch this valued community non-profit organization. For many years she served as a committed volunteer and fund-raiser, and together with a group of like-mind-ed individuals, she sustained and strength-ened this premier community organization (now Bay Area Cancer Connections) that sup-ports people touched by breast and ovarian cancer with comprehensive, personalized services in an atmosphere of warmth and compassion. 
Connie was a devoted wife, mother, grand 
mom, friend, and community leader. Her loy-alty, style, energy, creativity, humor, deter-mination and bravery are all hallmarks of who she was and made her unforgettable. She was an entrepreneur before the word was popular-ized . . . the owner of a tennis shop, Connie’s Racquet, and a food business, Ultomato. She 
also brought her enduring sense of beauty to the Cantor Arts Center at Stanford University as a member of the Board. 
Connie leaves her beloved husband of 55 
years, Albert (Pepsi), her children Melissa (Jonathan) and Michael (Susanne) and her beloved four grandsons, Mitch, Johnny, Ben and Tommy. Mr. Speaker, I ask the entire House of Representatives to join me in hon-oring and celebrating the life of Connie Eisenstat. In the words of Vincent Van Gogh: 
‘‘Close friends are truly life’s treasures. 
Sometimes they know us better than we know ourselves. 
With gentle honesty, they are there to guide 
and support us, to share our laughter and our tears. 
Their presence reminds us that we are 
never really alone’’. 
This beloved and unique woman strength-
ened her family, her friends, her community and her country. May our tribute to her be a source of pride and comfort to the entire Eisenstat family. RECOGNIZING THE CAREER AND 
RETIREMENT OF WILLIAM L. BERG 
HON. RON KIND 
OF WISCONSIN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Wednesday, January 14, 2015 
Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
the career and retirement of William L. Berg. Mr. Berg, a lifelong resident of Wisconsin, is retiring from his position as president and CEO of Dairyland Power Cooperative. During his career, Mr. Berg oversaw a series of major transitions in the electric utility industry. He handled these transitions with confidence, leaving Dairyland better for his service. Mr. Berg’s tenure at Dairyland was the longest of any CEO of a generation and transmission co-operative in the United States. 
Mr. Berg graduated from the University of 
Wisconsin-Madison with a Bachelor’s and Master’s Degrees in Electrical Engineering in 1971 and 1972, respectively. From 1972 to 1974, Mr. Berg was employed by the Wis-consin Electric Power Company as an engi-neer. Bill was hired by Dairyland in 1974, and assumed the duties of president and chief ex-ecutive officer in 1990, just as the electric re-structuring movement began. His leadership helped to guide Dairyland through the rapid changes associated with this period of restruc-turing and deregulation. 
Mr. Berg spent his career championing the 
values underpinning the cooperative business model. He believed that the strength of a co-operative comes from its members. His pri-mary concern was always the interests of the cooperative’s members, and by remaining fo-cused on their fundamental importance, he was able to achieve great success as the leader of the cooperative. 
Mr. Berg is a registered Professional Engi-
neer in the State of Wisconsin and a member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic En-gineers. He spends his time serving on a vari-ety of boards and committees, including the Board of Advisors of Viterbo University and its Executive Committee. He also serves on the Rail Energy Transportation Advisory Com-mittee of the Surface Transportation Board of the U.S. Department of Transportation and is a member of National Rural Electric Coopera-tive Association’s Environmental Task Force. Mr. Berg is a past-president and current board member of the National Renewables Coopera-tive Organization. He is also a past-president of the National G&T Managers’ Association and has served on the Board of Directors of the Electric Power Research Institute. 
Bill and his wife, Cindi, live in La Crosse 
where they plan to remain active in their church and in other community activities after Bill’s retirement. Together they have two chil-dren, Michael and Sarah, as well as five grandchildren. Bill and Cindi are keen trav-elers, enjoying hiking experiences across the continents. I wish Bill and Cindi all the best in the years to come.

IN RECOGNITION OF JOHN 
PITSTICK 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Wednesday, January 14, 2015 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize John Pitstick who is retiring as the Director of Planning and Development from the City of North Richland Hills. 
As Director, Mr. Pitstick was responsible for 
all of the city’s development activities, includ-ing planning and zoning as well as direction of building inspections. These responsibilities for comprehensive planning, strategic develop-ment and redevelopment included revitaliza-tion of Boulevard 26, expansion of Loop 820, future commuter rail station planning and gas well regulations. 
Under his leadership, the City of North Rich-
land Hills was presented with the ‘‘Certificate of Achievement for Planning Excellence’’ by the Texas Chapter of the American Planning Association. The annual award recognizes ‘‘a commitment to professional planning by City Administration, Elected and Appointed Officials and exemplary professional standards dem-onstrated by the Planning Staff.’’ 
Mr. Pitstick is a graduate of the University of 
Texas at Arlington with a Bachelor’s Degree in Communications and a Master’s in Urban Af-fairs. With a career spanning over 30 years of service, his retirement from North Richland Hills was preceded by his service in key posi-tions with the cities of Hurst, Wylie, Arlington, Lancaster and Irving. 
I am honored to represent Mr. Pitstick and 
the City of North Richland Hills in the U.S. House of Representatives, and I gladly join the City and the appreciative citizens of the 26th Congressional District and across North Texas whom he has dutifully served through-out his career.

RECOGNIZING MR. BILL MISCHKE 
HON. MICHAEL G. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Wednesday, January 14, 2015 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise be-
fore you today to recognize Bill Mischke, a dedicated Scouter, mentor to countless youth and one of my first merit badge counselors. As the director for Camp Ockanickon, Bill en-sured each Boy Scout troop had a fulfilling ex-perience at the camp fires, the mess hall was well stocked and each counselor was pre-pared for the rigors the summer would bring. Additionally, he oversaw the implementation of the GE Betz Science Center, the first such center in the United States which provides an 
opportunity for scouts to earn STEM based merit badges. After a successful career with the Bucks County Council, Bill has moved on to spend more time with his family but has continued to impact the lives of our future leaders as the Director of Program Experience with the DelMarVa Council. I want to congratu-late him on a successful life committed to the tenants of the Scout Oath and Law and wish him happiness in all his future endeavors. I yield back.

HONORING PETRA C. KAATZ 
HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Wednesday, January 14, 2015 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
honor of Petra C. Kaatz, the National Presi-dent of the Jewish War Veterans Department of Florida Ladies Auxiliary. Her diligence on behalf of our men and women in uniform is a testament to her dedication to our country, and she rightfully deserves our recognition and admiration. 
Petra Kaatz started a long and fulfilling ca-
reer as a member of the Long Island Civil Air Patrol, where she became a flight nurse and ran a stewardess training program for female cadets. At the age of 22, she became the head nurse of a medical surgical unit and later served as PTA President at United Cerebral Palsy of Queens and Children’s Rehabilitation Center. She became President of the Queens Hospital Center Community Advisory Board and served as a representative for the United Nations Year of the Disabled. She also estab-lished and ran a Cub Scout pack for disabled children at the Henry Viscardi School in Al-bertson, New York and was editor of the PTA newsletter. 
Petra joined the Jewish War Veterans of the 
United States of America Ladies Auxiliary in 1994 and has been an active member ever since. Before becoming National President of the JWVA, she served as Queens County President, Department of New York President, and the chairman of various auxiliary, county, and department JWVA committees. She is a member of the Advisory Board of the national JWVA and life-member of the Ladies Auxiliary. 
Representing a district home to veterans of 
every major conflict since World War II, I know very well the sacrifices that our military fami-lies have made for our country. Petra Kaatz’s commitment to honor our military and their families should serve as an inspiration for us all, and I have no doubt she will continue to inspire South Floridians to live by her exam-ple.

House on the state of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 240) making ap-propriations for the Department of Home-land Security for the fiscal year ending Sep-tember 30, 2015, and for other purposes: 
Ms. VELA ´ZQUEZ. Mr. Chair, when it comes 
to protecting our homeland, it is incumbent on all of us—Democrats and Republicans—to put politics aside and work together. Yet, the exer-cise we are going through today risks not funding the Department of Homeland Security. 
We know that elements of this bill blocking 
the President’s immigration reforms will not become law. Republican Senators are already expressing their skepticism about this ap-proach. And, the President would veto this bill if it passed Congress with these provisions. So as the clock ticks down on funding for our homeland security agencies, why are we wast-ing time on this debate? 
Sadly, the answer is that the majority party 
is catering to its extreme wing—anti-immi-grant, tea party Republicans who are obses-sively focused on blocking the President. 
Mr. Chair, let’s be clear—the President 
acted when this House did not. Last Con-gress, the Senate passed legislation to fix our broken immigration laws. However, this body dawdled, delayed and ultimately did nothing. Finally, the President was forced to move for-ward alone. He took sensible steps—backed by legal precedent and well within his author-ity—that will resolve some of the worst flaws in our broken immigration system. 
Now, House Republicans are saying that 
unless they can block the President and pun-ish immigrants, they will jeopardize funding for the Secret Service, for the Coast Guard and the TSA. At a time when the world is reeling from horrific terrorist attacks in Paris, how can my colleagues play politics with funding for these agencies? This is cynical politics at its worst—and we must reject it.

PASTOR DAN Q. CARR 
HON. STEVEN M. PALAZZO 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Wednesday, January 14, 2015 
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I stand today 
to honor Pastor Dan Q. Carr of South Mis-sissippi’s Fourth Congressional District, on the occasion of the pastor’s 30th anniversary of ministry at Faith Baptist Church of Gulfport. 
Born in 1962, Pastor Carr found himself 
called to preach at a young age. He surren-dered to that call on January 17, 1985, and became pastor of Faith Baptist Church on that same day. On Sunday, January 18, 2015, his flock of family and friends will join together to honor Pastor Carr’s 30 years of faithful stew-ardship. 
On that fateful day in 1985, Faith Baptist 
Church began with nine dedicated members

and since has grown to a congregation of over 
one thousand. 
That type of growth, along with a steadfast 
pastor like Dan Carr, has allowed Faith Baptist Church to become a community leader of faith ministry and outreach. In the aftermath of Hur-ricane Katrina in 2005, Faith Baptist opened its doors as a relief station where thousands of Gulf Coast survivors found comfort, hope, and needed supplies in those troubled and un-certain times. 
Pastor Carr is married to his lovely wife 
Mickey, and together they share nine children and eleven grandchildren. Mississippi, Gulf-port, and the Fourth Congressional District are blessed by the continued ministry of Pastor Dan Carr. 
I congratulate Pastor Dan Carr on his 30th 
anniversary and wish the Faith Baptist Church family continued growth and success in min-istry for many more years to come.

TRIBUTE TO MR. DAN FAGER 
HON. CHARLES W. BOUSTANY, JR. 
OF LOUISIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Wednesday, January 14, 2015 
Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, today I would 
like to pay tribute to Mr. Dan Fager on his re-tirement with thirty-five years of service with Chevron Corporation. 
Dan was born and raised in Topeka, Kan-
sas, and he graduated from Topeka West High School in 1970. After high school he at-tended the University of Kansas for two years. He then transferred to Michigan State Univer-sity and graduated in 1974 with a degree in Criminal Justice. Dan was a police officer in Baltimore, Maryland for one year before head-ing back to the University of Kansas Law School, where he obtained a Juris Doctor de-gree in 1977. Dan lived in Denver right after law school where he worked as a law clerk for the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. 
Dan Fager began his career with Chevron in 
September of 1980 as a Land Representative in the Denver office. In 1985, he became Dis-trict Supervisor for Land. Dan then moved to Washington, DC as the Upstream Representa-tive in 1988 on a ‘‘temporary’’ assignment. That temporary assignment soon morphed into his permanent placement. 
Fager quickly became a highly respected 
and effective lobbyist in Washington, DC es-tablishing Chevron as a go-to company on Capitol Hill. His word was his bond and his fact-based approach and commitment to integ-rity made him indispensable to Chevron and the people in Washington with whom he worked. 
His accomplishments are numerous, includ-
ing the Unocal acquisition for Chevron, first preserving Chevron’s right to operate in Burma and then later helping to lift the sanc-tions that allowed the U.S. to normalize the commercial relationship. He also played a key role ensuring that U.S. tax policy encouraged U.S. investment in oil and gas. 
As the head of Chevron’s federal affairs 
team, Dan managed a staff of four. While his tendency to play the ‘‘devil’s advocate’’ could sometimes frustrate the team, they agree that his challenges helped them sharpen their lob-bying skills. 
Anyone who knows Dan will describe him 
as a true gentleman with a bi-partisan spirit. He is well respected for both his knowledge 
on issues and his calm and kind demeanor. He is a consummate professional, with a warm sense of humor and strong work ethic. I am proud to call him a personal friend. 
I congratulate Dan on his retirement and 
thank him for his diligent service to the energy industry. I wish him all the best that retirement has to offer.

HONORING ALITHER MAE 
STEPHENS 
HON. JOHN R. CARTER 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Wednesday, January 14, 2015 
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Alither Mae Stephens of Copperas Cove, Texas as she celebrates her 100th birthday on January 15, 2015. Even with a century of living behind her, she remains a vibrant part of her growing central Texas com-munity. 
Born in Cassatt, South Carolina, Alither kept 
her southern heritage alive when she moved to Copperas Cove. Devoted to family, Alither and her beloved Edward had one daughter, eight grandchildren, and numerous great- grandchildren. She knows the keys to a long life are eating healthy, staying positive, and re-maining active. Alither continues to cook for herself and church, bowling, and civic duties help fill her days. 
In her century of living, Alither witnessed her 
nation’s brave soldiers defend freedom on for-eign shores, watched a humble midwesterner take mankind’s first steps on another world, and marveled at technological advances be-yond any of her dreams. She listened to the soaring words of a southern minister as he worked to bring equality to all Americans and she saw people of all races, creeds, and back-grounds join together to make our nation a beacon of hope and freedom. Alither saw how America has been defined by extraordinary men and women who fought for a country brave enough to confront its past imperfec-tions and hopeful enough to embrace a better tomorrow. 
The City of Copperas Cove, Texas pro-
claimed January 15, 2015 as Alither Mae Ste-phens Day, a fitting tribute to an amazing lady who has lived a long life, blessing all she has come into contact with along the way. I join her family and friends in celebrating Alither as we wish her the happiest of birthdays and 
nothing but health and prosperity in the years ahead.

Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the House Resolution Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the Citizens’ Stamp Advisory Committee, as an entity of the United States Postal Service, should issue a commemorative stamp in honor of the holiday of Diwali. I am proud to be joined in this effort by my colleagues Congresswoman T
ULSI 
GABBARD , Congressman M IKEHONDA , Con-
gresswoman G RACE MENG, and Congressman 
AMIBERA. 
The five-day ‘‘festival of lights,’’ Diwali cele-
brates the triumph of good over evil, light over dark, and knowledge over ignorance. This fes-tive and important Indian holiday is celebrated by billions across the globe. Despite the sig-nificance of this holiday to many Americans, the United States Postal Service has not yet recognized Diwali with a commemorative stamp, as it has with other major religious and cultural holidays such as Christmas, Kwanzaa, Hanukkah, and Eid. 
As one of the world’s oldest religious holi-
days, Diwali has survived political, economic and social changes throughout history, while always carrying the universal symbolism of the victory of light, goodness, knowledge and truth. It is long overdue that we honor this sig-nificant holiday with a postage stamp of its own.

HONORING CHIEF RICHARD 
MELTON 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Wednesday, January 14, 2015 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor Napa Police Department (NPD) Chief Richard Melton upon his retire-ment. Capping off a long and impressive ca-reer in law enforcement, Chief Melton devoted the last ten years to serving and protecting our community as Chief of Police. 
Before coming to Napa, Chief Melton was 
the Chief of Police for both Farmington and Los Alamos, New Mexico Police Departments. Upon assuming the position of Chief of Police in Napa in 2004, Chief Melton immediately began improving the NPD’s relationship with the community as well as both the level of professionalism and education within the NPD. 
Chief Melton made it a priority for the NPD 
to forge a better working relationship with members of the homeless population in our community. As a result, the number of calls in-volving homeless persons decreased by 50 percent and the number of homeless persons arrested dropped by 50 percent. Chief Melton also worked to improve the NPD’s interactions 
with those in our community who suffer from mental health issues by bringing a part-time Napa County Mental Health Worker to the NPD. As Chief, Richard Melton recognized the importance of compassion, efficiency and pro-fessionalism when working with all members of our community. 
Chief Melton made significant progress in 
raising the level of education within the NPD. He always encouraged and supported his em-ployees to take advantage of training and edu-cational opportunities. He also raised the level of formal education for employees at the supervisorial and managerial levels. Chief Melton made a concerted effort to increase the level of professionalism within the NPD during his tenure, while still remaining ap-proachable and receptive to his employees. 
Mr. Speaker, Chief Melton’s career is noth-
ing short of impressive. On behalf of a grateful community, I wish him a most enjoyable retire-ment.

Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Tassos Efstratiades, Esq. of Cherry Hill, New Jersey for his achievements, con-tributions, and service to the people of New Jersey and its Hellenic community. 
Born in Athens, Greece, Mr. Efstratiades’ 
life has been an inspiration to the citizens of South Jersey.

Over his more than three decades practicing law, Mr. Efstratiades has published numerous law articles and now serves as the co-chair of the Philadelphia Bar Association’s Banking Committee. 
Mr. Efstratiades also served the people of 
New Jersey in a number of civic posts. He was a close advisor to Governor James Florio, served as a board member of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, and as chairman of the Governor’s Commission on International Trade among several other posi-tions. Currently, he is serving as a member of the New Jersey Health Care Administration Board. 
Mr. Efstratiades is a pillar of New Jersey’s 
Hellenic community. He was one of the found-ers of the Greek American Chamber of Com-merce of New Jersey, and served not only as the first chairman of its board, but later as its president as well. He was instrumental in the the creation of the Hellenic Federation of New Jersey and, after being elected its first presi-dent, he worked tirelessly to promote the inter-ests of the Greek Orthodox Church and the Hellenic community in New Jersey. In recogni-tion of his efforts, Mr. Efstratiades was made an Archon of the Ecumenical Patriarchate by His All Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bar-tholomew I. 
Mr. Speaker, Tassos Efstratiades, Esq. is a 
great man who exemplifies the American spir-it. I join the Hellenic Federation and all of New Jersey in honoring the achievements of this exceptional man. PERSONAL EXPLANATION

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Wednesday, January 14, 2015 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor and pay tribute to an individual whose commitment and contributions to the City of Murrieta, California are exceptional. Murrieta has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedi-cated community leaders who willingly and un-selfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Murrieta Fire Chief, Matt Shobert, is one of these individuals. On Tuesday, January 20, 2015, Matt Shobert will be honored for his de-voted and valiant service to the people of Murrieta. 
Matt began his firefighting career in Tucson, 
Arizona, actively working his way to leading the fire department in Sedona, Arizona. He then brought his talent and leadership to the Hemet Fire Department, in which he served as Fire Chief for three years. Matt was then ap-pointed as Murrieta’s Fire Chief in March of 2011 in which he enthusiastically served the community for nearly four years. 
Chief Shobert holds a Master Degree in Or-
ganizational Management, a Bachelor’s De-gree in Business Management and an Associ-ate’s Degree in Fire Science. In addition, Matt also graduated from the National Fire Acad-emy’s Executive Fire Officers’ Program, has been accredited three times as a Chief Fire Officer Designee by the Center for Public Safety Excellence and has also been awarded membership into the Institution of Fire Engi-neers. 
Chief Matt Shobert is retiring after incurring 
a devastating injury while doing what he en-joyed most, keeping the people of Murrieta safe. Throughout his tenure, Fire Chief Matt Shobert continued the distinguished history of the Murrieta Fire Department, working daily to improve the partnership held with the commu-nity and by enhancing the strong sense of ca-maraderie amongst the firefighters in his de-partment. 
Fire Chief Matt Shobert has been an excel-
lent public servant who has consistently pro-vided for the safety and well-being of the com-munity of Murrieta. His legacy will serve as a shining example and constant reminder of what it means to be a public servant and I am proud to call Matt a fellow community mem-ber, American and friend. I know that many are grateful for his service and salute him in his retirement.

HON. HENRY CUELLAR

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Wednesday, January 14, 2015 
Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate a momentous occasion: the 100th anniversary of the Laredo Chamber of Com-merce. For one century, this organization has been an instrumental and encouraging part of our community that wishes to see our city con-tinue to grow and move forward. 
The Laredo Chamber of Commerce was 
founded in April of 1915 in Laredo, Texas. It is the largest and oldest business organization in Laredo, representing over 650 members from numerous industries, including financial institutions, retailers, and service providers. It is a voluntary, not-for-profit association that in-spires development in business and tourism, and is a voice for the local business commu-nity. The Chamber is also a member of other associations such as the American Chamber of Commerce, the Texas Association of Mexi-can American Chambers of Commerce, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
It is in the Laredo Chamber of Commerce’s 
mission statement that it is their duty to be proactive in order to further the success of the Laredo area while also strengthening the ad-vancement of development in areas such as infrastructure and resources. In addition, the Chamber provides various workshops for com-munity members, such as seminars, trainings, and informative customer service sessions. 
Mr. Speaker, I am honored to have the op-
portunity to recognize the Laredo Chamber of Commerce for their hard work and endless ef-fort in improving our community these past 100 years. I thank you for this time.

Ms. LINDA T. SA ´NCHEZ of California. Mr.

Since 2011, Ms. Mayer has lent her experience as a skilled lawyer and manager to the Committee’s im-portant work of enforcing the House ethics rules. She managed a team of attorneys and investigators that successfully handled a busy docket of investigations. 
During that time, she provided wise counsel 
to the Committee Members, guiding us through complicated issues and difficult choices. She instilled in her team a strong sense of the value of public service and a dedication to finding the truth, with fairness and impartiality. Deb’s entire career has been dedicated to public service—as a paramedic, in uniform, and as an attorney. 
Although she is leaving the House, she will 
continue her impressive record of public serv-ice as staff director for the Senate Ethics Committee. As she begins her new role, we pause to note that we will miss her leadership and her talents, but we know she will remain our friend. Congratulations, Deb, and good luck.

SHARON MENDOZA DOUGHTY 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Wednesday, January 14, 2015 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
memory of Sharon Mendoza Doughty, who passed away on November 19, 2014 following a long battle with cancer. A pioneering ranch-er, conservationist, teacher, winemaker and a natural leader, Ms. Doughty was a positive force within the local community. 
Sharon Doughty grew up on her parents’ 
historic B Ranch on the Point Reyes Penin-sula. After the passing of her second husband, Bill Bianchini Jr., in the early 1980s, she took over the daily operations of their 800-acre dairy. Transitioning from a career as an ac-countant and teacher, Sharon Doughty be-came a full-time rancher with the help of her close family and friends. 
Through her comprehensive knowledge of 
the dairy trade, Ms. Doughty became a natural leader within the North Bay dairy community and leaves behind a long legacy of positive impacts. The depth of her commitment to 
Marin County agriculture united fellow ranch-ers and helped to propel their products into national markets. A dedicated advocate for the preservation of local agricultural lands, Ms. Doughty served two terms as the president of the Marin Agricultural Land Trust and one term as a member of the California Coastal Commission. She selflessly devoted her time and expertise to the Marconi Conference Cen-ter in Marshall and 4-H. Among her many hon-ors, in 2007, Ms. Doughty was named the ‘‘Woman of the Year’’ for California’s 6th As-sembly District for her exceptional community leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, Sharon Doughty’s life teaches 
us that one woman can make a substantial difference. Her efforts will not soon be forgot-ten as much of her legacy lives on all around us in Marin County and beyond. It is therefore appropriate that we pay tribute to her today and express our deepest condolences to her husband Steve; daughters Kathleen von Raesfeld and Karen Taylor; brothers Joseph Mendoza Jr. and James Mendoza; grand-children Audrey and Nina von Raesfeld, Camilla, William Joseph, and Eva Taylor; and nephew Will Clark.

STOPPING OBAMA’S AMNESTY 
HON. BILL SHUSTER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Wednesday, January 14, 2015 
Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, America is a 
nation of immigrants. Since the earliest days of our nation, countless generations have come from around the world to build a better life here for themselves, their children and their families. 
But we are also a nation built on the rule of 
law, and those who enter our country illegally disregard those laws. 
Illegal immigration is an injustice to every 
single person who followed the proper proce-dure when they came to the United States, and in an age of international terrorism and global pandemics, it presents a serious na-tional security risk. 
What we don’t need right now is amnesty. 
Instead, we need strict border security and the proper enforcement of the laws we already have on the books. 
Unfortunately, our president does not feel 
the same way. 
Upon discovering he could not get support 
from Congress, he decided to circumvent the legislative branch through executive action and grant amnesty to millions of illegal immi-grants. 
He disregarded both the will of the Amer-
ican people and the separation of powers that our founding fathers laid out for our govern-ment. 
By ignoring the core parts of our democ-
racy, President Obama has shamefully over-stepped his Constitutional authority. 
A nation is nothing without total control over 
the sovereignty of its borders, and this execu-tive action has only made the situation worse by offering a powerful incentive for more peo-ple to enter illegally. 
Make no mistake: I am and always will be 
100 percent opposed to blanket amnesty for il-legal immigrants.

In the last election, the American people 
sent a message and elected Republicans to a majority in both the House and Senate. 
Congress is now in a much stronger posi-

That is why I am proud to stand here today 
with my colleagues to put a halt to this out-
rageous example of executive overreach, and to tell this president that he is not above the law.

HONORING THE 25TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE PUEBLO GARDENS NEIGHBORHOOD DR. MARTIN LU-THER KING, JR. BREAKFAST 
HON. RAU´L M. GRIJALVA 
OF ARIZONA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Wednesday, January 14, 2015 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I wish to rec-
ognize the Pueblo Gardens Neighborhood As-sociation’s Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Break-fast on the occasion of its 25th Anniversary this Saturday, January 17, 2015. 
This breakfast tradition was established in 
Tucson in 1990 by community activists John McNair and Edwina Gomez along with others to honor the great civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. They are working to keep his dream of fair and equitable treatment alive by fundraising for at-risk neighborhood youth to help them achieve their own dreams. In turn, youth are asked to perform community service projects that benefit the city of Tucson. In 1997, long-time community activist, James E. Christopher became Chairman of the program. As Chairman for the past eighteen years, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Breakfast has in-creased in attendance from thirteen people in its first breakfast to an average of one hun-dred and seventy-five in current years. 
Pueblo Gardens’ Martin Luther King, Jr. 
Breakfast has the distinguished honor of being the sole neighborhood in Tucson to attract city, county, state, and federal dignitaries, along with radio, television and newspaper coverage for an event of its kind. 
Dr. King’s dream has started to come to 
light with the election of an African-American president, Latina woman sworn into the Su-preme Court, the acknowledgement of gay members in the military, and so forth. The Martin Luther King, Jr. Breakfast funding has enabled many youth to graduate from high school and continue on to receive post-sec-ondary education certificates and degrees. Many of these youth have become part of the Tucson workforce and are valuable assets to the community. 
Finally, I must acknowledge the cast of 
dedicated volunteer board members who work diligently to fundraise and continue the break-fast tradition while working through the Pueblo Garden Neighborhood Association, a des-ignated 501(c)(3) organization. 
Congratulations and best wishes to the

ACHIEVEMENT OF MAJOR WIL-LIAM BRURING 
HON. RON KIND 
OF WISCONSIN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Wednesday, January 14, 2015 
Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor 
of the career of Major William E. Bruring. Major Bruring began his career with the Civil Air Patrol as a high school student in Decem-ber of 1941. He joined the organization right after the Pearl Harbor attacks, when his men-tor, Roy E. Kumm, began Civil Air Patrol orga-nizational meetings in the 32nd Red Arrow Wisconsin U.S. Army Division. Major Bruring was just 18 years old when he joined. 
In Wisconsin, the Civil Air Patrol served 
many purposes. They towed aerial targets for student pilots, performed pre-flight training and handled other home front duties, such as war drives, collecting supplies and assembling medical kits to be deployed overseas to Amer-ican troops in need of relief. Major Bruring also served as a paratrooper in the Army dur-ing World War II, volunteering for service when he graduated high school in 1943, and served in the Navy during the Korean War. When he returned home, he continued to serve in the Civil Air Patrol, and continues to serve in the organization today. Every Memo-rial Day, Major Bruring helps to coordinate ceremonies honoring America’s veterans. 
On December 10th, 2014, Major Bruring 
was honored with the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest distinction awarded to civil-ians in the United States, for his dedication and service in the Civilian Air Patrol during World War II. He is but one example of the brave men and women of Wisconsin who serve their country. 
It is with great pleasure that I extend these 
words of congratulations, as well as words of sincere appreciation, for all that Major Bruring has done for western and central Wisconsin. His service, both as a civilian in the Civil Air Patrol and as a soldier in World War II and Korea, are worthy of the highest praise, and he is certainly deserving of the Congressional Gold Medal. I wish him the best of luck in the years to come.

TRIBUTE TO ANTHONY HO 
HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON 
OF IDAHO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Wednesday, January 14, 2015 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
commend Mr. Anthony Chung-Yi Ho. Mr. Ho has served with distinction as Deputy Director of the Congressional Liaison Division of the Taiwan Economic and Cultural Representative Office. His leadership and expertise have been invaluable in working with me and my staff and many other congressional offices on Capitol Hill. I want to congratulate him for moving back to his home country of Taiwan, and thank him for his many years of service. 
Mr. Ho has worked closely with my staff for 
many years on many matters related to U.S.- Taiwan relations. Thanks in large part to his efforts, my staff and I have engaged many times on matters important to Taiwanese- American interests and our shared values of 
democracy, freedom and human rights. 
In addition, over the years the State of 
Idaho has maintained a fruitful relationship with the Taiwan Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Under Mr. Ho’s guidance, our office has cul-tivated a valuable relationship with the Taiwan Foreign Ministry, which has benefited both Idaho and Taiwan greatly. 
Taiwan is one of Idaho’s top trading part-
ners, and many sectors of the Idaho economy benefit from the strong ties between the U.S. and Taiwan. Mr. Ho has fully dedicated him-self to strengthening this relationship, and my constituents and I are very grateful for his ef-forts in this regard. 
I commend Anthony Ho for his dedication to 
the enduring friendship and respect between the U.S. and Taiwan. It has been an honor and a pleasure to work with him, and we will greatly miss him when he leaves Washington, D.C. I join many of my colleagues and their staffs in recognizing the devotion of Mr. An-thony Chung-Yi Ho and for his exceptional service and immense contributions to strength-ening relations between Taiwan and the United States.

HONORING TONY PADILLA 
HON. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM 
OF NEW MEXICO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Wednesday, January 14, 2015 
Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New 
Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Tony Padilla, a community icon, loving father and proud New Mexican. 
Tony was a lifelong resident of Los Padillas, 
a community he cherished in the South Valley of Bernalillo County. Tony never forgot his roots; he lived them every day of his life. He had a fiery passion, deep conviction and heartfelt desire to improve the lives of his friends and neighbors. 
Many vividly recall his many years at the 
Bernalillo County Fire Commission where he could be found marking the scene of a fire and training young firefighters on necessary skills they would need on the job. He always had a presence in the community; whether it was helping families grieve the tragic loss of a loved one, supporting the Rio Grande High School baseball team and Los Padillas Com-munity Center, or standing up for his fellow South Valley residents. 
A piece of Tony will live on forever in all of 
us; that characteristic ‘‘Hey neighbor’’ from across the yard followed by a vibrant smile, those routine visits to the Post Office for a brisk and engaging conversation, the fun and laughter at the church Fiesta, the insightful life lessons and the endless love he had for ev-eryone he met. 
Tony demonstrates the impact that one indi-
vidual can have on an entire community and serves as an inspiration for future generations of New Mexicans. His warmth, dedication and selflessness were felt by all. My thoughts and prayers are with family, friends and everyone who experienced Tony’s generosity and com-passion. May the memory of Tony live on in our hearts.

29TH ANNIVERSARY OF REV. DR. 
MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. HOLI-DAY 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Wednesday, January 14, 2015 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this year, 
the nation observes for the 29th time the Mar-tin Luther King, Jr. Holiday. 
Each year this day is set aside for Ameri-
cans to celebrate the life and legacy of a man who brought hope and healing to America. 
The Martin Luther King Holiday reminds us 
that nothing is impossible when we are guided by the better angels of our nature. 
Dr. King’s inspiring words filled a great void 
in our nation, and answered our collective longing to become a country that truly lived by its noblest principles. 
Yet, Dr. King knew that it was not enough 
just to talk the talk; he had to walk the walk for his words to be credible. 
And so we commemorate on this holiday 
the man of action, who put his life on the line for freedom and justice every day. 
We honor the courage of a man who en-
dured harassment, threats and beatings, and even bombings. 
We commemorate the man who went to jail 
29 times to achieve freedom for others, and who knew he would pay the ultimate price for his leadership, but kept on marching and pro-testing and organizing anyway. 
Dr. King once said that we all have to de-
cide whether we ‘‘will walk in the light of cre-ative altruism or the darkness of destructive selfishness. 
‘‘Life’s most persistent and nagging ques-
tion,’’ he said, is ‘‘what are you doing for oth-ers?’’ 
And when Dr. King talked about the end of 
his mortal life in one of his last sermons, on February 4, 1968 in the pulpit of Ebenezer Baptist Church, even then he lifted up the value of service as the hallmark of a full life: 
I’d like somebody to mention on that day 
Martin Luther King, Jr. tried to give his life serving others, he said. I want you to say on that day, that I did try in my life . . . to love and serve humanity. 
We should also remember that the Rev. Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr. was, above all, a per-son who was always willing to speak truth to power. There is perhaps no better example of Dr. King’s moral integrity and consistency than his criticism of the Vietnam War being waged by the Johnson Administration, an administra-tion that was otherwise a friend and champion of civil and human rights. 
Martin Luther King, Jr. was born in Atlanta, 
Georgia on January 15, 1929. 
Martin’s youth was spent in our country’s 
Deep South, then run by Jim Crow and the Klu Klux Klan. 
For young African-Americans, it was an en-
vironment even more dangerous than the one they face today. 
A young Martin managed to find a dream, 
one that he pieced together from his read-ings—in the Bible, and literature, and just about any other book he could get his hands on. 
And not only did those books help him edu-
cate himself, but they also allowed him to work through the destructive and traumatic ex-periences of blatant discrimination, and the 
discriminatory abuse inflicted on himself, his family, and his people. 
The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. that we 
celebrate today could have turned out to be just another African-American who would have had to learn to be happy with what he had, and what he was allowed. 
But he learned to use his imagination and 
his dreams to see right through those ‘‘White Only’’ signs—to see the reality that all men, and women, regardless of their place of origin, their gender, or their creed, are created equal. 
Through his studies, Dr. King learned that 
training his mind and broadening his intellect effectively shielded him from the demoralizing effects of segregation and discrimination. 
Dr. King was a dreamer. His dreams were 
a tool through which he was able to lift his mind beyond the reality of his segregated so-ciety, and into a realm where it was possible that white and black, red and brown, and all others live and work alongside each other and prosper. 
But the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was 
not an idle daydreamer. He shared his visions through speeches that motivated others to join the nonviolent effort to lift themselves from 
poverty and isolation and create a new Amer-ica where equal justice and institutions were facts of life. 
In the Declaration of Independence in 1776, 
Thomas Jefferson wrote, ‘‘We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all Men are Cre-ated Equal.’’ 
At that time and for centuries to come, Afri-
can-Americans were historically, culturally, and legally excluded from inclusion in that declara-tion. 
Dr. King’s ‘‘I Have a Dream’’ Speech, deliv-
ered 51 years ago, on August 28, 1963, was a clarion call to each citizen of this great na-tion that we still hear today. 
His request was simply and eloquently con-
veyed—he asked America to allow of its citi-zens to live out the words written in its Dec-laration of Independence and to have a place in this nation’s Bill of Rights. 
The 1960s were a time of great crisis and 
conflict. The dreams of the people of this country were filled with troubling images that arose like lava from the nightmares of violence and the crises they had to face, both domesti-cally and internationally. 
It was the decade of the Cuban Missile Cri-
sis, the Vietnam War, and the assassinations of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Mal-colm X, Presidential Candidate Robert Ken-nedy, and the man we honor here today. 
Dr. Martin Luther King’s dream helped us 
turn the corner on civil rights. 
It started with a peaceful march for suffrage 
that started in Selma, Alabama on March 7, 1965—a march that ended with violence at the hands of law enforcement officers as the marchers crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge. 
But the dream did not die there. Dr. King led the Montgomery Bus Boycott, 
begun with Rosa Parks, that lasted for 381 days, and ended when the United States Su-preme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to discriminate on account of race in the field of interstate public transportation. 
Dr. King used nonviolent tactics to protest 
against Jim Crow laws in the South and he or-ganized and led demonstrations for desegre-gation, labor and voting rights. 
When the life of Dr. Martin Luther King was 
stolen from us, he was still a very young man, only 39 years old. People remember that Dr. King died in 
Memphis, but few remember why he was there. 
On that fateful day in 1968 Dr. King came 
to Memphis to support a strike by the city’s sanitation workers. 
The sanitation workers there had recently 
formed a chapter of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees to demand better wages and working conditions. 
But the city refused to recognize their union, 
and when the 1,300 employees walked off their jobs the police broke up the rally with mace and police batons. 
It was then that union leaders invited Dr. 
King to Memphis. 
Despite the danger he might face entering 
such a volatile situation, it was an invitation he could not refuse. 
Not because he longed for danger, but be-
cause the labor movement was intertwined with the civil rights movement for which he had given up so many years of his life. 
The death of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr., will never overshadow his life. 
That is his legacy as a dreamer and a man 
of action. 
It is a legacy of hope, tempered with peace. 
It is a legacy not quite yet fulfilled. 
I hope that Dr. King’s vision of equality 
under the law is never lost to us, who in the present, toil in times of unevenness in our equality. 
For without that vision—without that 
dream—we can never continue to improve on the human condition. 
For those who have already forgotten, or 
whose vision is already clouded with the fog of complacency, I would like to recite the immor-tal words of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.: 
I have a dream that one day on the red 
hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former shareholders will be able to sit down together at the table of brother-hood. 
I have a dream that one day even the State 
of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. 
I have a dream that my four little children 
will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but for the content of their character. 
I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day down in Ala-
bama with its vicious racists, with its Gov-ernor having his lips dripping with words of interposition and nullification—one day right there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with lit-tle white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. 
I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day every valley 
shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough place will be made plain and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it to-gether. 
Dr. King’s dream did not stop at racial 
equality; his ultimate dream was one of human equality and dignity. 
Dr. King believed that freedom and justice 
was the birthright of every individual in Amer-ica. 
It is for us, the living, to continue that fight 
today and forever, following in the great spirit that inspired the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

HONORING KYLE EAN LONG 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Wednesday, January 14, 2015 
Mr. D ESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of Kyle Ean Long, who was born in Sacramento on June 14, 1987, and died on January 10, 2015, at the very young age of 27. Kyle, the son of James and Tina Long, was born and raised in Sacramento, at-tended local public schools, and was a grad-uate of California State University, Sac-ramento. 
I have known Kyle for three years, begin-
ning when came to work in my California Cap-itol office in January of 2012 as an intern. Kyle swiftly became known as ‘‘Sunshine’’ for his positive attitude and infectious happiness. Kyle then worked for Assemblymember Tony Men-doza. After his work in the Assembly, Kyle worked for me as a Legislative Aide for two years as an integral team member, a role that he thrived in. 
Kyle was dependable and resourceful team 
member. As a college student, Kyle worked diligently towards a career in public policy. While attending college at Sacramento State University, Kyle honed his extraordinary peo-ple skills at Chicory Coffee in Sacramento, and became a familiar face to those working in the State Legislature. Kyle was a master of working with people of all backgrounds and of bringing people together. 
Kyle’s passion for public policy and his en-
thusiasm for bringing people together made him a highly effective Legislative Aide. During his tenure in the State Legislature, Kyle suc-cessfully steered bills through the legislative process that helped to provide counseling services for rape victims, to keep pesticides out of California schools, to provide school supplies for homeless children, and to close loopholes to keep drunk drivers off of the roads. 
In addition to being a valued colleague, Kyle 
was an important member of the State Senate family, a beloved friend, and an integral mem-ber of the community. Kyle made sure to have dinner with his grandmother every Tuesday, was always there to support his friends, and was looked up to by his two siblings and many cousins. 
Kyle was a committed public servant who 
considered his public policy work a privilege and took on his responsibilities with a strong sense of duty. He was a dependable, re-sourceful team player who was a beloved col-league with a bright future ahead of him. Kyle’s tragic loss is inexplicable, and I send my deepest condolences to his family, friends, and loved ones. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in honoring the extraordinary life of Kyle Long. The world is a brighter and better place be-cause of him.

DOLLY MAE NAVE 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Wednesday, January 14, 2015 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
honor of Dolly Nave, who passed away on De-cember 23, 2014, at her home in San Rafael, California. As a dedicated community orga-nizer and leader, Ms. Nave helped to trans-form recreational facilities in the City of San Rafael for the benefit of countless Marin County residents. 
In the 1980s, on behalf of Ms. Nave’s eight 
children and the children in the local commu-nity, Ms. Nave rallied the support of local con-tractors and volunteers to donate the equip-ment, labor, and funding necessary to breathe new life into public schools and city-owned recreation fields and facilities. Ms. Nave con-tinued to improve recreational facilities throughout her life, and founded the Marin Bocce Federation in Albert Park, San Rafael. 
Ms. Nave was a skillful community leader 
who processed the necessary organizational skills to always put the pieces in place and get the job done. She was the project manager for the construction of Marin Community Fields in Larkspur and was in the forefront of numerous projects at San Rafael High, initiating the suc-cessful ‘‘Save Night Football’’ campaign. A volunteer at Albert Park for 35 years, she be-came known as the ‘‘Angel of Albert Park’’ be-cause she was one of its foremost advocates. In 1993, she was a founding board member and construction chair of the Marin Bocce Federation in Albert Park. The six bocce courts are now used by more than 1,000 play-ers a week. 
Ms. Nave’s work did not go unnoticed, and 
her longstanding commitment to the others was recognized by numerous awards including 
San Rafael Citizen of the Year, the Marv Lechner Award from San Rafael High, and Woman of the Year for California’s Third Sen-ate District in 1991. She was also one of the first women to be inducted into the Marin Ath-letic Foundation High School Hall of Fame. 
Mr. Speaker, Dolly Nave’s selfless efforts 
have benefited countless residents of San Rafael and Marin County. Her legacy will not soon be forgotten as her accomplishments can be seen all around the City of San Rafael. It is therefore appropriate that we pay tribute to her today and express our deepest condo-lences to her husband, Rich; three sons, Rich-ard Jr., Paul and Tom; and three daughters, Sheri, Kathy and Patti; as well as her forty-two grandchildren and great grandchildren.

KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE ACT 
SPEECH OF  
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Friday, January 9, 2015 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak about the Keystone XL Pipeline Project and the legislation before us, H.R. 3. 
Mr. Speaker, the Keystone XL project pro-
posed by TransCanada, a Canadian company, would build new pipeline to transport Alberta oil sands crude and crude oil produced in North Dakota and Montana to a market hub in Nebraska, and from there to Gulf Coast refin-eries. 
The proposed pipeline would deliver an esti-
mated 830,000 barrels of oil per day. One of the most appealing aspects of the project is the positive economic impact it is expected to have on the economy. 
Let me just take one state’s economy and 
realize what would happen with this particular effort. There would be a $2.3 billion invest-ment in the Texas economy, creating more than 50,000 jobs in the Houston area, pro-viding $48 million in state and local tax reve-nues, and increasing the gross domestic prod-uct of the state by $1.9 billion. 
I favor the job creation potential of the Key-
stone XL Pipeline project, and voted accord-ingly less than a month and a half ago, on No-vember 14, which was H.R. 5682. Yet the leg-islation contains several provisions that are of great concern to me which I feel inclined to address. 
First, because the pipeline would cross an 
international border, construction requires a presidential permit and would be subject to applicable state laws and permitting require-ments. 
To issue a presidential permit, the State De-
partment, after consulting with other federal agencies and providing opportunities for public comment, must determine that the project would serve the national interest. 
Because the Keystone XL project would 
constitute a major federal action with a poten-tially significant environmental impact, it is also subject to environmental impact statement re-quirements of the National Environmental Pol-icy Act (NEPA). 
The bill, however, declares that a presi-
dential permit is not required for approval of the Keystone XL pipeline’s northern route from the Canadian border through Nebraska even

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E73 January 14, 2015 
though the project crosses an international 
border. This is unprecedented. 
Second, H.R. 3 deems that environmental 
impact statements issued to date would be considered sufficient to satisfy all requirements of the NEPA and the Endangered Species Act. 
As a senior member of the Committee on 
the Judiciary, I have a problem with ‘‘deem-ing’’ something done that has not been done in fact. 
Third, the bill vests exclusive jurisdiction re-
garding legal disputes over the pipeline or the constitutionality of this bill would be granted to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and requires claims regarding the pipeline to be brought within 60 days of the action that gives rise to the claim. 
It is unduly burdensome to require ag-
grieved parties to bear the considerable ex-pense and hardship of traveling from their homes in North or South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, or Texas to Washington, DC to vindicate their legal rights. 
Mr. Speaker, I also believe the bill before 
could have been improved had amendments been made in order. 
For example, two proposed amendments, 
one from a Democrats and one Republican, making oil sands petroleum eligible to pay an excise tax into the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund and another splitting revenue generated by the pipeline’s construction between DOE’s energy efficiency and renewable energy research and 
deficit reduction, were not made-in-order. 
Had the bill been subject to amendment and 
the amendments offered in the Rules Com-mittee been made in order and approved, the bill before us would be improved markedly. 
And Mr. Speaker, as the Leader of this 
body, you are well-aware that when amend-ments are made-in-order, the rank-and-file can at least feel that they had a say in the process but when a Closed Rule is put forth—it does not stoke optimism about the legislative proc-ess for the 114th Congress.
