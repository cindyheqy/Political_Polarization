PRAYER 
Reverend Timothy Kesicki, S.J., Jes-
uit Conference, Washington, D.C., of-fered the following prayer: 
In the book of Proverbs, chapter 10, 
we are taught, ‘‘He who gathers in summer is a son who acts wisely.’’ This wise pursuit from the wisdom of Sol-omon has built our Nation. 
Of this season, the African American 
poet from Dayton, Ohio, Paul Laurence Dunbar, writes: 
Oh, summer has clothed the earth 
In a cloak from the loom of the sun! And a mantle, too, of the skies’ soft blue, And a belt where the river run. 
O, ye who toil in the town, 
And ye who moil in the mart, Hear the artless song, and your faith made 
strong 
Shall renew your joy of heart. 
The fruits of the Earth from the 
bounty of our land are all Your gift. And we praise You this day, O God, for 
all who labor for our sustenance and those who govern our Nation. 
Amen.

BREAST CANCER AWARENESS 
COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT 
SPEECH OF  
HON. GARRET GRAVES 
OF LOUISIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, July 14, 2015 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, 
breast cancer is the most common cancer among American women, except for skin can-cers. In fact, current statistics show that about 1 in 8 women in the United States will develop invasive breast cancer during their lifetime. It is estimated that in the United States 231,840 women will be diagnosed with and 40,290 women will die of cancer of the breast in 2015. This means that every 13 minutes a woman dies of breast cancer in the United States. 
Due to early detection, increased awareness 
and improved approaches to treatment, death rates from breast cancer have decreased since 1989, but it is still the second leading cause of death in women. It is the most fre-quently diagnosed cancer among nearly every racial and ethnic group, including African American, American Indian, Alaska native, Asian/Pacific Islander and Hispanic/Latina women. African-American women have the highest death rates of all racial and ethnic groups overall and are at least 44 percent more likely to die of breast cancer as com-pared to other racial and ethnic groups. This is largely due to disease type and lack of ade-quate care. 
Approximately $16.5 billion is spent on 
breast cancer treatment in the United States according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The NCI also estimates that the cost of breast cancer treatment will continue to rise if current trends hold steady. Finding a cure for breast cancer is in the best interest of the American public and is a goal of the United States government. 
While combined funding for breast cancer 
research through the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense’s Breast Cancer Research Program and the National Cancer Institute approaches one billion dol-lars, additional private sector support for breast cancer research will help us find a cure even faster. 
H.R. 2722, the Breast Cancer Awareness 
Commemorative Coin Act is designed to gen-erate additional funding for breast cancer re-search at no cost to taxpayers. The bill com-pels the U.S. Treasury to raise money for breast cancer research through the sale of $5 pink gold coins, and $1 silver commemorative coins in 2018. The additional funding for breast cancer research will aid the efforts cur-rently underway to find a cure for this deadly cancer. 
This week, it was brought to the attention of 
this body that the largest non-government funder of breast cancer research and initially selected as one of the recipients of breast cancer research funding pursuant to H.R. 2722, issues grants to Planned Parenthood. 
This development gave me pause and con-flicted with my well-established pro-life convic-tions. While I commend work on breast cancer research, I am against any direct or indirect federal funding for abortion. 
I was pleased that we were able to resolve 
the issue by amending the recipient of funds generated pursuant to the Breast Cancer Awareness Commemorative Coin Act, H.R. 2722 and designating 100% of the funds to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. I supported the amended version of H.R. 2722 and was proud to see this legislation pass through the House. I encourage my col-leagues in the Senate take up this bill so that we can move forward with the good and nec-essary work of pursuing a cure for the most common cancer in women worldwide.

HONORING THE LIFE OF CHAD 
TAYLOR JOHNSON 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Monday, July 20, 2015 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Chad Taylor Johnson. Chad passed away on July 7, 2015, at the age of 32. 
Chad was an impressive young man who 
proudly served his country in the United States Army. As a decorated Army Forward Scout, Chad served our nation courageously in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He was a close friend of our family and he will be sorely missed by us, his family, his community and the nation he served. 
My prayers and condolences go out to 
Chad’s loving wife, Jennifer, and his parents, Tillman and Beverly Johnson.

150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NEW 
YORK FIRE DEPARTMENT 
HON. DANIEL M. DONOVAN, JR. 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Monday, July 20, 2015 
Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) in recognition of 150 years of dedi-cated service to the people of the City of New York. 
Since the founding of the FDNY in 1865, 
New York City firefighters have been a shining example of heroism, bravery, and civil service. For every moment of every day over the last 150 years, New York’s Bravest have risked their lives to save ours. 
Their bravery has never been more appar-
ent than on the morning of September 11th, 2001 when 343 members of the FDNY sac-rificed their lives as they rushed into the World Trade Center. It is the heroism that they dis-played not only on that day, but on every day, 
that makes me proud to call myself a New Yorker. 
Mr. Speaker, the dedication of the brave 
men and women of the FDNY to protecting and saving the lives of their fellow New York-ers on a daily basis is what makes their 150th Anniversary truly special. To each and every firefighter keeping the City of New York safe every day, I say thank you for consistently put-ting your lives on the line to protect ours.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 54TH 
MASSACHUSETTS VOLUNTEER INFANTRY REGIMENT 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Monday, July 20, 2015 
Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
recognition of the 54th Massachusetts Volun-teer Infantry Regiment. Established in 1863 as one of the first military units comprised of en-tirely African American soldiers to fight in the Civil War for the Union, the 54th Massachu-setts Volunteer Infantry Regiment will further be memorialized with the unveiling of a his-toric mural in New Bedford, Massachusetts. 
While the declaration of the Emancipation 
Proclamation on January 1, 1863 provided an avenue for free black men to serve as sol-diers, it remained the responsibility of state governors to raise regiments for federal serv-ice. Massachusetts Governor John A. An-drews became the first governor in the nation to authorize an all-African American voluntary infantry regiment. In three months’ time, the regiment had grown to consist of over 1,000 enlisted volunteers from across the Common-wealth, united under the command of Robert Gould Shaw, a white officer. Included among the regiment’s enlistees were none other than Charles and Lewis Douglass—two sons of the well-known writer and abolitionist, Frederick Douglass, as well as the first African American Congressional Medal of Honor recipient and one of New Bedford’s most famous sons, Ser-geant William H. Carney. 
It was not long after its formation that the 
54th Massachusetts Regiment earned the fighting recognition it had anticipated. Fol-lowing a joyous parade and honorary celebra-tion in the streets of Boston in May 1863, the regiment headed south to the hostile coast of South Carolina. By July 18, 1863, after several days of fighting on little sleep, food or water, the regiment prepared for an assault on Fort Wagner, which protected the Port of Charles-ton. 
Tragically, due to a fatal miscalculation of 
the number of Confederate troops, the 54th Massachusetts Regiment saw over 280 of its men killed, wounded, or captured during the siege on Fort Wagner, including Colonel Shaw. However, not all was lost. It was during this battle that the severely wounded Sergeant William H. Carney saved the regiment’s flag

from being captured by Confederate troops. 
Upon his return to his regiment, he famously shouted, ‘‘The Old Flag never touched the ground!’’ For these heroic actions, Sergeant Carney became the first African American sol-dier awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. 
The courage, bravery, and dedication dem-
onstrated by the 54th Massachusetts Volun-teer Infantry Regiment over 150 years ago lives on in the pride of our community. Now, thanks to the partnership of the New Bedford Historical Society, University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, Artworks, and the New Bedford National Historical Park, residents of and visi-tors to the City of New Bedford will further cel-ebrate the memory of Sergeant Carney and the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment with a mural depicting the gallant men of the Regiment in the exact spot where local New Bedford volunteers enlisted through-out the Civil War. 
Mr. Speaker, it brings me great pleasure to 
recognize the unveiling of this historic mural and to call attention yet again to the bravery and dedication of the men who served in the 54th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer In-fantry.

MAJOR THREATS TO RULE OF 
LAW IN RUSSIA 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Monday, July 20, 2015 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
discuss an issue of critical importance—the U.S. relationship with Russia. The U.S. has a complicated bilateral relationship with Russia, which includes a number of vital global issues including ISIL, Syria, Iran’s nuclear ambitions and peace in the Ukraine, among others. However, a central aspect in the relationship that must guide all of the issues is the rule of law—and Russia has shown little respect for this essential principle. 
As a Member of Congress of Polish descent 
and who is the co-chair and leader of a num-ber of country caucuses in the Congress, I am well aware of Russia’s sometimes unaccept-able behavior on the world stage. 
An important but not widely known rule of 
law issue, is the $50 billion arbitration brought against Russia by GML on behalf of the shareholders of Yukos Oil, whose company was illegally seized over a decade ago. In July of 2014, a tribunal in The Hague ruled that Russia violated the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT), and awarded Yukos a $50 billion arbi-
tration award. Since last summer, Russia has appealed the ruling, asking that it be set aside and dismissed by the Dutch Courts, a review process that could continue for 10 years. 
In the decision, an independent arbitral tri-
bunal sitting in The Hague ruled unanimously that the actions of the Russian Federation were politically motivated and constituted ex-propriation of the majority shareholders’ in-vestment in Yukos. The roots of the ECT date back to political initiatives in Europe following the end of the Cold War. The fundamental aim of the ECT is to strengthen the rule of law on energy issues by creating a level playing field of rules to be observed by all governments who are signatories to the Treaty. 
Mr. Speaker, Russia needs to do much bet-
ter in respecting rule of law, international insti-tutions and global treaties. The GML case is a bellwether for Russia’s behavior, intentions and future actions. It will help demonstrate if Russia will truly be accountable under rule of law and serve as a constructive partner in the global community. I urge my colleagues to learn more by reading the November 15, 2014 article in The Economist entitled, ‘‘The Yukos affair: The chase is on.’’ It is a case the U.S. Administration and Congress should follow closely to strongly support and urge adher-ence to the rule of law.

TRIBUTE TO PROFESSOR MWANGI 
S. KIMENYI, SENIOR FELLOW AND FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE AFRICAN GROWTH INITIATIVE AT THE BROOKINGS INSTITU-TION 
HON. KAREN BASS 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Monday, July 20, 2015 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to re-
member the late Professor Mwangi S. Kimenyi, senior fellow and former director of 
the Africa Growth Initiative at the Brookings In-stitution, who passed away on June 6, 2015. 
I had the honor of working with Professor 
Kimenyi over the last several years. I drew on his expertise for one of the ‘‘Africa Policy Breakfasts’’ I hosted earlier this year that drew hundreds of people. 
You just needed to listen to Professor 
Kimenyi speak for a few minutes to under-stand that he was one of the foremost schol-ars and experts in the relationship between the United States and the nations of the Afri-can continent. His breadth of knowledge stretched from institutions of higher education as well as the non-profit sector. He drew on his ability to teach from his years of experi-ence as a former professor at the University of Mississippi and the University of Connecticut. He was the founding executive director of the Kenya Institute for Public Policy Research and Analysis, a resource person with the African Economic Research Consortium, and a re-search associate with the Center for the Study of African Economies, University of Oxford. 
He was rightly recognized for his years of 
work when he received the Outstanding Re-search Award from the Global Development Network in 2001 and the Georgescu-Roegen Prize in Economics in 1991. In 1994, Pro-fessor Kimenyi was also named by Policy Re-view among the top 10 young market econo-mists in the United States. 
The House of Representatives voted to give 
final Congressional passage to the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Renewing AGOA was only possible because of the work of Pro-fessor Kimenyi and the hundreds of Africans like him who committed themselves to ensur-ing that the United States and the nations on the African continent became true partners that work together to benefit our respective people and economies. 
I join with so many in sending my condo-
lences to Professor Kimenyi’s family, friends, colleagues and everyone who benefited from his years of work and his commitment to the relationship between the United States and the countries on the African continent. Al-though he has left us, his work will benefit people for generations to come.
