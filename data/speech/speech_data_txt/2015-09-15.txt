PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. Gracious God, the center of our joy, 
we thank You for all the blessings we receive daily as gifts from You. Though we don’t deserve them, Your mercies provide for all our needs. 
Help our lawmakers this day to move 
from simply knowing about You into a vital relationship based on faith in the unfolding of Your loving providence. Inspire them to rely on Your love as they seek to live faithfully. 
As You cleanse our hearts and keep 
us clean, birth within us all a burning desire to flee from all habitual and willful sin. 
We pray in Your merciful Name. 
Amen.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. 
SASSE). The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
REMEMBERING STATE TROOPER 
JOSEPH PONDER 
Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, Jo-
seph Ponder was proud to be a Ken-tucky State police trooper. ‘‘He was eager and just absolutely loved his job,’’ is how a State police spokesman described him. Ponder tragically lost his life in the 
line of duty this week. We are thinking of that 31-year-old Rineyville native today in the Senate. We are praying for his family and for his friends. 
I know his fellow officers in the law 
enforcement community feel the loss and so do Kentuckians whom he worked every day to protect. So I ask the entire Senate community to join me in honoring Trooper Ponder. 
f 
NUCLEAR AGREEMENT WITH IRAN 
Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, on 
a different matter, as the Senate con-tinues debating President Obama’s deal with Iran today, I think it is appro-priate to consider a quote from the President himself. Here is what he said: 
I believe Congress owes the American peo-
ple a final up-or-down vote. We need courage. You know, in the end, this debate is about far more than politics. 
When it comes to the Iran deal, you 
would have to say the President is right. After all, do Senators think it is right for the world’s leading sponsor of terror to be able to maintain an Amer-ican-recognized nuclear program? Do Senators think it is right that this deal would effectively subsidize Hezbollah, Hamas, and Bashar al-Assad by chan-neling literally billions of dollars to their benefactors in Tehran? Do Sen-ators approve of a deal that would leave Iran with an enrichment capa-bility just as the Iranian leadership is again calling for Israel’s destruction and praying for ours as well? It is hard to see how Senators could agree with these things. 
Many Democratic colleagues, includ-
ing the top Democrats on the Foreign Affairs Committees in both Houses of Congress who are among the most fa-miliar with the President’s deal with Iran, have already come out in opposi-tion. A strong bipartisan majority of the House of Representatives voted to reject the deal. A strong bipartisan ma-jority of the Senate would vote to re-ject it as well, if only Democratic Sen-
ators would stop blocking the Amer-ican people from even having a final vote on one of the most consequential foreign policy issues of our time. 
Democratic Senators will have a 
chance to vote on behalf of their con-stituents later today. Perhaps they will consider the President’s words I quoted earlier. It is from a 2010 speech about ObamaCare. If the President was so insistent on ‘‘courage’’ and a ‘‘final up-or-down vote’’ back then on ObamaCare, how can he justify block-ing a vote now on an issue of such im-mense magnitude as the Iran deal? It is part of a larger retreat to campaigning instead of engaging on this important issue, ad hominem attacks instead of serious debate, campaign one-liners in-stead of intellectual arguments, and simply ignoring reality when it be-comes inconvenient. That is why you see the President claiming ‘‘strong sup-port of lawmakers and citizens’’ for his Iran deal. 
Well, here is what the Washington 
Post’s Fact Checker had to say about that: 
Any way you slice it, it is difficult to sup-
port the claim that there is ‘‘strong support’’ for the Iran deal among lawmakers and citi-zens. This is clearly a case of winning ugly, in the face of minority support among law-makers and increasing opposition among American citizens. 
The White House certainly did better than 
many analysts expected, since enough Demo-crats supported the agreement to prevent a final Senate vote on the merits. And Obama avoided a veto fight. But that’s different than having ‘‘strong support’’ for the deal. 
That is the Washington Post Fact 
Checker. 
So if Democrats share the President’s 
determination to ‘‘win ugly’’ on this important issue, then they have suffi-cient numbers to do that, apparently, but I would remind my colleagues of something. This debate should not be about a President who will leave office in 16 months. It should be about where our country will be in 16 years.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6616 September 15, 2015 
Consider this advice from an edi-
torial that appeared in Bloomberg last month: 
Tactics aside, it would be far better to win 
this fight fairly. The pact is not a treaty: A future President and Congress might over-turn it, arguing that it was sealed without proper consideration. And history often looks with disgust at causes built on fear, es-pecially if they go awry. 
This is an important moment for the 
Democratic Party, but more impor-tantly it is an important moment for our country. Let’s stand up for the peo-ple we represent. Let’s allow them to vote on what is one of the most con-sequential foreign policy issues of our age.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Democratic leader is recognized.

NUCLEAR AGREEMENT WITH IRAN 
Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend 
the Republican leader, among other things, said he wanted an intellectual argument. The outline he just gave has nothing to do with intellectual credi-bility. 
The agreement that was finalized 
last week dealt with one subject and one subject only: whether Iran should have a nuclear weapon, and that an-swer was resoundingly no. That is what it was all about. All the other rhetoric my Republican friend talked about is not in keeping with what the agree-ment is all about. He tried to make the agreement that was finalized into something it isn’t. I would suggest in the future, realistically, the Repub-lican leader should be factual on what the agreement is between Iran and China, Russia, Great Britain, Germany, France, and the United States because what he just outlined has nothing to do with what the actual facts are. 
f 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. REID. Mr. President, it comes as 
no surprise to anyone watching the Senate that the Republican leader and I disagree on many things, but I was very glad to hear the Republican leader say last week that he believes any gov-ernment funding bill must be clean and that using the appropriations process as a vehicle to attack women’s health is, as he said, ‘‘an exercise in futility.’’ 
I am sure not everyone on his side of 
the aisle agrees with him, but there is no doubt it is the right thing to do. I agree that any budget deal must be clean; that is, no riders—nothing with Planned Parenthood, nothing with re-pealing what the Environmental Pro-tection Agency has done, no repealing what the Dodd-Frank bill put into ef-fect to stop us from having another Wall Street meltdown, no riders deal-ing with immigration—just a clean continuing resolution for a short pe-riod of time to allow us to do a more full and more complete deal in the very 
near future. 
I agree any budget bill must be clean. 
I say that again. I am glad to see the Republican leader coming around to that. Democrats will not support a con-tinuing resolution that has all these riders on it and especially a Planned Parenthood rider that was talked about so much in the House. 
I read in the paper today that there 
are 32 Republicans in the House who have signed a letter to the Speaker saying they are not going to vote for anything unless it defunds Planned Parenthood. That is a nonstarter and the Republican leader rightly has ac-knowledged that. I am glad the Repub-lican leader wants a clean continuing resolution instead of one that attacks women’s health. 
I am disappointed by his refusal at 
this stage to negotiate with the White House or any Democrats in the House or in the Senate dealing with the budg-et. We have a looming government shutdown. It is right before our eyes. The Republican leader has already wasted far too much time dithering and doing nothing on that. We know from experience 2 years ago that the Republicans actually did shut down the government for almost 3 weeks. For months, we have overheard them call-ing for bipartisan budget negotiations. We have 9 session days left before the government shuts down. Now is the time to sit down—Democrats, Repub-licans, getting the White House in-volved—and negotiate a bipartisan funding measure for the rest of the year, but by the look of this week’s schedule, the Republican leader doesn’t seem to be in any hurry to avoid a shutdown. That is truly unfortunate. 
The Republican leader has not sched-
uled any budget votes today. Instead, the Senate will waste precious time on another failed vote. And then what comes next? What is the Republican leader’s plan for the rest of the week? Political show votes on abortion that have nothing to do with keeping the Federal Government open. There is no reason why we can’t pass a bipartisan funding measure as soon as possible— this week, even. But that depends on the Republican leader’s willingness to sit down and negotiate, and sooner rather than later. Then, Congress can move on to our next budget priority: reversing sequestration and its harmful cuts. 
f 
HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH 
Mr. REID. Mr. President, today, Sep-
tember 15, marks the beginning of His-panic Heritage Month, a celebration that dates back to 1968. 
This month also includes the anni-
versary of independence for many Latin American countries. Hispanic Heritage Month is an opportunity for us as a nation to recognize, celebrate, and honor the history, culture, and contributions of America’s Latino com-munity. We see those contributions in all fac-
ets of our society, from the battlefields to the boardrooms and from the class-rooms to the halls of government. Every segment of American life has been enriched by Latinos and their proud culture. Without the contribu-tions made by generations of Latinos, Nevada and the United States would not be what we are today. 
In Nevada, Hispanic influence and 
history is everywhere. Consider the name of my State and the name of our most famous city. ‘‘Nevada’’ means snow covered. ‘‘Las Vegas’’ means the meadows. Las Vegas, one of the most famous cities in the world, has a His-panic name. Today, more than one- quarter of Nevada’s population is His-panic. 
Nationally, Latino Americans num-
ber nearly 60 million and are expected to make up to 60 percent of the popu-lation growth in coming decades. America’s future depends on a strong and prosperous Hispanic population. 
That is why Democrats have fought 
hard for policies to protect Hispanic 
families and strengthen Hispanic com-munities. We passed the Affordable Care Act, which allows millions of Latinos to have access to affordable health care. Because of the Affordable Care Act, 4.2 million previously unin-sured Latinos now have health insur-ance. An estimated 8.8 million Latinos are newly covered for expanded preven-tive services, with no cost-sharing, in-cluding mammograms, colonoscopy screenings, and immunization vaccines under the Affordable Care Act. 
Democrats also passed the bipartisan 
comprehensive immigration reform bill out of the Senate a couple years ago. That legislation, which House Repub-licans refused to consider, even though it would have passed overwhelmingly— all Democrats would have voted for it and enough Republicans would have voted for it to be an overwhelming vic-tory—but it didn’t happen. The Repub-licans refused to consider something that protected families, reduced the deficit, and strengthened our national security. 
We also supported President Obama’s 
Executive actions, which, as we speak, are protecting immigrant families from the threat of deportation and tak-ing criminals off the streets. Mean-
while, Republicans are doing every-thing in their power to undermine His-panic families. A person need only watch 5 minutes of a Republican Presi-dential debate to see how Republicans really feel about America’s Latino communities. Republicans are clam-oring to amend the Constitution to re-peal birthright citizenship. Repub-licans want to roll back President Obama’s Executive actions that are keeping families together and pre-venting DREAMers from being de-ported. 
Republicans are constantly attacking 
the Affordable Care Act, which has cov-ered 4.2 million previously uninsured Latinos with health insurance. Repub-licans refuse to boost the minimum

wage, blocking millions of Latino fami-
lies from earning a livable wage. 
These are the priorities of the Repub-
lican Party—a Republican Party that has abandoned Latino families. We as Democrats will do everything in our power to stop the Republican attack on these families. Democrats will con-tinue to fight for Latino families to help them tackle the challenges they face every day. 
Today, as we celebrate the first day 
of Hispanic Heritage Month, we honor the many incredible contributions Latino Americans make every day to our Nation. We also recommit our-selves to protecting Hispanic families and communities from the likes of Donald Trump and the Republican Party and treating them with dignity and respect because a prosperous America needs a strong and thriving Hispanic community.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest 
the absence of a quorum and ask unani-mous consent that the time be charged equally. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, as you 
know, today we are going to have a number of speakers coming down to talk about the deal that has been nego-tiated between the P5+1 countries— China, Russia, Great Britain, Germany, France, and the United States—and Iran. What is before us today is some-thing called a resolution of dis-approval. I know the procedures we deal with sometimes here on the Sen-ate floor can be very confusing to the public. We are going through a process where we are trying to seek cloture. Cloture is a vote where people decide whether they are going to end debate on a topic and move toward the final vote, to cast their vote on the sub-stance of what is before us. 
We had a similar type of vote before 
we left on Thursday. We had 58 Sen-ators—a bipartisan majority—who wanted to move to a final vote. As a matter of fact, we had Senators from both sides of the aisle on the floor for some time debating the issue. It was one of the most sober, respectful de-bates we have had since I have been in the Senate. But a minority of the Sen-ators voted not to end the debate. In other words, that is what the general public believes is a filibuster. And it kept us from being able to move to a final vote. 
Because there has been some confu-
sion, what I thought I would do is lay out what exactly is happening here and how we got to this process. 
Under our form of government, when 
the President enters into an inter-national agreement, he decides as to whether that is going to be a treaty, which, as we know, requires a two- thirds approval by the Senate, or whether it is something called a con-gressional-executive agreement, which is a little bit lower threshold, or whether it is just a pure executive agreement, in other words, the Presi-dent himself has the ability, if he so decides, to enter into an executive agreement. One of the problems with an executive agreement is that it doesn’t live beyond that President’s term. 
When you invoke an executive agree-
ment, what you are really doing is by-passing the buy-in of Congress. As a matter of fact, last week on the floor, I thought Senator F
LAKE made one of 
the most salient points that have been made; that is, since the President and his team decided to cut out Congress and to attempt to do an executive agreement, they made no attempt whatsoever to get the buy-in of Con-gress. That is why we have ended up in the situation we are in. 
When I realized that the President, 
through this process, was going to enter into this agreement solely by himself—an executive agreement, which he has the ability to do—but that he was also going to use some-
thing called a national security waiver to do so—again, this gets a little com-plicated, and foreign policy can some-times be complicated. Congress, on four different occasions, passed over-whelmingly in this body and over-whelmingly in the House of Represent-atives something that puts sanctions in place on Iran to try to bring them to the negotiating table. We did it four times. 
I have to say that in almost every in-
stance, the administration pushed back against us putting sanctions in place. They said, ‘‘Oh, the other countries won’t be with us, and this will create problems.’’ What happened as a result of us saying ‘‘No, we are going to sanc-tion Iran; we are going to do what we can to bring them to the table to end their nuclear program’’ was that the other countries fell in line. They put in place similar sanctions to the ones Congress put in place. 
When we passed those four sets of 
sanctions, we gave the President some-thing that is common, and that is called a national security waiver, where, if a crisis came up, he had the ability to waive those sanctions if he thought it was in our country’s na-tional interest. 
So when he decided to enter into an 
executive agreement around these ne-gotiations with Iran and bypass Con-gress, what he also decided he was going to do is to use his national secu-rity waiver to waive the sanctions Con-gress put in place. 
Some of us on this side of the aisle 
realized that was very problematic, that because we brought Congress to the table and because we put the sanc-tions in place, we thought it was inap-propriate for the President to use the national security waiver. 
By the way, we realize now that he 
was going to put a national security waiver in place for 8
1⁄2years and come 
to Congress 81⁄2years down the road to 
waive those sanctions permanently. That would have been long after the es-sence of this deal was done and over. 
So we were able to work with the 
other side of the aisle and pass a bill that has put us in the position we are in today, and that is allowing Congress to weigh in before those congression-ally mandated sanctions are waived. Of course, if those sanctions are not waived, then, in essence, the Iranian deal cannot go forward under the terms that have been laid out. 
A lot of people have said: Well, Con-
gress gave away authority. They en-abled the President to do this without entering into a treaty. 
That is totally untrue. The President 
has the ability to decide to enter into an international arrangement through an executive arrangement, as he has done, if he so chooses. Now, again, the problem with that is, it doesn’t stand the test of time because the next Presi-dent can come in and alter that. 
As a matter of fact, this is the first 
time I can remember that Congress has

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6618 September 15, 2015 
taken back authority from the Presi-
dent because what we really did was said: Mr. President, no, you cannot go forward with this deal until we have all of the information, both classified and unclassified, and it is paused for 60 days while we go through this review process, which we know ends—it is de-batable because we don’t have all the materials, but they would say it ends this week. 
So this process wouldn’t even be oc-
curring if Congress hadn’t taken back the authority that we took back from the President, put this pause in place, and given ourselves the ability to ei-ther approve or disapprove—disapprove in this case because many people be-lieve the President squandered this op-portunity. Here we had brought this rogue nation to the table, had a boot on its neck, its economy was suffering, and here we have this rogue nation that somehow has ended up in a situa-tion where the President and others have negotiated to allow them not to end their program, which is what was said in the beginning. 
By the way, let me just say that had 
the President held to what he said on the front end, which was that we are going to end Iran’s nuclear program, what we would be having today is al-most unanimous support for this agree-ment. But instead they squandered that opportunity—squandered it—and instead have agreed to allow them to industrialize their program and a whole host of other things that had nothing to do with the nuclear file. 
Let me go back to the process. The 
President decided he was going to go straight to the United Nations. Con-gress said: No, you are not going to do that. You are going to come to us, and we are going to decide whether we ap-prove or disapprove. 
So we have a lot of people out there. 
Some, I guess, just don’t understand. Some, I think, do understand, but they are trying to somehow or another cre-ate this narrative that Congress is ena-bling the President. The fact is, we would have liked to have had more of a say in this. I would have liked for this to have been a treaty. But since the President determines whether these are treaties or executive agreements— and he decided in this case it was an executive agreement—again, what Con-gress has done is said no and taken back a degree of authority. 
Unfortunately, what is happening is 
we have a minority of 42 Senators who have decided they are not going to allow an up-or-down vote. That is what has happened. 
What was dismaying to me was that 
during August the minority leader de-cided he was going to filibuster. I have a lot of respect—I think people know we have worked closely together in trying to make the Senate work here. But I was very disappointed that some-how or another this was going to take on sort of a Tammy Wynette feel to it, if you will, that, you know, ‘‘We are going to stand by our man. We are not going to cause him to have to veto a 
resolution of disapproval.’’ Somehow or another, instead of this being the sober, serious debate we thought it was going to be where a majority of Sen-ators were going to be able to express themselves, in order to protect the President from having to veto some-thing that the majority of the Senate in a bipartisan way disapproves of, somehow or another, we have this proc-ess underway. 
I do wish to say to the leader of the 
Senate that I appreciate very much the fact that up until this point, what he has agreed to do and has done is he has filled the tree—again, another term that I am sure sounds very unusual to people who are watching the Senate floor and don’t understand the process. What he has done is he has said: No— up until this point anyway—we are not going to have a bunch of amendments that are tough for people to vote on; we are going to keep the debate to one topic, and that is the resolution of dis-approval. That is what this is for. 
So tonight, in a second effort, begin-
ning at 6 o’clock this evening, we are going to have a vote. The vote is going to be about whether—I mean, this is what the essence of it is—it is about whether we should end the debate and move to final passage. I think plenty of people have had their say. Others are going to be coming to the floor today to talk about the merits of this deal and the demerits of this deal. But I would hope, again, that the minority, which seems intent on trying to keep the President from getting a resolution of disapproval, which the majority of people in this body believe should be the case—in order to keep him from having to veto the will of the Senate, a minority of people here are keeping that vote from taking place. 
I close by thanking my friends on the 
other side of the aisle for two things. I actually want to thank everybody in this body. Since 2010, four times the Senate has weighed in to put crippling sanctions on Iran. Those sanctions brought them to the table. That was something which was done in spite of the fact that the administration was pushing back. 
Secondly, this body, with a vote of 98 
to 1, passed the Iranian review act—in short, now called Corker-Cardin. We passed that on a 98-to-1 basis knowing that the President was issuing a veto threat up to 1
1⁄2hours before the com-
mittee vote took place. When they re-alized they were going to be crushed— I hate to use that word—overwhelmed in that committee vote, they lifted their veto threat about 1
1⁄2hours before 
that took place. 
But, again, on a 98-to-1 basis, this 
body said: No, we want to weigh in. We want to have the right to approve or disapprove. We want to pause. We want to see all of the documents. 
By the way, we have had 12 hearings 
in the Foreign Relations Committee— 12—and all kinds of other one-on-one briefings. So we have had plenty of time to look at this. As a matter of 
fact, the American people know more about this deal than they ever would have had that process not been put in place. Again, it was put in place be-cause the President decided he wasn’t going to cause this to be a treaty; he wasn’t going to ask for us to weigh in; he wasn’t going to ask us on behalf of the American people to approve it; he was going to do it himself and go di-rectly to the U.N. Security Council. As a matter of fact, he has done that. As a matter of fact, they moved the imple-mentation date back so we could have our chance of weighing in in this way. Certainly, we would love to have much greater power and authority over this. 
So thank you to everyone here for 
putting the sanctions in place. Thank you for allowing us to weigh in. 
Let me remind people that if the 
President had achieved the goals he set out to end Iran’s nuclear program—in other cases, he said dismantle Iran’s nuclear program—what would be hap-pening on the floor today is there would be an overwhelming, I would say unanimous vote in support of what the President did. But what is happening is we have a bipartisan majority that op-poses this. And even those people who have come out in support of this have done so tepidly. They have talked about all the problems in the agree-ment. As a matter of fact, now there is a huge push to try to come up with a Middle East policy because we know we have none to push back against what is in this agreement. 
I am going to have more to say, but 
I realize my good friend Senator H
OEVEN is here. I wish I had known 4 
minutes ago he was here. I have gone 4 minutes into his time, and I yield the floor. 
But I want to remind people in clos-
ing: Had the President done what he said the goal of the negotiation was— to end their program—we would have unanimous support. Instead, we have a bipartisan majority that opposes this bill, and we have a minority that has kept us, once, from being able to vote up or down. I hope with tonight’s vote that will not be the case. I hope we will have the opportunity to send a resolu-tion of disapproval to the President. I know he has said he would veto that, but I think it is important for us and the will of the body and the will of the country to be heard, and for it to reach the President’s desk. 
With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to 
voice my opposition to the Iran nuclear agreement and my support for the reso-lution of disapproval. 
Although there are many arguments 
related to President Obama’s agree-ment with Iran, I would like to focus on the subject of sanctions. I think it is important to consider why we sanc-
tioned Iran, what happens to our sanc-tions if the deal is implemented, and the prospects for snapping back sanc-tions in the future.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6619 September 15, 2015 
First, we imposed sanctions because 
we wanted to dismantle Iran’s nuclear program. Again, I want to emphasize that. We imposed sanctions because we wanted to dismantle Iran’s nuclear pro-gram. As Secretary Kerry said in De-cember of 2013, we imposed sanctions ‘‘because we knew that it would hope-fully help Iran dismantle its nuclear program. That was the whole point of the [sanctions] regime.’’ 
These were very serious and are very 
serious sanctions. According to the Treasury Department, sanctions re-duced Iranian oil exports by 60 per-cent—by 60 percent—from 2.5 million barrels per day in 2012 to just over 1 million barrels per day in 2015. In 2014 alone, the Treasury Department be-lieves Iran lost $40 billion in oil rev-enue. Sanctions also blocked Iran from accessing most of its billions in foreign currency reserves. In short, Iran’s economy today is 15 to 20 percent smaller than it was projected to be back in 2012. 
We know these sanctions were having 
the desired effect because Iran decided to negotiate. The mullahs in Iran would not have come to the bargaining table if they are not feeling the effect of our sanctions. The opportunity to dismantle Iran’s nuclear program was in sight, but then we let Iran off the hook. We agreed to a negotiations process that gave Iran room to maneu-ver. 
Instead of boxing them in with re-
lentless economic pressure, we offered sanctions relief in return for mothballing Iran’s nuclear infrastruc-ture for a few years. The end result is that the deal undermines the whole point of the sanctions regime. We insti-tuted sanctions to pressure Iran to dis-mantle its nuclear program, but this agreement provides sanctions relief and leaves the nuclear program intact. 
The terms of the agreement will give 
Iran access to more than $100 billion lo-cated in frozen bank accounts. Some estimates put that figure even higher. The windfall Iran expects to receive from foreign investments will strength-en Iran’s economy even further. 
But let us focus on the initial more 
than $100 billion in sanctions relief, which is an enormous number. It is equivalent to 25 percent of Iran’s an-nual gross domestic product. For per-spective, one quarter of U.S. GDP would amount to more than $4 trillion. So you can see what a huge sum this is to Iran and how much it means to Iran and their economy and, ultimately, to their military. One analyst even point-ed out that $100 billion for Iran in 2015 is roughly equivalent to the invest-ment the United States made across Europe over the 4-year Marshall Plan to rehabilitate Europe after World War II. So you realize what a huge impact this will have, what a huge benefit it is for Iran, for its economy, and for its military. 
In short, handing Iran $100 billion 
gives the mullahs incredible flexibility. It is hard to imagine that Iran won’t divert billions of these funds to 
Hezbollah in Lebanon, along with a bil-lion or two for Yemen, and another bil-lion or two or more for operations in Iraq and Syria. 
Remember, Iran is the No. 1 state 
sponsor of terror in the world today. This agreement will provide Iran with money to spend on its aggressive agen-da across the Middle East. So one thing is clear—one thing is clear—the world’s foremost state sponsor of terror and one of the worst violators of human rights on Earth will receive a huge windfall of cash. 
It is also clear Iran’s economy and its 
military would be strengthened. As I said previously, Iran’s economy today is 20 percent smaller than it would have been without 4 years of sanctions. Four years from now, without sanc-tions, Iran’s economy will be larger and the regime will have not only more financial strength but also more flexi-bility to carry out its agenda. 
That flexibility will come at a very 
opportune time for them. Five years into this agreement, the conventional arms embargo will end, per the agree-ment, and it should be clear to all of us that Iran will then have the money, the resources to buy arms at that point. Three years later, or a total of 8 years after the agreement is imple-mented, the ballistic missile embargo will be lifted. So in 5 years they can buy conventional weapons and within 8 years they can buy advanced missile technology. And restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program will begin to dis-appear a few years later. 
Iran’s leaders are probably very 
pleased with that timing. First, they get sanctions relief, allowing them to grow their economy. That growth will create the investment capital for con-ventional arms purchases, which the deal permits in 5 years. By then they will be ready to acquire advanced bal-listic missile technology—ballistic missiles the agreement allows Iran to purchase in 8 years. 
In fact, because their nuclear pro-
gram will remain intact, at that point Iran could opt out of the deal, finish developing a nuclear weapon, and mount it on a ballistic missile. In short, the President’s Iran agreement actually allows Iran a path to finance and develop an advanced nuclear weap-on. 
Further, the agreement is not only 
bad on its merits, it is a strategic mis-take. It hurts our long-standing Middle East alliances and positions Iran to be the dominant power in the Middle East. We know what Iran will do from a position of strength. It destabilizes Yemen, Syria, and Iraq, foments ter-rorism against Israel, and opens the door for countries such as Russia and China to meddle in regional politics. Even if Iran never developed a nuclear weapon, the agreement will position Iran to further undermine regional se-curity for years to come. Leaving its nuclear infrastructure in place only makes things worse. What if Iran violates the agreement? 
It is interesting to note that many sup-porters of the deal have argued we must approve the agreement because our allies are already lifting their sanctions and that our sanctions will not be successful on their own. Yet these same supporters of the agree-ment believe sanctions could somehow be reimposed if Iran cheats on the deal. 
Unfortunately, the procedures in the 
agreement make snapping back sanc-tions very difficult. Under the terms of the deal, it would take months to es-tablish Iranian violations of the agree-ment and put new sanctions back in place. Suppose Iran begins to cheat on the deal in a year or two. Under the terms of the agreement, it would take months to establish that Iran had vio-lated the agreement and approve those new sanctions. That is hardly enough of a threat to keep Iran from cheating, but more importantly, the deal permits Iran to withdraw from the agreement if sanctions are reimposed. So snapping back sanctions would effectively kill the deal. Remember, they could kill the deal after they have already gotten more than $100 billion. 
The agreement makes it in Iran’s in-
terest to cheat on the deal knowing sanctions either won’t be imposed or will allow them to pocket the $100 bil-lion in sanctions relief, jump-starting their nuclear program, before any kind of sanctions are reimposed. For this reason, I believe if the agreement goes into effect, it will very likely die slow-ly from a thousand Iranian cuts, leav-ing behind a richer and nuclear-pow-ered Iran. 
Voting to support the deal essen-
tially means putting faith in Iran. It means believing that Iran will allow the inspections to occur. It means be-lieving that Iran does not have any nu-clear facilities that we are unaware of. It means believing that Iran will keep its nuclear infrastructure without at-tempting to build a nuclear weapon. 
I don’t believe any of these things. 
Why? Because over the last 15 years Iran has blocked inspections, revealed the existence of secret nuclear sites only when forced to, and pushed for a nuclear weapon even when claiming they only wanted a peaceful program. 
But it doesn’t have to be this way. 
We could seek a stronger agreement. We could make it clear that Iran does not have the right to nuclear weapons and cannot be allowed to obtain them. We could return to our original goal, which was the dismantlement of Iran’s nuclear program, instead of negoti-ating away the leverage that sanctions created. 
For these reasons, I cannot support 
the President’s agreement with Iran. Instead, I favor immediate additional sanctions to pressure Iran to dismantle its nuclear program, which was the ob-jective when the negotiations began. 
We should not let Iran off the hook. 
We should not throw away the leverage we developed in recent years through

these sanctions. It takes time for sanc-
tions to work, but the relief is imme-diate when sanctions are lifted. We need to keep our sanctions, keep the pressure on, and get a deal that actu-ally dismantles Iran’s nuclear program. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence 
of a quorum but also request that the time be equally divided. 
I yield to the Senator. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mr. CORKER. It is my understanding 
that we are equally dividing the time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time 
is equally divided, but quorum calls are not equally divided unless requested. 
Mr. HOEVEN. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the time during the quorum call be equally divided. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. HOEVEN. I suggest the absence 
of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the

Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I have 
an inquiry relative to the remaining time. 
I am not understanding what the 
quorum call time is doing relative to the splitting of time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. By prece-
dent, quorum calls are charged to the side that requests the quorum call, un-less there is a request that the quorum call be equally divided between the two sides. 
Mr. CORKER. And my understanding 
was that request was made and grant-ed; is that correct? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, that 
request was made and granted in this particular request, but it only applies to the particular request unless it is made on the next quorum call request or unless the unanimous consent would apply to all quorum calls. 
Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I know 
the public is greatly confused by clo-ture motions, and I will say, even as the person in charge of the bill, I am confused also, but I will let that stand, and I thank the Chair. 
I know the next speaker we are hop-
ing to hear from will be Senator C
OR-
NYN at 2 p.m., Senator S COTT at 2:20, 
Senator B LUNT at 2:30, and then Sen-
ator H ELLER at 3 o’clock. I hope they 
will be down soon, and I will let the time be accruing against both sides by suggesting the absence of a quorum. 
I ask unanimous consent that during 
the period of time there is a quorum call, it be charged equally to both sides. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CORKER. I suggest the absence 
of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The

Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, last 
week we experienced what I would think was a dark day in the history of the United States Senate where, on one of the most important national secu-rity issues that has confronted the country in the last 25 years—and per-haps longer—our friends across the aisle, led by the minority leader, de-cided to filibuster the resolution of dis-approval on the President’s nuclear deal with Iran. 
So everybody understands what that 
means. Rather than cast a vote either in favor or against the resolution of disapproval, Democrats banded to-gether and decided not to have a vote. Presumably they did that for two rea-sons: One is they didn’t want the per-sonal accountability associated with having to cast a vote for or against dis-approval because they know at some point Iran is going to continue its pat-tern of misbehavior and people might come back and say: Why did you vote for this deal when in fact all the evi-dence pointed toward how bad a deal it was? 
The second reason I believe our 
Democratic friends decided to fili-buster the vote on the resolution of disapproval is they simply wanted to protect the President because they knew that had the resolution of dis-approval passed, the President had threatened to veto the legislation. Hav-ing done so under that circumstance, the President would in fact own this bad deal. 
As I said, it is a sad day when a polit-
ical party decides to put partisan con-cerns ahead of the national security in-terests of the United States. This is es-pecially true in light of the fact that we voted just a short time earlier to provide a mechanism for there to be that up-or-down vote following debate and review. It also had the effect of freezing the President’s ability to lift sanctions on Iran during that time-frame. 
This legislation, negotiated by the 
chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, was called the Iran Nuclear Agreement Re-view Act. This was not a partisan prod-uct, nor should any of this debate be a partisan activity. It didn’t sneak through the Chamber in the dark of night. It wasn’t the product of closed- door negotiations by one political party against another. Rather, it was a product of bipartisan concern over the President’s deal with Iran and was spe-cifically designed to make sure Con-gress had possession of all the relevant documents that laid out this agree-ment between the President and the Iranian regime. It would ensure a proc-ess by which the American people 
could be informed—and the Senate 
itself debate—through their elected representatives, whether this deal was a good deal or a bad deal in terms of the national security interests of the American people. 
Most significantly, that legislation 
which sets up that process passed over-whelmingly—as a matter of fact, I think it was nearly unanimously—with not one Democrat in the Chamber vot-ing against that legislation. 
So having voted for legislation to 
create a process by which there would be transparency and accountability, and rather than partisanship the na-tional security interests of the country would be elevated, our Democratic friends, listening to the White House, including the President of the United States, decided to block that very vote they had earlier agreed to have. 
Ironically, the same day the minor-
ity leader and his colleagues blocked the up-or-down vote on the resolution, he lambasted Republicans on this side of the aisle for ‘‘slowing down the leg-islation,’’ and suggested we ought to move on to other matters. We could be well on our way to finishing this reso-lution and moving on to other pieces of legislation that we need to consider if in fact our Democratic friends would, consistent with their earlier vote, just allow us to have an up-or-down vote on the resolution of disapproval, but I think what our Democratic friends began to realize is this is an enor-mously unpopular agreement between the President and the Ayatollah in Tehran. As a matter of fact, only 21 percent of the American people have said they want to see this deal be turned into a reality. Many of them are concerned, as am I, that rather than a traditional treaty process that requires two-thirds vote of the United States Senate, this has somehow become more of a political document rather than a legal document, binding only this President and the Iranian regime, under some circumstances, during the remainder of the 16 months or so of President Obama’s Presidency. 
Almost 80 percent of the country has 
said they are not sold on the deal. Their voices deserve to be heard, and Members of Congress and the Senate should be on record whether they are listening to the American people or whether they are listening to the siren song of the White House and a Presi-dent who is focused on his legacy, to the detriment of the national security of the United States. 
Even supporters of this deal were 
some of its biggest critics. Yet these are some of the same people who voted to filibuster an up-or-down vote on this resolution of disapproval. Many of them made the case as well as or better than I could; that an agreement made with a theocratic regime that con-tinues to call the United States the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6621 September 15, 2015 
Great Satan and threatens the very ex-
istence of our friend and ally in the re-gion, Israel—there should be real rea-son for pause and certainly debate and an up-or-down vote. 
Here is just one example. The junior 
Senator from New Jersey, as a prelude to his announcement that he would vote against the resolution of dis-approval, said: 
With this deal, we are legitimizing a vast 
and expanding nuclear program in Iran. We are in effect rewarding years of deception, deceit, and wanton disregard for inter-national law. . . . 
That is the junior Senator from New 
Jersey on September 3, 2015. Does that sound like somebody who is for this deal or against this deal? Well, miracu-lously, this is from a Senator who voted not just for the deal but voted to even prohibit us from having an up-or- down vote in the Senate. I couldn’t agree with these comments more. Our colleague clearly understands the na-ture of the regime and the pattern of troubling behavior characterized by outright deception. Last week, al-though headlines emphasized the sup-port of several of our Democratic col-leagues for the President’s deal, it was clear that many of them harbored deep reservations—and those reservations are entirely justified. 
Here is a comment of the senior Sen-
ator from Oregon, who said: 
This agreement with the duplicitous and 
untrustworthy Iranian regime falls short of what I had envisioned. . . . 
This statement was made on Sep-
tember 8, 2015, by somebody who said they were going to vote against the resolution of disapproval but in fact filibustered our ability to have an up- or-down vote on the resolution itself, and I couldn’t agree with the state-ment quoted from the senior Senator from Oregon any more. This is not ex-actly a resounding endorsement. 
Then there is the senior Senator 
from Connecticut, who said, on Sep-tember 8, before he announced his agreement with the President’s nuclear deal: 
This is not the agreement I would have ac-
cepted at the negotiating table. . . . 
I presume by saying that, that means 
he would have rejected it. But yet, again, deferring to the President and deferring to the leadership of the Democratic leader in the Senate, not only did the Senator who made that statement indicate his approval of the deal, this Senator voted to block an up- or-down vote on the deal in the Sen-ate—in other words, participated in the filibuster of this vote. 
(Mr. SCOTT assumed the Chair.) This debate is one the American peo-
ple deserve to hear. I know the press, as they typically do, likes to keep score and move on to other things, but this is one the American people deserve to hear, and it is one they have de-manded—and, frankly, from what they know so far, they don’t like this deal. Twenty-one percent have said they ap-prove of it. Rather than listen to their constitu-
ents, our friends across the aisle have decided to essentially block a vote that prevents the kind of accountability our constituents deserve and move on to other issues. But with the future secu-rity of our country hanging in the bal-ance, we can’t just move on, and we can’t disregard the will of our own con-stituents or what common sense or our own investigation and inquiry tell us; that this deal is an unenforceable deal. 
It ignores the fact that Iran remains the primary state sponsor of inter-national terrorism. It releases about $100 billion of money that is going to help finance that proxy war against the United States and our allies that has been going on since 1979, when the Ira-nian regime came into power. 
Then there is the bogus verification 
process. First of all, under the agree-ment, 24 days’ notice along with var-ious—the appeals process, which is a process that only Rube Goldberg would have been able to devise. And then there is the self-monitoring process. It is sort of like a selfie stick that the Iranian regime is going to carry around, where they conduct their own test on their military sites, and then they turn that over to the IAEA—the International Atomic Energy Agency— at the front gate because the so-called independent monitoring agency will not even have access to the military sites where breakouts in violation of this agreement are most likely. It is hardly one that gives you confidence that is going to be conducted with any sort of integrity. Then there is the dra-matic change in U.S. policy. 
When Prime Minister Netanyahu 
spoke to a joint session of Congress a couple of months ago, he said it used to be U.S. policy to deny Iran a nuclear weapon, but this agreement, as he cor-rectly points out, paves the way to a nuclear weapon. Again, this is not a ra-tional actor on the international stage. 
This is an extremist regime—a theo-cratic regime—driven by a desire to wipe Israel off the map and to conduct this proxy war against the United States and our allies as the primary sponsor of international terrorism. But then there is the final insult to injury. Just as our Democratic colleagues fili-bustered the opportunity to have any real accountability with an up-or-down vote in the Senate, we learned that the Supreme Leader in Iran has insisted that the Iranian Parliament have the final vote and say-so on the deal in Iran. 
Try to fix that picture in your mind. 
The Iranian regime—the main, prin-cipal state sponsor of international ter-rorism, a theocratic regime determined to wipe Israel off the map and conduct war against what they call the Great Satan, the United States—will have a chance for an up-or-down vote, but our Democratic colleagues have blocked an up-or-down vote in the U.S. Senate. That ought to be deeply troubling to anyone who cares about the Senate and any sort of sense of democratic ac-countability. It is beyond irresponsible for our 
Democratic colleagues to again deny the Senate the very same thing the Ayatollah has said the Iranian Par-liament will have a chance to do—espe-cially when they all supported this process by which an up-or-down vote would be facilitated. 
Later today my colleagues and I will 
have another opportunity to move this bill closer to an up-or-down vote on the merits of the President’s agreement with Iran. I hope the same senders who clearly supported a thorough review of this deal will join me in moving this bill forward so the American people can get the sort of debate they deserve about the No. 1 national security threat affecting this generation of Americans, and the American people can get the kind of accountability they deserve when it comes from their elect-ed officials casting a vote on their be-half on such an important agreement. 
I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. 
P
ORTMAN ). The Senator from South 
Carolina. 
Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I watched 
in absolute amazement as the Obama administration attempted to justify what is clearly a misguided gamble and a bad deal with Iran. We saw the signs of how bad this deal was almost imme-diately, as during the same speech in which he announced the deal, the President threatened to veto any legis-lation that opposed it. I have been a business owner. When you lead with threats, you typically are covering for a very bad deal, because when you are building support for your product—in this case the Iran deal—you don’t tell the folks you are talking to who dis-agree with you that they are crazy. That is simply something you don’t do when you have confidence in the deal. 
If you are leading with threats, you 
are showing your hand. The President is trying to bluff by holding a 2, a 5, an 8, and a 10, and we didn’t even bring a fifth card to the table. I use a poker reference because that is exactly what the President of the United States is doing—gambling with our security, gambling with Israel’s security, and, frankly, gambling with the future of the Middle East. He was also gambling that his National Security Advisor, Susan Rice, would not admit that the Iranian Government would use re-sources from lifting the sanctions to fund terrorists, but as we saw on CNN with Wolf Blitzer, she did. He was gam-bling that his own Press Secretary would not tell us that we should trust the Iranian Government because they would use ‘‘common sense’’ and use sanctions relief to help their economy and to help the Iranian people, but he did—even though we have seen no signs whatsoever previously that the Iranian Government cares about actually help-ing the Iranian people, and their hor-rific record on human rights has only worsened in recent years. 
The President is gambling that he 
could use international pressure to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6622 September 15, 2015 
convince people he was on the right 
side of the issue, along with Russia and China, and by bringing the deal to the United Nations before the U.S. Con-gress, that would somehow show Con-gress the deal was acceptable—another bad gamble, but it didn’t work. The longer we have to study the deal, the worse the deal gets. The longer the American people have to learn about the deal, the stronger their opposition becomes to the deal. 
There is not much good news as we 
look at this deal, as we look at the polling information 2 to 1 in opposition to the deal, the American people. Yet the President refers to those on the op-posite side of the deal as crazies—refer-ring to the American people, the vast majority of those folks around our country, so many of us, almost unani-mously on the Republican side and even some good friends on the left. 
As I said earlier, the President gam-
bles with our security, and we have seen how bad his hand truly is. As I suggested, he has a 2, a 5, an 8, and a 10—a 2 because Iran will be able to dou-ble their oil exports and therefore dou-ble their oil revenues, increasing by more than 1 million barrels a day—in other words, $15 to $20 billion of addi-tional revenue to fund nefarious behav-ior in the Middle East. That is more terrorism in the Middle East; a 5 be-cause, without any question, in year 5 of the deal they gain access to more weapons as the weapons embargo is lifted; an 8 because in year 8 of the deal Iran will be able to purchase ballistic missiles; and a 10—yes, a 10—because in year 10 Iran can begin installing ad-vanced centrifuges for enriching ura-nium. Simply put, this deal legitimizes Iran’s nuclear program and guarantees a timeline for Iran to secure the bomb. 
If Congress signs off on this deal, we 
can all take a big red pen and mark on our calendars almost the exact day that Iran will have a nuclear weapon. This isn’t a Republican or Democratic issue. Just listen to some of the quotes from my friends on the other side of the aisle: ‘‘The JCPOA, or Joint Com-prehensive Plan of Action, legitimizes Iran’s nuclear program.’’ 
Another quote: ‘‘Whether or not the 
supporters of the agreement admit it, this deal is based on ‘hope’—hope is a part of human nature, but unfortu-nately it is not a national security strategy.’’ 
And, finally, ‘‘To me, the very real 
risk that Iran will not moderate and will, instead, use the agreement to pur-sue its nefarious goal is too great.’’ 
In what the administration would 
call an exchange for this, we see the economic sanctions will be lifted, arms embargoes will be lifted, and Iran will have more money and more dangerous weapons to route to groups like Hezbollah and insurgents in Iraq—both groups responsible for the deaths of many American soldiers. That is not a gamble; that is the wrong direction at the wrong time, the wrong deal, and absolutely, positively, unequivocally not in the best interests of this coun-
try. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I am glad 
to be here and hear the comments from my friend from South Carolina, Sen-ator S
COTT. It made me glad that I get 
to sit by him on the Senate floor and hear the reasons—and they are good and they have been repeated many times—about why this is not a way for-ward for the United States. It is not a way forward for the Middle East. In fact, Senator S
COTT did a great job 
talking about what was in the deal, but what wasn’t in the deal was what the President said would be there when the negotiations started. 
When the negotiations started, the 
administration said Iran would never be allowed to have nuclear weapons, that we would find out everything Iran had ever done to try to develop nuclear weapons, that we would have any-where, anytime inspections, and the sanctions would only be lifted when real progress was made in those first three areas. That was the framework. That was what we were negotiating for. None of those things happened. None of those things are in this agreement. 
I think the question that you, I, and 
others in the Senate are hearing from people, when we are home and when we are talking to people about this agree-ment is, Is the Congress giving away its power? How is it possible that some-thing like this could happen and the majority of the Congress couldn’t do anything to stop it? Of course, the other question is, Is the President giv-ing away the power of the United States of America to lead? 
I think it is as clear from this agree-
ment as it is so many other things that leading from behind doesn’t work. A view that the United States of America is just any other country in the world is not a view that leads to a peaceful, more stable world. In fact, our friends don’t trust us and our enemies aren’t afraid of us in a world where there is vast agreement there are more poten-tial bad things that could happen from more potential places than any time ever before. That is not just Repub-licans; that is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that is the Direc-tor of National Intelligence, and that is the head of the CIA. They all come up with that same conclusion. 
We look at the President’s foreign 
policy, that this is just one symptom of—remember the redline in Syria that if the Syrians do this, we are going to do that? The Syrians did what we said we wouldn’t allow them to do. Basi-cally, we didn’t do much of anything. In fact, what happens is that when the United States of America takes that kind of position and does not move for-ward, Assad is emboldened. I think the latest number of Syrians who have been killed by Assad is now around 250,000 people, from chemical weapons to barrel bombs, to every way they can think of to massacre their own popu-lation—a population that has been dis-
placed in the millions, both inside and now outside the country—so an emboldened Assad. Putin looked at this. Before you know it, Putin took control of Crimea, and Putin has Rus-sian troops in Ukraine. And this week Putin put Russian troops and tanks in Syria. 
Every American President since 
President Truman—I am standing at one of the desks President Truman used as a Senator on the floor, and it has his name carved in it. In 1946 Presi-dent Truman did whatever was nec-essary to force the Soviets out of Iran. Every other President until now has done whatever was necessary to keep the Russian influence in the Middle East to a minimum. The Russians are building a base and unloading equip-ment right now. Why are things hap-pening now? Because they think they can get away with it. That is the Rus-sian reset. The Chinese—the Asian pivot—are building an island on an atoll in the South China Sea that is within striking range of the Phil-ippines. Why? Because they think they can get away with it. 
The more we look at the con-
sequences of the agreement, the more we wonder about it. Why aren’t we able to stop it? No future administration is bound by it. For weeks now on this floor and around the country, people have talked about the destabilizing im-pact this agreement will have on the Middle East and the world, and the only administration that is bound by it is this one. It is not a treaty. If it were a treaty, as it should be, we would be voting in the Senate on a treaty and two-thirds of the Senators would have to approve the treaty and the next ad-ministration would be bound by it as well. 
When Presidential candidates say ‘‘I 
will reverse this the first day,’’ they absolutely can reverse it the first day. What kind of policy is that to put in place, a policy that has this kind of de-stabilizing effect without even a sense that the United States for the long term is committed to it? 
I am sure the President believes that 
by the time he leaves, every other President would surely want to keep this agreement. But I don’t know how one could listen to this debate and think that. It does dramatically change the Middle East. Neighboring countries don’t trust Iran, and they will want to have whatever weapons Iran has. 
Senator S
COTT just made the point— 
and made it well—that you can circle the date on the calendar of when Iran is likely to have a nuclear weapon if this agreement goes forward, and more importantly, the hope that maybe the government would change—it might, but that won’t keep the neighbors from deciding they have to defend them-selves. 
As if the 1994 agreement with North 
Korea wasn’t bad enough—they had a missile announcement today, I believe,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6623 September 15, 2015 
and said they have a better delivery 
system for the weapon they were never going to have—we have truly let the nuclear genie out of the bottle here. Their neighbors will believe they will have to have a weapon when Iran has one, and they also all believe Iran will cheat. 
Even though Iran is theoretically on 
a 12-month clock, it might not be 12 months from the day they say: We are now going into full weapons mode and 12 months from now we will have one. So even if Iran were to change its mind, we will have three or four coun-tries in a very short period of time, in my view, that will have nuclear weap-ons and nuclear weapons capability that don’t have it right now. 
We met with Secretary of State John 
Kerry at the Munich Security Con-ference in 2014—a conference a handful of Senators normally go to, and I went to that conference that year. John Kerry said: We will be able to know ev-erything the Iranians are doing. We will be able to monitor this with such detail that there is no way they will be able to do anything we don’t know about. 
At the time, I said to Secretary 
Kerry: Even if that is true—and I said I don’t believe that will be true—you won’t be able to contain enrichment. Once you let Iran do this, other coun-tries that are perfectly happy with where they are right now will feel as if they have to do the same thing. There are well over one dozen countries that have nuclear power that don’t do what we are about to allow Iran to do. We have been able to control this because the world has understood that it need-ed to be controlled, but we are now at the beginning of letting this get out of control. 
What is the vote all about? It is not 
a treaty. Why are we voting at all if it doesn’t bind the next administration? Why are we having a debate if the ad-ministration would like to have the Congress involved in about 2023? That was another great comment that was often made before the law was passed to allow us to do what we are doing today. They said: Well, Congress will eventually have to be involved because eventually they will decide whether to extend the sanctions regime. 
By the way, the one that went into 
effect in 2013 is on the books until 2023. So the ideal day for the Congress to be involved was about 7 years after the administration left office. That would have been the involvement we would have had if Congress had not stepped up and said: We are going to insist that we get involved. 
In 2006 Congress took back some of 
the authority—this is not the first Con-gress to lose authority to the Presi-dent—the President had, and we put into law the sanctions that had been imposed by the President at that time. We made them not just President Bush’s idea but a law. I was there when that was negotiated, and one of the things we did when we negotiated that was to insist that that be codified and 
become the pattern—and it did—for all the sanctions to follow. 
But the pattern that Congress fol-
lowed was also a pattern that had been followed since World War II, which is, here is what we are going to do and here is what we believe the President and the country should do, but we are going to give the President national se-curity waiver authority. That is the authority the President has decided to use without congressional approval, without changing the law. He has de-cided he is going to waive these sanc-tions and the Congress could weigh in again in about 2023—if the President had totally had his way. 
What are we doing here? The Presi-
dent of the United States is about to prop up the No. 1 state sponsor of ter-rorism in the world. That is an inargu-able point. Nobody argues that Iran is not the No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism in the world. They clearly look strong-er at the end of this deal than they did at the beginning because they are stronger. 
The President of the United States is 
about to release billions of dollars that the No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism in the world can use for terrorist causes, with the support of a minority of the Congress—not only a minority of the Congress, but that minority happens to all be on one side. There is nothing like this in the post-war history of the country where the country stepped for-ward in this way on this big of an issue. Not only is a majority against it, but a bipartisan majority is opposed to it. A partisan minority is blocking the Con-gress from even having a vote while a bipartisan majority wants to vote, and they want to vote to disapprove this deal. Even then the President could still veto the disapproval, but the President doesn’t want to do that. The President doesn’t want this on his desk. 
I think I read the stories the other 
day when we for the first time couldn’t get the 60 Senators necessary to have the vote. The White House announce-ment was something like this: The con-gressional vote today ensured that the President’s Iranian deal would go for-ward. The whole time, my concern about this process is that by not stop-ping it, somehow it would look as if the Congress was for it. We may not be able to stop it, but I can guarantee that Congress is not for it, and any-body who has been paying attention knows that. 
A question I think we can ask our-
selves: Would Congress and the country be better off without this poor sub-stitute for overseeing a meaningful for-eign policy? This is clearly not pro-ducing the kind of result a democracy should produce in foreign policy. I think one could argue that it is a weak response. But why did it have to hap-pen? 
I cosponsored the initial bill that re-
quired Congress to approve the deal, but, of course, a piece of legislation has to be signed by the President. Senator 
C
ORKER and Senator C ARDIN finally 
came up with a piece of legislation that the President would sign, but it was al-most always guaranteed to ensure that the debate would go forward. So would we have been better off without it? I have had people ask me: What are you guys doing? Why can’t you get the for-eign policy of the country under some control? 
I have wondered several times wheth-
er we would have been better off going forward without it. As I have thought about that, it does seem to me that the Corker-Cardin bill has produced a num-ber of things, and one of those is that we have 60 days of debate that we wouldn’t have had otherwise. When would the Congress have gotten to weigh in? Eight years from now. We would have had the debate 8 years from now. We have had 60 days of debate. Well over 50 percent of the people in the country are opposed to going for-ward with this deal. Only about 21 per-cent are for going forward. 
This process has produced bipartisan 
opposition to a bad deal. Senator C
ARDIN , a top Democrat on the Foreign 
Affairs Committee, and Senator M
ENENDEZ , the other most knowledge-
able Democrat on foreign affairs, Sen-ator S
CHUMER , and Senator M ANCHIN  
voted with the 54 Republicans. So 58 Senators don’t want this to happen, and 60 percent of the House of Rep-resentatives are opposing this agree-ment. The White House would have liked to have Congress have a say al-most a decade from now. 
We have had our say, and we should 
have our vote. We should be allowed to put this bill on the President’s desk, and if he wants to veto it and defend that veto, that is how this process should work. 
I hope there is still a chance that two 
more of our colleagues will step for-ward and say: While I am going to be on the other side of the final vote, I think the Congress should vote. We had 98 Members vote for this bill that said Congress should vote to either approve or disapprove this agreement. Let’s have that vote, and let’s have that vote today. 
I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I agree 
with the distinguished Senator from Missouri in every respect, and I hope we get our wish to have that meaning-ful vote later on today. 
I thought I would take a few mo-
ments to explore a history lesson. Ed-mond Burke once famously said: ‘‘Those who don’t know history are destined to repeat it.’’ I think most people agree with that statement, which is why we find so many vari-ations of that quote. One of my favor-ite variations is by Mark Twain: ‘‘His-tory doesn’t always repeat itself, but it does rhyme.’’ 
I think the history of events leading 
up to World War II is an appropriate

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6624 September 15, 2015 
period for examination during today’s 
Iran debate, and I believe it is impor-tant to explore the question of whether the disastrous history of the Munich Agreement can be instructive to Amer-icans and even to our allies during the current debate. Munich has been cited numerous times in opinion pieces about the Iran agreement, and it has 
been mentioned on both sides of the de-bate in this Chamber. Furthermore, we have been cautioned, even scolded by various opinion-makers around the country that we dare not make com-parisons between Munich and the cur-rent situation. In this view, even utter-ing the words ‘‘Neville Chamberlain’’ or ‘‘Munich’’ brings to mind such pain-ful memories from the dark past that we simply should not go there. I do not agree. If history does rhyme, perhaps it is helpful to examine history and look for parallels today. 
For those who may not have recently 
studied the years leading up to World War II, let’s review the Munich Agree-ment. In September of 1938, Hitler’s ag-gression was fully underway. In his sights at the moment was Czecho-slovakia. Leaders met in Munich, Ger-many, in an ostensible effort to avoid war. Those leaders were Adolf Hitler himself, French Prime Minister Edouard Daladier, Italian dictator Be-nito Mussolini, and Britain’s Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. The agreement they announced with much fanfare at the end of September 1938 was that Nazi Germany would be given control of the German-speaking por-tion of Czechoslovakia, known by some as the Sudetenland. In return, Hitler agreed to stop his advance and to not make war. Against the backdrop of all of Germany’s aggression to date, of its violations of the Versailles treaty, the Fuhrer gave his solemn assurance in writing that there would be no more expansionist activity. 
We all know that upon his return to 
London, Chamberlain announced tri-umphantly that there would be ‘‘peace for our time.’’ The bold headline across the top of the Daily Express displayed the word ‘‘peace’’ with an exclamation point. 
Of course, a number of wise people 
immediately saw the false dream for what it was. Soon after, Winston Churchill rose in passionate opposition on the floor of Commons. He first made it clear that he held the opponents of the agreement in high personal regard, as many of my colleagues have also done already during this debate. Then he launched into a scathing denuncia-tion of the bad deal, characterizing it as a total and unmitigated defeat for Britain and France, not to mention a betrayal of defenseless Czechoslovakia. He went on to predict correctly that rather than preventing war, the Mu-nich accord would assure war. 
Sadly, for millions and millions 
around the globe, Winston Churchill was correct and Neville Chamberlain was tragically mistaken. Within months, Hitler was at it again, annex-ing the rest of Czechoslovakia and set-
ting his sights on Poland and beyond. 
I think it is appropriate to ask our-
selves: What would Churchill have said about today’s debate? And what would Chamberlain be saying if he could speak to us today? 
Let’s look at the parallels. At Mu-
nich, Britain and France abandoned a steadfast ally. Similarly, today’s agreement has been reached over the strenuous objections of Israel, our most reliable partner in the Middle East. I must emphasize that this oppo-sition comes not only from the current Prime Minister and his Likud gov-erning majority, but also from his op-ponents in previous elections—from virtually every point on Israel’s polit-ical spectrum, from labor and from center-left voices. Here is the near unanimous outcry from our Israeli friends: Iran poses an existential threat to Israel, and this bad deal makes mat-ters worse. It makes us less safe. It makes our friends, our neighbors less safe. 
As the whole world watched, the Mu-
nich agreement sent a chilling message to the rest of Europe and to the rest of the world about what could now be ex-pected from France and England. Today, our Sunni Arab friends in the Middle East are mystified and dis-mayed by this Iran deal. Understand-ably, their public reaction has been guarded and even muted. Most are hedging their bets, but make no mis-take, this is not the strong anti-pro-liferation nuclear agreement they had hoped for. 
This current deal and the Munich 
deal are also similar when we consider the history and behavior of the parties to the agreements. Like Hitler, the current Iranian regime has repeatedly demonstrated that they have evil moti-vations and that they cannot be trust-ed. Consider the most recent activities and pronouncements of the Iranian Su-preme Leader and his team. 
This deal has been made with a re-
gime that still leads cheers saying ‘‘Death to America’’ and believes in the destruction of the Jewish State. The mullahs, the ayatollahs, and the people in charge of Iran have shown no indica-tion that they are trustworthy. Aya-tollah Khamenei last month published a new book that once again makes it explicit that it is Iran’s foreign policy to obliterate the State of Israel. Just last week, he called America the Great Satan and said Israel would not exist in 25 years. Israel would not exist in 25 years, according to the other party to this agreement. 
Under this agreement, embargoes on 
arms and ballistic missiles will be lift-ed in 5 and 8 years respectively, allow-ing the biggest exporter of terrorism to build up conventional weapons. And have we forgotten the fact that Iran has been cooperating with North Korea on ballistic missiles for years? 
Of course, the scene in 1938 is not en-
tirely similar with that of today, as has been pointed out. Seventy-seven years ago, Nazi Germany at least gave 
lip service to leaving the rest of the world alone. Wise people knew this to be a lie, but at least the Nazi dictator signed such a promise. Today, the Ira-nian dictatorship makes no pretense of abandoning its goal: the complete elimination of Israel from the map. And this bad deal gives them the wherewithal to do just that: a $100-bil-
lion stimulus. The lifting of sanctions, which the United States and our eager European allies have agreed to, will ex-pand Iran’s gross domestic product by roughly one-fifth, not to mention relief from sanctions on deadly conventional weapons and ballistic missiles. 
In 1938, Chamberlain said, ‘‘Peace for 
our time.’’ We may wish he had been 
correct, but such an outcome was so unlikely, the deal so risky and ill-ad-vised, that it was merely a wish, albeit a dangerous and deadly wish. 
In 2015, Secretary John Kerry has 
called the current deal ‘‘a plan to en-sure that Iran does not ever possess or acquire a nuclear weapon.’’ Did my col-leagues hear that: Not just for our time or for a decade, but never, according to the distinguished Secretary of State. 
President Obama says this agreement 
marks ‘‘one more chapter in this pur-suit of a safer, more helpful, and more hopeful world.’’ Such statements have a familiar and troubling ring. Such words could have been uttered in 1938. And I wonder if Mr. Chamberlain’s fol-lowers ever said, in defense of the Prime Minister’s action: This isn’t a very good deal, but what other agree-ment is out there? What other choice do we have? I am willing to bet some people actually said that. The other choice might have been to stand up against a murderous bully, to stand by a friend. 
This resolution of disapproval is not 
just an opportunity to sound off. It has not been about sending a message. This procedure was designed, as the distin-guished Senator from Missouri said be-fore me, as the only way to prevent a bad Iran deal from actually going into effect. We always realized it would take a bipartisan majority to succeed. There are currently 58 Democrats and Republicans who are willing to say offi-cially to the President: Start over and get our Nation a better deal. We, frank-ly, need nine more courageous Sen-ators to step forward and say no to this deal. We are told the die is now cast, that the votes simply are not there. But I will say to my colleagues today, there is still time to do better for the American people. The doubts have re-peatedly been expressed by Senators who have said they will nevertheless vote with the President. 
Senator B
OOKER , in announcing that 
he will support the President, said: We are legitimizing Iran’s nuclear program and rewarding years of bad behavior. Yet, he will vote to support the Presi-dent. 
Senator C
OONS : I am troubled and 
deeply concerned. 
Senator B ENNET : None of us knows

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6625 September 15, 2015 
Senator W YDEN : It is a big problem, 
having to deal with Iranian leadership that wants a nuclear enrichment pro-gram. 
Senator P
ETERS : Enrichment of ura-
nium is a stark departure from Amer-ica’s nonproliferation policies. Indeed it is. Senator P
ETERS goes on to say: 
The agreement could set a dangerous precedent. 
We need these Senators to change 
their vote and to vote for the resolu-tion of disapproval. 
Senator B
LUMENTHAL said: Not the 
agreement I have sought. 
Senator M ERKLEY said: Significant 
shortcomings. 
According to Senator G ILLIBRAND : 
Legitimate and serious concerns are there. 
Senator F
RANKEN acknowledges it 
isn’t a perfect agreement. 
Alan Dershowitz, a Harvard law pro-
fessor emeritus and expert on the Mid-dle East—and hardly a neo-con— summed up the President’s deal with Iran in his book, ‘‘The Case Against the Iran Deal.’’ He said this: 
Hope is different from ‘faith,’ though nei-
ther is an appropriate basis on which to ‘roll the dice’ on a nuclear deal that might well threaten the security of the world. 
‘‘That may well threaten the secu-
rity of the world,’’ according to Pro-fessor Dershowitz. 
He goes on to say: 
The deal as currently written will not pre-
vent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. In all probability, it will merely postpone the catastrophe for about a decade, while legiti-mizing its occurrence. This is not an out-come we can live with. 
I appreciate people such as Alan 
Dershowitz having the courage to write a book and explain chapter and verse, page by page, the legitimate reasons why this threatens the security of the world and why America should not be willing to live with this deal. 
I say we should heed the warnings of 
people such as Alan Dershowitz. We should heed the warnings of history. There is still time to reject this ill-ad-vised agreement. There is still time to get a better result for our people, to get a better result for our future. 
Thank you, Mr. President. Seeing no other speakers, I suggest 
the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I do 
have concerns as well. Typically we re-ward people for a change of behavior; that is good behavior, going from bad to good—not static, old, bad behavior. The concern I have is with Iran. We have seen no change in behavior. The same battles are happening in Yemen as they are leading a coup. The same issues are happening in Syria where Russia and Iran are working together 
to prop up Bashar al-Assad. They are causing trouble in Bahrain. There is the same behavior in Lebanon with Hezbollah. There has been no change in behavior. Yet, the administration is de-termined to make an aggressive nu-clear deal to change the status quo on our sanctions on Iran based on the hope of some future new good behavior when we have seen no present change in the behavior of Iran. 
This doesn’t line up with some of the 
statements from our own administra-tion. For instance, in November of 2013, Secretary Kerry said that ‘‘there is no inherent right to enrich. . . . We do not recognize a right to enrich.’’ 
In December 2013, President Obama 
said, ‘‘we know [fully that] they don’t need to have an underground, fortified facility like Fordow in order to have a peaceful nuclear program.’’ 
At the same time, in December of 
2013, President Obama said, ‘‘They don’t need some of the advanced cen-trifuges that they currently possess in order to have a limited, peaceful nu-clear program.’’ 
But under this deal, not only are we 
giving them the right to enrich, not only are we allowing them to have for-tified underground bunkers, we are also allowing them to have advanced cen-trifuges that the President has stated there is actually no reason for them to have, unless they are not using them for peaceful purposes. 
I have heard over and over again for 
the last several days in this Chamber the conversation: If someone has a bet-ter deal, you should propose it, but this is the best deal that has been proposed. 
Well, let me just throw a few ideas 
out there as a better deal for a pro-posal. 
First, why don’t we do this as a pro-
posal: Why don’t we actually have the opportunity to read the agreement? We would like to be able to see it. No one in this Chamber has seen all aspects of this agreement. No one in the House has seen all aspects of the agreement. It is not that we will not read it, we can’t read it, because even the adminis-tration has said they have not read the entire agreement. 
Now, I will state that we don’t allow 
secret side deals between a bank and a car dealer when one is buying a used car. We certainly don’t allow secret side deals that no one can see between the U.N. and Iran. I am astounded that this body is OK with signing off on an agreement that absolutely no one has read in its entirety. In fact, the admin-istration has said they haven’t even seen it. 
The White House wants to have it 
both ways. They don’t want to turn over the documents which the statute requires, but they also want to keep the part of the law that says Congress has only 60 days to review it. They want to say that by the end of this week it is done—but, no, we are not ever going to turn the documents over that the statute requires. How about this for a different idea of 
what we can do for an agreement: They don’t keep the advanced centrifuges. Since even the President has said there is no peaceful purpose for those cen-trifuges, if we are going to have a good, solid agreement, they do not keep the advanced centrifuges. Not only do they keep them, they keep them in cascade, they keep them running, they keep them spinning. There is no change in behavior on those centrifuges other than the promise that they won’t put uranium in them. 
How about this for an idea for a bet-
ter agreement: We have onsite inspec-tions that would actually allow Ameri-cans on the inspection team. 
How about this for a better agree-
ment: We don’t lift the ban on missile testing and research on Iran which al-lows Iran to start missile testing and R&D again on ballistic missiles. We don’t lift the ban on conventional weapons sales to Iran, which will allow Iran to start buying large supplies of conventional weapons and surface-to- air defense systems. 
How about this change for a better 
agreement: Iran turns over their pre-vious military dimensions of their nu-clear program. They stated over and over again they don’t have a nuclear weapons program or ambitions. What would be the problem, then, in inspect-ing their research facilities and their technology if nothing existed? 
How about this for a better agree-
ment: We don’t agree to defend Iran in case in some future time they are at-tacked in their nuclear facilities by Israel. I think that is absolutely absurd to have in this agreement. 
How about this: We at least allow 
Iran the opportunity to publicly ac-knowledge that Israel has the right to exist—and they currently don’t ac-knowledge that Israel even has the right to exist—or we get our American hostages back, since we are lifting the sanctions on the individuals who per-sonally killed hundreds of American soldiers. Those sanctions are lifted. Why can’t we have our American hos-tages back? 
Here is one simple idea: Why don’t we 
have the same nuclear agreement with Iran that we had with Libya? When we negotiated the agreement with Libya years ago, their program actually ended. They actually turned their cen-trifuges over. They turned their nu-clear material over. They allowed any-time inspections. While this adminis-tration continues to say over and over again that what we are asking for is not possible, it was actually done by the last administration in Libya. 
This is not asking for something new 
or radical or different. This is asking for something enforceable and clear. Why can’t we have the same nuclear agreement with Iran that we made with Libya and actually stop Iran from advancing toward a nuclear weapon? 
I am convinced we can do better—we 
must, for the security of the Nation as a whole.

Mr. M CCAIN. Mr. President, I ask

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

Mr. M
CCAIN. Mr. President, a few 
hours from now the Senate will vote again on the Iranian deal. I think it is pretty well known that no votes will change. It is very unfortunate that that is the case. But it will give our colleagues, hopefully—they may have contemplated how bad a deal this is and possibly change, but obviously we know the likelihood of that is unlikely. 
The virtues of this legislation have 
been emphasized by my friends on the other side of the aisle. Those of us who have grave and serious concerns have also been articulated. But I think it is well to point out that this will be the first major agreement or treaty in his-tory that is voted on on strict party lines. Not one single Senator on this side of the aisle will be voting in favor—not one—a degree of partisan-ship concerning an issue of the greatest importance, in my view, of any treaty or agreement since that agreement Neville Chamberlain made with Adolph Hitler in Munich in 1938. So that part of it, in my view, is a failure on the part of the President of the United States. 
I know many of us, including myself, 
were willing to listen and consider any agreement that was verifiable and en-forceable that would have prevented the Iranians from acquiring nuclear weapons. In fact, it was stated by the Secretary of State that the object of this agreement was that Iran would never have nuclear capability. Now we all know it is a matter of time. Wheth-er it is 1 month or 10 years or 15 years, whatever, we don’t know. They notori-ously cheat. That is one thing we do know. So the fact is that we went from preventing Iran from having a nuclear capability—and they came to the table not because of renewed zeal for that but because their economy was so badly hurt because of the sanctions which had been imposed on them and which after this deal can never be re-imposed. Let’s be frank and candid with our colleagues and with the Amer-ican people. 
So here we are faced with an agree-
ment that should have been a treaty. I know of no observers of the Constitu-tion, both known as liberal inter-preters and conservatives, who inter-pret the Constitution who agree that this is anything but a treaty of tran-scendent importance, and we, of course, are treating it as an ‘‘agree-
ment.’’ Well, the bad news, I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who will be voting for this, is the next President of the United States can re-
peal this, can negate it. That would not have been the case if it was a treaty be-cause then it would have been ratified by the Constitution and the Congress, specifically the Senate. 
So, in the short term, apparently the 
President and his minions have suc-ceeded. In the long term, this will cause a grave threat to the security of the United States of America. 
I say to my colleagues, you know, 
this is an agreement that we are dis-cussing, and I will talk about the failings of it as I see them, but far more importantly, the President of the United States and the Secretary of State treat this as if it were in a vacu-um. It is not in a vacuum. You cannot consider this agreement unless you look at what is happening in the entire world today. 
REFUGEE CRISIS AND AMERICAN LEADERSHIP  
Mr. President, according to anyone 
who is an expert on national security, including people such as Henry Kis-singer, Madeleine Albright, Brent Scowcroft, and the list goes on and on, the world has never been in more tur-moil than it is today. That does not take a great deal of intelligence or study; all you have to do is watch tele-vision or read a newspaper. The United Nations head of refugees has said: There have never been more refugees in the world since World War II than there are today. You can’t turn on the television without seeing the terrible plight of these refugees who have had to flee their country because of the brutality and genocide committed by Bashar Assad. You can’t do that with-out seeing it. 
Some in the media and some of my 
friends on the liberal side treat this as if it were a hurricane, an earthquake, a natural disaster that just sort of hap-pened. It did not just happen, and it did not have to happen. What has happened with these refugees is a direct result of the failed, feckless policies of this ad-ministration in general and this Presi-dent in particular. 
This is the President of the United 
States who overruled his national secu-rity team when they said that we should arm and equip and train the Free Syrian Army to go in there and fight against Bashar Assad. This is the same President who said: It is not a matter of when, it is a matter of whether Bashar Assad leaves office. This is the same President of the United States who announced to the world that Bashar Assad had crossed the redline and we were going to retali-ate—only, of course, to hear that the President decided not to. 
I tell my colleagues, you cannot 
overstate the impact the President’s decision had after he warned Bashar Assad, after he said that if they crossed the redline we would act and we did not. I am not sure many Americans are aware that the Saudis had aircraft on 
the runways ready to join in those at-tacks and they found out on CNN. Is it an accident that we have seen the Saudis visiting Moscow? Is it an acci-dent that for the first time in its his-tory we see the Saudis buying Russian equipment? Is it astonishing to our col-leagues and friends that the Saudis have taken it upon themselves, along with UAE and other Gulf States, to in-tervene in Yemen against the Houthis, who are Iranian-backed, Iranian- trained, Iranian-equipped? No, it is not an accident. None of these things have happened by accident. 
Now we see a nation called Syria 
with over 230,000 killed and millions in refugee status. The surrounding coun-tries, particularly the small ones, par-ticularly Jordan and Lebanon, are lit-erally overwhelmed with refugees. Today, I tell my colleagues, there are more Syrian children in school in Leb-anon than there are Lebanese children in Lebanon. When you look at the size of the influx of the refugees into those two countries, some wonder in some ways how they have maintained their stability. 
All of it did not have to happen. It 
did not have to happen. 
The President of the United States 
decided to withdraw every single one of our combat troops in Iraq, saying at the time: We are leaving a prosperous, free, democratic Iraq. Does anybody be-lieve that? Of course, so many of us ar-gued: Please, leave a sustaining force behind—which they could have. Any-one who says we couldn’t have is lying. I don’t use that word casually because L
INDSEY GRAHAM and J OHN MCCAIN 
were in Baghdad when Maliki said: OK. He said: OK. I will keep troops. I will keep American troops. How many? How many and what mission? 
That answer never came from this 
administration until the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff testified be-fore the Senate Armed Services Com-mittee that it was down to 3,500—in his words, it cascaded down to 3,500. 
So now here we are with the greatest 
humanitarian crisis, again, since World War II, 70 years ago. Here we are with this situation, and Americans’ hearts are going out to these people. Can any of us who saw the picture of the drowned little baby on the beach ever forget that? It did not have to happen. It was because this President and this administration and its minions refused to exercise American leadership when we refused to arm and equip and train the Free Syrian Army, overruling his then-Secretary of Defense, Panetta; overruling his then-Secretary of State, Clinton; overruling his Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, GEN David Petraeus. It is well known that they all recommended arming the Free Syrian Army. At that time, Bashar Assad was in serious jeopardy. So what happened? The Iranians—the same Ira-nians we are concluding this deal with—called in 5,000 Hezbollah, had Soleimani in charge of the Iranian

Do you know what barrel bombing is? 
It is a huge cylinder. It is filled with explosives and shrapnel. They drop it. It explodes, and it spreads shrapnel ev-erywhere. It is a terrible weapon. It is a terrible weapon. Bashar Assad has been using it continuously. Who is giv-ing him that stuff to use? The Iranians. The Iranians are the ones who are doing it. 
It is the Iranians who are supporting

The Saudis and UAE have decided to go in because they could not afford to have—look at where Yemen is on the map—they could not afford to have Yemen under the control of the Iranians. 
So here we are. So here we are. Now 
the news of the last few days is—guess what. The Russians are now building bases—a serious military buildup in Syria. Why? Because they have to prop up Bashar al-Assad. This misguided, delusional administration thinks that only they can attack ISIS and not at-tack Bashar al-Assad and his killing machine. 
My friends, in the name of human de-
cency, in the name of the tradition of the United States of America helping those who are being slaughtered, we should tell Bashar al-Assad: You can-not fly those helicopters and those planes anymore and drop these terrible weapons. We are going to shoot you down if you do it. We are going to es-tablish a free—safe zone on the Turkish border. We are going to have the refu-gees go there, and we are going to feed them, we are going to clothe them, and we are going to take care of them. And don’t you fly an airplane over here or we are going to shoot it down. 
That is the message we should have 
to Bashar al-Assad. And now, what is happening now? The Russians have de-cided they are going to intervene mili-tarily on the side of Bashar al-Assad. 
Now, my friends, it has been Vladi-
mir Putin’s practice and ambition to expand the ‘‘near abroad.’’ That means moving into Ukraine, taking Crimea in violation of the Budapest agreement, it means putting huge pressure on the Baltics, and it means propaganda cam-paigns and other pressures that are even on countries such as Sweden and Norway in the Arctic. All these things Vladimir Putin is doing is sort of an expanding influence from Russia. 
Now, my dear friends, you see him 
leapfrogging over to Syria to maintain his base on the Mediterranean and that is a somewhat radical departure. But not to worry, my friends, the Secretary of State called the Foreign Minister, Lavrov—the old Stalinite apparatchik that he is—and expressed his concern. So the American Government ex-pressed their concern. Well, that ought 
to pretty well take care of it. 
Meanwhile, what about China? In the 
last day or two, there was a meeting, and a Chinese admiral, sitting between an American admiral and another ad-miral, stated: ‘‘The South China Sea belongs to China.’’ 
A few days ago, the President of the 
United States went to Alaska to re-name a mountain. I guess that is a rea-son for a trip. I will leave that to oth-ers to judge. So he goes to Alaska and guess what happened. By coincidence— by sheer coincidence—for the first time in history, five Chinese warships showed up off the coast of Alaska, pen-etrating the 12-mile zone—the first time in history. Now, I am sure that was just a coincidence that the Presi-dent of the United States happened to be in Alaska at the time that these Chinese ships showed up off the coast of Alaska. Every time we turn around, we are seeing nations react to a lack of American leadership. 
And so we are going to, of course, 
now vote—not to approve this agree-ment, because if it was a straight up- or-down vote, it would be a dis-approval. It would be a significant dis-approval, as a matter of fact—just not 60. I believe it is 57 or 58 Senators who will vote that they do not want to have the sanctions relieved that have been imposed by the Congress. 
It is a sad day. It is a sad day. Just 
as briefly as possible—because we have been over all of these before—there is no doubt there are almost no enforce-ment and verification procedures. In fact, again, this is for the first time I think that the Senate of the United States is being asked to approve of an arms control agreement—which is basi-cally what this is when you get right down to it—without knowing the veri-fication procedures. It is a deal be-tween the IAEA and Iran. I still don’t get it how anybody can support an agreement that we don’t know the most vital elements of. That is still be-yond me. 
Obviously, in the place where we 
found most of—some of their real se-cret activity buried in a mountain, that inspection will be conducted by the Iranians themselves. Remarkable. 
Of course, the past nuclear activities, 
so-called PMD, one of the require-ments—one of the interesting aspects of this is to see what was said at the time in the beginning and what actu-ally happened, such as the Secretary of State saying: We must know what their previous military activities were. We must know that because otherwise we cannot—guess what. We are not going to know that. Particularly, though, the aspect of verification both-ers me about as much as anything else. 
So now we have the Iranian Revolu-
tionary Guard sustaining the Shia mi-litias in Iraq. We have the Iranians funding Hezbollah, which is now the major problem for the Bashar al-Assad regime. We now have the Iranians sup-porting the Houthis, who, as I men-tioned, are trained and equipped by the 
Iranians in an attempt to take over Yemen. The Iranians are now providing weapons to the Taliban in Afghanistan. 
If they are doing all those things, and 
they are not changing their behavior, what in the world do you think they are going to do with $100 billion? Spend it on growing poppy, maybe building a YMCA? Of course not. They are going to continue their activities of sup-porting terrorist organizations throughout the Middle East with an-other $100 billion. This is what troubles me more than anything else. Has any-one in this body seen any indication of a change in Iranian behavior? If so, I would be more than eager to grasp that straw because everything I have seen— and the statements in just as short a time as 2 or 3 days ago—the grand Aya-tollah says in 25 years Israel will no longer exist. 
Is that the background, is that the 
atmosphere of some kind of agreement of this nature, where they are going to get $100 billion? It is confounding, and it can only be explained by this incred-ible delusion on the part of the Presi-dent and the Secretary of State—whom he has had for the last 6
1⁄2years—that 
if we somehow get an agreement with the Iranians, there will be an arrange-ment in the Middle East, and Iran and the United States will be partners against radical Islam—yada, yada, yada. That is impossible in light of Ira-nians’ stated ambitions, and of course the Israelis—of course the Israelis are deeply disturbed. 
All I can say is this is not a good day. 
This is not a good day. This is a day when votes are taken—again, for the second time—on one of the most impactful situations in the history of this country post-World War II; that is, that this agreement will allow the Ira-nians, to a degree of latitude and a de-gree of capability, to spread their ter-ror and their acts of terror throughout the Middle East in a far more effective fashion. 
Yes, we are war weary. Yes, Ameri-
cans don’t want to be involved. Yes, we know all of those things, even though it is 1 percent of the American popu-lation who actually serves in the mili-tary, but the fact is that sooner or later, as a result of this, the United States of America, unfortunately, will have to be engaged militarily. 
I hate to make that prediction, but I 
have been a student of what is going on in the Middle East for a long period of time. I have seen Iranian behavior, and I have watched what they have done— not just the rhetoric but their behav-ior. They are propping up a guy who has killed 230,000 of his country’s men and women and driven millions into exile. Now we are feeling the effects of it in Europe and soon in the United States of America. 
It is shameful—it is shameful—that 
we allowed this guy to slaughter so many hundreds of thousands of people. And who supported them, who backed them, and who bailed them out when

the President of the United States said: 
Oh, it is not a matter of whether Bashar al-Assad leaves, it is a matter of when. The President of the United States said: It is time for Bashar al- Assad to leave. Bashar al-Assad will be in office after this President of the United States. So it is not a good day. 
There have been other times in our 
country—there was a good book that was written about America before World War II called ‘‘While America Slept.’’ There was another great book by a professor at Texas A&M about how unready we were prior to the Korean conflict. We thought we were never going to be in another war, and we were totally unprepared when North Korea attacked South Korea. 
Now here we are—with blame on both 
sides of the aisle—continuing to cut our military, continuing to reduce our capabilities, and continuing to reach a point where the retiring Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army says we can no longer adequately defend the Nation against some of its threats, and, to cap it off, we are now going to see an agreement which will unleash the furies of Hell. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
TRIBUTE TO DENA MORRIS  
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to 
take a moment to thank an important member of our staff. Her name is Dena Morris, and she is with me on the floor today. Dena has worked for me for 12 years. The last 8 years she served as my legislative director, and she is going to be leaving soon for a new pro-fessional opportunity. 
When she first told me the news, my 
first reaction was: ‘‘Say it ain’t so,’’ but Dena had an offer she could not refuse. Next week, Dena Morris will join the U.S. Centers for Disease Con-trol and Prevention as the Agency’s Washington Director. Her new position, I have to admit, is a perfect fit. It will allow her to combine her exceptional management skills, her deep under-standing of public policy, and her strong commitment to public service in ways that will benefit America’s families and businesses. 
I already know Dena is going to do 
well because she has done so much for me, for the people of Illinois, and for our Nation. 
There is one thing that really tells 
you a lot about Dena’s commitment to public service and the public good. Dena Morris came to me 12 years ago. She left a K Street law firm and came to the Senate to work as a staffer. She took a substantial pay cut to do it. She started in my office as a legislative as-sistant handling education issues. Her portfolio quickly expanded to include public health and then all of the health care issues. By 2007, it was clear to me she was the right person to direct all the legislative activity in my office. Even with all the promotions and the new titles, Dena still earns less today than what she earned at that law firm she left 12 years ago. So when I hear my fellow Senators 
come to the floor and talk down our staffs and talk about denying them basic things such as health care cov-erage, I think about Dena and the hun-dreds just like her who make the Sen-ate work. They do it not for the money, not for the benefits but because they want to leave a mark. Dena has done that. You see, instead of making mountains of money, Dena chose to 
help and to help the Senate make his-tory. For that I am ever grateful. 
It will take too long to recite all the 
things she has worked on, but I can list a few: the American Recovery and Re-investment Act—it was the economic stimulus that was initiated by the Obama administration to bring Amer-ica out of the great recession after the 2008 economic crisis—her work on the Affordable Care Act, which has brought affordable, reliable health care to 16 million Americans, including 800,000 people in my State of Illinois, and re-duces the national deficit. Dena was my legislative director when Congress passed the first Wall Street reform act in 7 years. She helped steer legislation to cut the cost of student loans, to help save the American automobile indus-try, and to give the FDA, at long last, the authority to regulate tobacco. 
Her contributions extend beyond the 
historic laws that she has helped to pass. Probably her greatest contribu-tion, from a very selfish point of view, is that Dena Morris assembled my team. She took the time to bring to-gether an extraordinary group of bright, committed public servants, just like herself, who reflected my values, her values, and her work ethic. 
Lots of people think about Sunday 
morning as a time to kick back and relax. My staff, and Dena knows this personally, lives in fear of Sunday morning because that is when I have the time to leisurely go through the newspapers, to watch television, and to get on my cell phone and e-mail my staff about all the new ideas I have for the coming week. It is a drill Dena knows well and which she handles with skill and does so effectively. I think it is her daily yoga practice that helps her maintain her even keel. 
I want to thank her husband Peter 
Rogoff, who has joined us. He is a former longtime Hill staffer, and I want to give special thanks to their kids, Niles, now in high school, and Lulu. 
It was about a year after Dena joined 
my staff that she brought Niles and Lulu to the office for a take-your-chil-dren-to-work day. They were about 6 and 4 years old at the time. So I met with all these kids from my staff mem-bers, and I said: Do you have any ques-tions? Niles raised his hand, and he looked at me and he said: How come my mom has to work so late? 
It was a funny moment, an embar-
rassing moment in a way, but I think Niles and Lulu know now what the an-swer is. It is because their mom cares so much about what she does and cares so much about the people she can help. That is a bit of a story of Dena Mor-
ris’ career. When she worked for that K Street law firm, she specialized in ad-vancing legal and civil rights for peo-ple with disabilities and their families. She started that work just 3 years after the Americans with Disabilities Act be-came law. She was on the leading edge of one of America’s great civil rights struggles. 
Two other things worth mentioning: 
Dena’s first job in Washington, before the law firm, was working as an intern for her home State Senator, Dick Lugar of Indiana. It was an unpaid in-ternship, as most of them are. So to pay the rent Dena had to work five nights a week on Capitol Hill at an-other unique Washington institution— the Hawk and Dove—which happens to be a local popular Capitol Hill watering hole. 
Finally, Dena is one of six children. 
Her dad is a Baptist minister. In her whole family of origin—parents and siblings—Dena Morris is the only Dem-ocrat. She is a brave woman, and she tells me they do not really talk a lot about politics at family gatherings. Her parents may not share her politics, but I know they share our pride in the work she has done for America. 
I have no doubt she will continue to 
use her talent and her energies to move our Nation forward. 
Dena, thank you for your service. 
SYRIAN HUMANITARIAN CRISIS  
Mr. President, I listened to my 
friend, the Senator from Arizona, Sen-ator M
CCAIN, and this is the second 
time I have heard him on the floor talking about the tragedy, the humani-tarian crisis associated with Syria. I couldn’t agree more. 
I also take note of that heart-
breaking photograph of that 3-year-old boy who drowned as his family tried to escape Syria, ultimately bound for Canada. In the crossing of a body of water, their boat capsized, and the mother and two children were lost, and the lifeless body of that infant washed up on the shore. 
When I think back, and people ask, 
what do you remember about the Viet-nam War, I remember a lot of things, but the image I remember is a photo-graph of a little girl stripped naked, burned with napalm, running down the road screaming. I can’t get that out of my mind. Vietnam—I think of that photo. 
When I think of Syria, and what is 
going on with this humanitarian crisis, I think of the photo of that little boy. It is heartbreaking. I get emotional thinking about little kids who I love in my family facing that kind of tragedy. 
There are two things I would like to 
say. I think it is fundamentally unfair to blame the Syrian crisis on this President. This is a crisis which re-flects the Arab Spring, it reflects changes in the Middle East that have been going on for 30 years plus, and no country has really come up with a good solution to stop the bloodshed and kill-ing in Syria.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6629 September 15, 2015 
I am sorry my colleague from Ari-
zona is not here, but I would acknowl-edge and remind him there was a time when the President came to us and said: I want to do something. President Obama said: I want to do something about chemical weapons in Syria. The Senator from Arizona—and I might add the Senator from South Carolina— joined us in the Foreign Relations Committee in moving this issue for-ward to give the President the author-ity to do something to stop the use of chemical weapons in Syria, and it died before it came to the floor because there was no support—no support on the floor from the Republican majority in the House or the Senate. 
So to say this President has not 
taken action, he has. And you cannot overlook the fact the United States of America, through the generosity of its taxpayers and the leadership of this President, leads the world in humani-tarian relief in Syria. We believe we have invested almost $4 billion—more than any other nation on Earth—for these poor people who are suffering there. 
Can we do more? Should we have 
done more? Of course, in hindsight, things look so much clearer. I pushed for—and this administration is work-ing on something the Senator from Ar-izona has also endorsed—a humani-tarian safe zone. There ought to be a piece of Syria where people can go for medical care and know they are not going to be killed by these barrel bombs and attacks. I know the admin-istration is working on that with Tur-key. It has gone very slowly. I wish the pace would pick up. 
A friend of mine, Dr. Sahloul in Chi-
cago, a Syrian American, has made a dozen trips to Syria, to Lebanon, to Jordan giving free medical treatment to the Syrian refugees, and he tells the story in graphic terms—and many times brings back heartbreaking pho-tographs—of what these barrel bombs are doing. I hope we can find some dip-lomatic or military solution in Syria. 
In the meantime, here is the question 
we must ask ourselves: What will we do about these millions of refugees? We will give money, of course, to our allies that are creating camps for them. I vis-ited one of those camps in Turkey, and I have to say I was really a great ad-mirer of the leadership of that country in accepting at this one camp 10,000 people—one camp. And there are many more, hundreds of thousands all over the Middle East, fleeing out of that re-gion. So now what will we do about the refugees? 
The Senator from Arizona reminded 
us last week these are refugees, not mi-grants. They are the people who are victims of war who are fleeing with their families. 
On Friday I was in Chicago and met 
with four of these Syrian families who are now refugees in the United States. They told heartbreaking stories of los-ing members of their families and flee-ing from one city to another in Syria without any success, then finally leav-
ing, going to refugee camps and trying to come to the United States. Even after they applied for refugee status, it took this one family over 14 months to make it here to this country. 
We have a rich history in the United 
States of being there for refugees. We can point with some pride to the fact that when Cuba was going through its upheaval back in the 1950s and 1960s we accepted Cuban refugees who have be-come a major part of America today. In fact, the three Hispanic Members of the United States Senate are all Cuban Americans. At least two of them were the product of that exodus—the prod-uct of a refugee status that brought their families to the United States. They are making great contributions for the States they represent. 
We did the same thing in the Soviet 
Union. When the Jewish population there was facing persecution, we stood up and said: We will accept them as ref-ugees. Thousands and thousands of So-viet Jews came to the United States and have become an important part of America today. 
The list goes on: Somalians, 
Bosnians, the Hmong population out of Vietnam. So we have a rich history of responding to these humanitarian cri-ses. We need to do it again. What the administration has proposed is mod-est—10,000—too modest, as far as I am concerned. I believe we should be pre-pared to accept 100,000—100,000 Syrian refugees. 
Yes, each and every one of them 
needs to be carefully checked and vet-ted so we know we are not inviting someone in who is a danger to the United States. The people I have met in Chicago—the refugees there—are just desperate people trying to find a roof over their head, trying to find some little work to do to keep what re-mains of their family together. Each and every one of them said something interesting. All four of them said they couldn’t believe how welcoming Amer-ica was, how friendly people in Amer-ica were to the refugees and their fami-lies. Mr. President, that is who we are. That is what America is about. We shouldn’t be afraid when people who are desperate for some refuge find our shores and ask: May we come and join you? 
I have already had friends in Illinois 
calling my wife and asking: What can we do? Can we adopt a Syrian family of refugees to help them get started in the United States? I think that story can be replicated over and over again, thousands and thousands of times. 
So I would say to my friend from Ari-
zona, yes, it is outrageous, the death, the violence, the circumstances in Syria which has forced so many mil-lions of people to move and many of them to lose their lives in the process. And it is heartbreaking to read the sto-ries as they desperately try to find some safe place to live with their fami-lies and are rejected by countries, some in Europe, that want no part of them. I want America to do its part so that 
when the future generations look back and ask our generation: What did you do when you faced the greatest human-itarian crisis of your time at this mo-ment in history, I want them to be able to point with pride to the fact that we carried on the great American tradi-tion of opening up this country to refu-gees who are looking for a safe place to live with their families. 
Mr. President, we are in the midst of 
debating again—again—the Iran agree-ment, an agreement that was brokered by the President with five other na-tions—an agreement to accomplish two things: The agreement was to stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and, secondly, it was to create a safe enough environment that the United States does not have to commit military forces or go to war again in the Middle East. 
I voted for it, and 41 other Democrats 
joined me. We had this vote last week. It was historic and widely reported. At the end of the vote, Senator M
CCON-
NELL , the Republican leader, stood up 
and said: We are going to do it again. We are going to do it again next week— today—Tuesday night. 
I don’t know why we are going 
through a replay of this. There is a suggestion he may do another vote in another few days. Members of the Sen-ate have stood up to a person and an-nounced where they stand on this issue. Nobody is trying to run away from this issue. It is a challenging issue and a historic vote, and we are all on the record. We are there. 
I don’t know why we have these re-
peat roll calls. I don’t know why we are going through this again, but that is Senator M
CCONNELL ’s choice. One 
would think he might want to spend some time on the floor of the Senate dealing with some other issues, but he sticks with this one. 
What happened over in the House of 
Representatives is hard to describe. We came together because of a statute passed by the House and the Senate calling for a vote of disapproval of the Iran treaty. Now, it has been rejected— that vote of disapproval—here in the Senate. The House never took it up. The House, instead, had three separate votes, never going to the issue of dis-approval. They had three separate votes on separate issues. The one they passed that might be sent our way is hard to believe. 
You see, what the House of Rep-
resentatives said is that we will not lift any sanctions on Iran until we have a new President in January 2017. Think about that for a second. Here is what we know. We know that Iran has fissile material capable of building ten nu-clear weapons. We know that. We also know that Iran has the capacity within 2 or 3 months—2 or 3 months—to create this nuclear weapon. We know that from our intelligence, and we know it from the pronouncements of Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6630 September 15, 2015 
With the knowledge of that capa-
bility in Iran—to build a nuclear weap-on, which would be a disaster in the Middle East—the House Republicans have said they want to put off any ef-fort to stop the Iranians until we have a new President 17 months from now, which is more than enough time, I might add, for the Iranians, should 
they choose, to build a nuclear weapon. How does that make Israel any safer? How does that make the world any safer? 
Here is what we know. With this Iran 
agreement, within weeks the Iranians will start dismantling their cen-trifuges. They will start the process guaranteed by this treaty that will re-sult in closing down a nuclear reactor that produces plutonium which can be used for weapons. They will start invit-ing inspectors into their country. 
There has been a lot said by the Sen-
ator from Arizona and others about the track record of Iran. I agree with many things he said. They are not to be trusted. That is why verification is part of this agreement. If there were no inspectors, it would be a foolish ven-ture, but with these inspectors, we are on the ground inspecting Iran on a daily basis, through the IAEA, inter-national inspectors sponsored by the United Nations. Are these inspectors good? I can say that many years ago when we voted on the invasion of Iraq, when the Bush-Cheney administration told us there were weapons of mass de-struction, these inspectors told us there were none—after we had invaded, after the war had started. It turns out the inspectors were right and the Bush- Cheney administration was wrong. They have a good track record, and I am glad they are going to be on the scene to verify this agreement. 
But the question now is, How many 
more times will Senator M
CCONNELL  
want us to vote on this same issue? As leader, he can decide to do it over and over. Is this part of a debate prep for some of the Republican Senators run-ning for President? They come to the floor and make their speeches or hear speeches and get to cast a vote before the CNN debate this week? I hope that is not it. We have made ourselves clear where we stand on this issue, each and every one of us. We cast our votes. We will do it again today. Now it is time for the Senate to move on. 
Looming just ahead of us in a matter 
of days is the potential of another gov-ernment shutdown. The same tea party Republicans who shut down this gov-ernment 2 years ago have vowed to do it again over a different issue. Some-how they believe that come October 1, if we start shutting down the agencies of our Federal Government, they will have made a political point. They are right. They will make a point that the majority in the House and the Senate— the Republican majority—cannot gov-ern, cannot manage the budget of the United States to keep our government agencies open. I think they make that point 2 years ago; I don’t know why they want to remind the American peo-
ple of it again. 
So instead of voting repeatedly on 
the same measure, on the Iran agree-ment—where we already have a record vote—I would commend to the Repub-lican leader: Take up the issues of the day. Some are compelling. There is cyber security for the safety of the United States. There is a transpor-tation bill in the House of Representa-tives. We passed it, and it is time for the House to do the same. Let’s fund our government. Let’s not face a gov-ernment shutdown. 
I yield the floor. Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, as many 
of my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, have noted, today’s vote on the President’s deal with Iran is one of sig-nificant consequence. The American people deserve an up-or-down vote on the deal itself. 
I spent the day sitting on the floor of 
the Senate, listening to my colleagues debate the technicalities of the Presi-dent’s Iranian nuclear deal. This has been a lawyerly dispute, with argu-ments all over the map. I, like the vast majority of the American people, be-lieve that this is a terrible deal. 
It has blown up the sanctions regime 
that brought Iran to the table. It floods Tehran’s coffers with more than $100 billion that will almost certainly fi-nance the killing of innocents around the world. The verification efforts place all of the burden on the United States and our allies, leaving Iran free to delay, disrupt, and deny inspections. The deal even allows Iran to advance its ballistic missile programs and to stockpile uranium. It is simply a bad deal and the American people know it. 
I went to Embassy Row and stood be-
fore the old Iranian Embassy to the United States, a building which was abandoned on April 7, 1980. And what the American people understand—and what Washington, DC, does not seem to understand—is that the technicalities of this deal, though important, are not the central question. 
The central question is this: Why was 
that embassy abandoned April 7, 1980? 
It is because in 1979 there was an Is-
lamic revolution in Tehran, and the mullahs that came to power are theo-cratic hardliners that believe they have a divine mandate. Their divine mandate is to export Islamic law and tyranny across the Middle East, across North Africa, and beyond. The tyrants who rule Iran today believe they have a divine mandate to annihilate Israel. 
For 36 years we have had a bipartisan 
consensus in our country that the world’s largest state sponsor of terror should never be allowed to become a nuclear-threshold state. 
Sadly, the administration has aban-
doned that bipartisan consensus in the fanciful, imaginary dream that they are going to transform Iran’s theo-cratic hardliners into moderates that will no longer oppress religious minori-ties, women, homosexuals, and others within their country. The administra-tion believes that the Iranian regime 
will no longer try to spread destabiliza-tion and fund terrorism across their re-gion and across the globe. And this pre-sents dire, but foreseeable con-sequences. 
The administration’s deal with Iran 
will set off a nuclear arms race in the Middle East—one of the world’s most volatile regions. Billions of dollars in sanctions relief will be available to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and its terrorist proxies to spill innocent blood and destabilize Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen and elsewhere. Either of these developments is serious enough on its own. Taken together, we have an unacceptably high probability for re-gional conflicts that could quickly spi-ral into nuclear events. We have to take this seriously; but, as the out-come of this vote is likely to dem-onstrate, we are not. 
The American people are more seri-
ous than Washington DC. The Amer-ican people aspire to a day when that old and crumbling embassy is reopened, but not by the ruling theocratic mullahs. Instead, we can only accept a nation that believes in human flour-ishing and in the dignity of their own people, a government that repudiates the goal of annihilating Israel and the spreading their Islamic revolution across the Middle East. 
I am grateful that the American peo-
ple are more serious than Washington DC, but, it is not too late. I urge you to vote against the President’s deal with Iran. 
It is not in our national security in-
terest, and it is surely not in the inter-est of our friends in that most dan-gerous region on the face of the earth. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I came to 
the floor having spoken at great length last week outlining why I thought this agreement was something that ought to be fully debated and fully under-stood not only by Members of the Sen-ate but by the American people. We had that debate. We were promised from the very beginning and it was en-acted into law that Congress would be provided with all materials talked about and agreed upon before we had a vote to determine whether we would support approval or disapproval of this. We had a vote Thursday, which was procedural, to give us the opportunity to register our yes and no, our yea and nay. The American people deserve to know on the record where we stand on this. There have been arguments made on both sides of this issue. 
Personally, I think a close examina-
tion of this raises serious questions—so serious that it is not something some-one can come to the floor and simply say: Well, that is over, that is done, and let’s move on. There are more im-portant things ahead. It is hard for me to understand what is more important than getting this right. 
I think the issues I laid out last week 
on Thursday before the vote are issues

that still need consideration. But the 
real reason we are back here—thank you, Senator M
CCONNELL , for giving us 
another opportunity—is because we fell two votes short of the opportunity to even take a vote. We took a vote on a procedural measure—a measure which, as we all know, you can go home and hide behind. I don’t understand why my 
42 Democratic colleagues were afraid to put their names on a yes-or-no vote proposition so that everyone knows ex-actly where we stand and nobody can go home and make an excuse as to why they are for or why they are against it. It goes all the way back to the Scrip-tures: Let your yea be yea and your nay be nay. That has always been what I have believed to be the right way here in the United States Senate as well as the United States Congress so that when we go home, the people we rep-resent know exactly where we stand. 
I think what we are witnessing today 
in terms of the debates that will be taking place tomorrow in terms of the Presidential nomination process is the public partly frustrated—frustrated in many ways, but I think part is the fact that there is a lot of procedural gobble-dygook out there that elected Members can hide behind and not have a direct clarification of exactly where they stand on any particular issue. 
The purpose for delay was to hope-
fully give our Members the opportunity to go home and listen to their constitu-ents about how they feel about this, and perhaps we could have had two of the minority group who voted to block us from going forward—we won the ma-jority vote 58 to 42 on a bipartisan basis, including four Democrats, all of whom have significant foreign policy experience, some having more than the rest of us. So it was a bipartisan effort to move to this process, and we came up two short. We were hoping that over the weekend—I was assuming that many of my colleagues were receiving the same kinds of calls and input from their constituents as I was. Mine was running 10 to 1 against this agreement. The more we disclosed from this agree-ment, the more the American people learned about this agreement, the more concerned they were, and hopefully they expressed those concerns to their Senators who went home over the weekend having blocked us from this vote. 
At the very least, we are pleading 
that we could have a vote so that our yes is yes and our no is no, so that we reach the threshold by which we will buy a little bit of time to hopefully ex-pose more of this very flawed and I think fatally flawed agreement, more time for the American people to ex-press their wishes. 
We are not talking about a normal 
process of moving legislation through the Senate; we are talking about a process, a negotiation that will have enormous consequences for the future, enormous impact on the national safe-ty of this country, enormous impact on the world in terms of a rogue nation now having the pathway to develop-
ment of a nuclear weapons capability and weapons, unimpeded after this pe-riod of time expires. 
The very first thing people ought to 
understand is that coming down to the floor—or listening to the President of the United States say that this pre-vents Iran from having nuclear weap-ons or nuclear weapons capability is false. It is absolutely wrong. This pro-vides a pathway for them to get it. It just defers, but it legitimizes their be-coming a nuclear-armed nation. This rogue nation, which is seething ter-rorism throughout the Middle East and cries ‘‘Death to America’’ and extinc-tion to Israel, will have the wealth be-cause of the release of well over $100 billion, will have the capabilities be-cause even under this agreement their nuclear processing research and devel-opment goes forward—with our assist-ance. It is in the agreement, with our assistance. 
So this is not something we can sim-
ply say: Oh well, we had the vote, you guys came up short, and we will cease all debate because it is over. It was over for the President of the United States when he declared it an agree-ment, not a treaty. If ever something as consequential as this should fall under being a treaty and not an agree-ment, it is this agreement. Yet it was declared an executive agreement. The President obviously knew what he was doing because he has had a lot of prac-tice basically saying: I can bypass the Congress, I can bypass the Constitution by simply declaring it an executive agreement, an executive order, what-ever. 
In declaring this, it put us in a ter-
rible position. Thankfully, we were able to secure and vote into law, on a vote of 98 to 1, signed by the President of the United States, an agreement that would allow us to play a role in this and to look at the agreement and anything connected with this agree-ment before we made a decision and the opportunity to vote on approval or disapproval. 
Well, all that has been denied, and 
the President now only says it is over. The minority leader on Thursday said: It is over. Get over it. We are moving on. Other things need to be done. We just heard that again from one of my colleagues here, the second in com-mand on the Democrat’s side. Let’s move forward. Moving forward is a vio-lation of the law. That will be tested in courts. But it is very hard to under-stand how the administration and the 42 who voted for this could ignore the very language they voted for, the very language they agreed on, the very lan-guage that allowed us to go forward and understanding what this agree-ment says. 
Let me quote from the law which was 
signed by the President of the United States, in nearly unanimous agreement by the U.S. Congress: 
TRANSMISSION TO CONGRESS OF NUCLEAR  
AGREEMENTS WITH IRAN AND VERIFICATION  
ASSESSMENT WITH RESPECT TO SUCH AGREE -
MENTS  
The President shall— 
Not the President might, not the 
President could if he wants to or not if he doesn’t want to— 
transmit to the appropriate congressional 
committees and leadership . . . the agree-ment, as defined. . . . including all related materials and annexes . . . and any addi-tional materials related thereto. 
Including all related materials and 
annexes—including appendices, includ-ing codicils, including side agreements. 
We have been told—we have learned 
that there are two secret agreements that have been made between Iran and the inspection agency. We have not been allowed to see those agreements despite our pleas. We have been told by Secretary of State: They don’t matter. Don’t worry about it. It doesn’t di-rectly affect you. 
Who possibly could enter into any 
contractual agreement, any binding agreement with the adversary and not require access to the side agreements? Who would lease a car, who would buy a house, who would enter into any con-tractual arrangement with someone who said: Oh, by the way, there is some secret stuff here, but I can’t let you see what it is. But don’t worry—it really won’t affect this. 
I can’t conceive of anybody. This doesn’t take an Ivy League law 
school graduate or someone serving in the Congress who looks through this legislation and helps write this legisla-tion to have people understand that this alone ought to be reason not to vote for this agreement until they have access to that material—as required by the law they voted on. 
So how can a Member come down to 
this floor and simply say: I know ev-erything about this agreement, I like what it does, and I am voting for it. That is their privilege. That is their right. If they want to go home and ex-plain that to their people, that is their right to do so. But how can they go home and explain to the people: I voted for something without knowing exactly everything that is in it. And by the way, yeah, I voted for the opportunity to know that, it is in the law, but the President said, ‘‘Well, I am going to ig-nore that.’’ 
We have heard that from this Presi-
dent too many times, over and over and over: I am going to bypass Con-gress. I am going to game this thing so it goes my way and not your way. No input whatsoever. 
Here we stand. Why again? Because 
some of us—many of us—58 of us don’t want to simply throw up our hands and say: OK, you have got us. Let’s move on. What is next? Big deal. Not a lot of consequence here, but we will worry about that later. 
We are simply saying that we don’t 
think it is over. The actions by the ma-jority leader here have given us an op-portunity to take another shot at this.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6632 September 15, 2015 
Yogi Berra said, ‘‘It ain’t over till it’s 
over.’’ And I think John Belushi in ‘‘Animal House’’ said: It’s over? No, it ain’t over. It’s not over. 
So it is not over. We have a vote 
coming up this evening. This vote this evening will give the American people the opportunity to understand that this motion to this agreement is going to be killed through a procedural mo-tion without those who oppose it—even though they are in a minority but hav-ing the procedural right to do so under the Senate rules by leaving us two votes short of getting to that par-ticular point. 
What are they afraid of? You come 
down here and you tell people: This is a good agreement, but I don’t want to put my name on it. This is a good agreement, but we can’t keep talking about it. This is a good agreement, trust me, but, yeah, the side agree-ments—it is too bad we had to do that, but, you know, I guess we are not going to have access to that. 
I was surprised by what the previous 
speaker, the Senator from Illinois, said about the inspection agreement. Who could possibly agree to an agreement— concede to an agreement that, yes, we will have inspections, but you get to exclude the facility that did all of the nuclear research over the last decade. We are exempted—we need an exemp-tion from that. And we gave it to them. Also, by the way, we are not going to let you look at any of our military fa-cilities to see whether we have had any militarization of this process. Oh, by the way, if under the agreement you think we are cheating at some other fa-cilities around or places where you want to have some inspections, we will think about that. If we disagree, we will go through a Byzantine process to get to the point where the clock starts running, and then we have 24 days to try to figure all of this out. And some will say this goes on much longer. 
Having said everything I have said, 
having done everything I possibly can do, I am here to ask my colleagues— those who think this is a good deal—I am here basically just asking one thing even though I have major reservations. I am not even asking them to change their vote. I am asking them to give us the opportunity to have a vote. Give us an opportunity so that we can hold our heads high and go home and say: This is exactly how I came down on this, and here is my yes or here is my no. 
Isn’t that what the American people 
sent us here to do? We wonder why they are skeptical, why 70 percent of the people think they can’t trust Con-gress on probably the most consequen-tial, historic vote any of us in this body will have in our lifetime, with un-told consequences—which I am going to be talking about sometime later this week—for the future of the world, let alone for the future of America. How can we hide behind a procedural mo-tion so that we don’t have a full dec-laration of where the majority of this body and where the outstanding major-ity of the American people stand on 
this agreement? 
I am pleading to my colleagues, have 
the courage to stand up for what you believe in and give us a vote. Don’t hide behind a procedural motion. Any one of us has the capability of going home and confusing the heck out of our constituents by saying: Oh, well, there were problems with the agreement, and I think we can probably fix it, but this wasn’t the right time to do it, and we needed to move forward. By the way, the end of the fiscal year is coming up, and we have other important business to do. Or, it is irresponsible for Senator M
CCONNELL to require another vote or 
more debate on this. 
They want to run from this debate as 
fast as they can because the American public—I can only speak for my own constituents, but I see the polls also. There is heavy opposition to this—10 to 1 in my State, at least what has been sent to me through all the means of re-ceiving messages from people these days. 
I am going to end here. I see Senator 
C
ORKER on the floor, who is totally re-
sponsible for this language, which was illegally violated. It uses the word ‘‘shall’’ and it includes the words ‘‘side agreements’’ and anything related to this. We owe it to the American people to understand every possible con-sequence of this agreement and then make our decision, which will go down in history. However Members vote, they will carry that. We will see what this rogue Iran regime will do with it. 
All I know is they are cheering in the 
streets of Tehran. They are declaring this a victory that did not cross any one of their objections and crossed every one of our redlines. 
I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I want 
to thank the Senator from Indiana, who served as Ambassador to Germany, who has been so diligent in the pursuit of truth and knowledge relative to this agreement and obviously is very con-cerned about its implications. He has been a stalwart. He is leaving the Sen-ate at the end of this congressional term. We all are indebted to him for his tremendous concerns for our Nation’s national security and the efforts of di-plomacy to try to resolve the problems we have. 
I know we have another speaker com-
ing to floor in just one moment, but really because of what the Senator just said, I want to reiterate one more time as to why we are where we are. 
Four times since 2010, the Senate 
overwhelmingly, working with the House, put in place sanctions on Iran— four times. That was met with tremen-dous pushback from the administra-tion, which did not want to see those sanctions put in place by Congress. But those sets of sanctions are the very things that brought Iran to the table. The administration, along with Russia, China, Great Britain, France, and Ger-many, began negotiations with Iran be-
cause of the sanctions we overwhelm-ingly put in place in this body. Once they were about to reach a conclusion, the administration decided that in-stead of giving this to us in the form of a treaty—which is their choice. It is their choice under our form of govern-ment. I know we have a lot of people in 
our country who are very upset about this, but, in fact, it is their choice. They could have presented it as a con-gressional-executive agreement, which does live beyond that, but they decided instead that they were going to do it as an executive agreement and totally by-pass Congress. That was their purpose. As a matter of fact, I wrote a letter to the President, and they responded very quickly: Yes, our plan is to bypass Con-gress and go directly to the U.N. Secu-rity Council. We are going to do this as an executive agreement. That obvi-ously met with a lot of resistance here, but it is their choice. But the problem with that, of course, is that it only lasts while they are in office, and then the next Executive can change. 
Because all of us had brought Iran to 
the table and because the administra-tion had planned to use a national se-curity waiver to waive our sanctions— the ones that brought them to the table—we resisted. We began on our side of the aisle, saying: No, we want a voice in this. We brought them to the table. This is the biggest foreign policy issue that is going to occur while we are here, in all likelihood. 
We began pushing on this side of the 
aisle, and eventually we were able to get some support on this side of the aisle. Eventually we passed 98 to 1 a bill called the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, which, by the way, took back power from the President, basi-cally saying: You cannot implement this for a 60-day period after it ends. You have to give us the materials. We have to be able to go through all the materials. Of course, we haven’t gotten all of the materials. Then we have the right to disapprove or approve. But there is going to be a pause on behalf of the American people, we are going to go through this in detail, and then we are going to vote. 
That was actually a taking back of 
power from the administration which kept them from immediately being able to implement. We are in that pe-riod of time now. The administration has said the clock ends on Thursday. We are having this vote, but everybody has said in this body that this is a vote of conscience. Everybody has said that. 
By the way, I would add that over-
whelming support for sanctions, over-whelming support for review—there would be an overwhelming vote of ap-proval had the administration done what they said they were going to do when they began these negotiations, which was to end Iran’s nuclear pro-gram. Had they done that, we would be seeing a totally different outcome here. There would be 100 people here voting in support of an agreement. But

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6633 September 15, 2015 
what they did was they squandered 
that opportunity—squandered it. In-stead, with U.S. approval, Iran will be industrializing its nuclear program. Research and development will take place. All Iran has to do is adhere to the agreement, and it will be an ad-vanced nuclear country. 
Again, if they had just done what 
they said, we would be supporting them. So now here we are. The Amer-ican people have difficulty. We are in a process right now. In the Senate, we have something called cloture. When both sides of the aisle feel as though the debate has ended, we invoke clo-ture and then we move to the final vote. We have had plenty of debate. 
By the way, in the Foreign Relations 
Committee, we have had 12 hearings, not to count the informal meetings that have taken place. Every Senator in this body probably knows more about this nuclear deal than any inter-national arrangement that has been agreed to in recent times. I mean, peo-ple have gone through it tooth and comb. So what is happening now is that we have a bipartisan majority that opposes this deal. What has hap-pened—it is unfortunate, but Senator R
EID—I don’t know whether he saw 
this as a contest between himself and the majority. I don’t know what hap-pened. But in August, he decided he wanted to mount a filibuster. It is our understanding that the administration supported that filibuster. They wanted the Senate to block us from being able to vote our conscience. 
This next vote is not a vote of con-
science. It is not. It is a demonstration of 42 Senators—at least that is what happened last time—42 Senators—a mi-nority—refusing to let the majority, a bipartisan majority—the 2 most knowl-edgeable Democrats on foreign policy issues oppose this agreement. What they are doing is blocking us from hav-ing that vote of conscience. It has taken on a little bit of a Tammy Wynette kind of tone to me. It appears to me that this is about standing by their man. It is not about allowing us to vote our conscience. 
So, yes, people are upset. Almost 
unanimous support for sanctions to bring them to the table. Only one Sen-ator disagreeing with our ability to weigh in. Now we are at a point where it is time to weigh in, and the minority leader, my friend from Nevada, has or-ganized, with the administration’s sup-port, a filibuster, which is, by the way, put in place to make sure there is enough debate. We know there has been enough debate. But instead of allowing debate to end, tonight it appears. I hope there are some consciences in this body that say: Wait a minute, this is wrong. 
By the way, I know people say: Well, 
this is just the way the Senate oper-ates. I will tell you this: I have voted for enough things I disagree strongly with to make the Senate work to be able to make this appeal to my friends. Look, 98 of us voted to allow us to vote up or down on whether we agree with 
the substance of this deal. It is totally inappropriate, from my perspective, that a minority of Senators, all on one side of the aisle—definitely a partisan act, a very partisan act—appear in-tended to keep the President from get-ting a message of disapproval from the Senate. It appears to me that what they are going to do is do it again. 
I want to say to my friends on the 
other side of the aisle that our leader here has honored the request of the body—at least up until now. He has honored the request to be about a reso-lution of approval or disapproval. In this case, since a majority disapprove, it is a resolution of disapproval, but what we have seen him do is fill the tree. A lot of people don’t know what that means, so I will explain. We could have had a lot of amendments—and up until this point we haven’t had these amendments—that would have been pretty tough votes to make that are re-lated to this arrangement, but not about the disapproval itself. 
What our leader has done—in order 
to keep the debate civil, sober, and fo-cused on what we are here at hand about—he has actually filled the tree and kept those amendments from com-ing in place. 
We will have another vote at 6 p.m. 
We will keep it open for a couple of hours because it is a Jewish holiday, and we want to make sure that all of our colleagues can get back here and have the opportunity to register their vote. 
I ask my friends on the other side of 
the aisle: Is this really in keeping with the spirit of what we have done? 
I have had friends say: Well, we have 
known all along that it would take 60 votes. It doesn’t take but a week here to understand that a cloture vote has to be overcome, and in the Senate that takes 60 votes. My friend from Virginia keeps saying: Well, we all know it takes 60 votes. Look, I understand. The American people understand that it takes 60 votes to move beyond cloture to get to a final vote, which, by the way, is an up-or-down vote at 51. 
So the American people understand 
what is happening: 42 Senators on the other side of the aisle, my friends, after voting 98 to 1 that we could weigh in, have decided that what they are going to do is keep us from being able to vote the majority, up or down, because they know if we do, a bipartisan majority— the two most knowledgeable Demo-crats on foreign policy disapprove it, making it 58 votes—would be able to send to the President the feelings of this body, and that is the majority be-lieves that this deal should be dis-approved and that the administration has squandered the opportunity that we helped create because they did not end the nuclear program. Instead what they have done with this deal was to basically legitimize it. 
As the Presiding Officer mentioned 
the other day, we are going to be help-ing them with technology. They will continue with research and develop-
ment. We have lifted the ballistic-mis-sile ban, the conventional ban, and we are going to agree to let them begin testing missiles immediately. 
As our Presiding Officer mentioned 
the other day: What do they need ICBMs for? Think about it. What do they need them for? 
I know it is time for Senator M
ORAN  
to speak on the floor, so I will close with this: The American people know they have no practical need for this program—none. They have one nuclear plant. They could buy and enrich ura-nium much cheaper. We know this is about one thing, and that is them being a nuclear state, and, in essence, we are agreeing to the industrializa-tion of their program. 
With that, I yield the floor to Sen-
ator M
ORAN . 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. 
AYOTTE ). The Senator from Kansas. 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I ap-
preciate the remarks of my esteemed colleague of Tennessee, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. He has the knowledge and relationships in the Senate to make the case he just made. 
I wish to just briefly address what I 
see as terrible flaws in this agreement which was negotiated by the Obama ad-ministration with other countries and with Iran. 
I have previously outlined my objec-
tions on the Senate floor. I will restate that I strongly oppose the agreement and would hope that the Senate, on be-half of the American people, our na-tional security, and peace around the globe, would make the same decision that I have made, which is that this agreement results in less stability, a greater likelihood of war, and a nuclear Iran—a country that is capable of de-livering nuclear devices across its bor-der, shouts ‘‘Death to America.’’ We are acquiescing by the action the Sen-ate has taken to date that this agree-ment will take effect. 
I can’t imagine a more significant 
vote that Members of the Senate will take than this one, certainly in the arena of national security, national de-fense, and international relations. This agreement concedes too much and se-cures too little. 
I serve on the banking committee. 
This is the committee that, because of our oversight over the Treasury De-partment, is responsible for legislation dealing with sanctions. I have partici-pated in the debate in the committee and on the Senate floor about the sanc-tions that Congress has put in place against Iran. In my view, my col-leagues and I—and I can certainly speak for myself—did not vote to put sanctions in place for the purposes of causing Iran to negotiate a path to nu-clear capabilities. I voted for sanctions time and time again. I voted to in-crease them, encouraged by my letters and comments on the Senate floor, in my conversations with administration officials, and with my colleagues in the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6634 September 15, 2015 
Senate that we tighten the sanctions. I 
didn’t ask that the sanctions be tight-ened. I didn’t encourage the adminis-tration to be more forceful in their en-forcement for purposes of creating a setting in which Iran could negotiate a way out of the sanctions for the pur-pose of developing nuclear capabilities. Those sanctions were put in place for the purpose of keeping Iran from be-coming a nuclear power. Instead those sanctions have been the excuse by which this administration has nego-tiated a deal that is bad for the United States, bad for our European and worldwide allies, and particularly bad for our allies in the Middle East. 
One would think that any agreement 
that was negotiated would dismantle Iran’s nuclear capabilities. This agree-ment does not do that. One would as-sume that any agreement negotiated would prohibit the dollars from flow-ing—particularly billions of dollars to Iran—until they had complied with the terms of the agreement. But, no, this agreement allows the dollars to flow nearly from the beginning. 
Iran will become a legitimized and 
enriched nuclear power, and they will become a wealthier, nuclear-capable country that supports terrorism in the Middle East and around the globe. As they have clearly stated, they will con-tinue their effort to terrorize the world and end our way of life in the West as we know it with their continual chants of ‘‘Death to America.’’ 
As perhaps an issue that ought to be 
raised, one would think the adminis-tration would negotiate the release of Americans held captive in Iran as part of this agreement, but, no, they said that was extraneous. Yet, they nego-tiated issues related not only to nu-clear capability but other weapons al-lowing Iran to increase its weaponization outside the nuclear arena. 
I wish to now talk about the process. 
I came to the Senate following an elec-tion in 2010, and the frustration I im-mediately experienced was that this place was doing next to nothing. For most of my life, I have been encouraged when Congress wasn’t at work because I thought my constituents were safer in the absence of congressional activ-ity, but I came to the Senate with the intention of having a Senate that would work for the purpose of undoing many of the things that have happened over a long period of time that, in my view, are damaging to our freedoms and liberties and damaging to our abil-ity to live the American dream. 
I learned in a matter of a few weeks 
of my arrival in the Senate, and after taking the oath of office, that in this place the plan was to do nothing. We have seen that time and time again. My reaction to that was: I want to go out and see if we can get a Republican majority in which we have different leadership of the Senate, in which the goal is to have a Senate that functions, and the opportunity is for every Sen-ator, Republican and Democrat, to present their ideas on behalf of their 
constituents and make the case to the rest of us that those ideas are worthy of our support. 
The goal, in part, for a change in the 
majority of the Senate was to have a functioning Senate in which every Sen-ator, Republican or Democrat, had the chance to present their ideas. I thought, as a result of a change in the majority, that when we all, Repub-licans and Democrats, had the oppor-tunity to present those ideas on behalf of our constituents, we would see a change in the attitude and approach of the way the Senate operates. 
For much of my early life, what I dis-
covered about America’s Congress— about the Senate and the House—was that there were Senators who didn’t care who the President was or what party the President belonged to. There were Republican Senators who would disagree with a Republican President and Democratic Senators who would disagree with a Democratic President. Somehow over time, the political na-ture of our country has changed, and it seems to me we put the party of our President above the well-being of our Nation. That is dangerous. 
I oppose this agreement not because 
it was negotiated by a Democratic President. I oppose this agreement be-cause it is wrong, and it is bad for America. I thought the Senate—once the opportunities for all of us to present our ideas was available—would once again see the days in which it was not about party affiliation, but about the idea of presenting the best course and direction our country should go. Unfortunately, it seems to me, that the Iran agreement is the poster child for a Senate that is once again bogged down in support of a President on an agree-ment that is unworthy of that support. 
Our country desperately needs men 
and women who serve in public office whose decisions are made not because they are pressured by a President, not because their President shares their party and political affiliation. Deci-sions need to be made here that benefit Americans today but, more impor-tantly, Americans in the future. What seems to me to be missing in my ef-forts to change the nature of the Sen-ate is that we are still mired in the cir-cumstance in which—in the absence of 60 votes—the Senate’s will on behalf of the American people cannot be ex-pressed. 
The point I guess I failed to under-
stand is when new leadership came into play that was open and receptive to Democratic and Republican Senators presenting their thoughts, amendments being offered, bills being considered, most of my Democrat colleagues would find that appealing because we all came here to do something we believe in, not to play a political game. Unfor-tunately, that does not seem, to me, to be the case today. 
This is the opportunity for us to 
change course and return the Senate to the day in which it was deliberative and in which Senators spoke on behalf 
of the well-being of the country as compared to the well-being of a Presi-dent. It is very discouraging to me. We worked hard to make certain that the Senate became a place different than it was, and unfortunately we see in this circumstance it doesn’t appear to be much different than it was a year ago. 
I have been a supporter of the rules 
that allow for a filibuster, that require 60 votes for the Senate to advance an issue. I always thought that protected the minority—people who have dif-ferent points of view, people who come to Washington, DC, and may not be in the majority and may feel as if they would be run over in the absence of their ability to protect their constitu-ents, their ideas, and 60 votes was de-signed to protect the minority view-points in this country. 
This becomes the moment, in my 
view, in which we can look at what has transpired on the debate on Iran and reach the conclusion that the 60-vote rule is damaging to the future of our country because it is damaging to the ability of the Senate to work the will of the American people and to make decisions that advance a cause dif-ferent from one’s political party and political philosophy. 
In my view, the time has come for us 
to consider this issue of how the fili-buster works. It is because this issue is so important and the outcome of this debate so valuable to the future of our country and the security of the world that in this case, we need to move for-ward with a majority vote to allow this agreement to be rejected. 
This agreement is not worthy of the 
protection it is being given by a minor-ity of Senators. It is supported—the re-jection of this treaty—this agreement; it should be a treaty—the rejection of this agreement is opposed by a major-ity of Republican and Democratic Sen-ators. Yet we will never have the op-portunity—unless a couple of our col-leagues decide to do what is right this evening—for the American people to see where we stand on this issue. 
These are serious times. Nothing is 
easy in the world. It is always difficult to know what the right answers are, but the path the Senate is on today and the path the Senate took last Thursday is a terrible mistake for the future of our country and the security of our citizens. I urge the Senate to allow consideration of this agreement, and I urge the Senate to reject this agree-ment for the good of America.

Mr. ROUNDS. Madam President, I

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6635 September 15, 2015 
JCPOA, between the United States, 
Great Britain, France, China, Russia, Germany, and the Islamic Republic of Iran. Much has been said about the agreement over the past weeks and months. My colleagues have addressed a great number of concerns and defi-ciencies about the deal and many out-side experts have testified before mul-tiple committees of Congress explain-ing their views as well. 
In addressing these concerns, I wish 
to ask just a few simple questions: Do we believe that with this agreement the United States and our allies are safer today than we were 1 year ago and will we be safer when the nuclear limitations expire in 10 years? The an-swers to these questions are very im-portant. They will dictate what we de-cide in one of the most important votes we will cast in the 114th Congress. 
After closely examining the agree-
ment, the following can be concluded: Upon verification by the IAEA—the International Atomic Energy Agency— of Iranian compliance, supposedly within a few months if Iran is in com-pliance, they will, after payment of their obligations, receive around $56 billion that were frozen in overseas ac-counts. Further revenue will be gen-erated because the European Union has agreed to lift its ban on the import of Iranian oil, thereby providing Iran with billions more in revenue with which to repair its oilfields and begin to repair its battered economy. 
According to the Wall Street Jour-
nal, Iran’s Deputy Petroleum Minister recently stated that his country’s oil exports would reach 2.3 million barrels a day, compared with around 1.2 mil-lion barrels per day today. Iran would also gain access to 50 million barrels of oil which have been held offshore, and economists estimate that Iran’s econ-omy will grow up to 9 percent in the year after the implementation of the agreement. 
This verification that we talk about 
by the IAEA will be accomplished through protocols that Members of the Senate have not seen in writing and that the administration has not—nor will they—agreed to provide to us. This is in direct contravention to the Iran review act, which the President signed into law, agreeing to provide all docu-ments and side agreements and, ac-cording to reports, will unbelievably allow the Iranians to provide their own inspections of their military work on nuclear sites to the IAEA. 
A robust inspection of a regime re-
quires an anytime, anywhere inspec-tion policy. Unfortunately, under the idea of managed access, as found in this agreement, if the IAEA requests access to an undeclared location, under this agreement Iran can delay access to the facility for 2 weeks or longer with the outlined multistep process for undeclared locations. 
U.S. sanctions against foreign firms 
for dealing with Iran in the oil and fi-nancial sectors, which have been the most effective sanctions enacted against Iran, will be suspended upon 
implementation of this agreement. Sanctions prohibiting U.S. firms from conducting business with Iran will re-main in place, but with a large carve- out for non-U.S. entities that are owned or controlled by U.S. companies. Some sanctions will also be lifted against Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, the entity that actually runs the mili-tary aspects of Iran’s nuclear program. Furthermore, the agreement requires the United States to make certain that U.S. State and local governments com-ply with sanctions relief contravening their own sanctions placed on Iran. 
Now, this proposal, the JCPOA, also 
commits the P5+1—that working group of countries—to work to strengthen Iran’s ability to protect against and re-spond to nuclear security threats, in-cluding sabotage, which we can pre-sume would mean from even our allies who feel deeply threatened by this agreement which transforms Iran—a terrorist State—into a breakout nu-clear power and still a terrorist State. 
In year 5 of the agreement, Iran will 
be removed from the United Nations arms embargo. Yet as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, GEN Martin Dempsey, told the Senate Armed Serv-ices Committee in August: ‘‘Under no circumstances should we relieve pres-sure on Iran relative to ballistic mis-sile capabilities and arms trafficking.’’ 
In year 8 of the agreement, Iran will 
be removed from the United Nations ballistic missile embargo. 
Now, in July of this year, Secretary 
of Defense Ashton Carter confirmed to me in a hearing that under this deal, he could not rule out Iran acquiring, within 10 years, an intercontinental ballistic missile that could hit the United States. This means Iran would have the capability of producing a nu-clear weapon that could reach U.S. soil in a decade. 
These comments come after Gen. 
Paul Selva, now the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told me dur-ing a separate hearing that Iran re-mains the leading State sponsor of ter-rorism, and resources gained in sanc-tions relief under the nuclear deal could be used by Iran to continue spon-soring terrorism. 
Under the agreement, the United 
States agreed to allow the nuclear-re-lated equipment to remain in Iran under lock and key, and Iran will be al-lowed to continue researching IR–4, IR– 5, IR–6, and IR–8 centrifuges. Iran will also be allowed to begin testing IR–6 and IR–8 centrifuges in cascades of 30 at year 8 of the agreement. After 8 years, many of the research-and-devel-opment restrictions are removed and Iran will begin to manufacture ad-vanced centrifuges. All R&D restric-tions end at 10 years. 
Finally, after 10 years, Iran will be 
free of the restrictions on enrichment and could become a nuclear threshold State—legally, under international law—only postponing the inevitable nuclearization of Iran. So with these facts established, I am 
left with what appears to me to be the undeniable answers to my questions: The United States and our Middle Eastern allies are absolutely not safer today than we were 1 year ago, and we will all be left unquestionably less safe when this agreement ends in 10 years. I, therefore, oppose this deal. It is an agreement that will reward a violent terrorist regime. Instead of stopping the Iranians from ever obtaining a nu-clear weapon, it merely delays it. This deal is shortsighted and dangerous for our security. 
Just a few days ago I was talking 
with my 8-year-old grandson. He asked me what I was working on in the Sen-ate. I told him about the President’s proposed deal with Iran. I told him what we were giving them. I told him about the money, the lifting of the sanctions, the access to weapons and, soon, the ability to make a very bad bomb. After all of this, he looked at me and he simply asked: ‘‘What do we get out of it?’’ If this third grader can see how bad this deal is, so should we. 
In conclusion, I urge my fellow Sen-
ators to vote not only to allow us to debate this issue but to vote in opposi-tion to the President’s deal with Iran. It is truly wrong for the United States and for the world. If my grandson un-derstood that we truly are getting a bad deal—one that we should reject— most certainly we should understand as well. 
Madam President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I am 
moved by the comments of my friend. He told me the story regarding the dis-cussion with his 8-year-old grandson. 
I wish to reiterate that had the 
President and those he designated to negotiate done what they said they were going to do—and that was to end Iran’s nuclear program, something we all celebrated—and if the good Senator could say to his grandson that is what we got out of the deal, what we would have here today is unanimous support of approval. 
This body was so involved in bringing 
Iran to the table. It is unbelievable the way—in these days and times, since 2010, four times the Senate has voted almost unanimously to put sanctions in place to bring Iran to the table. It is also hard to believe the administration took the one issue that has caused us to almost have unanimity which, let’s face it, is rare in these times—the one issue where we have had almost una-nimity is to bring it to the table by passing sanctions and then give us a right to weigh in. They were trying to go around Congress by going directly to the U.N. Security Council. But what they did on an issue that the American people are solidly behind—and that is Iran not having nuclear weapons—what they did was squander—squander—the one opportunity for this body to act in unison; that is, to approve what they have done.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6636 September 15, 2015 
As the Senator just mentioned, what 
they have agreed to—what the partisan minority Senators on the other side of the aisle will not even allow us to vote on—vote our disapproval where a bipar-tisan majority disapproves—what they have agreed to, literally, is, with U.S. approval, Iran can industrialize their nuclear program, can develop long- range missiles, can be involved in re-search and development, which makes the IR–1 centrifuges, where all the focus has been, look like antiques com-pared to what they are going to be— what they are developing right now, and we are allowing them to do that. Again, this is in a country that has no need for a nuclear program—none. 
I mean, there is no practical need for 
the pain they have put their citizens through for the past several years under these crushing sanctions that brought them to the table that we put in place—no reason for that. They want to be a threshold nuclear country, and our government—our officials—has agreed to that. They have agreed to that at a time when we have no Middle East policy—none. We are watching on television refugees from countries that are the result of the fact that we have no Middle East policy. In that vacuum, this Nation—this administration, with-out this being disapproved and sent back—this Nation is going to agree to the industrialization of the No. 1 state sponsor of terror, which is propping up the regime that is causing all of these refugees to be flooding into Europe and other places. 
With that, I see Senator C
ASSIDY of 
Louisiana who has been such a stalwart on national security issues, and I will yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
Mr. CASSIDY. I thank the chairman 
of the committee. 
Madam President, the challenge in 
speaking after so many others have on this agreement is that almost every angle has been addressed. But the ad-vantage is that I have been able to learn what others have to say and per-haps introduce new ideas. 
I am actually struck that Democrats 
and Republicans agree. We all agree that the Iranian agreement is flawed, that it does not achieve the objectives originally defined by President Obama, and everyone is worried that the Ira-nians will use a portion of the $50 to $100 billion they receive as a result of this agreement to advance the cause of terrorism. 
What we do not agree on is whether 
or not the administration could have and can get a better deal. Ironically, Republicans have more faith in the President than the President’s fellow Democrats do. Republicans think that if Barack Obama and John Kerry called them back up—showed leadership among our allies—that we can do bet-ter and Democrats think not. I con-tinue to have more faith in the Presi-dent and Secretary Kerry than my Democratic colleagues because typi-cally the stronger party in a negotia-
tion gets the better deal. It seems as if the United States and our allies were the stronger parties. 
Iran’s economy is in terrible shape. 
The regime’s survival is threatened by dissatisfaction with 25 years of a cor-rupt bureaucratic autocracy, with eco-nomic mismanagement. Iran needs to get $130 per barrel of oil to meet the government’s obligations, and oil is far below that. Iran’s trading partners are limited, and aside from this, the Ira-nian people want freedom. There is dis-content with the regime. 
But far from the stronger party pre-
vailing, this agreement concedes on the 
very goals that it sought to achieve. We pursued this agreement with the in-tention of ridding Iran of its nuclear program. Instead we have agreed to lift sanctions that have crippled Iran’s economy and give immediate access to $60 billion, essentially bailing out a struggling regime. It is fair to ask: In return for what? 
According to the President and my 
colleagues who support this deal, we get the opportunity not to go to war, and all Iran had to do was simply agree to continue developing and running their nuclear program in a peaceful manner. But to quote Leon Wieseltier, a Senior Fellow at the Brookings Insti-tute: 
This agreement was designed to prevent 
Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. If it does not prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons—and it seems uncontroversial to suggest that it does not guarantee such an outcome—then it does not solve the problem that it was designed to solve. And if it does not solve the problem that it was designed to solve, then it is itself not an alternative, is it? The status is still quo. 
How can it be the claim that this Ira-
nian agreement protects the American people from the dangers of war when we are also told that the United States must provide more military support to our allies in the region because of this deal increasing the likelihood of war? 
Secretary Kerry acknowledged in a 
September 2 letter that, indeed, war is more likely: ‘‘Iran’s continued support for terrorist and proxy groups through-out the region, its propping up of the Assad regime in Syria, its efforts to undermine the stability of its regional neighbors, and the threat it poses to Israel’’ are real concerns. He goes on to say, ‘‘We have no illusion that this be-havior will change following the imple-mentation of the JCPOA.’’ 
Why are we willingly, I ask, legiti-
mizing a nuclear program of a country that we feel this way about or, worse yet, why are we willingly agreeing to lift sanctions, which gives Iran billions of dollars and an improved economy and therefore the extra resources with which they can buy and distribute con-ventional weapons, which Iran can now buy legally? Regarding the purpose of the conventional weapons, in the final hours of negotiations, the lifting of the embargo against the sale of conven-tional weapons and missiles was added to this deal. In just 5 years we lift the embargo against conventional weap-
ons, and in 8 years we lift the embargo against ballistic missiles. Secretary Kerry has declared that this provision is a win. The terrible thing about this deal is that it is full of wins such as this. Iran’s interest is advanced, and the rest of the world is less safe. 
This does not add up. We have the ad-
ministration claiming that the regime is weak underneath our sanctions—and for that reason Rouhani was able to persuade Khamenei to come to the table for negotiations—yet stating that Iran’s opposition to lifting the arms embargo was too strong to resist. The country cannot be too strong and too weak at the same time. 
Furthermore, knowing that the Ira-
nians have cheated on numerous pre-vious nuclear agreements, why don’t we have a stronger mechanism with which to punish them should they cheat? All this deal puts in place is the snapback. The hope is that reimposing sanctions on Iran will once more crip-ple their economy. The same sanctions that have been implemented over many years are expected to somehow imme-diately return to full strength. What is to say that countries such as Russia or China, which were initially reluctant to impose the sanctions on Iran, would agree to snap back should Iran cheat? Especially considering how much stronger Iran will be once their econ-omy is given the chance to rebound, it seems more likely that these countries believe the economic advantages of lifting sanctions on Iran far outweigh the implications of a nuclear Iran. 
It has been stated one way or another 
by others, but I will discuss something that has not been discussed in relation to the Iranian agreement but which I am surprised is not of greater concern to Democrats. In its environmental im-pact statement issued in February 2014, the State Department estimated that the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would ultimately carry 830,000 barrels of oil daily, could increase emissions of heat- trapping greenhouse gases by 1.3 to 27.4 million metric tons annually. Based on these calculations, President Obama has denied Americans a chance to ex-pand our energy independence and to in turn create 40,000 direct jobs and many more indirect. If this deal goes through—the Iranian deal—the Iranian oil minister stated that Iran could send 500,000 barrels of oil per day to the market immediately upon easing the sanctions and up to 1 million barrels of oil per day within 6 months. According to an estimate by a DC think tank, if Iran increases their oil production by this much, it will release 156 million more metric tons of carbon dioxide per day. Wait a second. If we build the Key-stone XL Pipeline, we may have 1.3 million metric tons. We can’t do that because of greenhouse gases. But the Iranian agreement, which the Presi-dent said has to occur, will increase greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 156 million metric tons—over 100 times more.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6637 September 15, 2015 
If climate change is the greatest 
threat to the United States, even greater than a nuclear Iran, it seems as though the President has said he is willing to accept that danger in order to give the Iranians this deal. 
Well, I return to where I started. I 
ask my Democratic Senate colleagues not to have such low expectations of the President and to demand a better deal for the American people. I stand by the assertion that the alternative to this bad deal is not war, but a better deal. 
I am confident that our Nation can 
stand from a position of power and ne-gotiate the deal we set out to achieve. 
Thank you, Madam President. I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. RISCH. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. RISCH. Madam President, I am 
here to make a few remarks about the proposed agreement between the United States—our participation in the agreement with the Government of Iran. I am going to speak briefly be-cause we have been through this. I just want to underscore a few points that are very important to me as to why I am going to be voting the way I am voting. 
I think, first of all, one of the things 
you always want to do when you are entering into an agreement is weigh whom it is you are making an agree-ment with. I always told clients when I was practicing law that more impor-tant than the words on the paper were the people whose signatures appeared at the bottom. I think, in this par-ticular instance, we could not have a worse situation than what we have. 
The Iranians have shown us what 
they are made of for decades. We all know what they are made of. This is not going to be a good time as we go forward. Generally, when people make an agreement, and people make agree-ments every day, they agree on an ob-jective and then both cooperate as they move forward toward that objective. That is not going to happen here. We have seen before the Iranians operate under similar circumstances. They cheat, to begin with, on a regular basis. But just as importantly, they will stiff- arm, they will drag their feet, they will misinterpret, they will challenge, they will do everything possible to avoid meeting the objective of the agree-ment. 
How did all of this start? You remem-
ber when this whole thing started, ev-eryone was cheering about what a won-derful thing this is, and we are going to go forward with this, but we do not trust them, and no agreement is better than a bad agreement. Well, what has happened since then? There is not any-body saying this is a good agreement. This is a bad agreement. So why did we 
not stick with the proposition that no agreement was better than a bad agree-ment? Now the mantra that people are talking about is, well, it is not perfect. 
I would urge that with what we are 
dealing, the people we are dealing with, and because of the consequences for America, for the world, for the Middle East, it needs to be perfect, and it is nowhere near perfect. I want to under-score a couple things in that regard. 
The other thing we started out with 
was that the President promised us that we are going to have inspections anytime, anyplace. Nothing could be further from the truth now that this agreement has been put on the table. This is not an anytime, anyplace agree-ment. Indeed, the procedures—if you wade through the difficult and complex procedures for how you get to an in-spection when there is suspicion or even when there is not suspicion, if you are just doing it to check, it is going to be very difficult to do that. In addition to that, there are places in Iran that are off limits. No American will ever set foot in there. No IAEA inspector will ever set foot in there. 
So why anyone would make this kind 
of agreement is beyond me. I am talk-ing about Parchin. Parchin is a place where they have done the kind of work in the past that we want to stop. In-deed, by getting in there, by going through it, by inspecting it and doing an analysis, we would be able to tell what they did so we could expect what they would do in the future—and they will. In addition to that, the most like-ly place in Iran for bad things to hap-pen is at Parchin. No one can get in Parchin. Why would the Iranians insist on a provision in this agreement that no one can get into Parchin? There is only one reason: They intend to cheat and they intend to do it at Parchin. They have gotten away with a lot of things at Parchin in the past, so they want to protect it. 
All of these things argue for no 
agreement being better than a bad agreement, which this is. 
Let me talk about a couple of the 
things. There has been a lot of time spent on them, but this situation re-garding the money is just—I don’t un-derstand how people can talk about signing on to this agreement, when you are talking about what is going to hap-pen with the money that is going to be freed up for Iran. There is $150 billion that is going to be freed up. Now, you will get people who say: Well, it is not that much because they owe this. It is dedicated here, what have you. So let’s just take the 50 billion that everybody believes—I think they say 54 billion, but let’s take $50 billion—$50 billion. In Iran this is not small change. Here in the United States, obviously, it would be a much smaller amount. But the statistics, when you compare what $50 billion means to the regime in Iran, it is very substantial. 
What does Iran do with its money 
when it gets money? Since the sanc-tions have been on, their economy has 
been ratcheting down and down. Life has become much more difficult there from an economic standpoint. The gov-ernment has very little money to oper-ate. But every country has national priorities. Every single country on the face of this Earth has national prior-ities. The only way can you judge it is how they have spent their money in the past. During this period of time, while they were in very difficult finan-cial straits, they had the ability to fund and to finance the worst enemies America has, the worst enemies the world has—terrorists. They have fund-ed Hamas, they have funded the Houthi 
rebels, they have funded Hezbollah, and others. Every problem we have in the world with terrorism has Iran’s finger-prints on it. 
They have been able to fund that 
even when they were in difficult finan-cial straits. What do you think is going to happen when they get this windfall of $50 billion? Those organizations are going to become flush with cash. They are going to be able do things they have not been able to do in the past. If you go to the hospitals here in America where our veterans are lying with missing limbs—arms and legs—almost all of them, almost all of them were caused by a device that Iran either made or financed. That is where this money is going to go. How can you go to bed at night saying, well, yes, I agreed to this because it is going to be a wonderful thing for the world, when you have actually put money in the hands of these terrorists who are going to hurt America’s best who go out into the field? It boggles my mind. When you are sitting at the negotiating table, why did someone not say: Hey, if we catch any of this money going to terrorists, all bets are off, and we are going to pull back everything. 
It is not just the $50 billion. More im-
portant than that is Iran will now have a continuous cashflow because they are going to be able to sell their oil, and they are going to be able to generate substantial amounts of money. So it is not just the $50 billion. This money thing is a real problem. It absolutely boggles my mind that—I don’t know how anybody who supports this is going to look these Americans in the eye who are hurt by these devices that are made and that are financed by Iran. It is going to go on. It is going to con-tinue. This money is going to be used for that. That alone, to me, is suffi-cient reason not to vote for this. It should be sent back, saying: Look, we need a specific agreement that this money is going to be used for domestic purposes for you to help the people of Iran—the people who want to do good things—and not sent off to foreign ter-rorists who are going to use that money to kill Americans and to kill other people. 
I wish to talk for a second about the 
secret agreements that are incor-porated into this. Who—who—would sign a contract or an agreement where

you incorporated two agreements made 
by two third parties, you don’t know what is in them—you will never know what is in them unless things go south and go south badly—but you will have agreed to that. Whatever happens as a result of these secret agreements— whatever happens as a result of these secret agreements—we are going to have to abide by it because we will have entered into this. 
Nobody enters into a contract to buy 
a bicycle where they have secret agree-ments. You wouldn’t buy a consumer product for your home if at the bottom line it said: By the way, there are two agreements between so and so and so and so. Neither of them is a part of this, but by buying this and signing this contract, you are agreeing to whatever is in there. 
I don’t understand that. No American 
has seen it. We get fairly good informa-tion in the Intelligence Committee, and we have had closed hearings on this. We have dragged in everybody. The closest I have come to is Wendy Sherman. She was the No. 2 negotiator behind John Kerry. John Kerry has not seen these agreements—and everybody tells you what is in these agreements. 
I cross-examined them: How do you know what is in these 
agreements? 
Well, that is what we were told. Well, how do you know it if you 
haven’t seen it? 
Well, the Iranians tell us what is in 
there, and the IAEA tells us what is in there. So we are willing to accept that. 
But no American has seen it. Wendy 
Sherman admitted she was in a room with a number of people when the agreements were there, and they were being waved around, but she did not read those agreements. She cannot tell us what is in those agreements. She tried to tell us what is in those agree-ments. Others tried to tell us what is in those agreements, but nobody knows because they will not let us see what is in those agreements. 
Why is that? Do you think there are 
things in those agreements that show this is a good deal? 
They are hiding stuff. There are bad 
things in there for America. Yet people are willing to sign on to this and to en-dorse, to adopt, and to ratify two se-cret agreements that no American has ever seen or can vouch for what is in those two secret agreements. 
One of the things that is included in 
there that they have admitted is how Parchin gets inspected or, rather, isn’t inspected. If they are willing to admit that in those secret agreements there is a provision that says Parchin will never be inspected, can you imagine what the rest of the matters are that are in those agreements? It is out-rageous for someone to adopt, on be-half of the American people, provisions that they don’t know what they are. 
Let me just say that I come back to 
where I started; that is, we need to have a full appreciation of whom we are dealing with. While this is going on, while the Senate is debating this, 
and while the American Congress is de-bating this, the leaders of Iran proudly stand, beat their chests, and say: We promise you that Israel will not exist in 25 years. 
I don’t believe much of what they 
say, but what I do believe is, because of the way they have acted, because of their history, that they will do every-thing they possibly can to make that promise come true. 
This is whom we are dealing with. 
They are going to try to eliminate our closest ally in the world over the next 25 years. This is whom we are dealing with. And we are willing to get in bed with these people and throw Israel under the bus? It is fantastic. It just does not make sense, but that is whom we are dealing with. They are prom-ising, while all this is going on, that they will see that Israel does not exist in 25 years. 
Well, it has been all over the media 
that the people who were supporting this are looking for a legacy. I promise you that the people who support this are going to get a legacy, but it is not going to be the legacy they want. When this thing goes south, the media and every American is going to be looking for the people who did this, who sup-ported it, and who ratified it through this Congress. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. 
G
ARDNER ). The Senator from Con-
necticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I am 
back to the floor a second time to speak very briefly in favor of the nu-clear agreement with Iran. I don’t clearly understand why we are here again. 
When I was sworn into the House, I 
remember that one of the things people told me was a phrase that said that politics stops at the water’s edge. The idea was we reserve our deep political, partisan disagreements for domestic issues, and we don’t hesitate to dis-agree—often vociferously—with each other on issues of national security that regard our relations with other countries, but we do that based on pol-icy grounds. We don’t do that in order to try to score political advantage with one another, because when you are playing pure politics with inter-national relations, you are really play-ing with the security of this country. 
There is absolutely no reason to have 
this vote today other than a desire on behalf of the majority party in the Senate to try to gain some perceived political advantage over the minority party or over the President. 
We know exactly what is going to 
happen. There aren’t the votes for this resolution of disapproval to proceed past the Senate. There weren’t the votes last week. There will not be the votes this week. We know this agree-ment is going to go into effect and we, frankly, have a lot of work to do. We have a lot of work to do to keep the government open and operating. We have a lot of work to do to implement 
this agreement. I will mention in a few moments that we have a lot more work to do in the Middle East to try to se-cure those who are running from terror and violence. 
This is a waste of our time tonight. 
This is just about politics. This is just about trying to gain political advan-tage over an issue that is fundamental to the security of this country and to our allies. 
I continue to support this agreement 
for a very simple reason. I just think it is the best way, taking a look at the options in front of us, to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. I know there are others who are hopeful—by the moderates achieving a victory within Iran’s political power structure—that there will be a willingness to try to come to the table and figure out some other very meddlesome issues in the re-gion, but that is not why I support this. 
I support this because I believe we 
have negotiated an agreement that is going to make it much less likely for Iran to get a nuclear weapon than if we were to reject the agreement. We are dramatically reducing the number of centrifuges; the quality of the enriched material will be greatly reduced from 20 percent down to 3 percent; we essen-tially eliminate their stockpiles, re-ducing their stockpile materials by about 97 percent; we get intrusive, un-precedented inspections on the entirety of the supply chain, so if they try to cheat—and they may try to cheat—we will have a much better chance of catching it with inspectors on the ground than if we rejected this agree-ment and had no inspectors on the ground. 
Then, importantly—and I think espe-
cially for many of my more hawkish Republican friends—we preserve the military option and make it much more effective and credible under this agreement. It is much more effective because we are going to have eyes on the program and on the supply chain so that if we did catch Iran cheating with those inspections, we would have more information than we would if we didn’t have any inspectors on the ground. It is more credible because we will do it in the context of an international agree-ment, meaning that if we do have to strike militarily, we will have our partners, our international partners, by our side—which we frankly would not have if they all asked us to sign this agreement to try to put us on a diplomatic path to divorce Iran from a nuclear weapon—we alone refused and then asked them for help in a military endeavor, they wouldn’t go with us and, thus, we would be on our own. We have just the last 10 years to see what unilateral, U.S. military action in the Middle East looks like. We are better off when we have partners. 
But this has always been a choice be-
tween one set of consequences flowing from the adoption of the agreement versus a set of consequences flowing

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6639 September 15, 2015 
from the rejection of the agreement. I 
have heard very little realistic talk from the opponents of this deal about what their conception of a realistic al-ternative would be because most seri-ous foreign policy thinkers are of one mind when it comes to what will hap-pen if Congress were to reject this deal—and we are not going to. We knew that last week. 
But what we know is that Iran’s nu-
clear program would start back up. I don’t think they would rush to a bomb—very few people do—but they would start their nuclear program back up, have more centrifuges spinning, and more stockpiled material piling up. 
The inspectors would get kicked out. 
I don’t think there is any way they would allow for inspectors to remain in the country if it wasn’t in the context of a deal. The sanctions would probably fray at first because the Russians and Chinese would not walk away, but they would—over time—fall apart. The mili-tary option, as I mentioned, would get harder because we wouldn’t have as much knowledge of their program, and we would have to go it alone with Israel, potentially, but probably not with our international partners who would feel badly burned by this rejec-tion. 
Finally, U.S. credibility as an honest, 
diplomatic, negotiating partner would be greatly damaged if—with the unani-mous support of the Security Council, the unanimous support of the P5+1— the Senate and Congress decided to walk away from this deal. 
This idea that there is a magical, 
better deal on the table is just fiction, plain and simple. There is no way to go back to the negotiating table if Con-gress were to reject this deal. The Ira-nians will not come back to the negoti-ating table. Our P5+1 partners have told us to our face that they will not come back to the table. So you are left, at that point, with an isolated Iran with a nuclear program restarting, with sanctions fraying, and with U.S. credibility damaged. I have no idea how that makes this country or that makes our allies in the Middle East any safer. 
I have listened to all of the argu-
ments against it, and I listened to Sen-ator R
ISCH—who is a good friend—just 
make his secret agreement argument again. But it is amazing to me, having had so much attention over this AP ar-ticle a few weeks ago on this supposed secret agreement between the IAEA and Iran, that there has been not even a whisper from opponents about the ar-ticle this week correcting the AP story talking about how, in fact, the IAEA— according to this report—is going to have direct access to Parchin and is going to be able to take samples under the agreement they have with Iran. 
There is a lot of talk about the first 
article, but the second article that cor-rects the record, nary a whisper from folks who oppose this deal. The reality is that this secret agreement you talk about, this agreement between the 
IAEA and Iran as to how they inspect Iran’s nuclear program is nothing new because the IAEA has this with every single country they inspect. It is the foundation of the IAEA’s inspection re-gime, the idea that they could only have credibility—they can only have credibility if they don’t disclose the se-crets of the countries that participate in the program. The IAEA could not function if it weren’t for these agree-ments. 
Now, we all sat in a room and were 
briefed on this agreement, so there is not a single Senator who cannot say they don’t know what is in this agree-ment. There is not a single Senator who could say the AP story was cor-rect. There is not a single Senator, if they were sitting in those briefings, who can say they were surprised by what we heard this week. The argu-ment, especially after reporting that we have seen this week, just doesn’t wash any longer. 
But as I said at the outset, the im-
perative to move beyond this argument is not just because we shouldn’t be playing politics with an issue of this import but also because we have to come together on other issues that are vital to the stability of the region. 
SYRIAN REFUGEE CRISIS  
Mr. President, I just came back from 
a Syrian refugee camp with Senator P
ETERS : 80,000 people living in this 
camp with 250 of them getting on a bus every day and going back to Syria. Why? Because they have been sitting in this camp in abysmal, unconscionable conditions, for 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and they have no hope, no hope of ever getting out. So they are going back to Syria. They are taking their kids and almost accepting the potential for death because the conditions in these camps gets worse and worse and their hope just atrophies away. Those who aren’t just going back to live in Syria, as we know, are pouring into Europe by the tens of thousands. 
When we were in the region, our part-
ners in the Middle East told us two things. Our Arab partners in the Mid-dle East said: Get this agreement done. It is vital to the security of the region. To a person, every single individual we met with in Qatar, in UAE, in Iraq, and Jordan said: Get this deal done. 
Second, they said: Step up to the 
plate and do more when it comes to solving this humanitarian disaster. Take refugees—like we are—in Jordan, Iraq, and Turkey. Make sure that the World Food Programme doesn’t run out of money, as it is about to. Think about that, 1 million refugees in Jor-dan are about to lose their food bene-fits because the United States and some of our partners refuse to put up money to continue to operate the pro-gram. And guess what. When they do not get funding from the World Food Programme, they go to see who else is offering them sustenance, and often it is the extremist groups we are trying to fight. When you stop funding the World Food Programme, you push 
thousands of individuals into the very arms of the groups we are attempting to take out, degrade, and destroy in the region. It is unconscionable that we are not feeding people in the Middle East who have fled violence, but it is terrible national security strategy to push them into the arms of the extrem-ists. 
What we should be debating today is 
an emergency appropriations bill to allow for refugees to come to this coun-try, as has been in the best traditions of America, and to fund humanitarian assistance so that people don’t starve and die or get pushed back into Syria to be killed by Assad and others. But instead we are having another vote— another vote—on the Iran nuclear agreement when we know the outcome is predestined. 
We have some really important stuff 
to talk about here, and we need to move on from this debate so we can start to build on the credibility we have already grown by virtue of negoti-ating this agreement in the region. 
Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield 
for a question? 
Mr. MURPHY. I would be happy to 
yield. 
Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the 
Senator from Connecticut a question through the Chair. 
First, let me thank the Senator for 
raising this issue. I have said—and I think my colleague may share the feel-ing—that this may be the greatest hu-manitarian crisis of our time, and other generations will ask us: What did you do in the midst of the Syrian hu-manitarian crisis? 
I met with four Syrian families in 
Chicago who are now refugees. They made it, and they have these horrible stories of what they went through. But when we look back at the past and what we have done in America for Cuban refugees, and I believe at least one of our colleagues here was a Cuban refugee—his family was when they came to this country; refugees from the Soviet Union, Jewish people suf-fering from persecution and wanting to escape; refugees from Somalia; the Hmong people from Vietnam; and Bosnians who made it to the United States, it seems to me that in the sweep of modern history—since World War II, I would add quickly—that we have really established ourselves as caring for refugees, not only feeding them but accepting them, after careful vetting, in the United States. 
So I ask the Senator from Con-
necticut, when we hear what is hap-pening in Europe, is he struck by the fact there are some countries opening their arms in extraordinary ways and others, sadly, going in the opposite di-rection with these refugees? I am sure the Senator has been struck by that as well. 
Mr. MURPHY. I say to Senator D
UR-
BIN, I come from Connecticut, one of 
the Thirteen Original Colonies. We are 
proud of our role as part of the founda-tion, the fabric of America, and our

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6640 September 15, 2015 
State’s motto is ‘‘He who transplants 
sustains.’’ This Nation’s existence is predicated on people coming here flee-ing persecution, sometimes violence, and finding a home. It represents the best of America’s traditions. Some 190,000 Vietnamese came here, and 180,000 from the Balkan countries came here just a decade ago. 
The Senator is right—this isn’t easy 
because we have to go through a sub-stantial vetting process to make sure we are not bringing anyone here who even sniffs of potential violence or con-nection to terrorist groups. I was sit-ting in those Syrian refugee camps 2 weeks ago, and I was looking at 8-year- old kids digging ditches through the sand so the feces running out of their house has a place to go. Those little kids aren’t terrorists. 
We can figure this out. We are going 
to need some additional resources to do it. I thank the Senator for taking such a lead in the caucus, and I am hopeful we will be able to move on to that de-bate in the Foreign Relations Com-mittee and in the Appropriations Com-mittee after today. 
I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I notice 
a discussion taking place. I wish to speak for approximately 10 minutes prior to the vote, assuming that is ac-ceptable to the minority. 
Mr. DURBIN. I would advise the Sen-
ator from Tennessee that all time re-maining is on our side of the aisle, but I would yield half of it—5 of the next 10 minutes—to him. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mr. CORKER. I thank the Senator 
very much. I will be very brief. I made these points earlier today, but I would just like to remind people as to why we are having this vote this evening. 
Almost unanimously, on four dif-
ferent occasions since 2010, Congress passed sanctions. Both sides of the aisle strongly supported sanctions being imposed upon Iran to bring them to the negotiating table. That was something which was very strongly bi-partisan. 
When it came time to bring them to 
the table and begin negotiations, the President declared the goal was to end their nuclear program, and they began negotiations. And by the way, we cele-brated that goal. I think there would be unanimous support for the agree-ment had that goal been achieved. But the President then declared that in-stead of bringing this as a treaty, which typically would be the case for an international agreement, or bring-ing it as a congressional-executive agreement, he was going to call this an executive agreement so that only he would be involved in it. 
That being known to this body, again 
in a very strong, bipartisan way—98 to 1—we voted for the first time since I have been here to take power away from the President and to keep him from invoking the national security 
waivers he had with the sanctions and to say: No, we want 60 days to go through this deal and we want the right to approve or disapprove and to vote our conscience. 
Let me say one more time that had 
the President achieved his goal, we would have unanimous support here supporting the deal itself. We would all be supportive of ending their program. But the administration squandered that opportunity and instead has agreed to the industrialization of their program, their development of inter-continental ballistic missiles, their de-velopment of even faster centrifuges to ensure they are a nuclear threshold state. 
What the public may not understand 
is taking place here now—we have had a debate. We had 12 hearings in the Foreign Relations Committee. We have had all kinds of Senators debating. As a matter of fact, Senators know more about the Iran deal than probably any international agreement in modern history. It has been studied and de-bated. 
So the minority, 42 Senators—I 
might say a partisan minority because they are all Democrats—a bipartisan 58 Senators—the 2 Senators who know more about foreign policy issues than any other Senators on the Democratic side oppose this deal. And now, in keep-ing with the Iran review act, the ma-jority, a bipartisan majority, is wish-ing to have the opportunity to vote on the substance of the deal. 
What is happening is my friend the 
minority leader, who is here, began saying in August that he wanted to fil-ibuster this, and my understanding is the administration has supported that. So what we have now is a partisan mi-nority of people who are keeping the spirit of the Iran review act from com-ing into play by blocking our ability to actually vote up or down. That is what is happening. I want to make sure the American people understand that. I know Members of this body understand that. 
I want to close with this. Our major-
ity leader, on every occasion where there has been an opportunity for this to devolve into something that was partisan and there was concern on the other side of the aisle about certain things that were occurring, at every point, the majority leader has acqui-esced and agreed for things to progress in a way that the minority would feel that this was not a partisan effort. 
I wish to also point out that the ma-
jority leader, when we brought this res-olution of disapproval to the floor, filled the tree. He filled the tree. My friends on the other side of the aisle did not want a bunch of amendments; they wanted only to vote on a resolu-tion of approval or disapproval. In this case, since there is a bipartisan major-ity in support of disapproval, that is what we are hoping to vote on. But, un-fortunately, what is happening again, it appears tonight based on the spirit, although I hope something changes— 
just last week, 42 Senators blocked the ability of the Senate to end debate and actually vote on the substance of the deal. I hope that changes. I hope to-night at least two Senators on the other side of the aisle will give us the ability to express ourselves on the sub-stance of the deal and not block a bi-partisan majority of Members who want to express themselves through a vote of disapproval. 
I yield the floor, and I thank the Sen-
ator for the time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Sen-
ator from Tennessee is my friend. I re-spect him. I have said so on the floor and have said so privately among my colleagues. For the record, I want to make it clear, though, that Senator R
EIDand the Democrats said there will 
be no cloture necessary on the motion to proceed, no motion to proceed vote necessary last week on the floor to go to this measure. We had an oppor-tunity to obstruct, to block, whatever you want to say, and we did not do it because we believed that what we had heard repeatedly—that this would be a 60-vote final passage—would ulti-mately be the standard. There is noth-ing in the statute that brings us to this measure that in any way eliminates the 60-vote requirement. It is just not there. There is nothing that does that. 
When my colleague’s side discovered 
they did not have 60 votes, which was the beginning of last week, they changed the standard and said: We want a majority vote, and anything less than that is a filibuster. So that was a Republican decision based on the fact that now 42 Democratic Senators see this issue differently. 
I would just say this: We have had 8 
weeks on this issue, and we should have taken 8 weeks on this issue. It is that important. And every Senator should stand up and say where they stand on this issue, and every Senator has stood up and announced where they stand on this issue. This has not been glossed over. We have not made light of it. People aren’t trying to find some sneaky way to avoid responsibility. Each person is on the record. You know where I stand, I know where you stand, and that goes for every one of our col-leagues. 
So what are we doing tonight? Why 
are we going through a replay of what we did last week, and now with the threat of amendments? Now we are going to have a run of amendments. They won’t be on the Iran agreement per se, on the adoption of the agree-ment, which was the underlying stat-ute. They could be on something else. We are just discovering what they could be. 
To say we haven’t taken the time 
and dealt with this in a bipartisan way, dealt with it in a serious way, allowed open debate—we have done it, and we have cooperated in doing it. My col-league doesn’t like the result. I happen

to believe it is a result that really re-
flects where we should be as a nation. 
I support the President. I believe we 
ought to have two goals here: Stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and stop America from going to another war in the Middle East. That is what I want achieved, and I think we can achieve it through this agreement. But it is subject to inspection, it is subject to reports, and if the Iranians decide they want to breach this agreement, then we start back on the sanctions. We are back where we started from. 
I would say to the Senator from Ten-
nessee, having, as he has, faced these conscience votes on the floor about war and about the deaths associated with them, I conclude: First try diplomacy. If diplomacy does not work, then you have to pursue whatever is necessary for national security. But I believe we have said—42 out of 46 Democratic Sen-ators—we support diplomacy first. 
To argue that this is somehow par-
tisan because four Senators see it dif-ferently—I think there may be some partisanship in the fact that not a sin-gle Republican Member of the House or Senate supports the President’s posi-tion—not one. I think there may be some partisanship in the fact that 47 Republican Senators, on March 9, 2015, sent a letter to the Ayatollah in Iran and said, basically, stop negotiating with the United States of America. There is no point in it. That has never ever, ever happened in diplomatic his-tory—that 47 Republican Senators would prejudge a matter under negotia-tion with the President of the United States. But they did. So the fact that all 47 voted against this agreement is no surprise. They announced in March they were against the agreement no matter what it said. I think that is the reality of what we face today. 
I don’t know why we are going to 
keep repeating these votes over and over. There are a lot of things we should take up. We have nine legisla-tive days left until this fiscal year ends and we end up closing down the govern-ment. I think it is time for us to move on to important issues that should command the attention of the Senate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
am going to proceed under my leader time. 
I want to start by congratulating the 
chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee for an incredible job in giv-ing the Senate an opportunity to actu-ally express itself on what the Presi-dent has described as an executive agreement. 
It is an executive agreement. I think 
it is important for everybody to under-stand that the next President of the United States is going to take a new look at this because it doesn’t have the force of law of a treaty. But the Presi-dent didn’t want us to have anything to do with it at all. And the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator C
ORKER , skillfully negotiated with the other side to give us an oppor-
tunity, as elected representatives of the American people, to actually ex-press our views on his unilateral action with the Iranian Government. We pro-ceeded, as the Senator from Tennessee pointed out, in a manner that re-spected the process and gave the Sen-ate an opportunity to vote on that deal only, even though technically it was open for amendment. Yet we have been denied the opportunity to get an up-or- down vote on the agreement on which the Corker-Cardin bill gave us an op-portunity to express ourselves. 
So I congratulate the Senator from 
Tennessee. It has been an extraor-dinary legislative performance. The Senator from Tennessee, as we all know, is someone who admires and re-spects and is willing to talk to the other side, and frequently good things come about as a result of it. But we are where we are. 
This evening, Senate Democrats will 
have one more opportunity to do the right thing and end their blockade of a vote on the President’s deal with Iran. We know that a strong, bipartisan ma-jority of the Senate would vote to re-ject it. But Democratic leaders are de-termined to do anything they can to prevent that vote from happening be-cause Democrats know the deal is inde-fensible—indefensible—on the merits. 
The President’s Iran deal would allow 
the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism to retain thousands of cen-trifuges, to enrich uranium, to conduct their research and development pro-grams for advanced centrifuges, and to reap a multibillion-dollar cash windfall which would help it fund terrorist groups like Hezbollah. 
Here is what the Iranian Defense 
Minister said just last week: 
I officially declare that under no cir-
cumstances will we refrain from providing material and moral support to Hezbollah, or to any other group of the resistance to the U.S. and Israel. We say this loud and clear. 
That is the Iranian Defense Minister. 
The assault on Israel and the assault 
on the United States continues unabated. In other words, President Obama’s Iran deal would likely en-trench Iran’s nuclear capabilities, es-sentially help subsidize terrorism, and threaten Israel—for what? For what? It is not as if the Iranian regime is about to change its behavior. The Supreme Leader crows that change ‘‘will never happen’’ as he rails against the Great Satan—that is us—and promises Israel’s demise. The scary thing about this is that he is serious. He really means it. The scarier thing is that the President’s deal could empower his re-gime. 
This is a gravely serious matter. The 
American people deserve to know where their respective Senators stand on the President’s deal. 
Democrats seem to think they can 
end the discussion by blocking an up- or-down vote, then turn around and pretend they care deeply about Israel and human rights. Well, if they vote again to deny the American people a 
final vote, they will have a chance to test the theory. 
I will file an amendment that would 
prevent the President from lifting sanctions until Iran meets two simple benchmarks: It must formally recog-nize Israel’s right to exist, and it must release the American citizens being held in Iranian custody. 
Let me say that again. If cloture is 
not invoked, I will file an amendment that would prevent the President from lifting sanctions until Iran meets two simple benchmarks: It must formally recognize Israel’s right to exist, and it must release American citizens being held in Iranian custody. 
The President has so far resisted 
linking his deal—a deal that fails to end Iran’s enrichment program, while leaving it as an American-recognized nuclear threshold state—to other as-pects of Iran’s conduct, but linkage is appropriate, and in this negotiation it would have been wise to have linkage. 
Indeed, Senators say they understand 
the importance of standing up for an ally such as Israel in a dangerous re-gion, and the Senate voted unani-mously just a few months ago in call-ing for Iranian leaders to release these Americans. 
Here is what one American prisoner— 
this is an American prisoner in Iran, one of ours—wrote earlier this year: 
As a fellow American and combat veteran, 
I am writing to bring to your attention my situation and that of a long list of my fellow Americans. For nearly three and a half years, I have been falsely imprisoned and treated inhumanely. . . . While I am thank-ful that the State Department and the Obama administration has called for my re-lease and that of my fellow Americans, there has been no serious response to this blatant and ongoing mistreatment. . . . 
My strong preference is for our 
Democratic friends to simply allow an up-or-down vote on the President’s Iran deal. I don’t know what they are protecting him from. He is proud of this deal. As I suggested last week, he could have a ceremony down there while he vetoed the resolution of dis-approval. He has convinced them to protect him from what he is bragging about. But if they are determined to make that impossible, then at the very least we should be able to provide some protection to Israel and long-overdue relief to Americans who have lan-guished in Iranian custody for years. 
So let me just say this. Either way, 
this debate will continue. This is an issue with a very, very long shelf life. It will be before the American people for the next year and a half and will certainly be a factor in their deter-mination of whom they want to lead our country as President in the next election. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Democratic leader. 
Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is hard 
for me to comprehend how my Repub-lican colleagues with a straight face can talk about ‘‘Let’s have an up-or- down vote on this.’’ We agreed to allow

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6642 September 15, 2015 
Republicans to have an up-or-down 
vote. I asked consent on this floor on two separate occasions, and I make the same request now. We are willing to have a 60-vote threshold. That is an agreement we made, and we are happy to do it. But for my friends now to say ‘‘We want an up-or-down vote,’’ up-or- down votes on the magical number of 60 is what they created. We didn’t draft this legislation. It was brought through committee to this floor. They thought they had—they, the Repub-licans, thought everything was fine until they realized they didn’t have enough votes and suddenly they changed direction dramatically. Fifty votes wasn’t good enough for trying to raise the minimum wage. Certainly a simple majority wasn’t enough to do anything about the overwhelming debt that faces the American people. It is not credit cards, it is student debt. No, we couldn’t debate that; we had to have 60 votes. Equal pay for men and 
women? No, we are not going to allow that to happen; what we want is to have 60 votes. That is the reason we had to file cloture more than 600 times, because the rule had been established by my Republican friend, the Repub-lican leader, during the entire Obama administration that that is the rule. 
Here is what he said—and I have read 
on this floor all the multitude of state-ments he has given saying it would be 60 votes: We are not interesting in using floor time for get-well efforts. We only have so much time on the Senate floor. If this isn’t a get-well issue, I don’t know what would be. We had de-bate that took place over a long period of time with this issue. It was debated during the August recess, it was de-bated all last week on the floor, and the decision was made that the meas-ures brought before this body did not get enough votes. It didn’t get 60 votes. That is the threshold. We have agreed to have that vote, and suddenly the rules are suddenly attempting to be changed here, and they are not going to be changed. 
It is a situation where I wonder if the 
Republican leader has bothered to look at the calendar. We have 8 days now until we are at the end of the fiscal year—8 days. We have 32 Republicans who have written to the Speaker say-ing: We are not going to allow a bill to pass unless we get rid of Planned Par-enthood—health care for women. We have had statements of people running for President over here who are saying there will be nothing done on paying the government’s bills unless we do something about Planned Parenthood. Other people have made statements that they want riders dealing with EPA and on and on. 
Now, it would be different—maybe we 
wouldn’t be as concerned, except you did it once. You did it once. They closed the government for almost 3 weeks. Two years ago, the government was actually shut down for almost 3 weeks. 
We have staring us in the face the 
debt ceiling, which is going to be upon us quickly. But, no, we are told that 
what we are going to deal with next after this: We are going to do some-thing that everyone knows has no chance of passing, and that is some-thing dealing with abortion. I guess they want to do that before the Pope gets here. But it is not going to change the Pope, how he feels about the fact that Republicans have ignored poor people in America. It is not going to change the Pope, how he feels about what is happening to our great world that we live in, that we know, dealing with climate change. Republicans have denied that climate change exists. So they can have a fake vote on abortion. It is not going to change how Pope Francis feels about what is happening, and it is all being directed towards the Republicans, and he doesn’t need—ev-eryone knows what the problems are. 
So we can be threatened all we need 
to be threatened. The Republican lead-er has threatened us: We lost, and we are going to make you suffer. Just like we lost ObamaCare. 
We had over 600 votes to get rid of 
that. We may have more than that to get rid of this agreement. 
They have magnified this agreement. 
They have this agreement—oh, it is doing all kinds of things. The purpose of this agreement, everyone knows, is to stop Iran from having a nuclear weapon, and that is what it does. That is the sole purpose of this agreement. And it is an agreement that is so im-portant. It is so important that we got Russia, we got China, and the others, our allies—Germany, France—to sign off on this, and Great Britain. To think, after all the years of negotiating this through all of our friends and al-lies, including the good work that has been done in this regarding Russia and China, to think that suddenly it is going to be back the way it was. Every one of these countries said: If you don’t move forward on this agreement, we are through. Sanctions are gone. 
So this is not an intelligent debate 
because my friend the Republican lead-er is trying to change the rules he de-veloped. He created these rules. He cre-ated the 60-vote threshold. We tried to change that hundreds of times, but no. 
Let’s also remind everybody that we 
did not filibuster this bill. We let the Republicans go to this bill. We let them go to the bill. We let them go to the bill. There was no motion to pro-ceed. And people watching may say: What is that? Well, what the Repub-licans did time and time again, even on measures they wanted passed, they would make us file a motion to proceed and have cloture on that. That ate up a week’s period of time. In their mind, that was really tasty because it was good, because it stopped Obama from moving his program ahead. Anything to stall for time. Well, the 60-vote threshold was created by the Repub-licans. That is the rule of this body, and we are sticking by the rules of this body. It was created by the Repub-licans. So we can be—I repeat—threatened 
all my friend the Republican leader wants to threaten us. Whatever he wants to do, he has a right do that. We are not going to be stalling for time. If he wants to tear down a tree—remem-ber the tree? Remember, Reid was the bad guy; he filled the tree. I can’t num-ber the times my friend the Republican leader has filled the tree—something he said would never happen. He said bills wouldn’t come to this body unless there were hearings and they were re-ported out of committee. Of course, that is not true. Being majority leader is not as easy as giving speeches. 
What is going on tonight is a charade 
by the Republicans to try to change the rules in the middle of the game. The Republicans have lost. They have lost this measure. We should move on to something else. It should be the budget. It shouldn’t be abortion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I do 
want to clarify, the bill specifically states regular order. It is not the rule of the Senate that final votes are on 60 votes. They are on a majority vote. I don’t want anybody in the Senate or certainly the public to think that somehow we have a rule that bills pass on 60 votes. That is not the case. That has been a tradition on major issues, but that is not the rule. The bill spe-cifically states we will settle under regular order, which means when clo-ture is invoked—which hopefully will happen tonight—we will have a simple majority vote, up or down. 
Mr. REID. Could I ask my friend a 
question? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would 
the Senator yield for a question? 
Mr. CORKER. If it is brief. I know 
people have a meeting to go to. 
Mr. REID. Do you think this Iran 
issue is a major issue? 
Mr. CORKER. It is a major issue. Mr. REID. You answered your own 
question. 
Mr. CORKER. I am hoping we are 
going to be able to vote our conscience on this major issue by getting cloture invoked. 
I ask unanimous consent to waive 
the mandatory quorum call with re-spect to the cloture motions on amend-ment No. 2640 and H.J. Res. 61. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered.

RECOGNIZING VERMONT’S 
SEVENTH GENERATION 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to 
call the Senate’s attention today to yet another outstanding Vermont busi-ness: Seventh Generation. Seventh Generation unveiled its line of environ-mentally friendly consumer household products more than 25 years ago. Today it has expanded to become one of the dominant businesses in this con-tinuously emerging market. 
I have visited Seventh Generation 
many times, and I am consistently im-pressed with how the company con-tinues to find new ways of expanding its business and offering Americans af-fordable and more sustainable alter-natives to standard household prod-ucts.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6645 September 15, 2015 
Since 2011, Seventh Generation has 
seen its business grow year after year and has unveiled some 100 new products in the last 4 years alone. President and CEO John Replogle has reinvigorated the company, further defining its pur-pose and leadership in the competitive marketplace. 
Seventh Generation has long been a 
company that fosters the business prin-ciples and ideals that so many Vermonters value: to make products locally, to keep it sustainable, to leave no footprint, and make products acces-sible. From its Burlington offices that overlook the shores of Lake Champlain to the shelves of the retail giants now promoting its products, Seventh Gen-eration is yet another Vermont com-pany leading the way in corporate re-sponsibility. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
August 27, 2015, article from the Bur-lington Free Press entitled ‘‘Seventh Generation: ‘Bursting at the seams’’’ be printed in the R
ECORD . 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows: 
[From the Burlington Free Press, Aug. 27, 
2015] 
SEVENTH GENERATION : ‘BURSTING AT THE  
SEAMS ’ 
(By Dan D’Ambrosio) 
Seventh Generation in Burlington has been 
on a tear since John Replogle took over as president and CEO in 2011. Sales are up more than 60 percent, from about $150 million when Replogle arrived to about $250 million projected for this year. Annual growth is in the ‘‘low double digits,’’ says Replogle. 
That’s a lot of toilet tissue made from re-
cycled paper and natural, cold-water laundry detergent, not to mention the dozens of other products in Seventh Generation’s ex-panded line of ‘‘green’’ disinfectants, dish-washing and hand soaps, surface cleaners, diapers and baby wipes and feminine hygiene products. Seventh Generation has added 
about 100 new products under Replogle. 
The company today dominates the market 
for natural cleaning products, according to Replogle, who says the other leaders in the industry are Method and Mrs. Meyers Clean Day. 
‘‘Adding our sales together we have a half- 
billion dollar business,’’ said Replogle. ‘‘I would love to see the three brands grow to a billion dollars over the next few years.’’ 
In typical Reploglian fashion, Replogle de-
clines to criticize his two closest competi-tors in any way, going so far as to refer to them as ‘‘frenemies.’’ And he points out that the three brands together have less than a 5 percent share in any category they sell in, leaving a long way to go before they begin to threaten the Procter & Gambles of the world. 
‘‘What they’re trying to do is very much in 
the spirit of what we’re trying to do,’’ Replogle said. ‘‘Use fewer ingredients, be less toxic, be more sustainable in manufacturing and packaging. So there’s a lot of com-monality among our brands.’’ 
‘
A REALLY SMART DUDE ’ 
Replogle, 49, is the former president of 
Guinness in the United States and United Kingdom. From there he went to Unilever, where he ran the North American skin care business, with brands including Dove, Ponds, Caress and Lever 2000. Next, in 2006, Replogle took the helm at Burt’s Bees, bringing the quirky natural skin care company to the masses. ‘‘We launched at Target, CVS and 
Walgreen’s,’’ Replogle said. ‘‘We built a na-tional brand. I put great people on the team, and gave them a lot of freedom. We set up core values and principles to run the com-pany and we invested behind it, and it took off.’’ 
Which is a pretty good description of what 
Replogle has done at Seventh Generation. Alan Newman, founder of Magic Hat Brewing Co., launched the original Seventh Genera-tion catalog business more than 25 years ago. Newman has been watching Replogle from his latest perch in the Maltex Building on Pine Street, where Newman is running a new craft beer company for The Boston Beer Co., a.k.a. Samuel Adams. Newman likes what he sees on the waterfront, where Seventh Gen-eration is headquartered at Main Street Landing. 
‘‘John’s a really smart dude who knows 
how to bring focus to an organization, who knows how to re-enthuse the mission,’’ New-man said. ‘‘From what I can tell from the outside, he’s a really good delegator and manager.’’ 
In Newman’s estimation, Seventh Genera-
tion had largely lost sight of its mission four years ago when Replogle took over. 
‘‘I did not pay a lot of attention to Seventh 
Generation, but whenever I did they were scattered all over the place,’’ Newman said. ‘‘They didn’t seem to have any mission left.’’ 
Sales were also flat, Replogle said. ‘‘I just knew this company stood for some-
thing greater and that it needed leadership,’’ Replogle said. ‘‘The company was at a cross-roads. We were very nearly at the end of our rope frankly.’’ 
Replogle began drawing that rope in by 
putting a laser focus on what Seventh Gen-eration stands for—natural, sustainable, en-vironmentally sensitive cleaning products, the only segment of the retail category showing significant growth. 
‘‘We’re really in tune with the consumer 
today,’’ Replogle said. ‘‘The millennial con-sumer in particular, people trying to avoid chemicals, who are more conscious about not only what’s in their product but also the practices of the company itself. More and more young consumers are understanding the company behind their product matters. We’re winning with those consumers.’’ 
A PIONEER BRAND  
As an example of a best manufacturing 
practice at Seventh Generation, Replogle points to the fact that the company con-tracts all of its manufacturing to about 22 factories across the nation. ‘‘You will always have the most sustainable footprint on a dis-persed model,’’ Replogle said. ‘‘If we can manufacture closer to the market, we’ll do a lot better. A lot of companies have one large- scale manufacturing site. Then you have to ship everything in and ship the products out.’’ Second, Replogle said, Seventh Genera-tion continues to innovate. 
‘‘We’ve upgraded every product in our port-
folio in the last four years,’’ he said. ‘‘Every product has been improved in some material way. We never stop and we’re innovating into new spaces. Plus, we’ve taken our brand from a few categories into several cat-egories. We’re not only in dish soap and laundry detergent, we’re in hand wash, dia-pers and wipes and feminine care. We’ve gone across all the categories.’’ 
Target has taken notice. Spokeswoman 
Erica Julkowski said Seventh Generation is one of a ‘‘handful of vendors’’ the giant re-tailer works with closely to ‘‘ideate and de-velop products.’’ ‘‘Seventh Generation is a pioneer brand in natural cleaning and has been a valued partner to Target by providing ongoing innovation and thought leadership,’’ Julkowski said in an email. ‘‘Through Sev-enth Generation’s deep understanding of the 
naturals cleaning industry, they continue to provide expert knowledge on the market and insight into up-and-coming products that might resonate with the Target guest.’’ 
In Seventh Generation’s soothing offices 
overlooking Lake Champlain—all earth tones and wood paneling with an open center staircase festooned with greenery and the company’s principles emblazoned on dan-gling wooden signs—John Fitzgerald is work-ing on a shelf layout for Target. The prod-ucts are dish soaps and detergents. 
In the computer generated ‘‘plan-o-gram’’ 
on his big screen, Fitzgerald proposes a dis-play layout of not only Seventh Generation’s products, but also of Method’s and Mrs. Mey-er’s offerings, as well as giants like Cascade and Finish. Finally, Fitzgerald proposes shelf positions for Target’s own house brands, all based on data collected by a third party. 
‘‘Our goal is to be objective, to share the 
facts and give them a recommendation,’’ Replogle said. ‘‘Our goal isn’t to convince them our way is the right way.’’ 
Nevertheless, working so closely with Tar-
get is a pretty good relationship builder, Replogle adds. 
BORN HERE , STAYING HERE  
Seventh Generation is bursting at the 
seams at Main Street Landing, with most of its approximately 140 employees working in Burlington. Replogle plans on adding an-other 15 employees to the staff by the end of the year. 
‘‘We have maximized our space in here,’’ he 
said. ‘‘Growth is a wonderful thing, but right now we’re fully utilized in this building.’’ 
That doesn’t mean, however, that Seventh 
Generation is going anywhere. 
‘‘Burlington is our long-term home,’’ 
Replogle said. ‘‘We were born here, we’re growing up here and will will remain here. No question. We’re committed to that.’’ 
Seventh Generation has a small office in 
Toronto, and a satellite office in Raleigh, North Carolina, where Replogle lived as CEO of Burt’s Bees, and where his family still lives. 
When he was recruited to run Seventh Gen-
eration, Replogle and his wife decided against uprooting their four children, so he has been commuting, returning to his home in Raleigh every other week. 
A native of Boston and a graduate of Dart-
mouth and Harvard, Replogle feels he has the best of both worlds, maintaining his life in Raleigh and returning to New England for more than a visit. Replogle said it’s going to feel even better when his daughter starts at Dartmouth as a freshman this fall. 
‘‘She’ll be right down the road as well,’’ he 
said. 
Replogle expects to open an office in Cali-
fornia soon, and earlier this year he launched the business in China with an office in Hangzhou. 
‘‘There’s demand for our products over 
there,’’ Replogle said. ‘‘We’re in Japan, Hong Kong, of course mainland China. We’re in Korea, Vietnam, Australia. That’s been growing over the last five years.’’ 
Replogle said Seventh Generation will also 
be in Europe within three years. 
‘‘How we get there we’re still working on 
right now,’’ he said. ‘‘Whether it’s a direct model where we create Seventh Generation Europe or whether we partner into that mar-ket we haven’t determined yet.’’ 
THE LATEST VENTURE  
Seventh Generation’s office in Raleigh is 
home to the company’s venture arm, with nine employees who look for new business opportunities beyond natural cleaning prod-ucts. 
‘‘We created Seventh Generation Ventures 
about three years ago with the idea of

partnering with like-minded companies and 
helping them accelerate their growth,’’ Replogle said. 
The acquisitions began with Bobble, a fil-
tered water bottle company Seventh Genera-tion bought in 2013. The plastic water bottle features a replaceable charcoal filter, and sells for $10, with a new filter that costs about $3. It’s marketed as a way to reduce disposable water bottle use. 
Next, Seventh Generation Ventures picked 
up Presse, a travel coffee mug with built-in French press, which is being marketed under the Bobble name. Call it a K-Cup killer. 
‘‘This is our answer to Keurig,’’ said 
Replogle, holding a stainless steel Presse in his hand. ‘‘We looked for mission-aligned companies like this that are trying to solve a problem like, end the incredible waste of single-serve water bottles or, end the incred-ible waste of K-Cups.’’ 
Seventh Generation Ventures was boosted 
considerably by a $30 million investment last September from former Vice President Al Gore’s investment fund, the London-based Generation Investment Management LLP. Seventh Generation returned to private own-ership about 15 years ago after a brief flirta-tion with being a publicly owned company. 
The company’s nine board members own 
about 70 percent of the company, Replogle said, with new shareholders periodically in-vited in, and existing shareholders offered an exit. The $30 million from Gore’s foundation was mostly used to retire existing share-holders who wanted to exit. 
‘‘There’s a long list of investors and com-
panies that would love to put their money into Seventh Generation,’’ Replogle said. ‘‘We’re pretty fortunate. We have a good thing happening right now.’’ Seventh Gen-eration is also debt-free. 
‘‘John has re-energized the business,’’ Alan 
Newman said. ‘‘He has them on clear objec-tives. He’s done the things that you do to be successful in business.’’

SAWTOOTH NATIONAL 
RECREATION AREA 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I wish to 
celebrate the enactment of the Saw-tooth National Recreation Area and Jerry Peak Wilderness Additions Act and congratulate my Idaho congres-sional delegation colleagues Represent-ative M
ICHAEL K. S IMPSON and Senator 
JAMES E. R ISCH on this important 
achievement. 
Enactment of this legislation, also 
called the SNRA Plus, was accom-plished due to significant hard work, led by Representative S
IMPSON . Rep-
resentative S IMPSON ’s determination to 
work through the many challenges that arose during the near decade of this collaborative effort has given Idaho a homegrown solution to sus-taining this treasured area of Idaho. 
Senator R
ISCH’s work in shepherding 
this legislation through the Senate, in-cluding through the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on which he serves, is also commendable. Senator R
ISCH fought through many 
challenges in his pursuit of getting this needed legislation over the finish line. 
A number of other individuals de-
serve acknowledgement for their con-siderable efforts to develop a hard- sought consensus that will be of lasting benefit. John Revier and Lindsay Slater of Representative S
IMPSON ’s staff dedicated immeasurable time and 
extensive know-how to developing the legislation to reach this milestone. Custer and Blaine County Commis-sioners also did an outstanding job in this collaborative effort. The SNRA Plus is a win for Idaho and an example of how local governments and interests can achieve solutions to some of the most persistent public lands issues we face today. 
Following the enactment of this im-
portant legislation, the focus must now shift to the hard work of successful im-plementation that will require com-mitment from the various Federal agencies and all of the affected inter-ests. Again, I commend Representative S
IMPSON , Senator R ISCH and the other 
stakeholders for their important work that will make a lasting difference in our great State.

RECOGNIZING THE 90TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF U.S. PROBATION AND PRETRIAL SERVICES 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, in 
March of 1925, President Calvin Coo-lidge signed into law the Probation Act, making that sentencing option available in the Federal courts. Six months later, on September 22, the first Federal probation officers were appointed, taking on the crucial dual task of promoting rehabilitation and protecting public safety. On this 90th anniversary, we pay our respects to the probation officers who serve the public, helping to keep our communities safe. 
The advent of probation at the Fed-
eral level was driven by the success and spread of probation by individual States. Between 1909 and 1925, some 34 bills were introduced to establish a Federal probation law. President Coo-lidge, who as Governor of Massachu-setts was familiar with probation at the State level, provided key support for the law’s final passage. 
A significant impetus for the law’s 
eventual enactment was the fact that the National Prohibition Act of 1919 made Federal criminals out of many non-violent, otherwise law-abiding Americans. Under the auspices of the U.S. Courts, Probation and Pretrial Services has been operating a Federal re-entry court since 2008, along with programs aimed at addiction recovery. 
Among those first Federal probation 
officers was George Grover, who, 20 years before the Probation Act became the first state-authorized probation of-ficer in Maine, serving Cumberland County. Mr. Grover was a vigorous ad-vocate of probation as an alternative to incarceration. Allowing a non-vio-lent offender, under rigorous super-vision, to remain at home and in the community, on the job and supporting a family, Mr. Grover often said, ‘‘Gives a man a chance to try again.’’ 
Probation officers are important 
members of the law enforcement com-munity. Together with pretrial serv-ices and other law enforcement agen-cies, they help individuals become pro-ductive, responsible, and law-abiding 
citizens. 
Balancing corrections and rehabilita-
tion with safeguarding the public is dif-ficult and, far too often, dangerous. On this 90th anniversary, we pay our re-spects to the probation officers who have lost their lives or been assaulted in the line of duty. In particular, I sa-lute the men and women of Probation and Pretrial Services in Maine and across the country for their dedication to the public they serve. 
Mr. KING. Mr. President, I wish to 
recognize the 90th anniversary of the U.S. Probation System in Maine, for their dedication to ensuring the crimi-nal justice system operates effectively and the public remains safe. Two events will be held in recognition, scheduled for September 21, 2015 and September 25, 2015, to commemorate 90 years of hard work and success. 
Signed into law by President Calvin 
Coolidge in 1925, the Probation Act al-tered the outlook of our judicial sys-tem. The act empowered courts to sus-pend a sentence and place worthy de-fendants into the probation system. Under predetermined conditions and ir-refutable terms, low-level offenders have the opportunity to stay with their families and remain employed, while giving back to the community. For 90 years, this important piece of legisla-tion has helped change and enhance lives, while keeping communities safe. 
Implementing probation services as a 
Federal law was a long and arduous process, and required significant effort at the State level. Maine has been a leader in supporting probation services since the early 1900s. In fact, Maine is home to George Grover, one of the first federally appointed—unpaid—State probation officers. He was appointed 90 years ago, on September 22, 1925, and served the communities and courts of Maine diligently. 
The U.S. Probation and Pretrial 
Services of Maine are dedicated to the betterment of the entire State. Helping to change lives, keeping families to-gether, allowing defendants to stay on the job and give back, are just a few of the benefits this system regularly achieves. The U.S. Probation System is also committed to addressing and com-bating the serious concern of drug ad-diction in Maine. Through re-entry courts and treatment services, the pro-bation system is helping low-level of-fenders turn their lives around and earn a fresh start. 
I applaud the U.S. Probation and Pre-
trial System in Maine for their dedi-cated service to communities and bettering lives throughout Maine. I would like to join the U.S. District Court of Maine in highlighting the suc-cess and hard work that has been dem-onstrated over the last 90 years.

Boston, who has contributed a lifetime 
of service to ensure that electricity in America is available reliably and at a reasonable price. 
By the end of the year, Mr. Boston 
will retire from the role of president and chief executive officer of PJM, a position he has held since 2008. PJM is a world-class institution that oversees the largest power grid in North Amer-ica and employs over 600 people in Au-dubon, PA. PJM performs the critical function of keeping the lights on 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for over 51 million people in all or portions of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, and the District of Columbia. 
In addition to his work at PJM, Mr. 
Boston serves as president of the Asso-ciation of Edison Illuminating Compa-nies, Inc., and was the immediate past president of the GO 15, an association of the world’s largest power grid opera-tors. Mr. Boston was recently elected to the National Academy of Engineer-ing, one of the highest professional honors accorded an engineer, and is a member of the board for the Electric Power Research Institute. 
Prior to joining PJM, Mr. Boston was 
the executive vice president of the Ten-nessee Valley Authority, the Nation’s largest public power provider. In his 35 years at TVA, Mr. Boston directed divi-sions in transmission and power oper-ations, pricing, contracts, and electric system reliability. 
Mr. Boston is a past chair of the 
North American Transmission Forum, dedicated to excellence in performance and sharing industry best practices. He also was one of the eight industry ex-perts selected to direct the North American Reliability Corporation in-vestigation of the August 2003 North-east-Midwest blackout. 
Terry Boston is one of the most 
qualified engineers and leaders in the electric industry. I wish him well in his future endeavors.

REMEMBERING WAYNE TOWNSEND 
Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, 
today, I wish to recognize and honor the extraordinary service of Wayne Townsend, a lifelong Hoosier who spent 23 years in the Indiana State legisla-ture and was the 1984 Democratic nominee for Governor. 
Wayne passed away on July 3, 2015, at 
the age of 89. A native of Grant County, Wayne dedicated his life to Indiana and embodied the true definition of a pub-lic servant. 
Throughout his legislative career, 
Wayne was a tireless advocate for Hoo-sier public schools and helped lead the effort to pass the School Reorganiza-tion Act of 1959 and its reauthorization in 1965. He also was a strong advocate for equal rights. 
Throughout his political career, 
Wayne remained humble and caring. He served as a role model to all Hoosiers and tirelessly fought to improve the 
lives of millions. 
I had the privilege of meeting Wayne 
on several occasions. His dedication to public service inspired me to create the Wayne Townsend Legislative Program in his honor. The Townsend Program affords college students and recent graduates the opportunity to serve In-diana by working in our Washington, DC, office for a semester. Wayne has been an important mentor to me dur-ing my own legislative career, and his legacy continues to motivate me today. 
Born on May 1, 1926, on his family’s 
farm in Grant County, the youngest of six children, Wayne graduated from Jefferson Township High School and went on to study agriculture at Purdue University. He joined the Army during the Korean War and served in the Counterintelligence Corps. In 1951, Wayne started his own farming busi-ness, which he eventually grew from 225 acres to 2,500 acres. He was elected to the Indiana General Assembly in 1958 at 32 years old and elected to the Indiana Senate in 1970. During his leg-islative career, Wayne was a member of the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee. 
Outside of politics, Wayne was a lov-
ing husband, father, and grandfather. He married Helen Hardin, his college sweetheart, in 1953, and they had five children together: Jay, Mark, Lisa, Steve, and Alan. All five of their chil-dren went to Blackford High School and graduated from Purdue University. He was also a proud grandfather to 18 grandchildren. 
Wayne continued to play a prominent 
role in Indiana after his time in the state legislature. He was president of the Grant County Purdue Agricultural Alumni Association and a director of the Purdue Agricultural Alumni Asso-ciation. Wayne also continued his in-volvement in education, serving as a trustee for Earlham College for 8 years and a trustee for Purdue University for 15 years. In 2007 he received the Frank O’Bannon Public Service Award, and in 2014 he received Purdue University’s highest honor, the Order of the Griffin. 
Wayne will be deeply missed by all 
Hoosiers. His integrity, tireless efforts, and strong leadership helped to make Indiana a better place, and we will al-ways be grateful for his service. May God welcome him home and bring com-fort to his family and friends.

REMEMBERING LIEUTENANT 
CALVIN SPANN 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I wish 
to celebrate the remarkable life and accomplishments of a great American and New Jerseyan, Lieutenant Calvin Spann. As a boy in Rutherford, NJ, Cal-vin was amazed by the miracle of flight, watching as planes took off from nearby Teterboro Airport. This early passion for aviation, coupled with a de-termination to prove that as an Afri-can American he was as capable as anyone to fly a plane, would eventually 
motivate him to take a courageous risk as a young man. Lieutenant Spann enlisted in the Army Air Forces at a time when all branches of the U.S. military were still segregated. He left home behind when he was assigned by the Army to attend Flight Training School at Tuskegee University in Ala-bama. 
In earning his wings at Tuskegee and 
serving in Europe during World War II 
as a member of the 100th Fighter Squadron and 332nd Fighter Group, Lieutenant Spann proved not only that he could fly but that he could do it with unusual bravery and skill. Lieu-tenant Spann flew 26 missions during the war, including what was at the time the longest bomber escort mission in history. Lieutenant Spann received numerous awards for his military serv-ice, including—much too late—a Con-gressional Gold Medal in 2006. The dis-tinction with which Lieutenant Spann and his fellow Tuskegee Airmen served paved the way for President Truman to desegregate the U.S. military in 1948. 
Lieutenant Spann, unfortunately, re-
turned home at a time in which racial discrimination still outweighed his dis-tinguished military service. Trying to build flight hours in an effort to re-main a pilot, he was denied access to planes at Teterboro, and commercial airlines would not hire him simply be-cause of his race. With characteristic resilience, he earned a living for him-self and his family as a factory super-visor, sales representative, restaurant owner, and real estate broker. Fifty years later, he was inducted into the New Jersey Aviation Hall of Fame. 
Lieutenant Spann pushed against a 
system that held all Americans back by denying some individuals the ability to contribute their talent and passion simply because of their identity. The United States of America is a better, stronger country because of Lieutenant Spann. For having the courage to pur-sue his dreams in the face of tremen-dous obstacles and at great risk to himself, Lieutenant Spann deserves our deepest respect and gratitude. May he rest in peace.

RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF ALLISON TRANS-MISSION 
Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, 
today I recognize the 100th anniversary of Allison Transmission, a company that traces its history back to the founding of the Indianapolis Speedway Team Co. in 1915. As a co-founder of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and part owner of several racing teams, James A. Allison established a machine shop on Main Street in Speedway, IN. Allison’s initial focus was racing. How-ever, in 1917 when the United States entered World War I, Allison shifted focus to produce parts and tooling for Liberty engines used by many Allied airplanes in the war. 
After a brief return to racing at the 
war’s end in late 1918 and a win at the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6648 September 15, 2015 
1919 Indianapolis 500, Allison continued 
to focus on engineering aircraft and marine products. When James Allison died in 1928, General Motors bought the company. Shortly before the start of World War II, aircraft engines became the Allison Division’s focus. Later, as part of GM, Allison Transmission de-veloped the first cross-drive hydraulic unit for the M–41 Patton tank. Since then the company has made trans-missions for most of the U.S. military’s armored and tactical wheeled vehicles. 
Further development of trans-
missions for buses, automatics for trucks and buses, hydraulically con-trolled trucks and buses, and trans-missions with electronic controls were developed by Allison from the 1950s through the 1990s. GM sold Allison Transmission in 2007 to a pair of pri-vate equity firms, and in March 2012, Allison Transmission Holdings Inc. be-came a public company with its shares trading on the New York Stock Ex-change. 
Today, Allison Transmission, a com-
pany founded on the values of innova-tion and Hoosier hard work, continues to deliver quality products and reliable services with a current focus on fuel economy. Headquartered in Indianap-olis, Allison Transmission is the world’s largest manufacturer of fully automatic commercial-duty trans-missions and a leader in hybrid-propul-sion systems. Today, vehicles powered by an Allison fully automatic trans-mission can be found on every con-tinent doing everything from trans-porting school children, fighting fires, and unlocking oil beneath the earth’s surface. Allison Transmission cur-rently has approximately 2,700 employ-ees and a presence in more than 80 countries, including manufacturing fa-cilities in the United States, Hungary, and India. 
On behalf of the citizens of Indiana, I 
would like to congratulate Allison Transmission on 100 years of success. As a multinational company that grew out of a humble machine shop in Speedway, IN, Allison Transmission has served as an economic and commu-nity anchor for the greater Indianap-olis area and beyond. 
On this special occasion, we con-
gratulate Allison Transmission on 100 years of excellence in innovation and service, and honor the generations of Hoosiers who have devoted their ca-reers to manufacturing excellence under the Allison Transmission brand. We are proud that Allison Trans-mission calls Indiana home, and we wish them continued success for many years to come.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO JOSEPH CASEY 
∑Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I 
wish to congratulate Mr. Joseph M. Casey for his years of renowned service to the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority, SEPTA, and the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. On September 30, 2015, Mr. Casey will re-tire as general manager of SEPTA. 
Mr. Casey has worked in the trans-
portation sector for over 30 years. His efforts have helped propel SEPTA, the sixth largest transit system in the Na-tion, to new heights in an era of great change and innovation within the transportation industry. Joe has been at the forefront of this innovation, leading the charge to transform SEPTA from a dependable transpor-tation service to a nationwide leader and trailblazer in public transpor-tation. 
During his tenure as general manager 
of SEPTA, Mr. Casey demonstrated a steadfast dedication to customer serv-ice, infrastructural innovation, and business integrity. 
Mr. Casey is committed to the prin-
ciple of putting the customer first. He established SEPTA’s first customer service division, which worked end-lessly to ensure customer service was the cornerstone of SEPTA and its em-ployees. Mr. Casey’s ‘‘Four Cs’’ of cus-tomer service—cleanliness, conven-ience, courtesy, and communication— quickly became doctrine engrained in the daily operations of the authority. Mr. Casey’s unwavering dedication to customer service helped propel SEPTA to record ridership numbers and mold SEPTA into the authority it is today. 
Mr. Casey not only helped SEPTA be-
come a more advanced and innovative authority, he worked tirelessly to im-prove the entire transportation infra-structure of Southeastern Pennsyl-vania. He supervised the attainment of 120 new Silverliner V rail cars and 700 hybrid buses, which were major im-provements to SEPTA’s operation. Mr. Casey also testified before the U.S. and Pennsylvania House and Senate com-mittees regarding infrastructure and the need for investment. His testi-monies helped lead to the passage of Act 89 in the Commonwealth of Penn-sylvania, which provides necessary funding for critical infrastructural ad-vancements for both rail and highway projects. 
Mr. Casey’s reputation of integrity 
and character is reflected in his com-mitment to economic, environmental, and social sustainability. His dedica-tion to sustainability resulted in SEPTA earning awards such as the 2012 American Public Transportation Asso-ciation Outstanding Public Transpor-tation System and the Gold Sustain-ability Recognition. These awards highlight the bright and successful ten-ure of Mr. Joe Casey as general man-ager of SEPTA. 
After his retirement, Mr. Casey will 
apply his transportation expertise as chair of the transportation committee tasked with planning and coordinating transportation logistics for the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. 
I want to once more congratulate Joe 
Casey on his career as an innovative and honorable leader of SEPTA. His ef-
forts and accomplishments have helped Pennsylvania grow and prosper. I wish him the best of luck and a happy and healthy retirement. ∑

TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL 
WALTER ZINK 
∑Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise 
to recognize one of my Nebraska con-stituents, MG Walter Zink. For the last 45 years of Major General Zink’s professional career, he has served our country, its military, and the great State of Nebraska. His work has spanned many areas of public service, and I wish to recognize Major General Zink and his family as he moves on to the next stage of retirement. 
As a young man from Sterling, NE, 
Major General Zink felt the call to public service early. He enlisted in the Nebraska Army National Guard in 1970 after completing his undergraduate course work at Nebraska Wesleyan University. Major General Zink re-ceived his commission as an infantry officer through the Nebraska Military Academy in June of 1972. He spent 4 years drilling as a young officer in the 134th Infantry Battalion while he com-pleted his law degree at the University of Nebraska College of Law. Major Gen-eral Zink went on to serve as a staff judge advocate at the brigade and State headquarters level before being selected as the Nebraska assistant ad-jutant general for the Army. Major General Zink retired in 2008 after be-coming commander of the U.S. Army North’s Operational Command Post One. 
Working in the legal community as 
an attorney, Major General Zink spe-cialized in worker’s compensation practices and tort law, while also don-ning the uniform on weekends to assist soldiers and the Nebraska National Guard with legal issues.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN: 
S. 2029. A bill for the relief of Shirley 
Constantino Tan; to the Committee on the Judiciary. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, 
today I am reintroducing a bill for the private relief of Shirley Constantino Tan. Ms. Tan is a Filipina national liv-ing in Pacifica, CA. She is the proud mother of 19 year old U.S. citizen twin boys, Jashley and Joriene, and the spouse of Jay Mercado, a naturalized U.S. citizen. 
I believe Ms. Tan merits Congress’ 
special consideration for this extraor-dinary form of relief because I believe her removal from the United States would cause undue hardship for her and her family. She faces deportation to the Philippines, which would separate her from her family and jeopardize her safety. 
Ms. Tan experienced horrific violence 
in the Philippines before she left to come to the United States. When she was only 14 years old, her cousin mur-dered her mother and her sister and shot Shirley in the head. While the cousin who committed the murders was eventually prosecuted, he received a short jail sentence. Fearing for her safety, Ms. Tan fled the Philippines just before her cousin was due to be re-
leased from jail. She entered the U.S. legally on a visitor’s visa in 1989. 
Ms. Tan’s current deportation order 
is the result of negligent counsel. Shir-ley applied for asylum in 1995. While her case appeal was pending at the Board of Immigration Appeals, her at-torney failed to submit a brief to sup-port her case. As a result, the case was dismissed, and the Board of Immigra-tion Appeals granted Shirley voluntary departure from the United States. 
Shirley never received notice that 
the Board of Immigration Appeals granted her voluntary departure. Shir-ley’s attorney moved offices, did not receive the order, and ultimately never informed her of the order. As a result, Shirley did not depart the United States and the grant of voluntary de-parture automatically became a depor-tation order. She learned about the de-portation order for the first time on January 28, 2009, when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents took her into immigration custody. 
Because of her attorney’s negligent 
actions, Ms. Tan was denied the oppor-tunity to present her case in U.S. im-migration proceedings. Shirley later filed a complaint with the State Bar of California against her former attorney. She is not the first person to file such a complaint against this attorney. 
On February 4, 2015, Shirley’s spouse, 
Jay, a U.S. Citizen, filed an approved spousal petition on her behalf. On Au-gust 20, 2015, U.S. Citizenship and Im-migration Services denied Shirley’s ap-plication due to the fact that Shirley still had a final order or removal. Shir-ley must go back to the immigration court and ask for the court to termi-nate her case and then reapply with United States Immigration and Citi-zenship Services. Shirley is now again faced with deportation while she seeks to close her case before the Immigra-tion Judge. 
In addition to the hardship that 
would come to Ms. Tan if she is de-ported, Shirley’s deportation would be a serious hardship to her two U.S. cit-izen children, Jashley and Joriene, who are minors. 
Joriene is a sophomore at Stanford 
University and is pre-Med in Human Biology. Jashley is a sophomore at Chapman University and plans to de-clare his Business major in spring. In addition to his studies, Jashley is in-volved in Stanford’s Pilipino-American Student Union. Ms. Tan no longer runs her in-home daycare and is a stay-at- home mom. 
If Ms. Tan were forced to leave the 
United States, her family has expressed that they would go with Shirley to the Philippines or try to find a third coun-try where the entire family could relo-cate. This would mean that Jashley and Joriene would have to leave behind their education and the only home they know in the United States. 
I do not believe it is in our Nation’s 
best interest to force this family, with two U.S. citizen children, to make the

choice between being separated and re-
locating to a country where they may face safety concerns or other serious hardships. 
Ms. Tan and her family are involved 
in their community in Pacifica and own their own home. The family at-tends Good Shepherd Catholic Church, volunteering at the church and the Mother Theresa of Calcutta’s Daugh-ters of Charity. Shirley has the support of dozens of members of her commu-nity who shared with me the family’s spirit of commitment to their commu-nity. 
Enactment of the legislation I am in-
troducing on behalf of Ms. Tan today will enable this entire family to con-tinue their lives in California and make positive contributions to their community. 
I ask my colleagues to support this 
private bill. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the text of the bill be printed in the R
ECORD . 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows:

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 252—EX-
PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE COMMITTEE ON SMALL BUSI-NESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP OF THE SENATE RELATING TO EASING THE BURDEN OF FED-ERAL TAX COMPLIANCE ON SMALL BUSINESSES 
Mr. VITTER submitted the following 
resolution; from the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship; which was placed on the calendar: 
S. R ES. 252 
Whereas American small businesses face 
major obstacles complying with their Fed-eral tax obligations; 
Whereas the complexity of the Federal tax 
code unfairly penalizes small businesses; 
Whereas such complexity requires small 
business owners to spend significant amounts of time, money, and resources com-plying with their tax obligations and less time operating their business; 
Whereas Congress has exacerbated these 
challenges for America’s small businesses by failing to update the tax code in a manner that properly reflects current circumstances; 
Whereas tax policy should also promote in-
creased savings by American citizens to be able to afford the costs of living deeper into old age; 
Whereas employee stock ownership plans 
help small businesses offer economic incen-tives to employees and help employees save more for their retirements via investments in their employing companies; 
Whereas tax policy should support small 
businesses in providing benefit packages to their employees to be competitive with larg-er employers for the best talent; 
Whereas the successful research and devel-
opment tax credit has been used to incentivize private firms to invest in re-search and development, and private invest-ment leads to spillover effects that can have a broad public good through the creation of new products, the development of new proc-esses, and the launching of new industries; 
Whereas while the research and develop-
ment tax credit is essential for our innovators, it is not accessible to many small businesses and startups—per the Gov-ernment Accountability Office, over half of the credit goes to firms with $1,000,000,000 or more in receipts; 
Whereas, according to the Congressional 
Research Service, numerous commercially successful innovations originated in small, fledgling firms that could not access the re-search and development credit; 
Whereas, if Congress made the research 
and development tax credit more available to small businesses and startups, thousands of innovative small firms could claim the credit, boosting their capacity to invest in innovation and job creation; and 
Whereas prudent changes to the structure 
of the Federal tax code would ease the bur-den of tax compliance, allowing small busi-nesses to put more money back into their business, community, and the economy: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Com-
mittee on Small Business and Entrepreneur-ship that the Senate should enact the fol-lowing: TITLE I—SMALL BUSINESS TAX REFORM

TITLE IV—PROMOTION AND EXPANSION 
OF PRIVATE EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP 
SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Promotion 
and Expansion of Private Employee Owner-ship Act of 2015’’. 
SEC. 402. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds that— (1) on January 1, 1998—nearly 25 years after 
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 was enacted and the employee stock ownership plan (hereafter in this sec-tion referred to as an ‘‘ESOP’’) was created— employees were first permitted to be owners of subchapter S corporations pursuant to the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 (Public Law 104–188); 
(2) with the passage of the Taxpayer Relief 
Act of 1997 (Public Law 105–34), Congress de-signed incentives to encourage businesses to become ESOP-owned S corporations; 
(3) since that time, several thousand com-
panies have become ESOP-owned S corpora-tions, creating an ownership interest for sev-eral million Americans in companies in every State in the country, in industries ranging from heavy manufacturing to tech-nology development to services; 
(4) while estimates show that 40 percent of 
working Americans have no formal retire-ment account at all, every United States worker who is an employee-owner of an S corporation company through an ESOP has a valuable qualified retirement savings ac-count; 
(5) recent studies have shown that employ-
ees of ESOP-owned S corporations enjoy greater job stability than employees of com-parable companies; 
(6) studies also show that employee-owners 
of S corporation ESOP companies have amassed meaningful retirement savings through their S ESOP accounts that will give them the means to retire with dignity; 
(7) under the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 
631 et seq.) and the regulations promulgated by the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, a small business concern that was eligible under the Small Business Act for the numerous preferences of the Act is denied treatment as a small business con-cern after an ESOP acquires more than 49 percent of the business, even if the number of employees, the revenue of the small busi-ness concern, and the racial, gender, or other criteria used under the Act to determine whether the small business concern is eligi-ble for benefits under the Act remain the same, solely because of the acquisition by the ESOP; and 
(8) it is the goal of Congress to both pre-
serve and foster employee ownership of S corporations through ESOPs. 
SEC. 403. DEFERRAL OF TAX FOR CERTAIN SALES 
OF EMPLOYER STOCK TO EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN SPON-SORED BY S CORPORATION. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Subparagraph (A) of sec-
tion 1042(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by striking ‘‘domestic C corporation’’ and inserting ‘‘domestic cor-poration’’. 
(b) E
FFECTIVE DATE.—The amendment 
made by subsection (a) shall apply to sales after the date of the enactment of this Act. 
SEC. 404. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY TECH-
NICAL ASSISTANCE OFFICE. 
(a) E STABLISHMENT REQUIRED .—Before the 
end of the 90-day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Treasury shall establish the S Corporation Employee Ownership Assistance Office to foster increased employee ownership of S corporations. (b) D
UTIES OF THE OFFICE .—The S Corpora-
tion Employee Ownership Assistance Office shall provide— 
(1) education and outreach to inform com-
panies and individuals about the possibilities and benefits of employee ownership of S cor-porations; and 
(2) technical assistance to assist S corpora-
tions in sponsoring employee stock owner-ship plans. 
SEC. 405. SMALL BUSINESS AND EMPLOYEE 
STOCK OWNERSHIP. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—The Small Business Act 
(15 U.S.C. 631 et seq.) is amended— 
(1) by redesignating section 47 as section 
48; and 
(2) by inserting after section 46 the fol-
lowing: 
‘‘SEC. 47. EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS. 
‘‘(a) D EFINITIONS .—In this section— 
‘‘(1) the term ‘ESOP’ means an employee 
stock ownership plan, as defined in section 4975(e)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; and 
‘‘(2) the term ‘ESOP business concern’ 
means a business concern that was a small business concern eligible for a loan, pref-erence, or other program under this Act be-fore the date on which more than 49 percent of the business concern was acquired by an ESOP. 
‘‘(b) C
ONTINUED ELIGIBILITY .—In deter-
mining whether an ESOP business concern qualifies as a small business concern for pur-poses of a loan, preference, or other program under this Act, each ESOP participant shall 
be treated as directly owning his or her pro-portionate share of the stock in the ESOP business concern owned by the ESOP.’’. 
(b) E
FFECTIVE DATE.—The amendments 
made by this section shall take effect on January 1 of the first calendar year begin-ning after the date of the enactment of this Act.

Whereas school buses are designed to be 
safer than passenger vehicles and are 13 times safer than other modes of school trans-portation, and 44 times safer than vehicles driven by teenagers; 
Whereas in an average year, about 25 
school children are killed in school bus acci-dents, with one-third of these children struck by their own school buses in loading/ unloading zones, one-third struck by motor-ists who fail to stop for school buses, and one-third killed as they approach or depart a school bus stop; 
Whereas The Child Safety Network, cele-
brating 27 years of national public service, has collaborated with the National PTA and the school bus industry to create public serv-ice announcements to reduce distracted driv-ing near school buses, increase ridership, and provide free resources to school districts in order to increase driver safety training, pro-vide free technology for tracking school buses, reduce on-board bullying, and educate students; and 
Whereas the adoption of School Bus Safety 
Month will allow broadcast and digital media and social networking industries to make commitments to disseminate public service announcements designed to save chil-dren’s lives by making motorists aware of school bus safety issues: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate designates Sep-
tember 2015 as ‘‘School Bus Safety Month’’.

APPROVAL OF JOINT 
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN OF ACTION 
SPEECH OF  
HON. STACEY E. PLASKETT 
OF THE VIRGIN ISLANDS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Thursday, September 10, 2015 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
support of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. 
Over these summer months my colleagues 
and I have engaged in—what I believe has been—enormous thought, analysis, consulta-tion, and heartfelt introspection in taking a po-sition on a matter that may determine the safety of the Middle East, and the United States’ continued leadership in the world. For several years our nation has spearheaded sanctions, which have brought Iran to the ne-gotiating table, and our President has pre-sented to our nation a path to peace. For the last 30 years, American-Iranian relations have been trapped in not only suspicion and mis-trust, but intractability; denying us the ability to develop even an agreement as to how we will manage our and our allies’ relationship and in-terests in Iran. As a nation of democracy, dig-nity and freedom, fought for and defended by ourselves and our allies, I believe that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) is the best means to protect and advance the best interests of our nation and those of our allies. I choose to support measures designed to build bridges to a future that may one day lead to peace. 
I fundamentally support the Joint Com-
prehensive Plan of Action and commend Sec-retary John Kerry and Secretary Ernest Moniz for their leadership in these negotiations. We are not the only party to this Agreement and we are well aware that all other nations in the negotiation are ready and willing to sign the JCPOA. They are also ready to resume com-mercial relations with Iran, which will effec-tively remove economic sanctions, the stick which initially brought them to the table. Our leadership role demands that we follow through with the terms of this Agreement and continue to be at the helm of monitoring Iran. We must never walk away from our commit-ment to peace in the region and our alliance with Israel. If we walk away now, however, we have no voice. We isolate not only our lead-ers, but also our nation. 
No one believes this is a perfect outcome or 
that we have entered with complete faith in the other side. As a lawyer, I understand that no party is ever completely satisfied with agreements such as this. I am particularly concerned that the Agreement will require lift-ing the sanctions against Iran, which has been our main enforcement measure. Iran stands to recover approximately $100 billion once re-leased from previously imposed sanctions. If we reject this deal, we waive any leverage to ensure the money is not used to advance a regime that would threaten our national and international security. I will work with my col-leagues in Congress and the Administration as 
we ensure Iran abides by the terms of the Agreement and uses the money to promote economic stability globally and within the re-gion. 
I have met with my constituents including 
those from both the Muslim and Jewish com-munities and am thankful for their thoughts on this subject, and even more so for their com-mitment to uplift the people of the Virgin Is-lands, our country and the world. 
Most important to this decision is my fear 
that military action would be the likely alter-native to rejecting the Agreement, and my constituents—mostly underserved and unem-ployed minorities—will be the individuals to bear the brunt of the fight. As the Representa-tive of a community that serves in our Nation’s military in greater proportion than most com-munities on the mainland, and as a mother of three service-age sons, I cannot support this outcome. 
On this anniversary of the attack of Sep-
tember 11, 2001, and our nation’s subsequent decision to enter war, we see that we must exhaust every option before entering war and suffering the casualties of such conflicts, which rob us of the most precious resource of our nation; our people. The alternative to not supporting the Agreement is not a viable op-tion for our nation. We as leaders must work diligently for peace in the Middle East, and to ensure we protect the interests of Israel, our must trusted ally in the region. 
I believe that President Obama has secured 
enough votes in the Senate to advance the Agreement, and hope we in Washington will now focus on efforts towards addressing and improving our long-term infrastructure needs, maintaining our social safety net system, alle-viating the continued inequities in this great country, and uplifting the lives of all Ameri-cans.

H.R. 3460 
HON. BRAD SHERMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, September 15, 2015 
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I voted 
against H.R. 3460. I regret that this bill was brought to the floor without even a discussion, let alone a markup, in the House Foreign Af-fairs Committee. Had it been marked up in the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I would have offered an amendment to strike the date so that the President’s authority to waive sanctions was either eliminated entirely or eliminated for three years or five years. Unfor-tunately the text of the bill implies that the next president will be more capable of making deci-sions regarding Iran than the current presi-dent. I have disagreed with President Obama on Iran policy, but I think it is absurd to as-sume that the next president will make better policy, especially when we have no idea who that individual will be.

STATEMENT RECOGNIZING TRAIN 
HEROES 
HON. AMI BERA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, September 15, 2015 
Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to com-
mend the bravery of three young men with ties to Sacramento County. While on a train to Paris, childhood friends Alek Skarlatos, An-thony Sadler, and Spencer Stone sprang into action to stop a man storming through their cabin carrying an automatic weapon and a box cutter. Their quick action saved the peo-ple onboard that train and their bravery has in-spired our country. 
As we recognize their heroism, the incident 
is also a reminder that terrorist threats are ev-erywhere. These three men took bold action to protect others from harm and I commend the sacrifice they were willing to make to protect those around them. 
The three met while attending Freedom 
Christian School in Fair Oaks. Sadler and Stone attended Del Campo High School and

were active in their community. Skarlatos 
moved to Oregon, but the trio stayed in touch. They were on a European vacation when the gunman burst into their cabin. 
As an Oregon Army National Guardsman, 
Army Spc. Alek Skarlatos had recently re-turned from Afghanistan. He was first to sound the alarm, telling his friends, ‘‘let’s go’’ as they moved to subdue the gunman. 
Anthony Sadler, a senior at Sacramento 
State University, said his first instinct was to help and he rushed toward the man. 
And Airman 1st Class Spencer Stone of the 
U.S. Air Force was the first to get to the gun-man. He was slashed while trying to disarm the man. As a trained Emergency Medical Technician, his injury didn’t stop him from ad-ministering care to some of the passengers who had been wounded. Stone has been nominated for the Airman’s Medal, the Air Force’s highest non-combat award. 
These men were faced with a dangerous 
threat and in that moment chose to act. It is a testament to their bravery and their service to their country. It is my pleasure to formally recognize the actions they took to save others. 
The parade in their honor will be held on 
September 11, 2015 in Sacramento. It’s a fit-ting date to welcome them home and honor their heroism. The story of these three men is a reminder that everyone can be a hero. Thank you Alek, Anthony, and Spencer: you have made your hometown proud and inspired our country.

Mr. MOOLENAAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today

A 1946 Owosso High School Graduate,

After retiring as a colonel in 1972, Campbell

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 375TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF THE TOWN OF MARSHFIELD 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, September 15, 2015 
Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the 375th Anniversary of the town of Marshfield, Massachusetts, a beautiful coastal haven on the state’s historic South Shore. While the town was officially incorporated as 
a separate town from Plimoth Plantation in 1640, the area that is Marshfield today has been inhabited by Native American tribes, in-cluding the Wampanoag Tribe, for thousands of years. When early English settlers came to the area known as Missacautucket by the Wampanoag, they found roads already well- established by the tribe—some of which are still in use today. 
Established as part of the ‘New Colony of 
New Plimoth in New England’ in 1620, this small colony grew from being predominantly cattle farmers to including commercial fishing, salt marsh haying and shipbuilding by the start of the 19th century. 
Marshfield and its residents retain a storied 
place in our nation’s history. Many of the town’s colonists fought in several early Amer-ican wars, including taking an early stance against the British on December 19, 1773— years before the official start of the Revolu-tionary War. At midnight, the Marshfield Patri-ots confiscated tea from the old Ordinary in the town as a protest against the Crown and a display of solidarity with those who took part in the Boston Tea Party, which took place only three days prior. 
Perhaps Marshfield’s most famous son is 
Daniel Webster, the former Senator and Sec-retary of State in the years leading up to the American Civil War. Though a national figure, this gifted orator and celebrated statesman was known in his time as ‘‘the Farmer of Marshfield’’. 
Since its historic beginnings, Marshfield has 
grown into a vibrant and active community of over 25,000 residents. Today, the town at-tracts visitors from all over the country as a popular summer destination. This scenic town is also known for hosting an annual agricul-tural fair, attracting crowds from all over the region. 
Mr. Speaker, the 375th Anniversary of 
Marshfield is an opportunity both to reflect on the significance of this prominent town and look ahead to its future as a pillar of the South Shore. Marshfield’s past embodies the rich-ness of American history and the indomitable spirit of the American people. May this historic Massachusetts town flourish for many years to come.

HONORING THE LIFE OF THE HON-
ORABLE RAYMOND L. BRAMUCCI 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, September 15, 2015 
Ms. D ELAURO. Mr. Speaker, it is with the 
deepest respect and the heaviest of hearts that I rise today to pay tribute to my good friend and outstanding political leader, Ray-mond L. Bramucci. His passing marks the end of an era and leaves a legacy of public service to which we should all strive. 
Born in Ludlow, Massachusetts, Ray’s story 
is one so many children of immigrants share. His success was built on hard work and com-munity service. One of four children of an Italian butcher who lost everything during the Great Depression, Ray worked a variety of factory jobs as a boy to help his family sur-vive. He dropped out of high school at age 17 and entered the United States Air Force where he served for four years with honor and dis-
tinction. 
After finishing his service in the Air Force, 
Ray moved to New York City where he joined the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union. Rising through the ranks, he became a senior director widely respected for cham-pioning fair play by both workers and employ-ers. This commitment to balance earned Ray a distinguished reputation among all those he worked with. 
Senator Bill Bradley chose Ray to lead his 
New Jersey office, a post he held for more than twenty years before he was tapped by then Governor Jim Florio to serve as Commis-sioner of New Jersey’s Department of Labor. His political acumen and policy prowess once again earned him the respect and admiration of all those who worked with him. As Commis-sioner, Ray left an indelible mark on public policy with one of his signature achieve-ments—the passage of the Workforce Devel-opment Partnership Act, which trained unem-ployed workers in high-tech, emerging trades. 
Ray later served as the Executive Director 
of the Scion Hall University Institute on Work, 
a not-for-profit organization advocating work-place equity. He was also an arbitrator on the New Jersey Board of Mediation, a Special Ad-visor to the President of Montclair State Uni-versity, and an adjunct professor of political science at Rutgers University. Ray ascended to the national stage in 1998 when then Presi-dent Bill Clinton asked him to serve as Assist-ant Secretary of Labor at the United States Department of Labor. He oversaw the admin-istration of national Youth Opportunity grants and became a driving force in employment and training nationwide. He also supervised job training across the country, including more than 100 Job Corps Centers. 
Even after his service at the United States 
Department of Labor concluded, Ray re-mained active as a consultant on worker train-ing, labor issues, conflict resolution and arbi-tration for public and private sector clients. Throughout his life, Ray demonstrated a unique commitment to public service. He fought hard for policies that strengthened the American workforce in immeasurable and in-numerable ways. 
On a more personal note, I will always be 
grateful to Ray for his friendship, support, and guidance. He was not only a good friend but, like for so many others, a mentor. I am hon-ored to stand today to pay tribute to Raymond L. Bramucci for his many contributions to our nation and to extend my deepest sympathies to his wife, Sue; his sons, Michael and Dante; as well as his many family, friends, and col-leagues. I consider myself fortunate to have called him my friend and he will be deeply missed by all of those fortunate enough to have known him.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E1280 September 15, 2015 
We also come together to remember two 
other tragic events that devastated the Polish- American community. I stand with the Polish people today at the Katyn 1940 Monument as they commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Katyn Forest Massacre, and the 5th anniver-sary of the tragic airplane crash that killed 96 people, including the Polish President and other top Polish officials. The Monument, lo-cated in Jersey City, is a symbol of the impor-tant history of the Polish-American community in New Jersey and the sacrifices of their an-cestors. 
The Katyn Forest Massacre occurred during 
World War II in April and May of 1940 while Poland was fighting a war on two fronts. The Soviet secret police brutally killed over 20,000 Poles whose bodies were later recovered in a mass grave at Katyn. Tragically, five years ago as a delegation of Polish officials were traveling to Katyn to commemorate the mas-sacre, their plane unexpectedly crashed in western Russia, killing all aboard. 
The Polish people throughout the course of 
history have been unwavering in their resil-ience and patriotism in the face of adversity. Their courage is admirable and inspiring, and on this day we stand in solidarity as they com-memorate these occasions of great loss.

OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, September 15, 2015 
Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recog-
nize the extraordinary achievements of the legendary percussionist and innovator of Afro- Cuban Jazz, Candido Camero. Popularly known as Candido, Mr. Camero has literally changed music on a world-wide scale. A jazz artist that has performed and recorded with a long list of distinguished figures across a diz-zying array of genres, he holds the distinction of being the most recorded percussionist in the history of Jazz. ‘‘Candido’’ is truly the per-cussion colossus of Modern Jazz and popular music. 
On September 17, 2015, National Endow-
ment for the Arts Jazz Master Candido will be honored this year by the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation (CBCF) at the 30th An-nual Jazz Forum and Concert, during the 45th Annual Legislative Conference (ALC). Dubbed ‘‘The Man with A Thousand Fingers,’’ Candido was the first musician to play two or more congas simultaneously, while tuning the drums to add melodic interest to rhythmic complexity. His innovations paved the way for future per-cussionists in Latin jazz, pop, rock, mambo, salsa and world music. For his many contribu-tions to the development of music, Candido is truly deserving of the 2015 CBCF Jazz Legacy Award. 
Candido de Guerra Camero was born on 
April 22nd, 1921 in Havana, Cuba. He started playing congas and bongos as a young child, and competed in neighborhood parades known as comparsas. His earliest gigs were with the CMQ Radio Orchestra for six years, and later with the famed Tropicana nightclub for eight years. In 1946 he appeared in a mu-sical revue called Tidbits at the Plymouth The-ater on Broadway, playing backup for the Cuban dance team, Carmen and Rolando. He made his first U.S. recording with the famed Afro-Cuban bandleader Machito in 1948 on the tune, El Rey Del Mambo, and worked with trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie to record three al-bums, Afro (1954), Gillespiana (1960) and The Melody Lingers On (1966). Candido also ap-peared on the Ed Sullivan and Jackie Gleason shows. 
Gillespie introduced Candido to legendary 
pianist, bandleader, composer and educator, Dr. Billy Taylor. He played with Taylor from 1953 to 1954. They recorded The Billy Trio with Candido: A seminal, Latin jazz LP which spotlighted Camero’s amazing and revolu-tionary conga and bongo playing. Dr. Taylor wrote that, ‘‘he had not heard anyone who even approaches the wonderful balance be-tween jazz and Cuban elements that Candido demonstrates.’’ Candido also worked and re-corded with Stan Kenton, Tito Puente, Grant Green, Elvin Jones, Wes Montgomery, Tony Bennett, Art Blakey and Randy Weston. In 1979, Candido wrote ‘‘Jingo’’ for the West Afri-can percussionist Olatunji and his Dancin’ and Prancin’ LP for the Salsoul Latin-disco label. 
Candido recorded over fifteen recordings as 
a leader, including ‘‘The Volcanic’’ (1956), ‘‘Conga Soul’’ (1962), ‘‘Thousand Finger Man’’ 
(1969), ‘‘Brujerias de Candido: Candido’s Latin McGuffa’s Dust’’ (1971), ‘‘The Conga Kings,’’ with percussionists Giovanni Hidalgo and Patato Valdes (2000), and ‘‘The Master’’ (2014). He was named an NEA Jazz Master in 2008, and was featured in the 2009 PBS documentary, Latin Music USA. 
Candido Camero is a living national jazz 
treasure, and I encourage my colleagues to honor his tremendous contributions to Jazz.

HONORING CAPTAIN KRISTEN 
GRIEST OF ORANGE, CONNECTICUT 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, September 15, 2015 
Ms. D ELAURO. Mr. Speaker, it gives me 
great pleasure to rise today to pay tribute to an outstanding member of our military and re-cent U.S. Army Ranger School graduate, Cap-tain Kristen Marie Griest. A native of Orange, Connecticut, Captain Griest recently became one of the first women to complete the 62-day combat leadership course—shattering a gen-der ceiling as she joins the ranks of our coun-try’s most elite Army members. Though she will not yet be able to serve in the 75th Rang-er Regiment, her hometown community and her state could not be more proud of her ac-complishment. 
A graduate of Amity Regional High School 
in Woodbridge, Connecticut, Kristen Griest was known as a quiet leader and a tough competitor, always pushing herself to succeed. A track and softball star in high school, she entered the United States Military Academy at West Point in the fall of 2007. Following her graduation, Kristen went on to serve in the military police because, as her brother, Chief Warrant Officer 2 Michael Griest, an Army avi-ator himself, said ‘‘it was the closest she could come at the time to serving in combat.’’ She was deployed to Afghanistan in 2013 as a military police officer and upon her return took up the challenge of Ranger School. 
With courses including phases at Fort 
Benning in Georgia, on the mountains of northern Georgia, and in the Florida Pan-handle swamps in and around Eglin Air Force Base, The U.S. Army’s Ranger School is con-sidered one of the military’s most difficult courses physically and mentally. Critics of al-lowing women into the military’s most elite units had used the argument that no woman has demonstrated she can keep up with men by passing Ranger School. Along with fellow graduate, 1st Lieutenant Shaye Haver of Copperas Cove, Texas, Kristen has success-fully challenged such notions, demonstrating that women should be allowed the same op-portunities as their male counterparts to join our military’s elite forces. 
Kristen recently received her black and gold 
Ranger tab along with her fellow Rangers, but will return to her previous unit instead of join-ing her male colleagues in the 75th Ranger Regiment. Perhaps soon we will see that ceil-ing shattered as well. Today, I am proud to stand today to join her parents, Thomas and Laura; her brother, Michael; her many family and friends, as well as the community of Or-ange and the State of Connecticut in extend-ing my sincere congratulations to Captain

SBA DISTRICT DIRECTOR, ON THE OCCASION OF HIS RETIRE-MENT 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, September 15, 2015 
Ms. D ELAURO. Mr. Speaker, it gives me 
great pleasure to rise today to extend my deepest thanks and appreciation to Bernard Sweeney who recently retired as the United States Small Business Administration’s Con-necticut District Director. In a career of federal service that spanned more than three dec-ades, Bernie demonstrated a remarkable com-mitment to public service. Bernie’s federal service included serving as Chief of Staff to the Under Secretary at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Spe-cial Assistant to the Secretary at HUD, and Staff Assistant to the President of the United States at the White House. However, it was his work at the SBA that left an indelible mark on our state and region. 
Bernie began his career with the SBA in the 
Connecticut District Office in 1987 as Acting Assistant District Director for Business Devel-opment. During his tenure with the SBA, he served as a Team Leader for Marketing and Outreach, a Loan Officer, and Business Devel-opment Specialist. Prior to being named the Connecticut District Director in 2005, Bernie was the Branch Manager in the Springfield, Massachusetts SBA Branch Office. 
As District Director of the SBA’s Connecticut 
District Office, Bernie oversaw the delivery of agency programs for the state of Connecticut, including financial assistance, management counseling, and business development. He was responsible for directing the activities of 10 permanent SBA employees, the administra-tion of a business loan portfolio, oversight of the Connecticut Small Business Development Center (SBDC) network, including its 15 loca-tions around the state, the coordination of 7 chapters of the Service Corps of Retired Ex-ecutives (SCORE) and 3 Women’s Business Centers (WBC) serving all of Connecticut. Ber-nie worked tirelessly to ensure that the district staff reached out to the underserved commu-nities in Connecticut and that the SBA training programs reached these communities. He also helped to establish the three Hispanic Cham-bers of Commerce by offering both technical and financial assistance. 
I would be remiss if I did not extend a spe-
cial note of thanks to Bernie for all of the help and guidance he provided to myself and my staff over the last decade. From coordinating informational briefings to immediately respond-ing to storm and fire damage in various com-munities, Bernie was always just a phone call away. He was always ready to assist in what-ever ways the agency could provide. He was a remarkable resource for all of us. 
For his many invaluable contributions to our 
small businesses, to our communities, and our state, I am honored to stand today to pay trib-ute to Bernard Sweeney. His is a legacy of public service to which we should all strive. I extend my very best wishes to Bernie, his wife, Sandy, and their son, Zack, for many more years of health and happiness as he en-joys his retirement.

IN RECOGNITION OF GARY BARTZ 
HON. JOHN CONYERS, JR. 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, September 15, 2015 
Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recog-
nize the extraordinary achievements of leg-endary saxophonist and educator Gary Bartz. A highly-talented instrumentalist, vocalist, composer, and leader—Mr. Bartz’s long career deserves our applause. 
Mr. Bartz started playing at an early age 
with Art Blakey at his father’s jazz club in his hometown of Baltimore, MD. Fifty-seven years later, he is an international sensation, earning a Grammy Award in 2005 for his and McCoy Tyner’s ‘‘Illuminations.’’ Over the course of his career, he has recorded over 40 solo albums and made guest appearances on over 200 more. 
Gary Bartz first came to New York in 1958, 
at just 17 years old, to attend the Julliard Con-servatory of Music. He remembers those days fondly, saying, ‘‘It was a very good time for the music in New York, at the end of what had been the be-bop era. Charlie Parker had passed away three years previously but Miles’ group was in its heyday, Monk was down at the Five Spot, and Ornette Coleman was just coming to town. Things were fresh.’’ He spent much of his time drinking Coca-Cola in the all- 
ages ‘‘peanut gallery’’ at Birdland, where he enjoyed a marathon bill of performers. Reflect-ing on his musical youth, he has said, ‘‘If I didn’t have money to get in, I’d help some-body carry a drum to work my way in.’’ 
From 1962–64, Mr. Bartz participated in 
Charles Mingus’ Workshop and began prac-ticing regularly with fellow members of the horn section, including Eric Dolphy. By the mid ’60s, the alto saxophonist, still in his early 20s, began performing throughout the city with the Max Roach/Abbey Lincoln Group, and quickly established himself as the most promising alto voice since Cannonball Adderley. 
With the splash of his New York debut sol-
idly behind him, Mr. Bartz joined Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers. The young saxophonist’s parents owned a club in Baltimore called the North End Lounge. When his father hired Blakey for a gig, Mr. Bartz grabbed the oppor-tunity to fill a sax player vacancy in the band. After his performance that night, he was offi-cially hired to join the Jazz Messengers. In 1965, he would make his recording debut on Blakey’s ‘‘Soulfinger’’ album. 
In 1968, Mr. Bartz began an association 
with McCoy Tyner, which included partici-pating in Tyner’s classic ‘‘Expansions’’ and ‘‘Extentions’’ albums. Work with McCoy proved especially significant for Mr. Bartz because of the bandleader’s strong connection to John Coltrane. During his first two years with Tyner, Mr. Bartz was also touring with Max Roach and taking some time out to record on Max’s Atlantic Records release, ‘‘Members Don’t Get Weary.’’ ‘‘With Max, there was that bond with Charlie Parker,’’ declares Bartz. ‘‘Charlie Parker is why I play the alto saxophone.’’ 
Mr. Bartz began working with Miles Davis in 
1970, his first experience playing electric music. It also reaffirmed his yen for an even stronger connection to Coltrane. In addition to working with Miles in the early ’70s—including playing the historic Isle of Wight Festival in August, 1970—Mr. Bartz was busy fronting his own NTU Troop ensemble. The group got its name from the Bantu language: NTU means unity in all things, time and space, living and dead, seen and unseen. 
Outside the Troop, Mr. Bartz had been re-
cording as a group leader since 1968, and continued to do so throughout the ’70s, during which time he released such acclaimed al-bums as, ‘‘Another Earth,’’ ‘‘Home,’’ ‘‘Music Is My Sanctuary’’ and ‘‘Love Affair.’’ By the late ’70s, he was doing studio work in Los Angeles with Norman Connors and Phyllis Hyman. In 1988, after a nine-year break between solo re-leases, Mr. Bartz began recording what music columnist Gene Kalbacher described as ‘‘Vital ear-opening sides,’’ on such albums as ‘‘Mon-soon,’’ ‘‘West 42nd Street,’’ ‘‘There Goes The Neighborhood,’’ and ‘‘Shadows.’’ 
Mr. Bartz followed those impressive works 
in 1995 with the release of his debut Atlantic album ‘‘The Red and Orange Poems,’’ a self- described musical mystery novel and just one of his brilliantly conceived concept albums. Back when he masterminded the much-touted ‘‘I’ve Known Rivers’’ album, based on the po-etry of Langston Hughes, his concepts would be twenty years ahead of those held by some of today’s jazz/hip hop and acid jazz combos. So it continues with ‘‘The Blues Chronicles: Tales of Life,’’ a testimonial to a steadfast be-lief in the power of music to soothe, challenge, spark a crowd to complete ecstasy, or move one person to think. It adds up to a shoe box 
full of musical snapshots from a life lived and played with passion and stirred—with both joy and sadness—by the blues. 
Mr. Bartz’s release ‘‘Live at the Jazz Stand-
ard Volume 1—Soulstice’’ is the first of a se-ries of recordings documenting his legendary, non-stop style, live performances. This initial release on his own OYO label bares testimony 
to Bartz’s continuing growth as a composer, group leader, and a master of both the alto and soprano saxophones. A quartet session recorded in 1998, was followed by ‘‘Live at the Jazz Standard, Volume 2’’ released in 2000, which features Mr. Bartz’s exciting Sextet. His follow-up release ‘‘Soprano Stories’’ features Mr. Bartz exclusively performing on the so-prano saxophone in a studio quartet setting. 
His follow-up album to the highly acclaimed 
‘‘Volume 1 of the Coltrane Files, Toa of a Music Warrior,’’ will be released in 2015, along with his album honoring Woody Shaw entitled ‘‘Two MF’s’.’’ 
When he is not on the road or preparing 
new music, Mr. Bartz serves as a professor in the Jazz Studies Department of the Oberlin Conservatory of Music. 
Mr. Bartz performs at the Congressional 
Black Caucus Foundation’s Annual Legislative Conference Jazz Concert on September 17, 2015. On that occasion, I will be presenting him with the Foundation’s Jazz Legacy Award. Next month, he will be honored with the BNY Mellon Jazz 2015 Living Legacy Award in a special ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on Friday, Oc-tober 16, 2015. 
Gary Bartz is an extraordinary musician that 
has made a remarkable contribution to Jazz music and world culture. For these reasons, I urge you to join me in congratulating him for these awards and his lifetime of outstanding accomplishments.

LOOKING BACK: YOUNG WOMAN’S 
LETTER TO HER MOTHER LOST ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 
HON. JOHN B. LARSON 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, September 15, 2015 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, 
as we remember those we lost 14 years ago, I submit one of the most poignant expressions I’ve seen since that grave day. Written by Anjunelly Jean-Pierre as a letter to her moth-er, whose life was lost on 9/11, this moving tribute both shows how inspiring her mom was to her and how her memory will be ever-lasting. 
LETTERS TO THE LOST 
(Collected by Sheila Weller) 
On a clear day 10 years ago, nearly 3,000 
people died. They were the sisters, brothers, boyfriends and mothers of young women who mourn them still—and who write intimate messages to them here. 
Dear Mommy, last night I made a whole 
chicken with vegetables for dinner. You would have been proud. 
My children, Brianna, seven, and Elijah, 
eight—the children you never met—loved it. 
When I cook, I remember the meals you 
made. I was the only kid who had manicotti for lunch on the first-grade school trip. Ev-
eryone else had a turkey or peanut-butter- and-jelly sandwich, but you were then the housekeeper for an Italian family, so you learned to make things they liked. Eventu-ally your cooking talent landed you—an im-migrant from the Dominican Republic with an elementary school education who had to learn English from scratch—a chef’s job at Cantor Fitzgerald, on the 105th floor of the World Trade Center. 
In the summer of 2001, I was planning to 
join the military. And then September 11 happened. It took me years to come to terms with the fact that you were gone. I actually kept your phone number in my cell phone 
until 2009! I had to keep you ‘‘alive’’ so that I myself could survive. 
But after you died, I tapped into the pas-
sion for cooking you’d instilled in me. I went to culinary school, then was a sous-chef on Emeril Lagasse’s show Emeril Green. Now I have my own catering business. The meal my clients like best is the Dominican rice-and- peas dish you made me as comfort food. I guess the love and heritage comes through. 
I wish you could see your grandchildren. 
Brianna looks so much like I did at her age. As for Elijah, he has your perfectionism. I remember you said, ‘‘Children should have names that are strong and great in mean-ing.’’ I gave Brianna her middle name, Maxi-ma, in honor of you. And to keep your spirit alive, every Friday night we have tea and a relaxing talk about life, just like you and I did, to mark the end of a long week of work and school. 
Being a single mom running a one-person 
business hasn’t always been easy. I some-times find myself driving boxes of cheese-cakes and pound cakes to a customer and then dashing off to pick up the kids at school. But you, too, were a single mom, one who’d conquered so many challenges. You’ve remained my guiding force. And you always will be. 
Anjunelly Jean-Pierre, 29, of Dumfries, 
Virginia, lost her mother, Maxima. Today she is a mom and owner of Max & Jax Cafe ´. TRIBUTE TO THE STEWART-RONEY

Whereas, in our beloved Fourth Congres-
sional District of Georgia, we are honored to have members of the Stewart-Roney family for they are some of our most honorable citizens in our District; and 
Whereas, family is one of the most honored 
and cherished institutions in the world and we take pride in knowing that families such as the Stewart-Roney family have set aside this time to fellowship with each other, honor one an-other and to pass along history to each other through their family reunion in DeKalb County, Georgia; and
