Hear us Lord in the day of our calam-ity. Send us help and deliverance from Your sanctuary according to the depth of Your mercy and the goodness of Your heart. Spare us from the arrows of our en-emies. Forgive our presumptuous sins. Cleanse us from our secret faults. Then we will rejoice in Your salvation. And in the name of the most High, then will we know that it is the Lord who saves His people. By the saving strength of Your right hand that You hear us from Your holy heaven. Some may trust in chariots and horses, but we will remember the name of the Lord our God. Let the words of our mouths, and the meditations of our hearts be acceptable in Thy sight, O Lord. In Jesus’ name, amen.

HONORING MOLLY EDWARDS 
HON. PAUL D. RYAN 
OF WISCONSIN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 20, 2018 Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I ad-dress the House today, the last one with Molly Edwards serving on my staff. After more than five years, Molly is moving on from the House, where she will be missed by not just me but the many with whom she worked to make this institution shine. A proud—very proud—North Carolina native, Molly was part of our team at the Ways and Means Committee, and she was there for the unexpected journey to the speaker’s office. It has been a privilege to watch her take on ever-expanding roles over these years. Through hard work Molly earned her way to be my director of press operations. When dignitaries or diplomats visited or when-ever the biggest events had the world watch-ing the Capitol, Molly was there to ensure things always went off without a hitch. With a steady hand, as well as some southern charm, no moment was ever too big or challenge too great. Poised under pressure, she is a true professional. And she has always made me look far more polished than I really am. I am enormously grateful for Molly’s service, and I wish her nothing but the best in her next ad-ventures.

HONORING THE 100TH ANNIVER-SARY OF FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH JEFFERSON PARK 
HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 20, 2018 Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 100th anniversary of First Baptist Church Jefferson Park in Newport News, Virginia. First Baptist Church Jefferson Park was es-tablished in the fall of 1918, following a long period of uncertainty and displacement for its future congregation. When the United States government purchased Mulberry Island in re-sponse to the outbreak of World War I, those already living on the island were forced to up-root their lives and relocate. This also meant that the thriving church community which had already made a home on the island had to be broken up; when Colossian Baptist Church’s property was repurposed by the government and its congregation moved to their new loca-tion in Newport News, not everyone could go with it. Many former members were forced to live far apart following their relocation, branch-ing off and eventually setting down roots in areas all across the city. Jefferson Park be-came such an area, and although the area was significantly underdeveloped with no pub-lic schools, mail delivery, or church, a small group of pioneers from Mulberry Island came to call it home. Deacon William & Mrs. Lucy Wooten, also originally from Mulberry Island, heard the group’s call for a church in their new location at Jefferson Park. With the help of other com-munity members, Deacon William built their first place of worship, including the pews, pul-pit, and communion table. At the time there was not sufficient money or space for a proper setup for an organ, piano, or formal choir, and the church was lit with kerosene lamps rather than electricity. Despite the limited space, en-thusiasm and membership for the church grew under the leadership of Reverend Zechariah White, who served as a spiritual pillar for the congregation in the church’s early days de-spite never serving as pastor. In 1925 Rev-erend J.O. Atkinson was able to oversee the construction of a larger church building to ac-commodate the congregation’s needs. Reverend Atkinson became First Baptist Church Jefferson Park’s first official pastor in 1920, following the death of Reverend M. Massenburg, who was called to pastor the congregation but unfortunately passed before his installation. Following Reverend Atkinson’s departure from the church in 1927, he was succeeded by Reverend T.H. Ashe in 1929, Reverend F.A. Rylander in 1937, Reverend Mack Samuel in 1940, and Rev. O.D. Henry in 1952. The First Baptist Church Jefferson Park congregation expanded in 1967, following Reverend Dr. Bernard Schiele’s purchase of nearby property and subsequent construction of a new church. Reverend Dr. Reginald C. Woodhouse was installed as First Baptist Church Jefferson Park’s next pastor in 1999, and the church has only continued to grow and expand since then. The church’s community is incredibly ac-tive, participating in a variety of ministries and programs established by Rev. Dr. Woodhouse, including Youth Choir, Junior Gleaners, Little Angels Choir, Junior Deacons, Junior Trust-ees, Junior Clerks, and Youth Bible Study. First Baptist Church Jefferson Park’s con-gregation takes the call to community engage-ment seriously, which is evident in their annual Education Day Celebration, Church-School partnership with Newsome Park Elementary School, and Tutorial Program. Over the last 100 years, The First Baptist Church Jefferson Park has been served by many dedicated men of faith—Rev. Zechariah White, Rev. M. Massenburg, Rev. J.O. Atkin-son, Rev. T.H. Ashe, Rev. F.A. Rylander, Rev. Mack Samuel, Rev. O.D. Henry, Rev. Dr. W. Bernard Schiele, and Rev. Dr. Reginald C. Woodhouse. Mr. Speaker, as First Baptist Church Jeffer-son Park of Newport News, Virginia celebrates this historic milestone, its congregation can take pride in an inspiring 100 years of fellow-ship, worship, and service. I would like to con-gratulate Reverend Dr. Reginald C. Woodhouse and all of the members of the church’s congregation on this joyous occasion, and I wish them many more years full of growth and prosperity. IN HONOR OF TWENTY YEARS OF SERVICE BY CHILDREN’S SAFE HARBOR HON. KEVIN BRADY 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 20, 2018 Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize the Children’s Safe Harbor for their twenty years of service to the commu-nities of Montgomery, San Jacinto, and Walker counties. The Montgomery County Children’s Advo-cacy Center, Inc., also known as Children’s Safe Harbor (CSH), was established over two decades ago to address child abuse. Specifi-cally, CSH cares for children between the ages of two and seventeen who have suffered sexual abuse, physical abuse and trauma. Since this important organization opened its doors on August 31, 1998, it has provided a safe place for children where they can be heard, helped and healed. From the beginning, CSH’s principle mission has been to provide a supportive, safe envi-ronment for children while enhancing the co-ordination between criminal investigations and the monitoring of child abuse cases. Instead of children unnecessarily accessing multiple law enforcement agencies and child protection systems to seek healing and justice, CSH uti-lizes a multi-disciplinary, team-oriented ap-proach to successfully coordinate effective, ef-ficient, and child-centered casework. This method allows CSH to offer victimized children the care they need while also ensuring that the evidence necessary for prosecution is gathered effectively and mental health re-sources for children and non-offending family members are coordinated through completion of care. First founded in Montgomery County, CSH has since expanded its operations and is now a multi-county resource for children and fami-lies. In its first few months, approximately 23 children were referred to the organization. Now, the average number of cases assisted by CSH totals over 200 a month. Though the increase in requests for help brought forth new challenges, CSH met them head-on. CSH’s hard work and selfless service has helped 14,369 vulnerable children seeking the healing and justice they deserve—a truly incredible accomplishment. In 1993, I joined my fellow CSH board members and signed a charter application to initiate this life-changing nonprofit organiza-tion. It is amazing to see the miracles this or-ganization has accomplished since its found-ing, and I am proud to recognize CSH for the crucial work it has done in our community over the past twenty years. To the staff, volunteers, and community leaders, such as my close friend Executive Di-rector Victoria Constance, Ph.D., who have worked tirelessly to make CSH the life-chang-ing organization it is today—thank you. With-out your dedication, CSH would not be able to

IN RECOGNITION OF MERCY PEDALERS 1ST ANNIVERSARY 
HON. DORIS O. MATSUI 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 20, 2018 Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mercy Pedalers and its volunteers and supporters as they celebrate their 1st An-niversary. As the community gathers today, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring them and their successful first year of service to the Sacramento region and beyond. On September 1st Sister Libby Fernandez founded Mercy Pedalers after serving as the Executive Director of Sacramento Loaves & Fishes for eleven years. During her many years of service for the people in our commu-nity experiencing homelessness, she realized that compassion and personal connections were what made a difference in people’s daily lives. Through her small but meaningful, indi-vidual actions, the inspiration for the organiza-tion was fostered. Mercy Pedalers is comprised of local, kind-hearted individuals, who cycle through the streets of Sacramento, reaching out to men and women who are in crisis and living on the streets. They emphasize their outreach and actions based on the ‘‘Works of Mercy’’ and ‘‘Welcoming the Stranger.’’ The work and care that the volunteers bring into the streets of our city cannot be overstated. As we struggle to address the causes and symptoms of home-lessness, Mercy Pedalers bring a ministry ap-proach to day to day outreach. The dignity and respect that Sister Libby and the Mercy Pedalers show homeless men and women is one that should be present in all of us. Mr. Speaker, as the members and volun-teers of Mercy Pedalers celebrate their first year of service to the Sacramento community, I ask all my colleagues to join me in honoring them for their dedication to our neighbors through their charitable work.

TRIBUTE TO DENIZ FRANKE 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 20, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Deniz Franke for being named the 2018 Women Business Owner of the Year honoree by the award-winning central Iowa Publication, Busi-ness Record. Franke successfully built her own business, a wealth management com-pany named Franke Miller Group. For 19 years, the Business Record has un-dertaken an exhaustive annual review to iden-tify a standout group of women who have made a significant difference in business, civic, and philanthropic endeavors throughout the Greater Des Moines Area. Deniz was born in Istanbul, Turkey. By the time she was eighteen years old she had an entrepreneurial spirit which led her to develop, design, and produce her own fashion line. Deniz and her family moved to Memphis, Ten-nessee where she attended the University of Memphis earning two degrees in finance and marketing. She has become one of the top pri-vate wealth advisors in Iowa and has been recognized nationally by Forbes magazine as Best in State Wealth Advisors for 2018 and was part of Forbes Top Women Wealth Advi-sors in 2018 . Deniz also finds the time to give back to her community as a trustee for the Boys and Girls Club of Central Iowa, volun-teers for Big Brothers and Sisters, the Amer-ican Heart Association, and the Alzheimer’s Association. Mr. Speaker, it is a profound honor to rep-resent leaders like Deniz Franke in the United States Congress and it is with great pride that I recognize and applaud her for utilizing her talents to better both her community and the great state of Iowa. I invite my colleagues in the House to join me in congratulating Deniz Franke on receiving this esteemed designa-tion, thanking those at Business Record for their great work, and wishing Ms. Franke a long and successful career. f 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL ESTUARY WEEK: SEPTEMBER 15 TO 22, 2018 
HON. BILL POSEY 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 20, 2018 Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, this week we cel-ebrate National Estuary Week, a week dedi-cated to raising awareness of the importance of our nation’s estuaries. This marks the 30th anniversary of National Estuary Week, and on Monday, September 17, I joined my fellow co- chairs of the Congressional Estuary Caucus and Restore America’s Estuaries in kicking off this celebration with the 2018 National Estu-aries Week Hill Expo. This Expo was a great showcase of research and resources for coastal habitats. The Environmental Protection Agency, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service were on hand to talk with staff and Members and explain how we can improve the health of our estuaries. Former Congressman Jim Gerlach taught us ‘‘Estuaries are coastal bays, harbors, sounds and lagoons, places where rivers meet the sea.’’ My own Eighth District of Florida is home to the Indian River Lagoon, one of the most diverse estuaries in North America and the world. I grew up around Cocoa Beach, raised my family along the Lagoon, and worked in local real estate for many years. I learned firsthand why it’s so important for us to work together to care for our environment. That is why, in early 2017, I founded the bi-partisan Congressional Estuary Caucus with several of my colleagues to give the nation’s estuaries a stronger voice and presence in Congress. Since that time, more than forty Members of Congress have joined the Estuary Caucus and become actively engaged in our efforts to support estuary restoration and con-servation. The Caucus has already held elev-en briefings on Capitol Hill about the critical role these delicate ecosystems play in our communities. Stretching 156 miles along Florida’s east coast, our Lagoon is a sanctuary for nearly 4,000 species of wildlife, an economic engine for our community, and an invaluable rec-reational and educational resource for resi-dents and visitors. Since estuaries are places where freshwater mixes with saltwater, pre-serving the delicate balance is as critical as it can be difficult. Our quality of life, economy and tourism, property values and the survival of many indigenous species of plant and wild-life depend on our efforts. Scientists often call them ‘‘nurseries of the sea’’ because estuaries are the nesting and feeding habitats for many aquatic plants and animals. Experts at the Na-tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimate that up to 80 percent of the fish and shellfish that we catch spend at least part of their lives in estuaries. That catch includes salmon, herring, and oysters, and our fishing industry is valued in the billions of dollars. Es-tuaries also contribute to healthy ocean envi-ronments by filtering out sediments and pollut-ants from rivers and streams before they flow into the oceans. Estuaries are also important recreational destinations. Millions of people each year boat, swim, watch birds and other wildlife, and fish in our nation’s estuaries. Coastal recreation and tourism generate bil-lions of dollars to our economy. Many estuaries, including our lagoon, are experiencing challenges like harmful algae blooms, declines in sea grass, and invasive species. These threats require our immediate attention. Acidification also presents uncertain-ties within our precious estuaries. The problem of estuarine acidification is less well under-stood than acidification in the open ocean and could pose severe effects for the biodiversity of our estuaries like the Indian River Lagoon. As we seek to restore and protect our estu-aries, I believe we have to adopt the prover-bial ‘‘all of the above’’ strategy. That means a coordinated effort involving federal, state and local cooperation with each level of govern-ment doing what it does best. Our state and local government will lead the efforts that im-prove our water quality and will provide lead-ership in assuring we adapt to sea level rise in the way we build and manage our land use. The federal government supports state and local leadership with restoration programs that include the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, En-vironmental Protection Agency, National Oce-anic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. De-partment of Agriculture, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. I’ve joined my colleagues, Congressman B
RIAN MASTand Congresswoman B ONAMICI , in introducing legislation aimed at mitigating and solving our hypoxia and toxic algal bloom challenges. In Florida, we are working to raise the priority of projects that benefit the estu-aries within the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. To get a leg up on the challenges to our es-tuaries posed by acidification, I’ve introduced the National Estuaries and Acidification Re-search Act of 2018. This legislation creates a research program so that we can understand how better how acidification works in estuaries and how we might be able to combat it. For the 2018 Fiscal Year, the Interior Appro-priations bill includes $16.8 million that will provide $600,000 to each of the 28 estuaries, and also includes my plan to direct $1.5 mil-lion for the National Estuary Program’s com-petitive grants program for special projects and prevention and mitigation focused re-search. This is a win for our estuaries, com-munities, and economy.

This week, millions of Americans will show their commitment to our estuaries through vol-unteer efforts. We all have a role to play in caring for our environment. It is a matter of awareness and of action. We must look for even more opportunities for our ‘‘all of the above’’ strategy for keeping our estuary economies sustainable and resilient. Advanc-ing common sense ideas that strengthen our economy, protect our estuaries including the Indian River Lagoon, and preserve our natural beauty remain a top priority for me. I’m grate-ful for the work of millions of dedicated profes-sionals and volunteers across this nation. National Estuary Week is a time to cele-brate the contributions of our estuaries to our way of life and our well-being. Estuaries pro-vide indispensable services to our ecology and our economy. Our estuaries are irreplaceable and we must protect, sustain, and restore them. National Estuary Week is also a time to re-view our progress in assuring the continued productivity of our estuaries, celebrating our successes and renewing our commitment to ensuring that future generations will enjoy these precious resources. I ask all Members to join me and the Congressional Estuary Caucus in that commitment. The challenge is critical and we can meet it.

LIZABETH LIEBESKIND 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 20, 2018 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I honor today a dedicated member of the Hastings on Hudson community, Lizabeth Liebeskind, a woman who brought art, beauty and insight to all she encountered. Lizabeth passed away on July 26, 2018 at her home surrounded by her loving family after a valiant battle with cancer. But for those who knew her, the legacy Lizabeth has left will last forever. Lizabeth graduated from Syracuse Univer-sity, BFA, and devoted her life to developing the arts in Tribeca, Woodstock, Hastings on Hudson and Brooklyn. As Co-Founder and Creative Director of 12 Miles North, Liz found-ed the wonderful ‘‘Take Me to The River Fes-tival’’ for which she was awarded a Key to the City on September 9, 2017. That day from here forth will forever be ‘‘Lizabeth Sipes- Liebeskind Day’’ in Hastings on Hudson. Liz wrote and performed plays, most recently her own one woman play about her battle with breast cancer in the Edinburgh Fringe Fes-tival. Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma to a loving family of seven, Lizabeth is survived by her mother, Beverly Sipes and siblings: Terry, John, and Scott Sipes and Marianne Brown. Liz leaves behind her beloved husband, Hank Liebeskind and her adored children, Samantha, Charlee and Lila Liebeskind. Mr. Speaker, Lizabeth was a wonderful, warm individual who did so much to better our community. Her contributions were many, as were all the different lives she touched. Lizabeth will be deeply missed, and I am hum-bled to be able to honor her legacy as a Mem-ber of Congress. LAKE FOREST DEBT FREE DAY HON. MIMI WALTERS 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 20, 2018 Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the City of Lake Forest, California, located in my con-gressional district. On October 2, 2018, the Lake Forest City Council will notify bondholders that the city in-tends to make an early repayment of a $7 mil-lion bond, the city’s only outstanding debt. The debt will be paid in full by December 2, 2018. By repaying the debt early, Lake Forest will save approximately $1 million. Those savings will allow the City to allocate additional re-sources toward various funds, such as trans-portation improvement funds and the General Fund. Lake Forest is the largest of three cities that has zero outstanding debt liability and is cur-rent in its pension payments within the Cali-fornia Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS). Following its incorporation in 1991, Lake Forest adopted a conservative fiscal manage-ment approach resulting in the substantial fi-nancial security the City enjoys today. For example, Lake Forest contracts for po-lice and fire services, and landscape and street maintenance, and rents office space for City Hall rather than issuing debt to build a Civic Center. Further, Lake Forest relies on property and sales taxes to fund its budget, rather than rely-ing on specialty taxes like automobile sales or hotel taxes, which can be unreliable sources of income. A stable income base coupled with conserv-ative spending practices allow Lake Forest to maintain a balanced budget and be debt-free. Again, I would like to congratulate Lake For-est on this achievement and applaud its fiscal responsibility.

I admire the great commitment of those dis-tinct individuals who have tirelessly devoted themselves to their country and community. Mr. Decker’s service as a Marine has spanned the globe, having completed several periods of active duty in countries including Iraq, Afghani-stan, Jordan, and Ghana. His service to the greater Kingston community, however, is un-paralleled. Through his active involvement with the Boy Scouts, the Ulster Detachment Marine Corps League, the Toys for Tots program, the King-ston Veterans Association, the Kingston Amer-ican Little League, and as a devout parish-ioner of Saint Colman’s Roman Catholic Church and member of their Buildings and Grounds Committee, Mr. Decker is an impor-tant role model for our communities, our vet-erans, and the next generation of soldiers. Being named the Veteran of the Year is a true testament to Mr. Decker’s continued leg-acy of patriotism and steadfast commitment to improving the lives of his friends, neighbors, and fellow veterans. I can think of no one more deserving of this honor. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in congratu-lating Mr. Decker on receiving this award. His lifetime of hard work and dedicated service to the United States is inspirational, and I am grateful for his contributions to New York State.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 20th Annual Labor to Labor Dinner to celebrate the activism and dedica-tion of our labor leaders, and their contribu-tions to making our community a fairer place to work. The annual labor dinner brings together members from different corners of our work-force to honor those who have demonstrated strong leadership and commitment to the inter-ests of workers. American workers owe a debt of gratitude to labor unions. Without them, we may not have a 40-hour work week, paid sick leave, child labor laws, Social Security, a min-imum wage, paid family leave, employer- based health coverage, or strong workplace safety laws. I am grateful that this annual labor dinner pays tribute to the contributions of our local workforce and their shared mission of pro-moting the rights of American workers. The hard work and sacrifice of union leaders to make all workers better off, not just union members, is commendable. I extend my appreciation to the Contra Costa AFL-CIO Labor Council and Building & Construction Trades Council, AFL-CIO for hosting this event and for their advocacy for workers in our community. Congratulations on 20 years of this wonderful event.

OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 20, 2018 Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and commemorate Corporal Alvin T. Rehmeyer on the 100th Anniversary of his death in World War I. Corporal Rehmeyer was born on September 25, 1898. When the United States entered the First World War and the call to arms sounded, Alvin Rehmeyer left his native Red Lion, Pennsylvania for training at Camp Meade, Maryland. On July 7, 1918, Rehmeyer was sent overseas, where he was assigned to the 316th Infantry Regiment of the famous ‘‘Cross of Lorraine’’ 79th Division. Soon afterwards, he and much of the Division were deployed to the front lines. On September 26, 1918, Rehmeyer was de-clared Missing In Action following an attack during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive—the largest offensive in American military history. His fate was unknown until March 20, 1919, when his gravesite was located near the town of Montfaucon, France. Corporal Rehmeyer is one of the 1,151 Soldiers of the 79th Division who gave their last full measure in defense of the United States and her allies in World War I. On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 4th District, I ask that you join me in honoring and com-memorating Corporal Alvin T. Rehmeyer on the centennial of his sacrifice; his life exempli-fied civic virtue in its greatest and noblest form. f

my colleagues to join me today in congratu-lating St. John’s faithful congregation and their ancestors on this auspicious occasion. In 1865, the New England Conference of the AME Zion Church deployed Reverend James Walker Hood to North Carolina to pro-vide spiritual guidance to the 331,000 former slaves and to establish Churches throughout the state. Among the first churches estab-lished was St. John AME Zion Church (1868). Though Hood was met with fierce opposition from white Northern Methodists in establishing AME Zion Churches, he was unwavering in his commitment to the cause of Christianity as he established dozens of Churches across North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, much of St. John’s growth over the years can be attributed to its dedi-cated leadership and congregation. After a fire destroyed the Church’s frame in 1909, the Reverend B. P. Coward led the Church in building the beautiful and stately building that the Church resides in today. Under Reverend Allen J. Kirk’s leadership, the Church erected a recreational center, started a day nursery, and renovated the parsonage. Reverend Dr. Ulysses S. Johnson is the Church’s longest serving pastor, serving the congregation for over fifteen years. Reverend Dr. Johnson led numerous renovations to the Church and served the entire community during his tenure. Reverend Staccato Powell (now Bishop Stac-cato Powell) was assigned to St. John early in his pastoral career, becoming a ministerial giant who led the Church into continued growth. His pastoral leadership became na-tionally recognized and he now serves as Pre-siding Prelate of the Western Episcopal Dis-trict. Over the years, the Church has been deeply involved in the community, providing, among many other things, daily hot lunches to senior citizens and educational enrichment to chil-dren in Wilson during the summer recess as a part of the Youth Enrichment Program. In earlier years, St. John operated a Boy Scott organization that impacted the lives of hun-dreds of young men. In recent years, the church established St. John Community Development Corporation, Inc. and the Smith Street Project to enhance the Church’s community outreach. St. John continues to meet the spiritual and physical needs of its growing congregation through the vision and devoted work of its current pastor, Dr. Charlean B. Mapson, Presiding Elder and former Pastor, Dr. Michael S. Bell, and Pre-siding Bishop the Right Reverend Dr. Kenneth Monroe. Mr. Speaker, by the grace of God, St. John AME Zion Church has been standing strong for 150 long years. Her outstanding leadership and devoted members have created significant growth in its membership and ministry, as well as, its continued outreach in the Wilson com-munity. The Church’s faithfulness and good deeds will ensure that St. John continues to experience God’s blessings for years to come. On behalf of the United States House of Representatives and the people of the First Congressional District of North Carolina, I commemorate the 150th anniversary of St. John African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church and extend my best wishes to the Pastor and members (many of whom are dear friends) on this auspicious occasion.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 20, 2018 Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate a San Diego business and civic leader, Patti Roscoe as she is honored as the 2018 ‘‘Ms. San Diego.’’ More person-ally, I rise today to congratulate a wonderful friend on her lifelong achievements in service to others. Started in 1952, this annual tribute was lim-ited only to men. It wasn’t until 40 years ago that both men and women were eligible for this honor. Patti will be the sixth woman to hold this distinction in its 66-year history. Originally from Buffalo, New York, Patti dis-covered a career in hospitality spending fifteen years in the hotel and destination manage-ment industry. Patti was the founder of PRA Destination Management Company; San Diego Rotary Club President from 2003 to 2004; board member for San Diego State Uni-versity’s Campanile Foundation, as well as the board of advisors for San Diego State Univer-sity’s Robert Payne School of Hospitality and Tourism Management, of which she was a co- founder; Plank Owner of the USS Midway; and trustee of the San Diego Library Founda-tion. This is just to name a few of her many achievements. In 2010, Patti helped create an endowment at the Institute of Meetings and Events, the first of its kind in the nation, which provides scholarships in the MFA Musical Theater grad-uate program and Hospitality & Tourism Man-agement program, as well as an endowment for student athletes. In 2015, Patti was recog-nized by the Global Society of Incentive Travel Excellence for embodying integrity and making notable contributions with long-term service to incentive travel and motivational events indus-try. In June, she received the Neil Morgan Vi-sionary Award for Lifetime Achievement from LEAD and the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce. Three organizations have rec-ognized Patti with Lifetime Achievement Awards: The San Diego Convention & Visitors Bureau, San Diego Rotary Club, and The International Special Events Industry. I commend Patti for her many accomplish-ments and contributions. A mother to three children and a grandmother to three grand-children Patti truly understands the meaning of empathy and service to the community. Patti knows how to take care of business and work overtime for the betterment of the San Diego community and beyond.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the House of Representatives to join me in recognizing Vivian Lee Battle Sims for her lifetime of work in education and for her long-standing contributions to the communities in which she has resided throughout her life. Vivian Sims was born and raised in New York City, where she graduated from Girls’ High School in Brooklyn, a highly regarded in-stitution of the public school system.

She began her career in education as an art teacher in 1950 at Nashville city schools, eventually moving on to be art supervisor for Metro Nashville Public Schools’ District 3 and Giles County’s elementary schools. She served as the first high school art teacher at Giles County High School from 1976 to 1985, as Assistant Principal for Pulaski Elementary School from 1985 to 1991 and was the first African American woman principal at South-side Elementary School before her retirement in 1997.

She also served as president of the Giles County Schools Teachers Association and on the Board of Directors for the Ten-nessee Education Association, among other national, state and local organizations. In addition to her work in public schools, Vivian Sims has always been an active mem-ber of her community. Some of these commu-nity activities include her work for Giles Coun-ty Senior Citizens, Inc., the Community Coun-cil for the Adult Developmentally Handicapped, the Community Development Corporation of North Pulsaki, Help A Talented Student (HATS), the Pulaski Boys and Girls Club and the Pulaski Area Vocational-Technical School. My pride in Vivian is also personal because she is my cousin.

Eagle Scout is the highest honor a Boy Scout can earn. The rank of Eagle Scout is the highest honor a Boy Scout can achieve.

HONORING THE 40TH ANNIVER-SARY OF UNITED STEEL-WORKERS LOCAL 8888 IN NEW-PORT NEWS, VIRGINIA 
HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 20, 2018 Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the United Steelworkers (USW) Local 8888, which represents nearly 10,000 shipbuilders at the Newport News Shipyard in Newport News, Vir-ginia. These dedicated men and women build and repair our Navy’s nuclear aircraft carriers and nuclear-powered submarines at this ship-yard, which is the largest private sector em-ployer in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The birth of this local union began with a secret ballot vote on January 31, 1978. While they received their charter from USW months later on September 15, 1978, it took the cou-rageous efforts of thousands of workers to carry forward a difficult campaign to ultimately win recognition by the shipyard. Since that time, USW Local 8888 has advanced eco-nomic progress for tens of thousands of ship-yard workers and has made the Newport News community more vibrant. The union’s advocacy has produced con-tracts over many years with higher wages, im-proved health benefits and better pensions. The USW Local 8888 contract established a health and safety committee, and created a fairer workplace by providing for wage pro-gression and a grievance and arbitration pro-cedure. The first six years following the first contract between Local 8888 and the shipyard resulted in more than a half-billion dollars in additional wages and benefits. The USW’s current 52-month collective bargaining agree-ment with Huntington Ingalls Industries—the current owner of the shipyard—will increase average wages and benefits by over $15,000 per worker. These gains did not come easily. Forty years ago, the shipyard workers had been represented by the Peninsula Shipbuilders As-sociation (PSA)—which was a small associa-tion that many workers viewed as a company union. Wages and pensions for these ship-builders were lower than those at other ship-yards in the country. Some workers were stuck in jobs that never had a pay raise. The PSA held no membership meetings, no elec-tion of shop stewards, and did not have a safety clause in its ‘‘contract.’’ Workers wanted and demanded a better deal. A group of shipyard workers reached out to the United Steelworkers to try to secure a stronger and more progressive union to rep-resent them. Known as the ‘‘front four,’’ Oscar Pretlow, Eddie Coppedge, Ellis Cofield, and WT Hayes were amongst the early organizers. The effort to build support was not easy. The company sought to terminate those who were organizing support for the USW as a way to discourage support. However, in January 1978 thousands of shipyard workers voted through a secret ballot election to affiliate with the USW. But the shipyard owner at that time—Ten-neco—refused to recognize or bargain with USW, and it joined with the PSA to challenge the validity of election before the National Labor Relations Board. These delaying tactics were intended to wear down support for the union the workers had freely chosen. A year to the day after the vote in January 1979, workers went on strike to demand rec-ognition. The strike lasted 82 days while work-ers braved the cold on picket lines outside the shipyard gates and hostile police action on the streets. ‘‘88, Close the Gate!’’ became their rallying cry during this historic strike. The ship-yard workers faced not only a deep-pocketed and determined employer, they faced a hostile Governor, and a Department of the Navy that continued to provide cashflow to the shipyard despite work coming to a halt during the strike—all while taking on this battle in a right- to-work state. Their solidarity was tested many times; how-ever, the shipyard workers received strike benefits from the USW, and many union mem-bers across Virginia and the country joined their picket lines. Ultimately, the NLRB and courts upheld the validity of the union election, and the company was obligated to bargain with USW. Local 8888 has been blessed with strong leaders over the past 40 years including presi-dents Lucky Howard, Wayne Crosby, Edward ‘‘Eddie’’ Coppedge, Russ Axsom, Ray Coppedge, Thomas Crudup, Alton Glass, Ar-nold Outlaw, and its current President Charles Spivey. The union has also not forgotten those who led the original struggle, and the USW union hall in Newport News is named after Oscar Pretlow—one of the original ‘‘front four.’’ Mr. Speaker, the sacrifices of those ship-builders who fought to have a union of their choosing in the late 1970s has borne fruit for the past 40 years and has paved the way for a brighter and safer future for those who come to work at the shipyard today. As the mem-bers of USW Local 8888 gather this weekend to celebrate the 40 years since they received their charter from USW, I want to commend and thank them for their tireless work rep-resenting the tens and thousands of ship-builders and shipyard employees at the New-port News Shipyard. Their work has bettered the lives and working conditions for these workers and their families.

More than anything else, Jim has distin-guished himself as a man with a heart for the Bakersfield community. Over the years, Jim has paid his personal successes forward, do-nating to charitable causes across Bakersfield. In particular, Jim and his wife, Beverly, ex-tended their generosity to help fund Bakers-field’s Memorial Hospital’s Grossman Burn Center. Jim has also been an active member of the Community Action Partnership of Kern (CAPK), serving the community service orga-nization in a variety of roles since 2007, the most prominent being his tenure as chairman of CAPK’s Board of Directors from 2013 to 2015. Through his work with CAPK, Jim helped to provide critical services to Kern County’s most disadvantaged, organizing and participating in events that helped to reduce poverty and meet critical needs such as edu-cation, housing, and healthcare.

He is a giver—pure and simple—a man with a heart of gold with an in-satiable desire to enrich the lives of others. That’s a rare quality to come by, and our com-munity is a better place because of Jim and his love for the people of Bakersfield. His ef-forts have measurably changed the Kern County community for the better, and one would be hard pressed to find a person wor-thier of the designation of ‘Man of the Year’ than Jim Camp.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 90th anniversary of Haylor, Freyer & Coon, a small business in my district providing insurance assistance to residents across Upstate New York. Haylor, Freyer & Coon was founded in 1928 when Barney E. Haylor and James McLusky opened a small four-person agency at the Herald Building in Syracuse, New York. Fol-lowing the passing of Mr. McLusky, Barney Haylor partnered with Clayton F. Freyer in 1946 and Douglas Coon shortly after to estab-lish the corporation that exists today. As time progressed, HF&C began to expand its pres-ence by partnering with other local agencies across the state.

Today, Haylor, Freyer & Coon remains a leader within the insurance industry of Central New York. It has also been ISO 9001 certified by the International Standards Organization, which recognizes the agency’s quality man-agement principles and its strong customer focus.

HONORING COMMUNITY CHAMPION ELIZABETH LAMPKINS 
HON. MIKE KELLY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 20, 2018 Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize one of my constituents from Western Pennsylvania, Mrs. Elizabeth Lampkins. Elizabeth has been employed with the Shenango Valley Urban League since 1974 and has served as the director of the Woman, Infants, and Children program (WIC) since 1978. Elizabeth has spent the past 44 years selflessly serving others and building a legacy that is absolutely admirable. Although her successful career is coming to an end as Elizabeth is retiring, her efforts will continue to benefit the community for years to come. Elizabeth is the beloved widow of Marion Lampkins, as well as a proud mother of three and a doting grandmother to five. In 1961, Elizabeth graduated from Choffin School of Practical Nursing and received additional cer-tification from St. Elizabeth Hospital in Youngstown, Ohio. In 1974, following a life- threatening illness, Elizabeth began volun-teering at the former Community Medical Edu-cation & Screening Center in order to help them create a program to address Sickle Cell. After just one month of volunteering, Eliza-beth was hired as a secretary and from that point forward she continuously advanced the program and her career. Elizabeth worked her way up from volunteer to secretary to coun-selor to coordinator and, ultimately, all the way to director. Being appointed as the Director of the WIC & Sickle Cell program was the start of the most rewarding endeavor of Elizabeth’s career. She proudly took on the leadership role and always maintained her focus on ‘‘service first,’’ which earned respect and ad-miration from colleagues at the Shenango Val-ley Urban League. The Shenango Valley Urban League, which is proudly celebrating their 50th anniversary, is an organization that welcomes, empowers, and encourages all citizens and provides vital services to those in need. Elizabeth is the old-est employee at the Shenango Valley Urban League in both age and tenure, and she has proudly served under every Executive Director or President since the inception of the organi-zation. Throughout her career, Elizabeth has worked tirelessly to advance the WIC program and ensure it continues to prosper and pro-vide. In every role, in every effort, Elizabeth has displayed unparalleled integrity, dignity, and strength. In addition to her loyalty to the WIC pro-gram, Elizabeth has actively participated in various civic organizations and advisory boards, making community service an integral part of her life. Elizabeth’s expertise and par-ticipation has been beneficial to the following: Prince of Peace Center, Teen Parenting Advi-sory Board, United Way Budget Panel, Minor-ity Health Advocacy Committee, Pennsylvania WIC Association, Mercer County Children & Youth Services, Mercer County Family Cen-ters, and Mercer County Comprehensive Health Planning Council. Due to her noteworthy accomplishments, Elizabeth has been honored by many, includ-ing the Shenango Valley Urban League, Na-tional Urban League, Pennsylvania Associa-tion of WIC Directors, Pennsylvania Depart-ment of Health, and the Shenango Valley Women’s Auxiliary. Furthermore, Elizabeth is an active member of the Second Baptist Church in Sharpsville where she has partici-pated in various committees, choirs, circles, and also served as financial secretary and Sunday school treasurer. In every role, in every effort, Elizabeth has been an exemplary public servant and leader. Elizabeth has been a catalyst for improve-ment throughout the community and her pas-sion and dedication deserves praise. She is a leader in the truest sense of the word and a role model for those who are privileged to know her. Elizabeth has set a standard of ex-cellence and generosity that will inspire others for generations to come and it is my honor to congratulate her on a distinguished career and a well-earned retirement. Therefore, on behalf of the 3rd Congres-sional District, the State of Pennsylvania, and this nation, I would like to express sincere gratitude and appreciation to Elizabeth Lampkins—an extraordinary individual, a noble public servant, and a true Community Cham-pion.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Gwynith (Gwyn) Green, a great Coloradan and wife, mother and grandmother. Gwyn Green was born on November 21, 1938 in New Orleans, LA. She died peacefully in her home September 12, 2018 after a long battle with ALS. She was married to her hus-band Daniel for 56 years and had four chil-dren, Laura, Kevin (Barb), Mark (Mary Ann), and Benjamin (Julie), 10 grandchildren and one great-grandchild. In 1961, Gwyn graduated from St. Mary’s College in South Bend, Indiana. She went on to receive her Master’s in Social Work from the University of Denver in 1984.

On behalf of the people of Colorado, I extend my deepest appreciation to Gwyn Green for her dedication to her community and to the people of the State of Colorado.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF CHARLES W. MEYERS, JR. 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 20, 2018 Mr. D
ESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, Leader P
ELOSI and I rise today to recognize Charles W. (Chip) Meyers, Jr. who has recently retired from UPS after 38 years of dedicated service. Chip, a native San Franciscan, began working for UPS in downtown San Francisco in 1980. Since that time, he has enjoyed a steady rise through the ranks, and since 2005 has served as a Vice President of Public Affairs, working out of the company’s Washington, D.C. office. While in California, Chip graduated from St. Ignatius College Preparatory High School, earned a Bachelor of Science degree from St. Mary’s College, and a marketing certificate from the University of California at Berkeley. Later, he earned a Masters’ of Business Ad-ministration degree from Indiana Wesleyan University. His father, Charles W. Meyers, rep-resented San Francisco, with distinction, as a member of the California General Assembly from 1948–1970. Throughout his career at UPS, Chip has held various positions of increasing responsi-bility in operations, sales, marketing, and pub-lic affairs, while living in California, Montana, Indiana, and Washington. Most recently, he served as an executive on loan to the Para-lyzed Veterans of America, continuing his life-long passion for aiding those who have served in the United States Armed Forces. Mr. Speaker, Leader P
ELOSI and I are grate-ful for the opportunity to formally acknowledge Chip Meyers’ meaningful contributions to our community and honor his service to UPS on the floor of the United States House of Rep-resentatives. Chip has carried out his profes-sional duties with the utmost integrity, profes-sionalism, sincerity, and has been a friend to all whom have encountered him on Capitol Hill throughout the past 13 years. Leader P
ELOSI  and I want to congratulate this proud son of California for his 38 years at UPS, and wish him, his wife of 29 years, Linda, and their daughters Christiana, Analisa, and Alexandra all the best in retirement.

OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 20, 2018 Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Karin Strasser Kauffman for her lifetime of environmental stewardship efforts to im-prove the quality of life for the women and children of the central coast of California. Views of the Pacific coast from Highway 1 would be less spectacular without Karin’s ef-forts. As Chair of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, Karin helped to restrict on- shore oil facility development in Monterey County and worked to ensure that breath-taking views of the Pacific remain unobscured for public enjoyment. Through the Big Sur Coastal Plan, Karin was also responsible for preventing the transfer of water out of Big Sur, thereby maintaining its verdant fields, water-ways, forests, and biodiversity. As a member of the Carmel River Watch citizen’s group, Karin’s efforts helped to create ecologically sound regulations for flood con-trol, restore the riparian corridor, and improve water quality and wildlife corridors. This work led directly to the establishment of the Mon-terey Peninsula Water Management District. As its director, Karin was deeply involved in water conservation, water reclamation, and water resource allocations for Central Coast residents, including those living in affordable housing. Under Karin’s leadership, Monterey County revised flood-way and flood plain issues relating to the Carmel River and Toro Creek, safeguarding residents from historic flood control issues. Karin is also deeply committed to women’s empowerment. Elected for the first time in 1984 and again in 1988, Karin was the second woman ever to serve on the Monterey County Board of Supervisors. She utilized her platform to appoint many other qualified women to po-sitions and committees previously controlled by men alone. For her years of public service and commitment to the advancement of wom-en’s representation, Karin was awarded the Paula Wainwright Peace and Justice Award in 2008 by the Carmel Valley Women’s Net-work—in addition to the Outstanding Political Woman of Monterey County award in 1985, Professional Woman of the Year in 1986, and the Monterey Bay Marine Sanctuary Award from the Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments in 1993. I am grateful for Karin’s dedication to serv-ice to the Central Coast and have no doubt that she is an inspiration to all who have been impacted by her work. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing Karin Strasser Kauffman’s service to the Central Coast.

CONGRATULATING YORK COLLEGE OF PENNSYLVANIA ON ITS 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. SCOTT PERRY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 20, 2018 Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I’m honored to recognize York College of Pennsylvania on its 50th Anniversary. Higher education in York County first began in 1767, when Reverend John Andrews estab-lished York County Academy to teach German immigrants English, Latin, and Greek. In 1873, the York Collegiate Institute opened its doors after generous donations from Samuel Small. The two schools merged in 1941 to form the present York College of Pennsylvania, and es-tablished its accredited Bachelor’s Degree pro-gram in 1968. Today, York College of Pennsylvania offers more than fifty baccalaureate majors in var-ious professional programs, the sciences and humanities. The College also offers Master’s programs in business, education and nursing, as well as a Doctoral program in nursing prac-tice. A faculty of 154 full-time professors edu-cates over five thousand students from across the Country. Mr. Speaker, I’m privileged to commemorate York College of Pennsylvania as it celebrates its 50th Anniversary. On behalf of a grateful community, I thank the College faculty and staff for their tireless service to the community, and their dedication to educating many gen-erations of Americans. ASHLEY LANE EARNS GIRL SCOUT GOLD AWARD HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 20, 2018 Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Ashley Lane from Clear Lake for earning her Girl Scout Gold Award. The Gold Award is the highest achievement a Girl Scout can earn. To earn this distin-guished award, Ashley had to spend at least 80 hours developing and executing a project that would benefit the community, as well as have a long-term impact on girls. For her Gold Award project, Ashley addressed the lack of permanent visual images on the walls of the Early Childhood Program (ECP) at Clear Lake Presbyterian Church. For young children, these programs could be their first time away from their home and parents and being able to see murals and colorful images on their sur-roundings will help them grow their senses and creativity. Ashley led a team to design, create and paint mini murals on each of the classroom walls. On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-sional District of Texas, congratulations again to Ashley Lane for earning her Girl Scout Gold Award. We are confident she will have contin-ued success in her future endeavors. We are very proud of her accomplishment.

IN REMEMBRANCE OF MR. DAVID MICHAEL KING 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 20, 2018 Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Mr. David Michael King of Spot-sylvania who passed away July 27, 2018. We should always recognize those who acted in the defense of our great Nation, Mr. King was a proud Vietnam veteran who loved God, his family, and his country above all else is no ex-ception. Serving during the tumultuous years of the conflict in Vietnam, Mr. King rep-resented the values that serve as hallmarks of the Vietnam generation: selfless service and sheer love of country. Only 19 years old when joining the armed forces, Mr. King spent the years 1969 to 70 patrolling the jungles of South Vietnam with the Army’s 20th Engineer Brigade. Coming in contact with Agent Orange throughout his time in Vietnam did not slow Mr. King down even after completing his Army service. Returning home, he continued to serve his community as a land surveyor for 39 years. Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me today in honoring the life of David Michael King, one that represents what makes our Nation stand out from the rest of the world, namely, dedica-tion to community, love of country, and putting oneself last when it comes to the needs of others. HONORING THE FIRST ANNUAL LEGACY RUN BY THE AMERICAN LEGION RIDERS OF POST 114 HON. JASON SMITH

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate the American Legion Riders of Post 114 in Sikeston, MO as they celebrate the completion of their first an-nual Legacy Run to benefit the Legacy Schol-arship Fund. The American Legion was chartered and in-corporated by Congress in 1919 as a patriotic veterans organization devoted to mutual help-fulness. Chartered in 1920, Post 114 em-bodies this patriotic spirit and serves an impor-tant role in the Sikeston community by spon-soring youth baseball leagues, supporting local community causes, and providing unre-lenting support to America’s servicemen and women. The American Legion created the Legacy Scholarship Fund to provide college scholar-ships to children of fallen U.S. military per-sonnel on active duty since September 11th, 2001. On June 22nd of this year, riders from Post 114 embarked on their first Legacy Run, visiting 22 cities throughout my congressional district. The efforts by these Riders will create educational opportunities for many children who would otherwise not be able to pursue a higher education. It is my great privilege to recognize the American Legion Riders and the entire Legion family before the United States House of Rep-resentatives as the organization approaches its centennial birthday next year. I celebrate the community spirit, sense of duty and pride that thrives in this patriotic organization.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 20, 2018 Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mark Behan on receiving the Henry Crandall Award. For the past six years, the Crandall Public Library has presented the Henry Crandall Award to an individual active in the community who embodies the values of loyalty, persever-ance, generosity, compassion, and civic pride. This year, the Library selected Mark Behan, a gentleman who is a staple of the Glens Falls community. Mark’s dedication to improving his community and his commitment to the Crandall Public Library is admirable. A former board member of the Crandall Public Library, Mark holds a number of posi-tions that qualify him for this award. He serves his community as the vice chairman of the Board of Governors of Glens Falls Hospital, co-vice chair of the Board of Trustees of The Hyde Collection, a member of the board of the Glens Falls Foundation, and a director of Glens Falls National Bank and Trust Co. and Arrow Financial Corp. After a career in the newspaper industry, Mark founded Behan Communications, where for 30 years he has provided public relations advice to organiza-tions in his community. His philanthropic spirit is contagious. On behalf of New York’s 21st District, I want to congratulate Mark for this well-deserved award, and thank him for his tireless commit-ment to making his community a better place to live.

HONORING THE LIFE OF BRIAN LEWINSTEIN

OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 20, 2018 Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, it is with great sadness that I rise in remem-brance of Brian Lewinstein, who served as an intern in my district office from December 2015 to March 2016. Brian was a bright young man who assisted my office’s casework oper-ations, conducted research for my staff and helped organize a constituent issue survey for thousands of my constituents. Brian planned to devote his life to social jus-tice, equality, and civil rights. He graduated magna cum laude from the University of Cali-fornia, Los Angeles and would have started his second year at UC Berkeley School of Law this fall. After interning in my district office, Brian went on to intern at the Congressional Management Foundation in Washington, DC. Brian also worked as an intern in juvenile de-fense at the East Bay Community Law Center in Berkeley helping at-risk youth; he hoped to start a career in public interest law helping people in underserved communities. Everyone in my district office who worked with him spoke of his intelligence, work ethic, and professionalism, in addition to those who knew him outside the office for his sensitivity, compassion, and humility. His efforts helped ensure that my constituents received assist-ance from federal agencies and helped me hear directly from them about their policy pri-orities. Brian is survived by his parents, Marc Lewinstein and Felicia Lewinstein, and his sis-ter, Jenna Lewinstein, who was his first and biggest fan. I want to thank Brian for his serv-ice to California’s 33rd Congressional District and commitment to making our society more equal and just. Though Brian was taken from us too soon, I hope that his family is com-forted in knowing that Brian made a difference in his community helping those in need. May he rest in peace. f 
INTRODUCTION OF THE NATIONAL VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION PROGRAM IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2018 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 20, 2018 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I intro-duce the National Vaccine Injury Compensa-tion Program Improvement Act of 2018. This bill would further encourage the development of important vaccines by doubling the max-imum number of special masters the Court of Federal Claims can assign to vaccine cases. Vaccines are a vitally important component of our public health system. The National Vac-cine Injury Compensation Program (‘‘Pro-gram’’) was created by Congress in 1988 so that individuals or families of individuals in-jured by childhood vaccines could receive fi-nancial compensation. This ‘‘no-fault’’ system caps the amount of compensation allowed under the Program for vaccine-related injuries, thus meeting the dual goals of encouraging the further development of vaccines and com-pensating anyone who is injured by them. The Program was also designed to accel-erate the compensation process so that plain-tiffs would not have to undergo a full trial be-fore receiving damages that could potentially be used to address their injuries. However, as the number of vaccines covered under the Program has increased, so, too, has the num-ber of cases brought before the court and the special masters. The number of petitions filed has increased from 24 in fiscal year 1988 to 1,120 in fiscal year 2016. Congress capped the number of special masters at eight when it first authorized the Program, and has not increased it since, de-spite the increased number of covered vac-cines and petitions filed. To meet the demand caused by the increased number of these complex cases, my bill would increase the maximum number of special masters allowed to 16. Moreover, the court may reduce the number of special masters should the number of cases drop, as this is a statutory ceiling, not a floor. This is an important measure to ensure compensation when necessary and further im-portant medical development. I urge my col-leagues to support this bill. f

For 19 years, the Business Record has un-dertaken an exhaustive annual review to iden-tify a standout group of women who have made a significant difference in business, civic, and philanthropic endeavours throughout the Greater Des Moines Area. Teri Wahlig has committed her life to serv-ing others. She started her career as a neonatologist at Mercy Medical Center and began to volunteer with ChildServe after learn-ing of the company’s mission of serving chil-dren with unique medical treatment needs. Ac-cording to Business Record, ‘‘[ChildServe] aligned with her personal goals of caring for each families’ spirit, as well as their child’s physical treatment.’’ Dr. Wahlig’s passion lead her to become ChildServe’s first full-time med-ical director in 2011. On July 1st, she became the company’s CEO. Teri Wahlig’s passion to serve extends be-yond her work in medicine. She continues to serve as chairwoman of the YMCA Board of Directors.

CHINA CAMP VILLAGE 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 20, 2018 Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in rec-ognition of the 150th anniversary of China Camp Village. Welcoming more than 260,000 visitors each year to its 1,500 acres of park-land, natural resources, and recreation areas, China Camp is an important part of the Bay Area’s past, present, and future. One of a few fishing villages in the San Pablo Bay in the mid-1800s, China Camp was home to thousands of Chinese American im-migrants who came to work at newly built dairy ranches and brick manufacturing plants in the area, while continuing to fish for income and for their families. China Camp Village still maintains a 300-foot wooden pier and several wooden homes where the former Chinese fishing camp once stood, preserving the area’s rich and diverse history. As fresh water was diverted from rivers that entered San Pablo Bay, it became too salty for shrimping. China Camp transitioned to a state park in 1977 when a developer donated the 36-acre village as a living memorial to the important Chinese American history it rep-resents. Years later, the Friends of China Camp helped save the park when it was threatened for closure during a state funding crisis. In 2011, I authored legislation, Assem-bly Bill 42, to allow California state parks to be managed by non-profit operators. The bill was approved and signed into law, and the Friends of China Camp entered an agreement with California State Parks to manage China Camp. Today, China Camp is still operated by the Friends of China Camp, a non-profit organiza-tion comprised of dedicated staff and volun-teers, who are hard at work to increase camp-grounds and picnic sites and expand interpre-tive programs for visitors while also attracting the community to engage in protecting its im-portant natural and cultural resources. In keeping with its past, China Camp con-tinues to evolve and grow with changing times and the environment. Mr. Speaker, it is there-fore appropriate that we stand together today, in celebration of 150 years of China Camp Vil-lage, as a living tribute to the Bay Area’s his-tory and future. f

The Chaplin’s work with the Emergency Ministries Service Church and Garcia Trail Rider moves and inspires all of us. The Emer-gency Ministries Service Church provides food, preaches to the youth, gives the home-less a nice, warm place to rest for the night and much more. Chaplin Garcia also led a trail ride to benefit a Vietnam veteran battling can-cer and has an upcoming trail ride to benefit St. Jude’s.

They celebrated their anniversary on September 7, 2018. Bonnie and Ed’s lifelong commitment to each other truly embodies our Iowa values. As they reflect on their 50th anniversary, may their commitment grow even stronger, as they continue to love, cherish, and honor one an-other for many years to come. Mr. Speaker, I commend this great couple on their 50th year together and I wish them many more. I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating Bonnie and Ed Davidson on this meaningful occasion and in wishing them both nothing but continued happiness. f 
IN RECOGNITION OF MS. VIRGINIA ANN SANDERS 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 20, 2018 Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Mrs. Virginia Ann Sanders, a re-markable volunteer, public servant, and out-spoken advocate of those less fortunate both in our community and around the world. For her incredible service to the causes to which she has given so much of herself, Ann has been awarded title of Kentucky Colonel in 2001, the Silver and Gold President’s Volun-teer Service Awards in 2012 and 2011, re-spectively, and the President’s Lifetime Achievement Volunteer Service Award in 2017, far exceeding the 4,000-hour require-ment of service hours. A small number of the organizations and individuals she has donated her crafting or clowning skills, her time, or her resources to are: Clowns of America Inter-national; Kolonial Klowns of Williamsburg, Alley No. 357; Rainy Day Kids, LLC.; the Hu-mane Society; the Salvation Army; Sgt. Santa, Inc.; Camp Sunlight for children with Xeroderma Pigmentosum; Operation Christ-mas Child; the Special Olympics at the Univer-sity of Richmond; American Red Cross; the children of Haiti; Samaritan’s Purse; numerous fundraiser walks; Stonehouse Preschool; and Menokin Baptist, Church of the Good Shep-herd, Jamieson Memorial United Methodist, and Buffalo Baptist Church. Ann is also a breast cancer survivor. With a career spanning 30 years, Ann has also worked for the Depart-ment of Defense at Dahlgren and Fort Lee as well as the U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service in Richmond. Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me in recog-nizing the work of Ann Sanders; words cannot capture the amount of time, energy, and emo-tion Ann has devoted to volunteer efforts throughout her life as well as in service to our country throughout her career. The greatest way to express the overwhelming gratitude of our community is simply, ‘‘thank you.’’

CONGRATULATING T EKYLAH SIMP-SON ON HER ACCEPTANCE TO CULINARY SCHOOL 
HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 20, 2018 Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate TeKylah Simpson for being ac-cepted into the Auguste Escoffier School of Culinary Arts in Austin. TeKylah, a senior at Stafford High School, enrolled in Chef Courtney Ralls’ Culinary Pro-gram as a sophomore. Through the program, Simpson became the first in her family to trav-el outside of the United States when she went to Italy; next summer she will go to Spain. Her skills have developed and earned her a spot at the Culinary school. She is incredibly driven and one day hopes to open her own bakery. On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-sional District of Texas, congratulations again to TeKylah Simpson for being accepted into the Auguste Escoffier School of Culinary Arts in Austin. We know that she will reflect the hard work and values of her community through her academics, and wish her the best of luck. f 
107TH NATIONAL DAY OF THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 20, 2018 Mr. BANKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 107th National Day of the Republic of China. National Day, known as 10–10, commemorates the Wuchang Upris-ing of 1911 and the revolution that followed. The Wuchang Uprising was the first event in a monumental revolution that reshaped China. Dr. Sun Yatsen led the Chinese nationalists to victory and went on to create a republic grounded in the same principles as our own. Today, the National Day of the Republic of China is the celebration of a free and demo-cratic Republic of China. Taiwan is a global leader in commerce, technology and innova-tion and has helped power the technological revolution of the 21st century. Over the last 107 years, the United States has developed deep connections with the Republic of China. The Republic of China has been a steadfast ally of the United States, assisting operations in World War II and Vietnam. At a time of in-creasing strategic competition, the FY 19 NDAA passed by this Congress seeks to in-crease our strong ties with Taiwan by increas-ing security cooperation. Trade is an additional area of cooperation between the United States and the Republic of China. In fact, Taiwan is one of the largest markets for soybeans grown in northeast Indiana. I wish the people of the Republic of China a happy 107th National Day, and I know that the bonds of friendship between us will con-tinue to flourish.
