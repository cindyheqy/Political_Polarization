IN MEMORIAM, DR. MARY JO FRANCO FRENCH, MD, JANUARY 4, 1936–DECEMBER 31, 2015 
HON. KYRSTEN SINEMA 
OF ARIZONA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, January 25, 2016 Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Dr. Mary Jo Franco French, M.D., (Mary Jo), who passed away on December 31, 2015. A native Phoenician, Mary Jo was a revered leader in the Latino community, whose imprint on the city touched a countless number of people. She was the daughter of the Mexican Consul to Arizona, attended Xa-vier College Prep, ASU and medical school in Mexico City. From 1970–1980, Mary Jo was the editor of El Sol, the first Phoenix Spanish newspaper, which her parents launched in the 1930’s. Mary Jo served on the Board of Direc-tors of Alma de la Gente, the El Mirage Diabe-tes Coalition, Vesta Club, and Friends of Mexi-can Art. As the Executive Director of Hispanic Health Coalition, Mary Jo addressed critical health issues confronting the Valley’s Latino families. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan ap-pointed Mary Jo to the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services (DACOWITS). As an Honorary General, Mary Jo met with service women throughout the world, discussing the challenges faced by our enlisted women. Mary Jo chaired the Veterans Day Parade and the Grand Army Ball; in 1988 she received the George Washington Award for distinguished civil service. For her years of leadership, Valle del Sol honored Mary Jo with the Profiles of Success Award in 1994. She was a principal strategist behind Pope John Paul II’s visit to Phoenix in 1987. Above all else, Mary Jo was Alfred’s wife for over 43 years, she was mother to Laura and Alfred Jr. and grandmother to Maya and Aran. Members, please join me in extending condo-lences to the Franco French family, as they mourn the loss of Mary Jo, an iconic woman, trailblazer and role model and who will be dearly missed and fondly remembered by all whose lives were made better because of her. THE PASSING OF ASHLEY GAMMON HON. KAREN BASS 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, January 25, 2016 Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I learned of the passing of Ashley Gammon, who served on my staff as my com-munications director before moving back to her home town of St. Louis, Missouri, most re-cently serving as the director of communica-tions for the United Way of Greater St. Louis. Like many of her generation, Ashley signed up to work on President Obama’s first presi-dential campaign in 2008, and she believed that she could truly make a difference. And she did make a difference, both at the Depart-ment of Housing and Urban Development and in my own office on Capitol Hill helping to keep my constituents informed and continuing to promote the Democratic agenda. I was most struck by how much she touched and stayed in touch with her former friends and colleagues in Washington. It is clear that her passing affected everyone very deeply. I will remember Ashley both for her tireless work and for her sweet and bright smile. She brought people together and was a true friend in life as is evident in the out-pouring of sympathy in the Capitol Hill com-munity. I join Ashley’s friends and family in mourning her loss and celebrating a wonderful young woman who was taken from us too early.

RECOGNIZING THE OUTSTANDING SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY OF TACOMA OF LINCOLN HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER NATHAN GIBBS-BOWLING 
HON. DEREK KILMER 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, January 25, 2016 Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Nathan Gibbs-Bowling of Tacoma, WA. Mr. Gibbs-Bowling has been an intrepid leader in the Tacoma community, where he grew up, through his excellent instruction of AP Government and Human Geography at Lincoln High School. I am proud to offer my sincere congratula-tions on behalf of my district’s constituency to Mr. Gibbs-Bowling for the recent announce-ment of his selection as a finalist for this year’s National Teacher of the Year Award of-fered by the Council of Chief State School Of-ficers. For 10 years Nathan has exceeded expec-tations as an instructor and has become known as the ‘‘cheerleader, college professor, and drill sergeant’’ for Lincoln High’s student population. His dedication to his craft and his student’s success has set him apart more than once in recent years. Mr. Gibbs-Bowling has already received ac-colades for his teaching. He received the Washington State Milken Foundation Educator Award for 2013, and was named the Wash-ington State Teacher of the Year by the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction in 2015. Yet, if you ask him, he will insist that he is not even the best teacher in his own house-hold—his wife Hope also teaches at the high school. Mr. Speaker, I have had the pleasure of at-tending Nathan’s classroom to visit with his students. He has consistently impressed me with his control of the classroom and the re-spect that his students show him—it’s clear that he is loved and appreciated within the halls of Lincoln High. Nathan’s service extends to efforts outside of the classroom, as well. He is the co-founder of the school’s Professional Leadership Devel-opment Team, has created Teachers United— a research and advocacy group that engages with local community leaders and elected offi-cials on important issues—and has helped de-velop curriculum on both Tacoma and Wash-ington State history. Mr. Speaker, it is truly an honor to represent a man of this caliber here in our nation’s cap-ital. I am truly humbled to be able to speak in recognition of the many achievements of Na-than Gibbs-Bowling today in the United States Congress. f 
FOIA OVERSIGHT AND IMPLEMENTATION ACT OF 2015 
SPEECH OF  
HON. JODY B. HICE 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, January 11, 2016 Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and I rise in support of the FOIA Oversight and Implemen-tation Act. The Freedom of Information Act enables in-dividual citizens to request records and infor-mation from federal agencies, and is therefore one of the greatest tools available to the pub-lic to ensure accountability and transparency. President Obama promised the American people that his administration would have an unprecedented level of openness. Unfortu-nately, the President has failed to deliver on his promise. Mr. Speaker, the House Oversight and Gov-ernment Reform Committee released a report today that found a dysfunctional and ambig-uous FOIA system. To quote from the report, ‘‘The FOIA process is broken. Unnecessary complications, misapplication of the law, and extensive delays are common occurrences.’’ H.R. 653 will make great strides in cor-recting, protecting, and ultimately strength-ening FOIA by providing greater disclosure of records and encouraging greater federal agen-cy compliance. Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 653.

FUTURE LEGISLATORS: BRAINERD HIGH SCHOOL YOUTH IN GOV-ERNMENT CLUB 
HON. RICHARD M. NOLAN 
OF MINNESOTA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, January 25, 2016 Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the students in the Youth in Govern-ment Club at Brainerd High School (BHS). Last week thirteen students in the club: Alison Jones, Sean Paulus, Thea Fisher, Ellen Hick-man, Alyssa Neistadt, Emma Anderson, Nick Ashman, Rachel Cleveland, Marina Cruz, Caleb Meyer, Anthony Rice, Lillian Schmitz, and Claire Waltion participated in a four-day assembly at the state Capitol in St. Paul. During the assembly students from across Minnesota assumed roles of state legislators, executive branch staffers, lobbyists, and polit-ical reporters. Students then dealt with bills on topical issues such as: stricter sentences for drunk drivers, ratification of the Kyoto Pro-tocol, and changes to state curriculum require-ments for public secondary schools. I would also like to recognize Amy Aho, the club’s faculty advisor for all her hard work co-ordinating the club’s participation in the as-sembly. As a teacher myself I admire her pas-sion for helping her students pursue their in-terest in public policy. Amy’s participation al-lowed students to take part in a unique, valu-able, hands-on experience which will help them to become our future leaders. The Youth in Government Club at BHS gives students experience in how government works and an opportunity to learn more about the legislative process. Their level of interest and engagement is very impressive and I would not be at all surprised to see any of them representing Minnesota in Congress one day.

HON. JODY B. HICE 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, January 11, 2016 Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and I rise in support of the Taxpayers Right-to-Know Act. H.R. 598 is a bipartisan, common-sense, piece of legislation that makes a critical step towards increased government transparency and accountability. This bill will give the American public a com-plete picture of how their taxpayer dollars are being spent by requiring each federal agency to provide an annual report detailing the costs of every program. Hardworking taxpayers have a fundamental right to know where and how their money is being spent. By passing H.R. 598, these re-ports will be made available online, and Amer-icans will be able to see first-hand which fed-eral programs are working well, and which are wasteful and duplicative. Americans deserve an efficient and effective federal government, and I firmly believe this legislation will make strides toward that end. Mr. Speaker, I was pleased to support this legislation in the House Oversight and Gov-ernment Reform Committee and I am proud to do so again. I urge all my colleagues to sup-port H.R. 598.

PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUB-MITTED BY THE CORPS OF ENGI-NEERS AND THE ENVIRON-MENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 
SPEECH OF  
HON. ROD BLUM 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Wednesday, January 13, 2016 Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in sup-port of the Senate resolution S.J. Res. 22, in-troduced by my good friend and colleague from Iowa, Senator E
RNST , to express my dis-approval of the Environmental Protection Agency power grab through an expansive defi-nition of the Waters of the United States (WOTUS). The WOTUS rule gives more control to fed-eral agencies, like the EPA and the Army Corp of Engineers, while stripping authority from those who know our natural resources best such as farmers, ranchers, and state reg-ulatory authorities. This is in direct contradic-tion of state laws, Supreme Court rulings, and existing compact agreements and has poten-tially devastasting consequences on our econ-omy, our farmers, and the small businesses that create jobs in the First District of Iowa. I know the farmers and small businesses in my district do not want the heavy hand of Washington micromanaging their lands—espe-cially without input from the state of Iowa. President Obama and the EPA must realize increasing regulatory burdens and compliance costs will fail to improve the water quality while only adding red tape for ordinary folks. Last year I voted for H.R. 1732, the Regu-latory Integrity Protection Act and I intend to vote again for S.J. Res. 22 to protect Iowa’s land, water and resources and to stop the ex-ecutive overreach of the suffocating Obama Administration. f
