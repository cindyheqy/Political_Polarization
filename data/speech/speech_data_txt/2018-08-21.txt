RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER  
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. H
YDE-SMITH). The majority leader is recognized. 
CLEAN AIR  
Mr. M CCONNELL. Madam President, the Obama administration’s so-called Clean Power Plan offered a typical story from that era, an innocent-seem-ing name, a pleasant-sounding objec-tive, but underneath, an intrusive reg-ulatory regime built not on effective policy but on far-left ideology. That is why I am so grateful today that the Trump administration is unveiling its plan to pare back this unfair, unwork-able, and likely illegal policy. Remember, the far left tried to push through radical legislation like an en-ergy tax through the last Congress. Well, enough of us knew it would have hurt American competitiveness, vic-timized the poor, and done little to ac-tually give the American people a cleaner environment, but instead of learning from those failures, the Obama administration tried to go it alone and impose their radical agenda unilaterally. The so-called Clean Power Plan they dreamed up would have had no mean-ingful effect on global emissions. It would, however, have packed up mid-dle-class American jobs and sent them right overseas. It would have piled a heavier burden onto the most vulner-able families. Lower income Americans are hit the hardest when energy costs take off, and this plan was projected to yield double-digit percentage increases in electricity costs of 40 States, of course, including Kentucky. Unfair, ineffective, unaffordable, more than likely illegal. That is quite the pedigree. That is why I fought the Obama ad-ministration’s entire War on Coal, which was centered around this regula-tion, tooth and nail. I submitted an amicus brief to the courts when this was challenged for exceeding the scope and intent of the Clean Air Act. I championed legislation to cancel it en-tirely. On two occasions, I wrote to every Governor in the Nation asking them to not be complicit in imple-menting this outrageous overreach until the courts had ruled on its legal-ity. My colleagues and I have been at this for quite some time. That is why the President’s actions today are so encouraging. Today’s pro-posed rule is the first step in the proc-ess. I look forward to engaging in this process as it moves forward toward a better outcome for Kentucky and for the entire country. 
APPROPRIATIONS  
Madam President, on another mat-ter, the Senate is considering the eighth and ninth of 12 appropriations measure for fiscal year 2019. They will deliver on most of the important prom-ises we make to the American people. First and foremost is our promise to defend the Nation and to meet our obli-gation to the brave men and women who do so, to ensure that if we send them into battle, they will be prepared and equipped to prevail.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5734 August 21, 2018 
Secretary Mattis and our Nation’s top military commanders have made their assessments perfectly clear. Our security and our interests are chal-lenged every day across the globe by a wide array of threats, whether nation states or terrorist groups. They include the destabilizing influences of Iran in the Middle East and Russia in Eastern Europe, the challenges we face on the Korean Peninsula, the security of our allies, and the stability of inter-national commerce in the Pacific. Our leaders have outlined the threats we face and the strategies it will take to check them, but they have also ex-plained how the past decade’s pattern of inconsistent and insufficient funding undermined readiness and borrowed from the future. This Congress and this President are determined to right the ship. Earlier this year, we did away with the arbitrary spending caps that had cut our military readiness and mod-ernization. We passed a defense bill that authorized the largest year-on- year increases in defense spending in 15 years. This week, we have the oppor-tunity to follow through by appro-priating the necessary resources. The Defense appropriations measure before us will support American mili-tary installations at home and abroad. My fellow Kentuckians and I are more than proud to host installations like Fort Campbell, Fort Knox, and the Blue Grass Army Depot. This legisla-tion supports the most important work that goes on at those facilities and the communities that revolve around them. Each of my colleagues, I am sure, can offer similar reports of the resources directed to military operations in their States. Whether they are serving at sea or training with the 101st Airborne Divi-sion in Kentucky, our Nation’s men and women in uniform will receive some well-deserved benefits from the legislation we are considering today. That includes expanded access to onbase services for veterans, billions in new funding for housing, support infra-structure, child and health services, and the largest pay raise for our mili-tary personnel in nearly a decade. It is impossible to put a price on the sacrifices warfighters—and their fami-lies—make in service to our Nation, but it is within our power to give them the support they deserve on behalf of a grateful nation, and that is precisely what this legislation will do. I thank Senator S
HELBY and Senator D
URBIN , who led this bill through the subcommittee process. I urge my col-leagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan measure when the time comes to pass it. 
ECONOMIC GROWTH  
Madam President, on one final mat-ter, our servicemembers will not be the only Americans who will be receiving well-deserved pay increases. As Repub-licans’ pro-opportunity agenda con-tinues to take hold, our economy con-tinues to steam ahead, and working families across the country are reaping the benefits. By now, we are all familiar with the fact that millions of American workers have received special bonuses, wage in-creases, or other new benefits from their employers as a direct result of our Nation’s new Tax Code. We are talking about nationwide employers from AT&T to Walmart, and local busi-nesses from Glier’s Meats in my home State of Kentucky to Stricks Ag in Montana, and New Hudson Facades in Pennsylvania. These are, in some cases, the multithousand-dollar bo-nuses that my friends, the Democratic leaders in the House and in the Senate, tried to shrug off as ‘‘crumbs’’—maybe in New York or San Francisco but not much anywhere else. Remember, they persuaded every one of our Democratic colleagues to vote against tax cuts. Well, the Bureau of Labor Statistics recently found the Employment Cost Index—that is everything American employers spend on employee wages and benefits—has increased 2.8 percent in the last 12 months alone. As CNBC reported, that is the strongest year- over-year growth since the autumn of 2008. So let me say that again. By this measure, on Republicans’ watch, work-er pay and benefits has already logged a faster 12-month growth rate than we ever achieved in all of President Obama’s time in office. It is yet another data point: Amer-ican workers, job creators, and middle- class families are enjoying one of their best economic moments in a long time, and it is thanks, in part, to Repub-licans’ economic agenda, which is get-ting Washington’s foot off the brake. I am proud this week’s appropria-tions bill will give American service-members a raise. I am also proud our healthy economy is giving a raise to millions more Americans, and Repub-lican policies are helping to make that happen. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip. DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS  
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, pending before the U.S. Senate today are two of the biggest appropriations bills we will consider this year. As Sen-ator M
CCONNELL , the Republican lead-er, mentioned, they are the eighth and ninth bills we will pass. One of those bills I have had a direct interest in as the ranking Democrat on the Defense Appropriations Sub-committee. We are about to break a record. This spending bill for the De-partment of Defense is one of the larg-est increases we have seen in any given year. This bill is $607 billion for day-to- day operations of the Department of Defense and another $68 billion for something known as Overseas Contin-gency Operations, which is just an-other category of spending. This one bill—one bill of the Department of De-fense—comprises 49 percent of all of discretionary spending of the Govern-ment of the United States of America. Almost half of our discretionary budg-et is going to be spent in this bill. Ac-companying it is the bill on health and education, which is the second largest appropriations bill we consider. So be-tween the two of these bills, we are talking about a massive government expenditure. Let’s reflect on that expenditure for a moment. There is no replacement for a strong national defense, but we should ask ourselves why. Why does it cost the American taxpayer so much to defend America? The last budget deal, under which we are working here, provided a near- record increase for the Department of Defense. Going back almost 50 years, you can only find two or three other increases comparable. We are talking about a massive expenditure and a sub-stantial, historic increase in the De-partment of Defense. Why? Because we face enemies in this world. I am not naive about that. I be-lieve it. When it comes to superpowers threatening us, at the top of the list is Russia, and second on the list is China. How much do they spend, when it comes to the defense budgets of those two countries—our two hard targets, the most threatening nations when it comes to the United States? That is where you have to step back and shake your head and say that can’t be true. But it is true. The Russian defense budget from 2017 to 2018 is $78 billion. Remember my earlier figures? We are going to be spending $700 billion, and their annual budget is $78 billion. How can there be such a disparity? Some people have argued that it is be-cause of the accounting methods. It is the fact that Russian soldiers are paid dirt wages and ours, thank goodness, are paid just compensation and are given benefits. I accept all of that, but it still doesn’t explain an almost 10-to- 1 ratio of spending in the United States against spending in Russia. What about China? There is another nation that we are worried about in terms of our national defense. China is believed to spend about $175 billion a year, about one-fourth of our total de-fense spending. Here is Russia spending about 10 per-cent of our defense spending, and we are concerned about the threat they pose to the United States and our al-lies. Here is China spending one-fourth of what we do, and we worry about their expanded roles in places like the Pacific. What is baffling about that compari-son is that we spend so much more than our major adversaries in the world. Yet many experts testify over and over before congressional commit-tees that we are falling behind in the development of key technologies— technologies like satellites, artificial intelligence, hypersonic missiles, and quantum computing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5735 August 21, 2018 
It doesn’t stand to reason that the United States of America, with all of its strength and all of its innovation and all of its ingenuity, is being chal-lenged in the world by countries that are spending a fraction of what we spend. The conclusion is obvious. Our large increase of military spending calls for more accountability on how these funds are being spent. I voted for Sec-retary Mattis. I respect him very much, not only for his service to our country as a General in the U.S. Ma-rine Corps but also as our Secretary of Defense. Thank goodness he is on the job. I have a lot of faith in him, and I believe he has a steady hand in an ad-ministration where there aren’t too many steady hands. In March, Secretary Mattis sent a memo to every member of the Depart-ment of Defense, and here was the title: ‘‘Be Peerless Stewards of the Taxpayers’ Dollars.’’ I have had the op-portunity on two or three occasions to have direct conversations with Sec-retary Mattis about my concern that we are dramatically increasing Amer-ican spending over our adversaries and still we believe they have a competi-tive edge or a near-competitive edge in many critical areas. Secretary Mattis correctly assessed in this report that the Pentagon needs a culture of per-formance and accountability in order to increase the trust and confidence that not only Congress but especially the American taxpayer places in his team. We also have a procurement system— a purchasing system—that sadly en-courages poor behavior and poor re-sults. I asked Dr. Michael Griffin, the top research and development official in the Department of Defense: Why do we spend so much more in the United States and continue to fall behind? He said that many members of the Department of Defense are afraid to be the last to say yes to a program that may not succeed. Too many decisions are pushed up the bureaucratic ladder to higher levels, which strangles these programs in redtape and delays them even more. If something goes wrong, failures are the subject of heated con-gressional hearings. We have seen that over and over—from $20,000 toilet seats and similar scandals in the past. I agree with Dr. Griffin’s findings. The Department of Defense needs to do so much more to change the culture of accountability at that agency. We need to establish a new spirit of trans-parency. Right now, every weapon sys-tem—every single one of them—is sold to Congress with a rosy scenario: tech-nological breakthroughs at a modest cost. There is no difference between the sales pitch on a program that is easy to develop and one that is a giant risk. The Department of Defense needs to be more upfront and more candid with what can go wrong and what will hap-pen if something does go wrong. Very often, the contentious hearings that Dr. Griffin spoke about are not the re-sult of a failed test but a broken prom-ise. While the Pentagon has much work ahead of it to improve its account-ability, the world does stand still. The Defense appropriations bill before the Senate makes major investments and innovation, and these are critical to our servicemembers, their families, and to the defense of our Nation. In this bill there is $95.1 billion in re-search and development spending. Re-member, the total budget is almost $700 billion, and $95.1 billion goes for R&D. This is the highest level of R&D funding in programs in the history of the Department of Defense, even when adjusted for inflation, and I support it. The increases provided by the com-mittee will include major investments in areas that are challenging and prom-ising at the same time: artificial intel-ligence, satellite technologies, and basic research. In addition, the bill pro-vides $1.8 billion, just a small propor-tion of the total budget, and that money goes to medical research. That is a 5-percent increase over last year’s spending. This DOD research is just a fraction of what is invested at the Na-tional Institutes of Health, which I will address in a moment, that resulted in breakthroughs ranging from breast cancer treatments to battlefield med-ical care. Our soldiers, sailors, marines, mem-bers of the Coast Guard, and airmen are surviving in battle because of this research at the Department of Defense. It is money well spent. With all of the valuable investments that are included in this bill, I want to especially thank Chairman R
ICHARD  S
HELBY , of Alabama, for all of his work on this bill. It has been a real joy to work with him. We have disagreed on a few things—don’t get me wrong—and I am sure we will continue to do so, but we have known one another for many years. We respect one another, and we are determined that this critical bill is going to be part of the success report that comes out of the Senate as we break for the Labor Day recess. Chairman S
HELBY has been receptive to many suggestions and comments, and I have tried to do the same when he has made some ideas a part of his proposal in this bill. I want to com-mend him for all of his work to get the appropriations process on track, not just on this bill but on the others as well. We stand a real chance in the Senate of sending most appropriations bills to the President before the end of the fiscal year the last day of Sep-tember—a feat that has not been ac-complished for the defense budget in 10 years. To Chairman S
HELBY ’s great credit, he understands that moving this De-fense appropriations bill along also means moving other appropriations bills with it. While there may be tough votes coming up, we have come a long way to reestablish regular order in the last few months, and I am happy to be a part of this bipartisan solution. I hope the House will come back soon and join us in this effort. We would love to see them again. Now, let me say a word about the other appropriations bill that is part of our package on the floor. This bill, the Labor-HHS-Education bill, includes funding for the National Institutes of Health. For the past 6 years, I have made this the focal point of my work here in the Senate. I don’t take par-ticular credit for the results, but I have done my darndest to encourage my col-leagues on both sides of the aisle to make this a priority, and I am happy to report they have. For the fourth year in a row, Con-gress is on track to provide the Na-tional Institutes of Health with fund-ing increases of at least 5 percent in real growth—a $2 billion increase in this bill. In the fiscal year 2019 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Edu-cation appropriations bill before the Senate, we will help to ensure that our Nation’s best and brightest medical re-searchers have the funding they need to conduct research on the diseases and conditions that impact every single American. NIH researchers are currently trying to develop cures for cancer, to figure out developments to delay or prevent the threat of Alzheimer’s, and to help better those living with heart disease or diabetes. Between 2010 and 2016, the Food and Drug Administration approved 210 new drugs in that 6-year period of time for treatments in the United States. Every single one of these new drugs was de-veloped with funding by the National Institutes of Health. I hope, as we move forward to con-ference with the House on this bill, that we can include at least a 5-percent funding increase for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as other agencies that allow America to literally lead the world in medical innovation. This bill provides $3.7 billion for the prevention and treatment of the scourge of opioid addiction. It will help our Federal agencies to respond better to this ongoing public health chal-lenge. It includes provisions I re-quested to help the CDC address the toll of violence in the city of Chicago and assist with the Legionnaires’ dis-ease outbreak in Quincy, IL. It rejects President Trump’s efforts to slash the Federal-Work Study Program and in-cludes an increase in the maximum Pell grant of $100. It includes $5 million for the Open Textbooks Pilot Program, helping college students across Amer-ica with the exploding cost of higher education. It is a good bill, and I want to com-mend Senator P
ATTY MURRAY of Wash-ington, the Democrat, and Senator R
OY B
LUNT of Missouri, the Republican, for crafting the bipartisan fiscal year 2019 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill. I do think we should be addressing the sky-rocketing drug costs that every single

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5736 August 21, 2018 
American is well aware of. It is some-thing we all talk about, but the under-lying bill doesn’t address it. I filed a bi-partisan amendment with my friend and colleague from Iowa, Republican Senator C
HUCK GRASSLEY , to improve price transparency and direct-to-con-sumer drug advertising. If I ask you whether you have seen any ads for drugs on television and you answer no, then, I know automatically that you don’t own a television because the average American sees a drug ad-vertisement about nine times a day. Why do the drug companies spend so much money advertising on television in the United States? Doesn’t every other country do the same? No. It turns out that the United States and New Zealand are the only two coun-tries that allow pharma, drug compa-nies, to advertise their products on tel-evision directly to consumers. Why would pharma spend $6 billion a year on advertising so many different ways for Americans to buy these drugs? Because it is profitable. Americans, fi-nally, after the fifth, sixth, seventh, or eighth time they have seen it can not only pronounce but even spell Xarelto. When they go to the doctor’s office, they say: Doctor, maybe I need a little different blood thinner; maybe I need Xarelto. Xarelto turns out to be the brand name of a very expensive prescription drug. What about the drug Humira? How many ads have you seen for the drug Humira? You can’t escape them. It is the most advertised treatment on tele-vision. Humira was designed to deal with rheumatoid arthritis, a very seri-ous illness that many Americans face. Then, they found out that Humira might have some value when it comes to something called psoriasis. What is psoriasis? It is the red patch on my elbow. They said: You know, you ought to consider Humira to deal with psoriasis. Here is a Humira ad. Here is the one thing they don’t disclose about Humira on the ad. It costs $5,500 a month. I would like to have perfect skin on my elbow—but at a cost of $5,500 per month? Would you think twice about asking for this drug from your doctor if you knew that it was going to cost this much? Of course you would. Senator G
RASSLEY and I have a sim-ple amendment. The drug companies that want to advertise on television ought to advertise the price of their product or treatment as well. Pharma hates this idea like the devil hates holy water. The notion of actually dis-closing what these drugs cost would not only give you a jolt—as you hear $5,500 a month for Humira—but it would also dramatize the increases in drug costs that we see happening all of the time. Senator G
RASSLEY and I have an amendment before this Senate that is going to call for the disclosure of drug pricing. Don’t you think the American people deserve this information? Guess what. Look at the passenger side behind the driver’s seat in your car. Look at the window. There is a lit-tle disclosure about exactly what you should have to pay for that car. But when it comes to paying for prescrip-tion drugs, pharma doesn’t want to tell you. They want you to finally face it at the cash register. I think Americans have a right to know earlier and more about the cost of these prescription drugs. Seventy-six percent of the American people, inci-dentally, agree with that position. This amendment is bipartisan and is supported, incidentally, by 76 percent of Americans, the American Associa-tion of Retired Persons, the American Medical Association, and—hold on to your hat—President Donald Trump supports this provision as well. We have an amendment that is bipar-tisan and is supported by the adminis-tration, which should be included in this bill, which will move us toward price disclosure. I think it is overdue. We also need to increase the funding for the Centers for Disease Control’s work on congenital heart disease, the most common and deadliest category of birth defects. I will be filing an amendment to in-crease the funding for this program from $4 million to $7 million—a modest amount in a bill of billions of dollars but one that would help 2.4 million Americans living with congenital heart disease. STUDENT LOAN DEBT  
Madam President, I also plan to file 2 amendments to help some of the 44 mil-lion Americans who are struggling with student loan debt by bringing san-ity to the way student loans are treat-ed in bankruptcy. Unlike most types of debt, student loans are extremely difficult—almost impossible—to discharge in bank-ruptcy. Why? There are two reasons. A debtor has to meet a high bar of show-ing ‘‘undue hardship’’ in order to get student loans discharged, and the De-partment of Education pays private contracting firms to fight the students tooth and nail in court if they try to seek a discharge of their student debt because of undue hardship. My amendments would bar the use of Federal funds to pay these contractors who contest undue hardship claims in bankruptcy court when the claims are brought by certain student debtors. Listen to the categories of people we have included in this amendment, peo-ple I think would be deserving of dis-charge of their student debts in bank-ruptcy court: No. 1, veterans who have been deemed unemployable because of a service-connected disability; No. 2, family caregivers of veterans or of the elderly or disabled family members; No. 3, people receiving Social Security disability whose only income is Social Security payments; and No. 4, bor-rowers who have finished school but have spent at least 5 years at a low in-come of less than $24,000 a year. Those are four of the categories of people we think deserve a break when it comes to student loan debt. I hope my colleagues will join me in helping disabled veterans and their caregivers and the others included in this amend-ment. A second amendment would focus ex-clusively on disabled veterans and fam-ily caregivers. Finally, I will file two amendments to protect students from our Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos. Secretary DeVos is planning to repeal or rewrite Obama-era borrower defense and gain-ful employment rules that help stu-dents and taxpayers avoid being cheat-ed by for-profit colleges and univer-sities. Do you want to know the story on for-profit colleges and universities? You need to know only two numbers: only 9 percent of all post-secondary students attend for-profit schools— University of Phoenix, DeVry, and similar schools; 9 percent of students go to that type of school, yet 33 per-cent of all student loan defaults are from students who attend these for- profit schools. Why—9 percent of the students, 33 percent of the student loan defaults? There are two reasons. No. 1 is they charge too darn much. They are dramatically more expensive than other alternative education at the higher education level. Secondly, their diplomas aren’t worth the paper they are written on. These students learn after they graduate that they can’t get a job to pay back their student loans. So I think in this situation Secretary DeVos is doing exactly the wrong thing. She is not holding these schools accountable. She is making it tougher for the students who are lured into their traps to get relief. I am pleased that many of my colleagues have joined in this effort. The Secretary of Education should not roll back impor-tant protections for students and tax-payers, and the Secretary should not eliminate Federal student debt relief for borrowers defrauded by predatory for-profit schools like Corinthian and ITT Tech. It is my hope that these amendments will be included in the final bill. Madam President, once again, the Senate is considering bipartisan appro-priations bills. These bills may not in-clude everything I want or everything other Members want. They are good compromises, which I plan to support. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

speeches, opinions, and judicial philos-ophy. The nominee has weighed in on a number of legal issues publicly and in his role as a circuit judge. There is lit-tle reason why he should be unable to answer direct questions about his judi-cial philosophy, his record, and already decided cases. I also hope that he is willing to shed some light in the areas in his record that remain opaque. The Senate and the public have been able to see only a tiny fraction of the nominee’s exten-sive written record because, unfortu-nately, the Republican majority con-tinues to block access to the great bulk of these documents. I will ask our Re-publicans: What are they hiding? We did make a little progress last night after the Parliamentarian ruled that the rules of the Senate allow every Senator to see the committee documents. Chairman G
RASSLEY gra-ciously agreed that any committee member could see them without muss or fuss. So we very much appreciate that. The next Supreme Court Justice, whether it is Judge Kavanaugh or not, will have immense influence over the lives of every American for generations to come. Most Americans think this is sort of an abstract or political argu-ment. It is not. The actual rulings of Kavanaugh will affect just about everyone’s life in America in very significant and mate-rial ways. The next Supreme Court Justice may someday determine whether the President must comply with a duly issued subpoena. The next Supreme Court Justice may someday soon determine whether Americans with preexisting conditions will be able to afford healthcare. The next justice someday soon may determine just how much States can restrict a woman’s constitutionally guaranteed right to make her own medical decisions, to say nothing about labor rights, civil rights, voting rights, environmental protec-tions, and more. All of these things, part of the wellspring of America, are affected by the Supreme Court’s rulings. As we know, Judge Kavanaugh will be a cru-cial vote on just about every one of those issues with the 4-to-4 division on the court today. Judge Kavanaugh, in his meetings with Senators today and the days ahead, has a responsibility—a responsi-bility—not to duck, not to hide behind false legal shibboleths or say: Oh, I just can’t discuss this; a case might come before me. He has a responsibility to inform the Senate as to his beliefs and philosophy so that the Senate can con-duct its constitutional duty to advise and consent. 
HEALTHCARE  
Madam President, on another mat-ter, it seems that every day we read about a new danger to our healthcare system caused by President Trump and his party in Congress. Only a few days ago, it was announced that the court case that concerns the constitu-tionality of protections for Americans with preexisting conditions, Texas v. United States, will begin on September 5. Remember, President Trump’s Jus-tice Department has refused to defend protections for preexisting conditions in court. What an abomination. Just about every American has someone in their family—many in their immediate family—who has an illness. Someone might have diabetes. Someone might have asthma and, God forbid, some-thing worse. Those are preexisting con-ditions. That family will not be able to get health insurance. That family risks that their present insurance will expire and they will not get anything new. This administration is trying to take away that protection so important to so many Americans. That is what is happening, so Senators MANCHIN and C
ASEY have introduced a resolution asking the Senate legal counsel to step in to defend the law since the adminis-tration will not. I hope we get a vote on that resolution soon. I don’t see how anyone couldn’t be for it. Sadly, the Justice Department’s deci-sion to abandon protections for pre-existing conditions is far from the only example of President Trump’s repeated sabotage of our healthcare system. Over and over again, he has tried to undo the healthcare Americans have without even understanding what he is really doing. On day one, President Trump issued an Executive order aimed at the healthcare law. It was the very first thing he did. He then proposed legisla-tion with congressional Republicans to repeal the healthcare law, devastate Medicaid, and eliminate protections for tens of millions of people with pre-existing conditions. That failed, but congressional Republicans managed to repeal the coverage requirement in their tax bill, of all places, and put nothing in its place, causing unneces-sary premium increases across the country. Americans know, as their premium increases gallop upward, that it is Re-publicans in the Senate and President Trump in the White House who have caused this to happen. Now he con-tinues to do that. He has expanded the availability of junk insurance plans that bait Americans in with lowest rates while providing only the flimsiest of coverage. Again, if these junk insurance plans become the law, the rule, the mode, so many people will lose their ability to protect themselves when they have preexisting conditions. These actions by President Trump, aided, abetted, and encouraged by con-gressional Republicans who either agreed with him or failed to challenge him meaningfully, have had dev-astating results for so many Ameri-cans. Premiums have risen by double digits in a bunch of States, the direct result of Republican sabotage. And the insur-ers themselves—they are the ones who have raised the rates, but they say: Hey, it is Republicans in the House, Senate, and the White House who are causing it. Those insurance industries don’t tend to favor Democrats, but they have to protect themselves and their clients. Prescription drug costs continue to rise. After promising tough action on prescription drugs, the President and congressional Republicans have hardly lifted a finger. The United States is now last—dead last—among industri-alized nations in maternal mortality. The United States is the only industri-alized country in the world with rising maternal mortality rates. Despite all of our advances in genetics, nutrition, and surgery, the United States is get-ting worse at caring for mothers. We should hang our heads in shame about that. We should do something about it. Come on, Republican colleagues. Your voters are no different from our voters and independent voters. They care about good healthcare at an af-fordable cost. Please, do something about it. Join us. But instead of grappling with these problems and proposing solutions, President Trump and congressional Re-publicans just launch attack after at-tack after attack on our healthcare system, particularly women’s health. That worked in the 2016 campaign be-cause they said that they had a plan to replace it with something better. No plan—no plan emerged. And it is not working for them now. It is just not working for them. The American people overwhelm-ingly prefer Democrats to Republicans on healthcare, and healthcare is the No. 1 issue in State after State after State. So for their own political ben-efit, Republicans in the Senate and in the House ought to wake up—wake up—because the old playbook that may have worked in 2014 and 2016 when you weren’t in charge—it was a Democratic President and a Democratic Senate for part of that time—ain’t no more. You are in charge, and you put nothing in its place—nothing. There is just nega-tivity. In poll after poll after poll, the Amer-ican people say that healthcare is the No. 1 issue. They don’t want to go back to a time before we offered protections for Americans with preexisting condi-tions. They don’t want to go back to a time when insurance companies charged women and seniors and older Americans more for the same exact coverage. They don’t want to go back to a time when insurance companies could deny maternity care, mental health treatment, prescription drug coverage, and more, but that is where President Trump and our Republican colleagues want to take us. I say to all those blue-collar folks who voted for President Trump: He promised you bet-ter healthcare. Is he delivering it? Go look at your bills. Go look at healthcare. If he is not, maybe you will help bring some change to Wash-ington—real change—so that your

NOMINATION OF BRETT KAVANAUGH  
Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, the Senate has developed a bad habit. That bad habit is treating Presidential nominees as innocent until nominated. I hope to see better behavior during the next few weeks as the Senate begins hearings on President Trump’s nomina-tion of Judge Kavanaugh to be a mem-ber of the U.S. Supreme Court. Instead of treating Judge Kavanaugh as some-one recently released from San Quentin prison, I hope we treat him with dig-nity and respect so Americans can bet-ter understand his temperament, his intelligence, and his character. That is what we should want to know about a Presidential nominee for the Supreme Court. The current rudeness is a recent phe-nomenon. Historically, Senators have recognized that bipartisan approval of qualified nominees helps improve the esteem of the Court. It confirms its im-partiality. It strengthens it as an insti-tution. For example, conservative Jus-tice Antonin Scalia was confirmed unanimously by this body even though he was perhaps the most conservative Justice on the Court. On the other hand, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was confirmed with only three votes against her even though she may argu-ably be the most liberal Justice on the Court. Both were obviously well quali-fied, of good character, high intel-ligence, and good demeanor, and there-fore the Senate—unanimously in one case and with only three ‘‘no’’ votes in the other case—confirmed the Presi-dent’s nominees. More recently, half the Democratic Senators voted to confirm President Bush’s nominee Chief Justice John Roberts. In 2014, I voted to confirm President Obama’s nominee, Sonia Sotomayor, not because I agreed with her but because I thought she was obvi-ously well qualified for the position. Some Senators insist that Judge Kavanaugh should tell them how he might decide a case. That reminds me of a story from Senator Howard Baker, the former majority leader of the U.S. Senate, who was a practicing lawyer in the mountains. He said he was once be-fore a mountain judge who told the lawyers right before the case: ‘‘Boys, just give me a little bit on the law. I had a telephone call last night, and I pretty well know the facts.’’ Judges aren’t supposed to decide a case in ad-vance. That is why we have judges—to create an impartial judicial system. Justice Ginsburg said during her con-firmation that she would give ‘‘no hints, no forecasts, no previews’’ of what her legal views might be if she were to be confirmed. This rule is now known as the Ginsburg rule. Justices are supposed to follow the law and de-cide cases when the cases are pre-sented, not before Justices are con-firmed or while they are being con-firmed. Of course, a Justice’s opinions and decisions can be surprising. That has been true throughout the history of the Supreme Court. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was often surprised by Jus-tice Felix Frankfurter. Justice Scalia once ruled that a government ban on flag-burning violated the First Amend-ment. Scalia also said that ‘‘the judge who always likes the results he reaches is a bad judge.’’ In 2006, I voted for Judge Kavanaugh when he was President George W. Bush’s nominee for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Last month, I attended President Trump’s nomination of Judge Kavanaugh at the White House. It is said that you only get one chance to make a first impression, and Judge Kavanaugh certainly took advantage of his one opportunity that night. I was again impressed with Judge Kavanaugh when I visited with him in my office a few weeks ago. We dis-cussed federalism, how to strengthen the Supreme Court as an institution, and other matters. Never once did I ask him how he might vote on a particular case. I will not announce how I will vote on his nomination until the hearings are complete. Some Democratic Sen-ators have already announced their op-position to Judge Kavanaugh. I won-der, why have a hearing? Why ask for more records to examine if you have al-ready decided how you are going to vote? During my 8 years as Governor of Tennessee, I appointed probably 50 judges. In doing so, I looked for the same qualities I will look for in consid-ering the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh: intelligence, character, temperament, respect for the law, and respect for those who come before the Court. I did not ask one applicant to be a Tennessee judge, of that entire 50, how he or she might rule on abortion or immigration or taxation. And polit-ical party membership was far down my list of considerations when I had the job, as the chief executive of a State, of appointing judges. I hope the Senate will return to the practice of inquiring diligently about the qualifications of a nominee, about intelligence, about character, about temperament, and get away from this bad habit of treating Presidential nominees for the Supreme Court as if they had just been released from San Quentin and as if they were innocent until nominated. I thank the President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. KEN-
NEDY ). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unani-mous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
AMENDMENT NO . 3829 
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment aimed at helping to ensure the integrity of the budget enforcement process in future years. Before I do so, I would like to again ac-knowledge the hard work the Appro-priations Committee has put into the fiscal year 2019 spending bills. We have made significant progress so far this year, particularly considering that this is the first Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appro-priations bill to be brought to the Sen-ate floor for amendment in nearly 11 years. I commend the committee and its leaders for their efforts and the spirit of cooperation that has made this feat possible. As it stands now, this appropriations bill is subject to a point of order under section 314 of S. Con. Res. 70, the fiscal year 2009 budget resolution authored by former Democratic Senator and Budget Committee chairman Kent Con-rad. That point of order aims to pre-vent mandatory spending increases on appropriations bills. My amendment remedies this violation while main-taining the proposed increase to the maximum award. The amendment I am offering relates to the budgetary effects of the sub-stitute amendment’s proposed increase to the maximum discretionary Pell Grant award for the award year 2019– 2020. If anybody has been able to follow that so far, you ought to be on the Budget Committee. Now I am going to give a lot more detail that will be equally as difficult, because it needs to be a part of the record to show why we need the amendment that I am talking about in order to avoid a point of order and to get the increase for this year that is being requested. As former chairman of the HELP Committee, I understand how impor-tant Pell Grants are in making college more affordable and accessible, espe-cially for students from my home State of Wyoming. That is why I want to be very clear that my amendment would not cut Pell Grant funding for the 2019– 2020 award year or prevent future in-creases in the maximum annual award. My amendment simply deals with how we account for such increases in the Federal ledger. First, a little background may be helpful on the Pell Grant program, which has one of the most complicated funding profiles in the entire Federal budget. The Pell Grant program is funded by a mix of annual discre-tionary appropriations, a so-called mandatory add-on award, and a perma-nent mandatory funding stream. My

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5739 August 21, 2018 
amendment deals with the interaction between the discretionary and the mandatory add-on funding streams. Each year, the Appropriations Com-mittee includes a provision in the De-partment of Education spending bill specifying the maximum discretionary Pell Grant award for the upcoming award year. The substitute amendment would increase that maximum award for the award year 2019–2020 by $100 to $5,135. CBO estimates that this change, which follows a $175 increase to the maximum award provided in fiscal year 2018, will increase mandatory spending on the add-on by $39 million in fiscal year 2019. It is pretty complicated. There are a lot of dollars, a lot of dif-ferent places. Even though the substitute specifies the maximum discretionary award is $5,135 for award year 2019–2020, under scoring rules—that is how we keep track of how much money we are going to owe—the CBO has to assume this maximum award extends through 2028. That means the $39 million annual mandatory cost of this provision also extends through 2028, giving it a 10- year score of $390 million. The sub-stitute amendment includes an offset for the $39 million cost in the first year but leaves the remaining $351 million in mandatory spending scored to the fiscal year 2019 bill unpaid for. Again, under scoring rules, once that $350 mil-lion in estimated future spending is in-corporated into the baseline, it will not be subject to budget enforcement in fu-ture years and will never need to be paid for. That is a problem we face reg-ularly around here, and this is the problem my amendment aims to ad-dress. My amendment would maintain the maximum discretionary award for 2019– 2020 to $5,135, preserving the $100 in-crease proposed by the Appropriations Committee, while it would prevent the estimated $351 million increase in esti-mated future year spending from being rolled into the baseline where it could escape enforcement or even notice in future years. It would require Congress to offset future mandatory spending in-creases just as the substitute amend-ment would do for the first year. If we can do it now, we should be able to do it in the future. Let me repeat. My amendment would not reduce the maximum Pell grant for the 2019–2020 award year or prevent fu-ture increases to the maximum award. In fact, it would maintain the proposed increase to the maximum Pell grant for the 2019–2020 award year. Let me repeat. As it now stands, this appropriations bill is subject to a point of order under section 314 of S. Con. Res. 70 of the fiscal year 2009 budget resolution, which was authored by former Democratic Senator and Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad and passed. That point of order aims to pre-vent mandatory spending increases on appropriations bills. My amendment remedies this violation while main-taining the proposed increase to the maximum award. This is just a good-government amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Let’s not be spending into the future until we know where the money is coming from. Let’s go ahead and make the award for this year, and let’s find a way to pay for it next year. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, this is the first time in 11 years that the chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Sub-committee has had a chance to stand on the floor and present a bill. It is a subcommittee that I am honored to chair. As a subcommittee member, I am honored to get to serve on that committee with the Presiding Officer. It is a subcommittee that is led on the other side by Senator M
URRAY from Washington, the ranking member on this committee. This is not a bill that either Senator M
URRAY nor I would have drafted on our own, but our job was not to draft a bill that I thought was the perfect bill for me to vote for or the perfect way for all of these agencies to be run. There is a reason that this bill has not been on the floor in 11 years. It is big. It is complex. It can be contentious. But Senator S
HELBY , the chairman of the full committee, and Senator L
EAHY , the lead Democrat on the full committee, have made an incredible, good-faith effort to come to the floor with a bill that focuses on how we spend the money. There is not much new in this bill about all of the things we could try to determine about social policy and about issues that all of us feel strongly about, but there are other committees whose principal job is to do that. Our committee’s principal job is to decide how we establish the priorities for the country and how we spend the money. Senator M
CCONNELL and Senator S
CHUMER have also both had to agree that if we are going to get these appro-priations bills on the floor, if we are going to have all of the Members of the Senate—for the first time, in the case of this bill—get a chance to debate this bill for the first time in 11 years, that is not going to happen if we try to have a big authorizing bill and a big appro-priating bill all wrapped into one. I see the ranking member has come to the floor right after I praised him and Senator S
HELBY for the unique leadership they have had that has al-lowed us to get this bill on the floor. This bill deals with everything from medical research to home energy as-sistance, to employment opportunities, training programs, and Pell grants for people who are trying to go to college who don’t have the resources that would allow them to do that otherwise. It is the largest of the nondefense dis-cretionary bills. About 30 percent of all of the nondefense spending is in this one bill. We take that bill and add it to the defense spending bill, and suddenly we are looking at roughly 62 percent of all of the spending of the Federal Govern-ment. That still sounds like a pretty big bill, but it is the first time in the case of the Labor, Health, Human Serv-ices, and Education Subcommittee— and then we have that unique add-on, ‘‘and Related Agencies,’’ just to get the footprint even a little bigger—in over a decade that Members have been able to come to the floor and say: No, we would like you to spend the money here rather than here. By the way, as the Presiding Officer understands, to do that, that Member also has to say: Here is where we are going to take the money from to pay for it. So it is not just on the floor and you get to make up all of the spending you want to that those of us on the appro-priating committee didn’t have a chance to do. There is still a finite amount of money. So for the Presiding Officer’s amend-ment, the Kennedy amendment, which will be offered right after we finish this morning’s discussion and go to votes, he had to come up with an amount of money to pay for that. I am fully supportive of the amend-ment that he and Senator REEDcame up with to deal with the pressing issue of suicide prevention and the dis-turbing suicide rates. In my State of Missouri, suicide rates have increased by 36 percent above where they were in the year 2000—a 36-percent increase. Too many of those are our veterans. Too many of those are people who serve on the frontlines of homeland se-curity, police, and veterans. All of that is something we need to look at. Here is the Presiding Officer’s opportunity, which he took, to say: No, I think there is a better way to spend some of this money than how the committee spends it. That is what we missed for the last 11 years, when 69 of the Senators didn’t have any say as to what the 31 of us who serve on the Appropriations Com-mittee need to debate and talk about. So we now bring this bill to the floor. There were 6,164 ideas that came to Senator M
URRAY and me—6,164 Member requests of ideas as to how this could be the best possible bill. I think most of those are reflected in what we did. In this bill, we talk about fighting the opioid epidemic. We talk about pro-moting college affordability, strength-ening the workforce, and having people better prepared for the jobs that are out there to be filled than they would otherwise see. Now, both sides would approach drafting this bill differently. We would both start out with some significantly different sets of priorities. We have

been able to reach an agreement that neither of us would have drafted on our own, but that is not the job that we were given. We have been able to present a bipartisan bill to the full committee and have that bill referred out of the full committee with 30 ‘‘yes’’ votes and 1 ‘‘no’’ vote, and now we are bringing that bill to the Senate floor. It represents a compromise on both sides. It represents taking a step back on issues that authorize on both sides, which we can deal with at a later time. I certainly appreciate not just the lead-ership of Senator L
EAHY and the lead-ership of Senator S
HELBY but also the leadership of Senator M
URRAY in help-ing to determine what those priorities would be and should be. I see Senator L
EAHY is standing on the floor, and I am glad to yield to him for a comment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I just wanted to applaud what the Senator from Missouri just said. He has had a lot of experience in the other body and here in the Senate. He and I have been here since a time when we actually voted on these bills and got them done. I note that he has been a tremendous help in getting us this far. For Senator M
URRAY , because of a very necessary absence, I will manage her part of this bill when it is up. She has worked very hard on it. As the Senator from Mis-souri just said, regarding the vote we had in the Appropriations Committee, keep in mind that appropriations goes across the political spectrum of both parties, and we reported this bill out of the committee with broad bipartisan support. I commend Senator S
HELBY  too. We are opposed to authorizing legis-lation on the right or the left, unless there is total agreement with every-body, because we want to get these bills done. We still have to go to con-ference with the House when they come back in a few weeks. We want to have a solid vote here. So I thank the Senator from Missouri for the work he has done. We are get-ting somewhere, and as someone who has been here for a long time, I am rather happy to see that. I yield the floor. I thank the Senator for yielding. Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for his lead-ership. Again, this is the first time in over a decade for the 69 people who aren’t on the Appropriations Com-mittee to get to come to the floor and offer amendments and think about what this bill does. Let’s talk about some of the things it does. We worked really hard over the last 4 years to do the kinds of things we ought to do in healthcare research. This bill, for the first time, reaches a long-held goal of the national plan to address Alzheimer’s disease, of getting those annual research dollars up over $2 billion—in fact, $2.34 billion, exceed-ing what had been a long-term goal. The goal should not be how much money we spend. It should be finding a way to solve this problem. This is a significant increase over last year. It quadruples where we were 4 years ago. We spent 277 billion tax dollars a year on Alzheimer’s and dementia-related care. A lot more private money is spent than that—three times that amount in private money—and there is lost work as caregivers step back to help people with these terrible diseases of demen-tia and Alzheimer’s. But here is $277 billion. So this bill does about 1 per-cent of that in research to try to solve a problem that taxpayers are over-whelmed by. It is a problem that by 2050, if we don’t find a solution, we will be spending about twice today’s de-fense budget on Alzheimer’s care, twice today’s defense budget—$1.1 trillion of today’s dollars being spent on Alz-heimer’s care if we don’t do what we need to. This is the only leading cause of death that doesn’t have a treatment, doesn’t have a cure, doesn’t have a way to prevent it, and, obviously, the right kind of discovery, the right kind of medical advancement that can change the lives of millions of American fami-lies now and in the future if we do this. I am pleased to see we are making that investment. I am also pleased to see that after a 12-year period, when there wasn’t any increase in healthcare research spending at all, we continue to find money, in many cases by elimi-nating programs that weren’t working, to where we had a 30-percent increase in NIH funding over the last 4 years. What a 4 years to be doing that—under-standing the things we know now about the human genome, understanding how each of us is different than all the rest of us and that, in fact, each of us has a different capacity to fight disease than any other person does. If you can figure out how to maximize that, such as things like immunotherapy in cancer, where many cancers that 5 years ago were largely untreatable—and if they were treatable, they were treatable with radiation and chemotherapy—are now treatable by just simply figuring out how, in your own system, you can maximize your ability to fight back. That is the NIH healthcare research kind of victory we need to now con-tinue to find out why it works on some cancers and why it doesn’t work on others. This kind of research and commit-ment to NIH not only helps individuals and helps families but, frankly, at a time when healthcare is dramatically changing, has the ability to help our economy. The economy that figures out new ways to be in this healthcare fight is also going to be the economy that has the job opportunities and the transformational opportunities to be part of that. Not only are we looking at healthcare research, but we are also looking at research as it relates to the opioid epidemic. The opioid cost to the economy is now anticipated to be about $500 billion a year in lost work time and other costs related to the opioid epidemic. This bill provides a significant, tar-geted opioid funding. This is the fourth year in a row we have increased our funding. Again, this is only the second time we have had any more money to do it with. We have had to look at pro-grams that weren’t working and cut, reduce, and combine those programs to fight back on the opioid epidemic, which is now, and for a couple of years has been, the No. 1 cause of accidental death in the United States. It is the No. 1 accidental cause of death in my State of Missouri. The 73,000 people who died last year with overdoses ex-ceed the number of people who died in car accidents, which for decades had been the No. 1 cause of accidental deaths until opioids replaced it. We have $1.5 billion available for State opioid response grants. Under-standing that every State is different, and frankly the more things we try to do in different ways, the more likely we are to find the things that work. We have that. There is more money for community health centers to expand behavioral health and substance abuse disorder services. There is an increase in the ability to improve surveillance and prevention efforts in the illicit drug space or the drug abuse space, more money to research pain management. Part of the NIH money, at half a bil-lion dollars, is designed to find more ways to research for better pain man-agement and better ways to, if you have become addicted to drugs and opioids specifically, end that addiction in an effective way. There is more money for the hardest hit rural com-munities. Some of our Members have advocated strongly for a drug problem that is more of a rural drug problem on a per capita basis than it is an urban drug problem. There is more money for children and families who are put at risk by opioids. I saw a news report just this week fo-cusing on kids being raised by their grandparents because their parents wound up with an opioid addiction problem that drove their life in a way their children were not only in danger and ignored but had to go somewhere else. This bill prioritizes education pro-grams through a student’s life, focus-ing on programs that provide the most flexibility for States and communities that meet the needs of families, chil-dren, and their workforce in their State. There are increases for Head Start, increases for title I support for low-in-come schools to help them meet aca-demic challenges. There is more money to meet the goal the Federal Govern-ment set decades ago, where individ-uals with disabilities are assisted with-in the school context, as the Federal Government determined they had to be, but the Federal Government has been wanting and coming up with the money that was committed to do that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5741 August 21, 2018 
decades ago. We continue to make steps in the right direction there, and I think there are substantial steps in this bill. There is flexible spending so schools can look at more science, math, and STEM education, more computer science education, and more ability for schools to take some of their funds and look at school safety. Nobody wants to see kids go to school in an environment that is not as safe as we can possibly make it. This allows more flexibility for local administrators and local school boards to decide how they are going to meet that school safety need. We looked at impact aid, charter schools, and programs that create both competition and fairness in a way I think people we work for will like. This bill maintains the significant investments made last year on college access. The best way to minimize col-lege debt is to get done, finish. Year- round Pell is something we returned to after several years of having only the normal traditional school year Pell. Year-round Pell is maintained in this as part of our Federal commitment to have people going to school. If you are an adult going back to school, if you are somebody who is a first-time col-lege attender in your family, if, for whatever reason, you are paying for your own school, the most likely way to get done is don’t interrupt a pattern that is working. This bill allows that to continue. We also do things that I think better prepare our workforce for the work-place. It is a bill to look forward to working with Members to see how it can be improved, just like the amend-ment we will be voting on soon that deals with suicide prevention in ways Senator K
ENNEDY and Senator R EED have suggested, and I support. With that, I will conclude my re-marks. I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes of debate, equally divided in the usual form, prior to the vote on the Kennedy amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. C

The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate, equal-ly divided, prior to the vote. The Senator from Louisiana. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, my amendment No. 3703 is pretty straight-forward. It would increase funding for the National Suicide Prevention Life-line by an additional $2.8 million. It is a bipartisan amendment. It is fully offset. It is not adding money to the budget. I think it will do a great deal to make sure that anyone battling depression knows there is someone out there who is listening. Our National Suicide Prevention Hotline, as you know, supports the national network of local crisis centers. To date, they have answered more than 10 million calls from people in distress, and they esti-mate that over the next 4 years, they will take 12 million calls. We underfund them. It is embarrassing how much we underfund them. Again, this will add an additional $2.8 million to their budget, and it is fully offset. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition? Mr. REED.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5742 August 21, 2018 
NOMINATION OF BRETT KAVANAUGH  
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the President’s nomina-tion of appellate judge Brett Kavanaugh to serve as an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. On July 9, President Trump announced his selection of Judge Kavanaugh to be the 114th Justice in our Nation’s proud his-tory. For a practicing lawyer, serving on our highest Court is the pinnacle of achievement, and nomination to the Bench is testament to a distinguished legal career. When we imagine a Su-preme Court Justice, we think of re-spected jurists, well-steeped in legal questions, rigorous in attention to de-tail, respectful of traditions, faithful to the law, awed by the recognition of the proud and profound responsibility wielded, and fair to all involved. Our legal system requires it, and the Amer-ican people value it among their high-est ideals of government. Throughout our history, the central tension of our Republic can be defined as the exercise of government power versus liberty. Each expands at the ex-pense of the other. Finding a way for both central authority and individual freedom to coexist and support each other remains our biggest challenge and will remain so long into the future. To preserve the limits on an ever-ex-panding Federal Government, our Founding Fathers conceived of a sys-tem of interlocking powers that sup-port each other but serve as a nec-essary restraint against tyrannical be-havior of any. We all know it as the principle of separation of powers, with each of the three branches acting as a check on the others. The Constitution’s appointments clause defines one of the most con-sequential duties of our Federal Gov-ernment, and it illustrates the working application of the checks and balances dynamic. Article II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution provides that the Presi-dent ‘‘shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other pub-lic Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court’’ and others. This provision interlocks the executive branch with the legislature. Neither can succeed without the other. At its best, this is a partnership functioning well. At its worst, either side can deny the other’s success. One popular but misguided criticism made of Judge Kavanaugh centers around his academic study of the sepa-ration of powers in our Federal system. In one scholarly writing, he explores the legal structures of our government and the dangers presented by over-po-liticizing the relationship between the branches. He describes the enormous challenges faced by President Clinton and President Bush in carrying out their constitutional duties while polit-ical difficulties swirled about them and the impact that had on the efficient ad-ministration of government. Much hyperbole has been spoken about Judge Kavanaugh’s keen obser-vations. Whether you find yourself on the political right or the left, few would dispute his central point—that a government system rendered inoper-ative benefits no one. To quote Alex-ander Hamilton in Federalist Paper No. 70, ‘‘A feeble Executive implies a feeble execution of the government.’’ Judge Kavanaugh offers a number of options for the political branches of govern-ment to explore and points out the pros and cons of them. The opposite view held by Judge Kavanaugh’s critics is, then, by extension, the status quo of Washington’s dysfunction. As a jurist, in his legal opinions, Judge Kavanaugh has consistently demonstrated a willingness to reign in both Congress and the Executive when they overstep their constitutional bounds. In a town where acquiring power seems ingrained, having a judge committed to preserving the constitu-tional function of each branch cannot be overstated. Yet some would have you believe that Judge Kavanaugh’s understanding of the proper operation of our system of government is a threat to the very Republic and dis-qualifying to serve on our highest Court. I disagree. His analysis is in-sightful and should be eagerly em-braced by civic students throughout the country. In the weeks since President Trump nominated Judge Kavanaugh for the Court, special interests have kicked into overdrive, peddling one imagined conspiracy after another. Variously, I have heard people suggest that Judge Kavanaugh is a threat to the people of every race, creed, gender, and age. Some have even unleashed prophecies of biblical gloom and doom awaiting the confirmation of a Justice Kavanaugh. Still others have called on opponents of Judge Kavanaugh’s to use every possible tool to stop his con-firmation, including the extreme step of shutting down the government should things not go their way. So, fac-ing a nominee with impeccable creden-tials, opponents must imagine a boogeyman. Fortunately, people see past those attacks because they are the same attacks they lobbed when Presi-dent Bush nominated Justice Souter and when President Reagan nominated Justice Kennedy. Failing at that, some opponents of Judge Kavanaugh’s are hoping to de-mand an endless stream of documents to delay confirmation proceedings in-definitely. These opponents claim that the process is unfair and lacks trans-parency, when in reality the opposite is true. As Chairman G
RASSLEY of the Judici-ary Committee so eloquently pointed out at a recent Senate Judiciary meet-ing, none of these criticisms hold any weight. There will have been 57 days between the announcement of Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination and the date of his confirmation hearing—a longer period than Senators had for Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Gorsuch. Judge Kavanaugh has submitted more than 17,000 pages with his bipartisan Judici-ary Committee questionnaire, which is the most extensive questionnaire ever sent a nominee. The committee has also received hundreds of thousands of pages of documents from Judge Kavanaugh’s service in the executive branch. This, too, is already more than any Supreme Court nominee before him, and documents are continuing to be sent to the committee for review. Chairman GRASSLEY is working tire-lessly to make the vast majority pub-licly available as quickly as possible, and I appreciate and applaud his trans-parency. I recognize the politics and the pur-pose behind these creative but mis-guided attacks, and so does the Amer-ican public. Judge Kavanaugh’s experience and legal background are not in dispute. His readiness for the Supreme Court is not contested. His law clerks vouch for him. Lawyers who argue before him commend him for his judgment, his fairness, and his temperament. His peers admire and respect his intellect and draw regularly from his opinions. In short, he is a judge’s judge. In fact, nearly every one of his former clerks signed a letter extolling the qualifica-tions that he has, his virtues, and his temperament. So widespread was the support of their former mentor that only those who were prohibited by their employer from signing were left off. Newspaper editorial boards from across the country have endorsed his nomination. Here are just some of the dozens of glowing testimonials about Judge Kavanaugh: The Wall Street Journal: 
Judge Kavanaugh has an exemplary record that suggests he will help to restore the Su-preme Court to its proper, more modest role in American politics and society. . . . He has the experience and intellect to be a leader on the Court, not merely a predictable vote on this or that issue. 
The Detroit News: 
Brett Kavanaugh’s credentials, his com-mitment to judicial independence, his unas-sailable character, his record as a judge dedi-cated to the Constitution and his likability should overwhelm the Senate skeptics who will be tempted to oppose him simply be-cause he was appointed by Trump. 
The Richmond Times-Dispatch: 
If one were to create an ideal resume for the position of Supreme Court justice, it would not look terribly different from Brett Michael Kavanaugh’s curriculum vitae. President Trump’s nominee to replace Jus-tice Anthony Kennedy is more than qualified for the job. . . . Indeed, Kavanaugh’s quali-fications are impeccable—unfortunately, that won’t stop him from being lambasted by the opposition on the left concerned about his conservative values. 
The Las Vegas Review-Journal: 
Judge Kavanaugh is imminently accom-plished. . . . Judge Kavanaugh is firmly in the judicial mainstream, although Demo-crats will no doubt try to twist him into a rabid, dangerous extremist. He is, in fact, a

constitutionalist who believes that judges should follow the nation’s founding docu-ment rather than interpret law to achieve desired ends. 
The Lowell Sun in Massachusetts: 
What Democrats cannot question is Brett Kavanaugh’s credentials. . . . After all the drama and histrionics, sensible Democrats should put politics aside and vote to make him the ninth member of the Supreme Court. 
Judge Kavanaugh is one of the most qualified nominees ever for the Su-preme Court. He has been nominated to succeed Justice Kennedy, a man for whom he once clerked and called a ‘‘mentor.’’ With over 300 authored opin-ions and 12 years of service on the bench, he is a judge with a clear record demonstrating that he applies the law as written and enforces the Constitu-tion. He values precedent and wrote, along with Justice Gorsuch and others, ‘‘The Law of Judicial Precedent,’’ a scholarly piece on the importance of stare decisis. Many critics argue that a Justice Kavanaugh would likely be the key to unlocking any number of Supreme Court precedents. I wonder, though, how many have actually read this book and understand that he is someone who has given exhaustive and weighty con-sideration to important legal ques-tions. But we should take him at his own words: 
The judge’s job is to interpret the law, not to make the law or make policy. So read the words of the statute as written. Read the text of the Constitution as written, mindful of history and tradition. Don’t make up new constitutional rights that are not in the text of the Constitution. Don’t shy away from en-forcing constitutional rights that are in the text of the Constitution. 
Judge Kavanaugh is a respected ju-rist with a sterling reputation for in-tellectual rigor and attention to legal detail. He understands the proper role of a judge in our legal system—to fair-ly interpret the law, not create it. He thinks deeply about the legal questions before him and strives to build con-sensus on the court. As stated by his former law clerks, ‘‘Judge Kavanaugh never assumes he knows the answers in advance and never takes for granted that his view of the law will prevail.’’ He actively solic-its views from all sides of the argu-ment—all the better to form a lasting and well-reasoned opinion. I look forward to the Senate Judici-ary Committee’s upcoming hearings, when the public can hear directly from Judge Kavanaugh, in his own words, the proper role of a judge in our legal system. I am confident Judge Kavanaugh will demonstrate the rig-orous intellect, the fealty to law, and the judicial temperament that have long defined his career on the bench. Thank you. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Indiana. Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about Judge Kavanaugh, President Trump’s second nominee to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States. Judge Kavanaugh’s qualifications are undeniable. He has proven over the last 12 years on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit that he is well qualified for this next step in his ca-reer. I had the opportunity to sit down with Judge Kavanaugh in my office just last month. He struck me as a man of great character and integrity. He an-swered questions directly. He spoke forthrightly. He demonstrated, at once, a strong intellect and a deep humility. He had a wide-ranging conversation with me on issues that are important to the people in my home State of Indi-ana, including his approach to faith-fully interpreting the Constitution of the United States. As a D.C. Circuit judge, he has car-ried out his duties faithfully and con-sistently. He has shown by the record that he understands that the judge’s role is to apply the law as it is written; it is not to impose his own policy pref-erences. He is what you might call a textualist when interpreting statutes, meaning he adheres strictly to the law as it is written. He is an originalist as well, meaning he carefully reviews the history of our Framers when inter-preting the Constitution. This is an ap-proach he frequently lectures and writes about as a guest lecturer at Har-vard and other top law schools, includ-ing Notre Dame Law School back home in Indiana where he gave a guest lec-ture on his jurisprudential approach in February of 2017. It is also worth not-ing, it was Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan who hired Judge Kavanaugh to teach at Harvard when she was the Harvard Law School dean. Justice Kagan clearly thought highly of the Judge’s reputation and creden-tials—so highly, in fact, that she hired him to help shape the minds of Harvard Law School students. In his writing, Judge Kavanaugh re-minds us that federalism and the sepa-ration of powers ‘‘are not mere matters of etiquette or architecture, but are es-sential to protecting individual lib-erty.’’ Judge Kavanaugh has also exhibited a willingness to rein in administrative agencies when they exceed their au-thority under the law. He has consist-ently held that international laws do not govern national security matters if Congress has not adopted them as do-mestic law. After carefully reviewing Judge Kavanaugh’s record, I am confident he will be faithful to the Constitution and preserve the integrity of the Supreme Court. I have to say, Judge Kavanaugh is more than just a highly respected ju-rist. He is more than an eminently qualified legal scholar and a mind that is well suited for the Supreme Court. He is also a father, a husband, a coach to his two daughters’ basketball team, and a man of impeccable character. Earlier this month, a group of more than 30 parents sent a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee praising Judge Kavanaugh’s character. The judge’s two daughters are students at Blessed Sacrament School in Wash-ington, DC, and the judge is the girls’ basketball coach. The parents wrote: ‘‘Brett Kavanaugh has been a devoted coach and mentor to our daughters.’’ They continued: ‘‘In addition to his long list of professional and academic accomplishments—we hope that the Committee will also consider Brett Kavanaugh’s contributions as a volun-teer youth basketball coach—and the service, selflessness, dedication, and commitment his coaching exhibits.’’ In 2 weeks, the Senate Judiciary Committee will begin its confirmation hearing for Judge Kavanaugh. He is one of the most qualified nominees to ever come before the U.S. Senate, and when all is said and done, the Judiciary Committee will have reviewed more records than ever before for a Supreme Court nominee. The importance of protecting indi-vidual liberty cannot be overstated. I am pleased we are considering the nomination of someone who, by word and deed, has committed himself to preserving freedom. I look forward to watching Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing, and after conducting a thorough and objec-tive review of his nomination, I am confident Judge Kavanaugh will be an excellent addition to our Nation’s high-est Court. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Illinois. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I note my colleagues have come before me to discuss the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to fill the vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court after the retire-ment of Justice Kennedy. I checked, just to make sure I under-stood the section of the Constitution. It is article II, relative to the Presi-dent’s powers, which talks about the power of the President to fill that va-cancy on the Supreme Court, subject to the advice and consent of the U.S. Sen-ate. One hundred U.S. Senators ulti-mately have the last word on any nominee. I am fortunate to serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where we get the first chance to review any nominee and take a look at their background and vote as a committee before the matter is brought to the floor of the U.S. Senate. I have listened to my colleagues who support Judge Kavanaugh ascending to the bench and to a lifetime appoint-ment to the highest Court of the land. I am troubled by one particular aspect of this nomination. It is different than

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5744 August 21, 2018 
any nomination to the Supreme Court in the history of the United States in this respect: This President made it clear that any person who wanted to be eligible for the U.S. Supreme Court needed to pass a clearance by two orga-nizations. One is called the Federalist Society and the other is the Heritage Foundation. Both of these are conserv-ative organizations which reviewed all of the potential Supreme Court nomi-nees and produced a list of 20 or more men and women who would be eligible for the Supreme Court by their judg-ment. Is their judgment important? I will point to one fact in history which illus-trates. When Neil Gorsuch was consid-ered by President Trump to serve on the Supreme Court and fill the vacancy of Antonin Scalia, he was not notified by the White House. The White House called the Federalist Society head, Leonard Leo, and asked him to call Mr. Gorsuch and tell him the good news. So to say that the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation played a crit-ical role in the selection of a nominee is an understatement. If you don’t clear their background test, their lit-mus test, you cannot be considered by the Trump administration for the Su-preme Court. That is offensive to me. We don’t see any reference to the Federalist Society or the Heritage Foundation in the U.S. Constitution. There is a clear reference to a President elected by the people of the United States, but to give to any special interest group, right, left or center, that kind of authority is way beyond what our Founding Fathers imagined would be this process for se-lecting someone for the Supreme Court. Then it gets even more complicated. Before we consider a nominee for the Supreme Court, we have to carefully review their records. It takes time. Lit-erally, scores of lawyers sit down and go through the published opinions and speeches and other documents which evidence a person’s background, and when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh, it is an extensive background. He has had a role at the highest levels of the Fed-eral Government for years: Ken Starr’s Office of Independent Counsel, the Bush v. Gore lawsuit that went down to the State of Florida and beyond. The cases he was involved in as a member of the court are pretty obvious and published, but many of his other activities—particularly in the White House when he served as Staff Sec-retary to the President of the United States—were extensive. For a 3-year period of time, for 35 months, he was the gatekeeper in the White House as to the documentation the President would receive and read. It involved a pretty massive amount of time and documentation on all of the major issues facing the Presidency for almost 3 years. Should we take a look at it? Is it worth our investigation and inquiry into what Mr. Kavanaugh said and did during those years? Well, there was a time here when Re-publicans thought it was not only im-portant but essential when it came to a nominee named Elena Kagan. Elena Kagan had never served on the Federal judiciary. She was nominated by Presi-dent Obama. At the time, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Jeff Sessions of Alabama, insisted on the full documentation of her role in the White House, and the Democratic Senator, P
ATRICK LEAHY of Vermont, joined him in making that request. As a result, 170,000 pages of documents were produced because of the request made by Senator Sessions and Senator L
EAHY . It was a bipartisan request. It established a standard. The same standard was applied for Democratic nominee Sonia Sotomayor. Documentation had to be presented to the committee and carefully reviewed before there was a vote on whether that person would serve in a lifetime appointment to the highest Court in the land. Most of us assumed, at that point, that it was a settled practice in the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee when it came to the documentary proof we would ask for when nominees came be-fore us for the Supreme Court. We thought that, but we were wrong be-cause when the Republicans took con-trol, everything changed. It changed, of course, with Antonin Scalia’s vacancy as a result of his untimely death—a va-cancy President Obama sought to fill during his last year in office. He ended up nominating Merrick Garland, a DC Circuit Court judge of impeccable cre-dentials to fill the vacancy. Many Re-publicans in the Senate refused to even meet with Merrick Garland, let alone consider him and vote on him. So, for a whole year, the vacancy continued at the Supreme Court while the Repub-licans broke Senate tradition and re-fused to consider President Obama’s nominee. Then came the election of Donald Trump, the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch, and the process went forward to fill the vacancy the Republicans had kept open for more than a year before Neil Gorsuch was finally voted on by the U.S. Senate. So here came the second vacancy under the Trump administration—a va-cancy created by the retirement of Jus-tice Kennedy—and the question was ob-viously asked: What standard will you use for asking for the documentary evi-dence of the person’s background in public service? Many of us assumed it would have been the same standard that was pushed by Senator Sessions, a Repub-lican of Alabama, and Senator L
EAHY , a Democrat of Vermont. We were wrong. Instead, what the Republicans said is, we are going to have a new rule when it comes to Republican nominees from the Trump administration in the case of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, and that new rule said we will not ask for documentation for the 35 months when he served in the White House as the closest adviser to the President of the United States. I can tell you there were a myriad of issues that were considered by the President in that period of time, and Brett Kavanaugh, then assistant to the President, was involved in these de-cisions. We will not know what he said or did because the Republicans have re-fused to ask for the documentary evi-dence of his time there. There is more to the story. The Re-publicans decided, for those documents they might consider asking for, they would have a final filter, and the final filter is a man named Burck, who has served as an attorney for not only President Bush but also in the past for Steve Bannon. Does the name ring a bell? Steve Bannon of Breitbart News. Burck has served as his counsel and was a deputy to Brett Kavanaugh in the White House. Mr. Burck is literally going through Kavanaugh’s documents from his time in the White House Counsel’s Office to decide which ones will be given to the Senate Judiciary Committee to con-sider. So it means he is the filter of things he doesn’t want us to see and he doesn’t want the American people to see. This Republican advocate attorney is going to be a decisionmaker when it comes to whether we can see docu-ments that were produced by Brett Kavanaugh when he served in the White House Counsel’s Office. It gets even worse. It turns out, those documents, which he preclears for us to read in the Senate Judiciary Com-mittee, are subject to some sort of committee confidentiality. I have served on the Senate Judiciary Com-mittee for a number of years, and I know there are documents which are considered somewhat committee con-fidential, but it is rare, and it is usu-ally a case you wouldn’t argue over; classified information, for example. In this case, these Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee will be the final, final filter as to whether the American people will know the back-ground of Brett Kavanaugh. Why is there so much secrecy here? Why wouldn’t these documents be made public? Well, let’s look back in time. When Elena Kagan was asked to produce her documents from the time when she served in the White House, she produced every one of them except those that were personal and private. On how many of those 170,000 pages did she assert executive privilege and say: I can’t produce them? None. Every sin-gle document was turned over to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Now, when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh, I can’t tell you what is going on here. There is a concealment which is impossible to explain. What would we find in those documents that have been carefully screened by Mr. Burck and then again by the Senate Judiciary Committee Republican ma-jority? I am concerned about it because this is a lifetime appointment to the high-est Court in the land. We know the

Court is carefully divided. It is legiti-mate for us to ask the questions about Judge Kavanaugh’s background be-cause of our constitutional responsi-bility to advise and consent, but we can’t ask those questions if they don’t produce the documents, and that is where we are today. So my colleagues can come to the floor and talk about Judge Kavanaugh’s record leading up to this nomination. They are limited in the in-formation they have been given, and the limitations are unprecedented in the U.S. Senate. The Republicans, when it comes to the Supreme Court, just rewrite the rules. Merrick Garland, President Obama’s nominee: Sorry. No thanks. We are not interested in interviewing him or even considering him for that appointment. When it came to this judge, Judge Kavanaugh, the ordinary production of documents, by a standard established by the Republicans and Senator Sessions, is being ignored now when it comes to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh. We will be given lim-ited information because of this proc-ess and have to do our best to carefully review this nominee before he is con-sidered for this lifetime appointment to the highest Court in the land. I yield floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. H

NOMINATION OF BRETT KAVANAUGH  
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, when it comes to deciding whether to confirm a Supreme Court Justice, there are two important questions: One, is this per-son well qualified? And, two, does this person understand the proper role of a judge? When it comes to Brett Kavanaugh, the answer to both questions is yes. I don’t need to tell anyone how qualified Judge Kavanaugh is. He is a graduate of Yale Law School and a lecturer at Harvard Law School. He has extensive legal experience in government and private practice, and he has spent the past 12 years serving on the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, sometimes referred to as the second highest court in the land. His opinions have been endorsed by the Supreme Court more than a dozen times, and they are regularly cited by courts around the country. In short, he is eminently qualified to be a Justice on the Supreme Court. But being qualified, while essential, is not sufficient. A Supreme Court Jus-tice also needs to understand the prop-er role of a judge, and that role is to in-terpret the law, not make the law; to judge, not legislate; to call balls and strikes, not rewrite the rules of the game. Judge Kavanaugh understands this. He understands that as a Supreme Court Justice, his job will be to rule based on the facts of the case, the law and the Constitution, and nothing else, not his personal opinions, not his polit-ical feelings, not his beliefs about what the law should be—just the plain text of the law and the Constitution. And that makes Judge Kavanaugh exactly the kind of judge that all of us, Demo-crats and Republicans alike, should want on the Supreme Court—the kind of judge who, in the words of Judge Kavanaugh, will decide cases ‘‘without regard to policy preferences or polit-ical allegiances or which party is on which side in a particular case.’’ Of course, that is not the kind of Jus-tice Democrats are looking for. They don’t really want an impartial Justice. They want a Justice they can rely on to rubberstamp Democratic policies. So even before President Trump had named a replacement for Justice Ken-nedy, Democrats were already sig-naling their intention of rejecting any-one the President put forward. One Democrat Senator formally announced his opposition to the President’s nomi-nee the morning of July 9, before the President had actually nominated any-one. Since Judge Kavanaugh’s nomina-tion, Democrats have tried to make a case against Judge Kavanaugh, flinging up accusations in the desperate hope that something will stick. Needless to say, they haven’t had much luck. It is difficult to argue that a judge like Judge Kavanaugh isn’t eminently suit-ed to serve on the Supreme Court. Democrats are also doing their best to delay the proceedings by making outlandish demands for documents re-lating to Judge Kavanaugh’s time in the White House. Apparently the up to 1 million pages that the Judiciary Committee expects to receive from Judge Kavanaugh’s time in the execu-tive branch and his circuit court con-firmation aren’t enough, even though it could be more than the amount of material received for the last five Su-preme Court nominees combined. Let me repeat that. One million pages that the Judiciary Committee expects to re-ceive from Judge Kavanaugh’s time in the executive branch and his circuit court confirmation are more than the amount of material received for the last five Supreme Court nominees com-bined. One also has to ask why Democratic leaders feel the need to see any mate-rial for Judge Kavanaugh, given the fact that they have already made up their minds to oppose him. Of course, it is not about the mate-rial. We all know that. Democrats aren’t really interested in reading every email that happened to be copied to Judge Kavanaugh. They just want to delay his nomination. It would be nice if Democrats would abandon their partisan opposition to Judge Kavanaugh and take a serious look at this superbly qualified nomi-nee. Unfortunately, I expect the polit-ical posturing to continue, but we will continue to move forward with the con-firmation process to deliver another outstanding Justice to the Supreme Court. ECONOMIC GROWTH  
Mr. President, the good economic news continues to pour in. The econ-omy grew at an impressive 4.1 percent in the second quarter of this year, bringing economic growth for the year so far up over 3 percent. Unemploy-ment dropped to 3.9 percent in July, which is close to an 18-year low. Work-er pay and benefits are increasing at the fastest pace in a decade. Consumer confidence is at a nearly 18-year high. Disposable income, which is income after taxes, is up 3.5 percent this year. And small business optimism is at a record high. In short, Republican economic poli-cies are working, and I don’t need to tell anyone that economic growth lagged during the Obama administra-tion. Recovery from the recession was historically weak, and some econo-mists were predicting that 2 percent growth would be the new normal. But Republicans disagreed. We didn’t think American workers should have to resign themselves to permanently sluggish economic growth and the di-minished opportunities that come with it. We knew that American innovators and job creators were as creative and driven as ever, but we also knew that American businesses, large and small, were weighed down by burdensome reg-ulations and an outdated tax code that discouraged growth. So over the past year and a half, the White House and Republicans in Congress have focused on removing obstacles to economic growth. We have reduced burdensome regulations, and in December, we passed historic, comprehensive tax re-form legislation. Before that bill passed, before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed, the Tax Code was not helping businesses grow and create jobs. In fact, it was doing the opposite, and that had real con-sequences for American workers. A small business owner struggling to afford the hefty annual tax bill for her business was highly unlikely to be able to hire a new worker or to raise wages. A larger business struggling to stay competitive in the global marketplace while paying a substantially higher tax rate than its foreign competitors too often had limited funds to expand or increase investment in the United States. So we took action to improve the playing field for American workers by improving the playing field for busi-nesses as well. We lowered tax rates across the board for owners of small and medium-sized businesses, farms, and ranches. We lowered our Nation’s massive corporate tax rate which, until January 1, was the highest corporate

tax rate in the developed world. We ex-panded business owners’ ability to re-cover investments they make in their businesses, which frees up cash that they can reinvest in their operations and their workers. And we brought the U.S. international tax system into the 21st century so that American busi-nesses are not operating at a disadvan-tage next to their foreign competitors. Now we are seeing the results: stronger economic growth, as I men-tioned—4.1 percent in the second quar-ter of this year, giving us an annual growth rate of over 3 percent. That is something we haven’t seen in quite a while. Low unemployment—we are see-ing the lowest unemployment numbers, literally, in the last 18 years. The num-ber of jobless claims is the lowest in 40 years. There are better wages and bene-fits. We are seeing companies large and small across this country increasing wages and the benefits they pay to their employees. Wages, as I mentioned earlier, are up—the highest level in-crease in wages in a decade. And, as I said earlier, disposable income is up 3.5 percent since the first of this year. All of this has happened since tax reform passed last year. One and a half million new jobs have been created since the passage of tax reform, and that means more opportunities for American work-ers. I am proud of the progress we have made in getting the economy going again, and I am going to go keep work-ing with my colleagues, hopefully on both sides of the aisle, to expand eco-nomic opportunities for Americans even further. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Ohio. 
OPIOID EPIDEMIC  
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I would like to agree with my colleague from South Dakota, who has talked about the importance of the tax relief and regulatory reform and what that has meant for our economy. We are growing at rates that some have said were impossible. People said: Well, you just have to get used to the new nor-mal. We are going to have the economy grow at 1 or 2 percent. It was 4.1 per-cent last quarter, and it looks as though we are going to continue to see strong growth. That is because of poli-cies that were enacted here, and I think they are making a difference. I am going to talk about something today that actually is making it more difficult to find the workers to be able to get that economy moving forward the way all of us would like to see be-cause as we have lower unemployment, as we have a growing workforce, we are seeing a number of Americans who are out of the workforce altogether. There is some new data from the De-partment of Labor and from the Brook-ings Institution, some studies that have shown that between the opioid epidemic—which is heroin, prescription drugs, now this new fentanyl—and other issues, there are people who are not showing up even to apply for jobs. They are not even showing up in the unemployment figures, and they are at historically high levels—81⁄2million men between the ages of 25 and 55, so able-bodied men between 25 and 55. This recent study from both the De-partment of Labor and from the Brook-ings Institution shows that almost one- half of those men acknowledge taking pain medication on a daily basis. In one of the studies, when pushed, two- thirds of those men said that they were taking prescription drug medication on a daily basis. Think about that. This is shocking: 8
1⁄2million men out of work between the ages of 25 and 55—about one-half of them are saying that they are taking pain medication on a daily basis; two-thirds are taking prescrip-tion drugs. That is not overreported. In my view, that is underreported because there are legal issues involved with the opioid epidemic. Also, there is a stigma attached to the addiction. So in order to fully take advantage of this growing economy—and my col-league is absolutely right about that— we have to deal with this opioid epi-demic. I will tell you something that is even more tragic is that the Centers for Dis-ease Control just came out with a new report last week talking about what is happening around the country, and it was another year of tragic results for American families, for communities represented by Members all across the country here in the U.S. Senate. This was the Centers for Disease Con-trol. The new report shows that last year—they just got the final numbers for it—the number of people who overdosed and died from the opioid cri-sis that we have was greater than the year before, not just at record levels but at levels that really create this epi-demic level. Seventy-two thousand Americans died of overdoses last year. This is the map that shows where it is, and it is all over our country. There were a couple of States that made some progress. Those are the States in pur-ple here. But in all of these other States, you actually see an increase— overall a 9-percent increase in overdose deaths in our country from 2016 to 2017. The problem is not getting better; it is getting worse. My own State of Ohio increased 9.5 percent from 2016 to 2017. Sadly, that puts Ohio third in the country for total drug overdoses and fourth nationally for the number of overdose deaths per capita, per 100,000 residents. Seventy-two thousand Americans dying of overdoses—that is more than the deadliest year for car accidents or gun deaths ever. Now, 72,000 Americans died last year by overdose. That is more than the total number of Amer-ican casualties in the Vietnam war. Re-member that this is just 1 year—just last year. Overdoses are now the top cause of accidental death in the United States and the No. 1 cause of all deaths for all Americans under the age of 50. The most recent CDC report illus-trates something a lot of us already knew. This is a national crisis, and it is gripping every single State represented in this Chamber. By the way, this is de-spite a lot of good work that has been done by this body, by the House, and by the administration. Over the last couple of years, Con-gress has taken on this issue. We passed legislation that is helping. One of the pieces of legislation is called the Comprehensive Addiction and Recov-ery Act, or CARA legislation, which I coauthored with a colleague on the other side, SHELDON WHITEHOUSE . The other one is called the Cures Act, which is funding going directly to the States. By the way, Ohio just got an-other $26 million this year from the Cures Act, and we are putting it to work. In the appropriations bill that is before this body now in the Labor-HHS bill, we again provide funding for the CARA legislation, which does funding directly to groups that are doing a good job on prevention, education, treatment and recovery. It also helps our firefighters and other first respond-ers with the miracle drug Narcan that they need to reverse the effects of an overdose. It is all good, and it is work-ing. I was recently back home and had a chance to visit, as I do regularly, some of the institutions and some of the en-tities that are using this funding. Just to give an example, I went to a town called Whitehall, outside of Columbus, OH. We had a roundtable at a fire sta-tion, and I got to see what is going on. They are taking this grant money and training their EMS personnel—the fire-fighters and paramedics—to be able to handle people coming in who are ad-dicted and get them into treatment. This firehouse has opened up its doors, no questions asked. If you come in there, they will get you treatment. While I was there, coincidentally, a young man showed up. He had been through treatment three times, and it hadn’t worked for him. He said he was ready—ready to go. He was shaking and he was nervous, but I watched the firefighter deal with him. They spoke to him, and I spoke to him. I saw him get into the ambulance and go to another entity that is called the Addiction Stabilization Center in downtown Columbus, which is also doing innovative work and is also fund-ed by these programs, in this case with the Cures Act funding. It is an old hos-pital they converted into a 50-bed treatment center with an emergency center. So people can come in from the street, and they have a place to go into treatment immediately. It takes away the excuse. They have about an 80-per-cent rate of people getting into treat-ment. That is incredibly high. One of the big problems with the cur-rent crisis is that people who are ad-dicted and who overdose and are saved by this miracle drug Narcan, which re-verses the effects of the overdose, typi-cally then go right back into the same environment. How do you get them

into treatment? How do you get them back on track? How do you keep them in treatment? How do you ensure that treatment is successful? That is what the CARA and Cures legislation is help-ing to do. I will say that despite the positive stories back home, despite the addi-tional effort we have put in, still there is this data from the Centers for Dis-ease Control and Prevention showing that last year was worse than the year before. Why is that so despite the ef-forts in Congress and at every level of government? In all of our communities something is being done. People are starting to step forward. The private sector is starting to get more engaged. That is all good. I think the primary reason for this is because of the rise of a particular drug—the new scourge. It is the syn-thetic form of opioids. Just as we were making progress in reducing some of these overdoses and deaths and dealing with the terrible consequences of the opioid epidemic, what happened? We saw a steep increase in a new drug coming into the market. It is more deadly—50 times more deadly than her-oin—and it is relatively inexpensive. That is a fatal combination for thou-sands of our constituents who are dying every year now from the fastest growing and deadliest drug in this epi-demic—fentanyl. This breaks down the types of drugs and the type of drug and the increase or decrease. The one trend that stands out, as you see here, is the growth in synthetic opioids. In fact, with regard to other drugs, including heroin, you can see a slight decrease—basically, a flattening. For other opioids, there is an increase and, then, a slight flattening. With regard to synthetic opioids, there is a steep increase, and there is a steep increase recently. Last year there were 30,000 overdose deaths from synthetic drugs like fentanyl. That is up from approxi-mately 20,000 overdose deaths from fentanyl the year earlier. So there are 10,000 more deaths from fentanyl be-tween 2016 and 2017. To give you an idea of how rapidly this drug is infiltrating our country, in 2013 there were about 3,000 fentanyl overdose deaths nationally. This means that from 2013 to 2017, there has been an 850-percent increase in overdose deaths due to fentanyl. Last year, fentanyl was involved in more than 60 percent of the 48,600 over-dose deaths that the CDC says were from opioids. In my State of Ohio, we think that is consistent. We think it is over 60 percent, or closer to two-thirds. Looking at the new data coming in this year from Ohio from the various health departments around the State and from our coroners, it looks like it is an even higher percentage in 2018. When I am home I hear about this a lot. People come up to me and tell me stories that will break your heart about family members. I have had two tele-townhall meetings in the last month, and both of these involved thousands of Ohioans. People aren’t se-lected for anything other than that they get a phone call and they are asked if they want to talk to their Sen-ator. We pick up the phone and we have 15,000 to 20,000 people on the call, and in both of these last two tele-townhall meetings, somebody called in with a very similar story—a tragic story about the pain and suffering they expe-rienced from a loved one passing away from a fentanyl overdose. Pauline from Zanesville called in, and she told me her brother had re-cently passed away. She wondered what we were doing about it. Sam from Shelby County called at the next town-hall meeting and told me that his son had tragically overdosed from fentanyl and died. By the way, in both of those cases, they didn’t mention that up front. They called and had a discussion with me about some policy issues, and it just kind of came out. Their voices cracked. You could tell when they are overcome with emotion at the end of our conversation. They said: Well, my son—in this guy’s case—just died from an overdose of fentanyl. By the way, in both cases, the broth-er and the son did not know they had taken fentanyl. They didn’t know they had used fentanyl. In one case, with re-gard to the brother, he thought it was only cocaine that he was using. In-stead, it was laced with fentanyl. In the other case, it was heroin, and the person had shot up heroin before and been successful in not dying of an over-dose, at least, but in this case fentanyl was laced in the heroin. Now I tell you this because this new deadly drug is not just about pure fentanyl. It is about evil dealers and drug traffickers actually mixing the fentanyl with other drugs as well. When the coroners’ reports come in, often they are finding out it is fentanyl, not the drug the person thought he or she was taking. I had first responders telling me that some-body wakes up and says: Thank you for saving my life on this Narcan. I am OK now. Unfortunately, that is not what you hope would happen. You hope they will say: I want to go into treatment. But they wake up, after having been saved by Narcan, and they say: I don’t know why I overdosed, because I wasn’t taking a strong drug. They are told: Well, this tested for fentanyl. They say: Well, I wasn’t taking fentanyl. That is because now any street drug—any street drug—that is taken has the risk of containing fentanyl, which can be deadly. I hope people who are listening today tell everyone they can think of—at work, in their family, people in the community—just to be sure that this message is getting out. This is a new and deadly threat out on our streets, and it can be in any drug. We want to turn the tide in this drug epidemic that is depriving the people I represent and the people represented by this Chamber of their God-given purpose in life, whatever it is. It cer-tainly isn’t to overdose and die from opioids. We have to confront much more aggressively this rise of fentanyl. This is the reality. None of us wish it were, but it is. Shockingly, when you do research on this, you will find out that these syn-thetic drugs come into our country from other countries directly through the U.S. mail system. That is what law enforcement folks have told us—shock-ing. It is not mostly coming from any place except foreign countries sending it through the U.S. mail system. That is where the majority of this is coming from. We looked into this issue on the Per-manent Subcommittee on Investiga-tions. I chair that subcommittee. We spent 18 months studying this. We found out how easy it was to purchase fentanyl online and have it shipped to the United States of America. We learned through this 18-month under-cover investigation that these drugs can be found through a simple Google search and that overseas sellers essen-tially guaranteed delivery if the fentanyl was sent through a Federal agency—the U.S. Postal Service. We found out from talking to law en-forcement and our own research that this drug is primarily coming from China—one country—where there are scientists and chemical companies that are putting together this deadly mix-ture and are sending it to our shores. Why do the traffickers prefer the U.S. Postal Service? Because it has lower screening standards than the other private carriers. International packages that enter the United States are subject to screening. Every private entity—such as FedEx, UPS, DHL, or others—has to provide law enforcement with advanced electronic data as to where the package is from, what is in the package, and where it is going. With that data, they can use big data from around the country and around the world, including from intelligence sources, and they can help to identify suspicious packages. Otherwise it is like finding a needle in a haystack. The post office, by the way, brings about 900 million packages a year into the country. It is like finding a needle in a haystack, unless you have that in-formation in advance and electroni-cally. It allows Customs and Border Protection, which are doing the best job they can, to identify those sus-picious packages, to stop them in tran-sit, to keep these synthetic drugs out of our communities, and to stop the poison. I have seen them in action. I have visited the Customs and Border Protec-tion port of entry and have seen how they can get packages. They have to take these packages into a sealed room that has adequate ventilation, and they have to wear protective gear to be

able to even open these packages be-cause this stuff is so deadly. I have been to Columbus, OH, and I have seen there, in one of these dis-tribution centers for one of the private carriers—not Customs and Border Pro-tection—people putting their lives on the line for us and finding deadly pack-ages and taking them offline to avoid this poison coming into our commu-nity. Law enforcement, as you can imagine, is desperate to stop these deadly drugs from reaching our shores in the first place. That is the best way to stop it. They need this critical infor-mation in advance to be able to do that. Why doesn’t the post office do it? Be-cause we haven’t required them to. By law, after 9/11, we have required all pri-vate carriers to provide this informa-tion. Frankly, we were more focused on explosives than we were on contraband such as drugs. But we didn’t require the U.S. Postal Service. Instead, we said: Study this issue and get back to us. That was 16 years ago. For the last several years, some of us have been pushing the U.S. Postal Service hard on this, and unfortunately, some still continue to oppose this effort to pro-vide 100 percent electronic data. Because of congressional pressure, they have recently been getting more data on some of these packages. Based on testimony before our subcommittee, last year the Postal Service received electronic data in advance on about 36 percent of the packages that came in, meaning that the United States re-ceived more than 318 million inter-national packages with no or little screening. Even when the post office conducted these pilot programs to screen for the drugs to get to the 36 percent number, 80 percent of the time they presented the packages to Customs and Border Protection and 20 percent of the time they did not present the package. So only 30 percent of the time was screen-ing being provided, and still in 20 per-cent of those cases, they didn’t present the packages to Customs and Border Protection. Instead, they went into cir-culation in our community. We have a simple solution: 100 per-cent screening. This is a deadly epi-demic. Can you imagine tens of thousands of people dying from something that comes in from overseas through our own U.S. Postal Service and we are not stepping up to say: Whoa, let’s do ev-erything we can to screen these pack-ages. The best monitoring devices, the best information—that is what we are asking for. The legislation we have is called the STOP Act. It is a bipartisan bill that I authored with my colleague A
MYKLO-
BUCHAR from Minnesota. It closes the loophole from the U.S. Postal Service that drug traffickers are using and ex-ploiting to ship these deadly drugs into our communities. By holding the Post-al Service to the same standard as pri-vate carriers and requiring them to provide that advance electronic data for all international packages entering the United States of America, we can keep the fentanyl out of our commu-nities. By the way, talk to your letter car-rier about this issue. They will tell you they want to stop this. They don’t want to be carrying this poison. The person who walks door-to-door in your community or delivers mail to your post office does not want to have fentanyl in their package. First, it is dangerous for them, but more impor-tant to them is that they know what it is doing to our communities. They don’t want to be any part of it. The STOP Act passed the House of Representatives earlier this summer, and more than one-third of the Sen-ators in this Chamber are now cospon-sors of this legislation. In my view, it is long past time for the Senate to pass this legislation so that it can become law and begin to make a real difference in our communities. I would like to thank President Trump for his leadership on this issue. Some of you may have seen yesterday that he sent out a statement—a tweet—supporting moving ahead with the STOP Act because of the scourge of this fentanyl coming into our neigh-borhoods, coming into our commu-nities, our homes. He recognized the importance of this issue, by the way, and talked about it during the 2016 campaign and has talked about it a lot since then. He appointed an opioid commission to look into this issue. That commission endorsed the STOP Act specifically. I want to thank Gov-ernor Christie for working with us on that. That was the final report in No-vember of last year, and still we have not passed it. On Monday, when President Trump called on the Senate to pass this legis-lation without delay, I noticed there was more interest and reporters talk-ing about this issue in the halls. I am glad about that. The President is wait-ing, pen in hand. He is ready to sign the STOP Act. Let’s not make him wait any longer. Last year, an average of 81 Ameri-cans died every single day from syn-thetic opioids. From what I can tell back home, this year is no better and may, in fact, be worse. We can’t wait around for this problem to get worse. We can’t do nothing. We have to do something. The legislation we passed here to help with prevention, treat-ment, and recovery is good. It is begin-ning to work. But we also need to re-duce the supply and at least increase the cost of this deadly drug, which is 50 times more powerful than heroin. We need to pass the STOP Act. We need to pass it now so we can make a meaning-ful difference in combating fentanyl, the new scourge of this opioid epi-demic. I yield back my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Kansas. Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. REMEMBERING ED ROLFS  
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, yester-day, my wife Robba and I attended the funeral services of Ed Rolfs of Junction City, KS. I come today to pay honor to this Kansan, to this great individual, and pay tribute to his contributions to his community and to our State. Mr. Rolfs was born on December 13, 1924, in Junction City, KS, where he lived his entire life. He attended school there and graduated from Junction City High School. He then attended the University of Kansas for his under-graduate degree and later received de-grees from Columbia University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Ed was a lifelong student and was al-ways busy. He was an avid reader and researcher. He studied financial mar-kets and economic trends. He also stuck to his roots as a farmer, and he worked on the family farm until his passing this week. The community and State know him as a strong supporter of schools and education. He continually supported scholarships and mentored many young men and women in the Junction City area. He was a banker, and he began his ca-reer at the bank his father first started in 1915—Central National Bank. In 1967, Ed was promoted. He was named presi-dent of the bank, and he served in that capacity for over 25 years. He saw a great deal of growth and expansion in the bank as it spread into communities across the State and region. He was a president of a big bank, but he was a president of a community bank that had relationships with its customers. The banking community knew him to be a visionary leader, and he was, by many accounts, described as having a brilliant mind. His impact on the bank was more than just the bottom line; he took care and focused on his employees and their success. Ed was a dedicated member of the Junction City community. Junction City is a community that is surrounded by Fort Riley. It is a community that understands the importance of civic en-gagement and understands the impor-tance of caring for those who serve our Nation and whose families often re-main behind while that service occurs. He was active in his community. It is what you, Mr. President, and I know about many communities across our States in which people devote a significant amount of their time to making sure that good things happen at home. It is also a generational thing where you see those the age of Ed make certain that their lives are more than just their careers. Ed had been a member of the Rotary Club since 1950. He joined the Masonic Union Lodge in 1953. He had held the post of president of both the Rotary Club and the Junction City Chamber of

Commerce. He was engaged with the Highland Cemetery Association as president; the Central Charities Foun-dation, where he was chairman; and he was a treasurer and trustee of the Kan-sas Council for Economic Education. I have known Ed for many years. I, as well as those who honored him at his funeral service yesterday, described him as a humble man, despite his many successes, who kept quiet about those accomplishments. Over his lifetime, he received many awards, ranging from the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year to the Kansas Governor’s Art Award in 2007. He served his country, in addition to his community. It makes us proud that he was a veteran of both World War II and the Korean conflict. He was a 73- year member of the American Legion Post No. 45. Serving and sacrificing for others is simply who Ed Rolfs was. Ed had a deep understanding of the temporary nature of life. He was a de-voted and lifelong member of the First Presbyterian Church, where he served in various roles—as treasurer, member of the choir, trustee, and Sunday school teacher. A dedicated family man and loving husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, Ed leaves behind his wife, Eunice, of nearly 70 years. I would use this as an opportunity to indicate to my colleagues that Eunice is the daughter of Frank Carlson, former Governor and U.S. Senator from Kan-sas. They were married for nearly 70 years. He has three children, four grandchildren, and four great-grand-children. One of the things I observe in judging a person on their abilities, their char-acter, who they are as a human being, is what their family is like. In any dealings I ever had with Ed Rolfs and his family, I knew he was good at what was really important in life. He raised a good family. He and Eunice raised a good family. Ed represents the kinds of values on which our State was built. His sense of care and compassion and his service to his community, his country, his church, and his family have made the world and our part of the world a bet-ter place. He had a vision for a stronger community and a more prosperous Kansas. He will continue to inspire me personally. Another observation is that my at-tendance at the funeral services yester-day caused me to remind myself that you hope the people who come to your funeral service are there because they admire and respect you and honor you and the life you lived. Ed had signifi-cant responsibility and a significant position in the community, but it is unusual to see so many people of all ages at a funeral. It wasn’t about his position; it was about his relationship with those he knew and cared about. In the coming weeks, Robba and I will continue to keep Ed and his wife Eunice, along with their family and friends, in our prayers. As they cele-brated his life at the funeral services on Monday, may we continue to live our lives in a way that honors the way he lived his life. May Ed Rolfs rest in peace. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF BRETT KAVANAUGH  
Mr. INHOFE. After the announce-ment that was made this morning—it was a great announcement, long await-ed—I think it is appropriate that we talk a little bit about it. When Trump withdrew from the Paris Agreement and pulled back from the Clean Power Plan, we heard from the environmental extremists and the liberals declaring that the administration’s actions will ‘‘endanger public health, our environ-ment and our economic prosperity.’’ That was Governors Brown and Cuomo. They further declared that ‘‘if we don’t decarbonize our future, people are going to die.’’ People are always going to die. That is what the extremists al-ways say. I guess there must be a popu-lation out there that actually believes that. However, the opposite is happening even without a one-sided international agreement or the punishing Clean Power Plan. In effect, in 2017, the United States led the world in CO
2re-ductions, while China and India led the world in increasing CO
2emissions. How many people know that? All you ever hear about is that we are the guilty one in terms of our emissions. That is not true at all. Just think, both China and India led the world in increasing CO
2emissions. These are the guys our previous President, Barack Obama, would have us believe were actually making great sacrifices, and here they are leading in increasing CO
2emis-sions. When we passed tax reform, the Democrats claimed we would experi-ence ‘‘Armageddon’’—N
ANCY PELOSI  said that—and taxes on middle-class families would increase. As we have seen, tax reform has been a resounding success, with 4 percent unemployment and nearly 4.1 percent GDP growth in the last quarter. Right after Congresswoman P
ELOSI  made the statement that taxes would increase on all middle-class families, the Washington Post fact-checked the Democratic claims, giving them four Pinocchios, as 80 percent of middle- class families are paying less in taxes. In other words, 80 percent of middle- class families are paying less in taxes now than they were. Yet she was say-ing that taxes on all middle-class fami-lies were going to have to increase. You hear these things—they can’t look at success and see what is hap-pening and really appreciate it without rousing everyone on the other side with extreme accusations. With every Executive order and Congressional Re-view Act resolution that rolled back regulation after burdensome regula-tion, we heard that the end of days was coming. Let’s pause here for a minute and see how you get rid of some of these regu-lations. There are two ways of getting rid of regulations. One is you do it with an Executive order. Sometimes that doesn’t work. You can’t use an Execu-tive order in certain types of regula-tion, so you have to go with the Con-gressional Review Act. It is kind of interesting because we started the Congressional Review Act over 20 years ago. Prior to this admin-istration, it had been used successfully only once in 20 years; now it happens almost every day. With every Executive order and Con-gressional Review Act resolution roll-ing back the regulations, we heard that the end of the world was coming. You would not know it if you looked at the economy and saw what is happening in this country today with the increases in energy production, manufacturing, consumer confidence, GDP, and job op-portunities. Meanwhile, jobless claims have dropped to a 45-year low—a 45-year low of jobless claims this year—and the So-cial Security disability claims last year were the lowest we have seen since 2002. I think it is kind of interesting to go back and look at the fact that we have 4 percent unemployment. For as long as I can remember, I have always con-sidered 4 percent unemployment full employment. There are always going to be some unemployables, but 4 percent is considered to be full employment, and that is what we have. It is kind of interesting. I was in Texas last week, talking to one of my liberal friends down there. I said: What can you say now? Look at the econ-omy. The economy has never been bet-ter. He said: No, the economy is bad. It is hard to find anyone to work in res-taurants anymore. In other words, we have full employ-ment, but that is supposed to be bad. That is the position we are in right now. In the last quarter, we had 4.1 per-cent growth in the economy. Let’s stop and think about that. This is some-thing that no one disagrees with. For every 1 percent growth in economic ac-tivity, that translates into $2.9 trillion of new income coming into the Federal Government every 10 years. Let’s stop and think about it. We have a President who is trying to undo the damage from the last administra-tion when the military was cut down to the bone and we didn’t do anything in the way of infrastructure. This Presi-dent is committed to that. People are saying: All right, where is the money going to come from?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5750 August 21, 2018 
There is where it is going to come from. My gosh, if we can average just 3 percent growth—and we have been doing that; we are far exceeding that— that is going to be close to $6 trillion of new funding that will be there for the next administration. With each action the President takes, we hear that the consequences are going to be dire and that people will die. It is always that people will die. Yet those predictions have never materialized. We have seen the oppo-site happen. When it comes to President Trump’s pick to replace Justice Kennedy on the Supreme Court, the predictions are just as hysterical. If there is not any logical reason to be against something, they just start name-calling. That is what has been happening. In a recent speech, Hillary Clinton worried that with the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, Republicans ‘‘want to turn the clock back . . . to the 1850s.’’ That came from Hillary Clinton. Her meaning was very clear. She wants people to believe that Judge Kavanaugh and the Republicans are taking the country back to the days of slavery, despite no evidence to back up this reckless claim. In fact, Repub-licans want more freedom, not less. Others are equally as bold in their predictions in saying that his con-firmation will be the death—listen to this—the death of millions, that his confirmation will be the destruction of the Constitution, and that his con-firmation will usher in the end of civil rights in America and make us complicit in evil. In other words, it will be the death of millions of Americans. Who, logically, can even look at that without smiling and saying that they have to be totally desperate in the ac-cusations they are making against this guy? All of these baseless and extreme attacks on his nomination mean just one thing—that Judge Kavanaugh is an excellent pick for the Supreme Court. After meeting with him last week, looking into his record, and reading about his character—some of the sto-ries that I have heard from other peo-ple—it is clear that he is a solid choice to become our newest Supreme Court Justice. With 12 years on the DC Court of Appeals, Judge Kavanaugh has amassed a record of over 300 opinions, and the worst opposition research we have seen against him so far is that he charged baseball tickets to his credit card and then paid for them. By all accounts, from those who know him, Judge Kavanaugh is a re-spected member of his community and of his profession. Professionally, he is known as a serious jurist who studies the law and is evenhanded in applying the law. In his op-ed for the New York Times, entitled ‘‘A Liberal’s Case for Brett Kavanaugh,’’ Yale Law professor Akhil Reed Amar made this statement: ‘‘Good appellate judges faithfully fol-low the Supreme Court; great ones in-fluence and help steer it.’’ He was re-ferring to Judge Kavanaugh. By this measure, Judge Kavanaugh has been a great appellate judge. He ranks second among the current judges who have law clerks who have gone on to clerk for the U.S. Supreme Court. More impressively, the Supreme Court has agreed with the positions that Judge Kavanaugh took in the last 13 of his opinions, adopting his logic in the prevailing opinion before the Court. In other words, they came down on his side in the cases that he had de-cided in the last 13 of his opinions. Nine of those times, the Supreme Court adopted his dissenting opinion as their majority opinion. In fact, he has been reversed by the Supreme Court only once and only in part. Of those dissenting opinions by Judge Kavanaugh that the Supreme Court adopted as their own, one of them in-cludes his dissent in Coalition for Re-sponsible Regulation v. EPA, in which he concluded that the EPA defined ‘‘air pollution’’ too broadly in its regula-tions on greenhouse gas emissions. He viewed the Obama EPA’s burdensome greenhouse gas regulations for power-plants as exceeding its authority and argued that the courts should ‘‘not lightly conclude that Congress in-tended’’ to ‘‘impose the enormous costs on tens of thousands of American busi-nesses, with corresponding effects on American jobs and workers.’’ Again, the Supreme Court agreed with him. They were on his side. This opinion is also instructive to see his thinking on the proper role of the courts in our system of government. In his opinion, he wrote: ‘‘As a court, it is not our job to make the policy choices and set the statutory boundaries, but it is emphatically our job to carefully but firmly enforce the statutory bound-aries.’’ This is a consistent part of his jurisprudence. Because of his position on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Kavanaugh has had many opportuni-ties to check the Federal Government’s overreach. I served as chairman of the Environment and Public Works Com-mittee for quite a number of years, and one of the big problems we had at that time was that the bureaucrats were ac-tually making the determinations. This is where he has actually overruled the bureaucracy many times. In fact, he has overruled Federal agency ac-tions 75 times in his 12 years on the bench. That is really saying something. When the EPA wanted to impose massive emissions regulations but did not want to consider the costs, Judge Kavanaugh rejected that effort in White Stallion Energy Center v. EPA. The Supreme Court agreed. In the case of EME Homer City Gen-eration v. EPA, Judge Kavanaugh held that the Obama EPA’s cross-state air pollution rule was awful and imposed excessive regulatory burdens on the States. He also rejected the Department of the Interior’s position to designate 143 acres of plaintiff’s property as critical habitat for a shrimp based ‘‘on a single 2001 sighting of four ant-sized San Diego fairy shrimp’’ on the property. They would shut that down. He re-versed it. These are just a few examples of Judge Kavanaugh’s efforts to ensure that our agencies are acting and regu-lating within their authorizing stat-utes and the U.S. Constitution. This is the real reason we are seeing such vitriol from the left. They have long used our courts and our agencies to impose their unpopular agenda, mostly because they couldn’t get it through Congress, as the majority of Americans recognized how stifling and burdensome their agenda is. Having another judge on the Su-preme Court who recognizes the proper role of the courts and the agencies when it comes to setting policy that af-fects all Americans threatens their ability to force costly, ineffective, un-popular burdens on our economy, our job producers, and our landowners. With Judge Kavanaugh on the court, we will preserve the U.S. Constitution and our system of representative gov-ernment for decades to come. As I told Brett in our meeting—he has been good enough to go around and have meetings with all of the Members of the Senate. As a matter of fact, I told him that, from his reputation, he didn’t need to waste his time with me because I knew all about him, and I was going to support him. As I told him during that meeting, though, his nomination and the work President Trump and the Senate have done to process judicial nominations are to save our country, not for me but for my 20 kids and grandkids. So I look forward to the confirma-tion. We are going to hear more of the accusations, more of the extreme left making comments about this great ju-dicial success. I look forward to having him there for many years to come. I am convinced that it is going to hap-pen. With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

planes, vehicles, and other equipment they need to defend our country. The bipartisan bill reported out of the committee reaffirms the strategic importance of our Navy and our ship-building programs by including funding for three Arleigh Burke-class destroy-ers in fiscal year 2019, while also in-cluding $250 million in advance pro-curement funding for an additional de-stroyer in fiscal year 2020. This funding signals our strong belief that the Navy should sustain an aggressive rate of growth for large surface combatants in fiscal year 2020 and beyond in order to project strength in an increasingly dangerous and complex world. In recognition of national security imperatives, the Navy’s own 2016 fleet structure assessment increased the tar-get number for large surface combat-ants to 104 ships from the 88 ships called for under the previous 308-ship Navy requirement. Maintaining a steady and predictable production pro-file for large ships will not only protect the help of our shipbuilding industrial base but also ensure that the Navy maintains an adequate number of these ships into the future. In Maine, we are very proud of the vital role Bath Iron Works plays in contributing to our national security by building and maintaining ships for the fleet. BIW is known throughout the fleet for the high quality of its ships that are built there, with many Sailors using the motto ‘‘Bath built is best built.’’ BIW employs the finest ship-builders, engineers, and designers in the world. This bill rightly recognizes the great value that these tried and tested warships bring to the Navy. I am also proud of the continued in-vestment this bill makes at our Na-tion’s public shipyards. The additional $350 million provided for facility sustainment, research, restoration, and modernization, as well as the $176 mil-lion for shipyard investment accelera-tion, will help the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, ME, and other public shipyards keep our Nation’s sub-marines at sea for years to come. This bill also makes critical invest-ments in research and development programs that are being carried out in partnership with research institutions such as the University of Maine. These programs include producing jet fuel from Maine’s forest biomass, using structural thermoplastics for Army ground vehicles, conducting cellulose nanocomposite research for the Army, developing hybrid composite structures for the Navy, and participating in the Navy’s advanced hull form develop-ment initiative, among many other es-sential research and development projects. Our legislation invests in cutting edge, fifth generation aircraft by fund-ing 89 F–35 aircraft. These state-of-the- art planes are truly the future of avia-tion, and I am proud of Pratt & Whit-ney’s contributions to this program through its construction of the F135 engine at its facility in North Berwick, ME. Additionally, our legislation procures eight heavy-lift helicopters for the Ma-rine Corps. The rotating drive shafts are a critical component of this air-craft and are produced at Hunting Dearborn’s facility in Fryeburg, ME. The National Guard, as the Presiding Officer is well aware, provides our country with both a strategic and oper-ational reserve which has proven itself time and again. I applaud the bill’s inclusion of pro-viding $900 million to the National Guard and Reserve equipment account to modernize our Reserve Forces and ensure their full interoperability with the Active-Duty Force. Finally, the committee report en-sures that Congress has sufficient over-sight over any efforts to close or re-align facilities of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service. DFAS, as it is called, maintains a highly efficient fa-cility in Limestone, ME. It is respon-sible for payments to our servicemem-bers, DOD employees, vendors, and con-tractors. Given this critical responsi-bility, I applaud the work done by the hundreds of hard-working employees at Limestone, and I welcome their contin-ued support of our Armed Forces. I am very pleased that we are pro-ceeding the Defense appropriations bill, as well as the Labor-HHS appro-priations legislation. I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass both bills in one package this week. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous con-sent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS  
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this week marks the continuation of a bi-partisan effort to actually do the work we were elected to do. The New York Times recently pub-lished an article that said the Senate got its groove back. I don’t know if I would go that far, but certainly we are making some progress when it comes to these important funding bills. These two appropriation bills are two of the largest ones in the Federal Gov-ernment. One, of course, is for the De-partment of Defense which, appro-priately, is the No. 1 priority of the Federal Government—to maintain the peace and keep our Nation safe. The other funds the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Edu-cation. After we pass these bills this week, which we will, we will have passed 9 of the 12 appropriations bills, which cover 87 percent of discretionary spending. I might add that when I mention dis-cretionary spending, it is noteworthy that about 70 percent of what the Fed-eral Government spends is not discre-tionary spending. It is mandatory spending, which is another story in and of itself. But insofar as the Congress’s respon-sibility to appropriate the funds in dis-cretionary spending, we will have cov-ered about 87 percent of that. I want to express my gratitude again to Chairman SHELBY and Vice Chair-man L
EAHY for their efforts in facili-tating such a relatively smooth process on all of our appropriations bills so far. They have done a good job of managing the bills and, even more importantly, of managing the people and preventing this process from devolving into a quagmire, as it occasionally does. To give you an idea of how difficult this can be, it bears mentioning that it has been 15 years since the Senate last passed the Labor-Health-Education bill in time for the start of the fiscal year. So hats off to Mr. S
HELBY and Mr. L
EAHY . As the majority leader, Senator M
CCONNELL , said yesterday, these two bills represent big strides toward avoiding another omnibus, which the President said he wanted to do, and ap-propriating the taxpayers’ money the right way. The funding bills we are working on this week are important, but they are not the only developments worth not-ing. Remember, recently we heard that in the second quarter of this year—the second 3-month period of this year— our economy grew at an astounding 4.1 percent after years of economic stagna-tion and wages that never seemed to go up. We were able to pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act at the end of last year, which helped provide a needed stimulus to the economy by putting more money into the pockets of the people who earned it. We were successful in low-ering rates across the board and dou-bled the child tax credit and standard deduction. Over the last 9 months, my constitu-ents in Texas have been writing to me about the effect it has had on their lives. These are men and women like Virginia Davis, a small business owner who said the changes will help keep ex-penses down and help her company buy new equipment. Then there is Suzan Casey, a widow in New Braunfels, TX, which is north of San Antonio, who is working part time even when facing health issues. She wrote and said that she appreciated our efforts at reform-ing our outdated Tax Code and that every little bit helps, especially when she has been saving up the money to go visit her grandson in California. In Texas, our economy has been ro-bust for a long time now. We heard that last month, more than 23,000 jobs were added—the 25th consecutive month of job growth in my home State. In some places, such as Midland in the Permian Basin, which is the center of the universe when it comes to oil and gas production, it seems, the unem-ployment rate was as low as 2.2 per-cent. It is hard to find anybody who will work in the Permian Basin, in the

Midland-Odessa area, because the econ-omy is so strong that every able-bod-ied, willing worker is essentially em-ployed. These are positive signs, al-though obviously there are stresses and strains that go along with it. Tax reform and the good economic news are complemented by other legis-lative victories we have had on behalf of the American people during this Congress. We funded rebuilding efforts fol-lowing natural disasters, such as Hurri-cane Harvey. We enacted the Fix NICS Act and the STOP School Violence Act to help pro-tect Americans from gun violence. We delivered real healthcare choices to American veterans with the VA MISSION Act. We passed occupational licensing re-form, as well as banking reform, which helped our small banks, credit unions, and community banks get rid of some of the rules that never should have been applied to them in the first place because they weren’t the cause of the huge crisis that led to the great reces-sion just a few short years ago. It wasn’t the community banks—it was Wall Street and some of the overreach there—but community banks in small towns in and around Texas and else-where were the collateral damage. This last year and a half, we fought sex trafficking by passing legislation targeting internet predators, and we have worked hard and I think helped to reduce the rape kit backlog. We have confirmed a total of 53 judges this Congress, including 26 cir-cuit court judges, 26 district judges, and a Supreme Court Justice, Neil Gorsuch. 
NOMINATION OF BRETT KAVANAUGH  
Mr. President, 2 weeks from today, we will start the confirmation hearing of the next Supreme Court Justice we will consider, and that is Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated to succeed Justice Anthony Kennedy as an Associate Justice on the U.S. Su-preme Court. As I said, his hearing is set for the first week of September, and I hope we will move quickly to vote on his con-firmation after the hearing. His con-firmation process includes the largest production of documents ever in the Senate’s consideration of a Supreme Court nominee. I appreciate Chairman C
HUCK GRASSLEY ’s spearheading the ef-fort in such a transparent, efficient, and thorough manner. To see how a judge will behave once elevated to the Supreme Court, the best evidence of how they will perform their job is how they have performed as a lower court judge, as Judge Kavanaugh has been over the last 12 years in the DC Circuit Court of Ap-peals. The best way to find out about his judicial philosophy, his tempera-ment, and how he actually handles cases is to look at how he has done each of those things during the 12 years he has served on the DC Circuit. Yet we have heard some of our colleagues on the other side, including the minority leader and the former Judiciary chair-man, Senator LEAHY , who actually used to agree with us that the best way to evaluate a nominee—for example, during Justice Sotomayor’s hearing— was by looking at their judicial record, but now they have changed their tune. In Judge Kavanaugh’s case, what the rulings show consistently is that he is a diligent and thoughtful judge. His rulings are clear, they are impartial, and he strives to achieve justice in each one. Yesterday, I mentioned some of the cases in which Judge Kavanaugh’s opinions, whether written as part of the majority opinion or the dissent, were vindicated by an adoption of that position and that opinion, essentially, by the Supreme Court on a 9-to-0 basis, but I would like to talk about another couple of arguments that have now started to bubble up. As I like to say, a false charge unrebutted is sometimes a charge be-lieved, so we have to work hard to re-mind people that just because someone says something about Judge Kavanaugh’s record, it is not nec-essarily true. The first claim that has now popped up is that he is somehow an ‘‘anti- worker radical.’’ This is a phrase coined by the pundit Paul Krugman of the New York Times. It sounds pretty ugly. I guess it means that the judge is predisposed, when deciding cases, to find against employees and hard-work-ing men and women in favor of man-agement and big business. But the fact is, Judge Kavanaugh’s record indicates exactly the opposite. In one case, a pro se litigant had been terminated after filing a discrimina-tion complaint. Judge Kavanaugh joined the majority in a ruling for the employee, finding that a reasonable jury could have found unlawful dis-crimination, harassment, and retalia-tion against the plaintiff. That doesn’t sound like an anti-worker radical to me. Judge Kavanaugh wrote a separate concurrence that a racial epithet that may have been used could create a hos-tile work environment, even if uttered a single time. In another case, involving a terrible accident involving a trainer of a killer whale at a theme park, Judge Kavanaugh did not simply defer to large corporate interests. In fact, the strict question of liability, which would have implicated State and Fed-eral tort law, was not even before him, nor was the question of whether the work environment at the theme park was unreasonably dangerous. Instead, the question before the court and be-fore Judge Kavanaugh was one of ad-ministrative law. Judge Kavanaugh argued persua-sively that a Federal agency had ig-nored congressional intent when inter-preting a statute in self-serving ways to give itself, the Federal agency, au-thority that Congress had not con-ferred. He argued that this agency had made arbitrary distinctions between different kinds of sporting and enter-tainment events and departed from longstanding agency precedent. That actually was the crux of his decision, despite the mischaracterization from some of the critics. We can count on Judge Kavanaugh to appropriately consider overreach by the administrative state and to enforce the rule of law that protects both cor-porations and individual workers. I think we have plenty evidence of that. One additional line of attack is that the judge has somehow been insuffi-ciently protective of Fourth Amend-ment privacy rights, but one expert at the libertarian Cato Institute who has analyzed the judge’s record in detail found that Judge Kavanaugh is a ‘‘big step forward for constitutional lib-erty.’’ Among other things, this expert noted that Judge Kavanaugh had been a leading advocate of interpreting stat-utes to include robust mens rea protec-tion. In other words, in criminal stat-utes, before you can be convicted of a crime, you have to have criminal in-tent. That is mens rea. Judge Kavanaugh has authored 307 opinions on the DC Circuit and has at-tracted praise from across the ideolog-ical spectrum for the clarity of his thought and expression and the preci-sion of his legal reasoning. He respects the roles and responsibilities that are assigned to the different branches of our government by the Constitution, and he sees the proper role of the judi-ciary as a narrow one, albeit an impor-tant one. It does not make policy. It interprets the law and applies it to in-dividual cases, one at a time, impar-tially, with no eye toward the outcome or the politics of the case. The truth is, I believe that after the hearing we will have the week of Sep-tember 4, the American people will conclude, as I have concluded based on my knowledge of Judge Kavanaugh for the last 18 years, that he is an emi-nently qualified and well-respected ju-rist by all those who know him and are familiar with his work. I look forward to confirming him as a Justice early this fall, hopefully in time for the Oc-tober term of the Supreme Court, the first Monday in October. I yield the floor.

not to threaten career government em-ployees, and especially not to carry out political retribution. Virginia is home to tens of thousands of dedicated men and women who serve in our intelligence and defense commu-nities. Over the years, as Senator and vice chairman of the Intelligence Com-mittee, I have met literally thousands of FBI agents, CIA officers, military servicemembers, contractors, and other public servants who hold security clearances. These men and women work day in and day out, often thank-lessly, to keep America safe. Do you know what? I have no idea, amongst those Americans who have those security clearances, which of them are Democrats and which of them are Republicans, and that is the way our system is supposed to work. The Federal Government grants secu-rity clearances only to those individ-uals who can be trusted with our Na-tion’s secrets. Applicants go through intense, lengthy background checks, interviews, and even, in many cases, lie detector tests, not to mention exten-sive rechecks for suitability every few years. Only then, after this process, do we allow them to serve in some of the toughest intelligence and national se-curity jobs. We ask a great deal of these dedicated professionals, but what we don’t ask about are their political views. Since the mid-1990s, the Code of Fed-eral Regulations has governed the 13 criteria under which personnel are deemed eligible or ineligible for secu-rity clearances and access to classified information. Amongst those 13 reasons to actually get a security clearance or to lose a security clearance is included: allegiance to the United States, being subjected to foreign influence, finan-cial considerations, and others. When you look through that list of 13—and I have it over here—none of those cri-teria includes political speech, nor should they. Our national security is too important to infect with political partisanship. I believe that more than ever, in light of the President’s actions last week when this President revoked the clearance of former CIA Director Bren-nan and, equally important, if not more important, when he threatened to revoke the clearances of numerous former and even current national secu-rity professionals. These individuals collectively have hundreds of years of honorable service to our country under their belts. No one can seriously ques-tion their fitness or loyalty to this country. Unfortunately, what we know—which is what happened last week and which, unfortunately, happens too many times out of this White House—is that this is all about politics. According to media reports, White House officials have dis-cussed how to issue the revocations on a going-forward basis to other enumer-ated individuals to distract from bad news stories. I hope these reports of the White House’s plans are mistaken. True or not, we need only listen to the President’s words to know these ef-forts are politically motivated. I will admit I had missed the widely pub-licized press event at which the White House announced the President’s ‘‘en-emies’ list.’’ Yet anyone who looks at this list will notice some common fac-tors in that they all served in the pre-vious administration, and in the time since, several have exercised their First Amendment right to criticize this President for his policies. Many of those on the list have also had some in-volvement in the investigation into Russia’s assault on our democracy in 2016. For that—in many cases, for doing their jobs—they are now being pun-ished or will be potentially punished by this President and this White House. In the President’s own words, ‘‘These people led it . . . so I think it’s some-thing that had to be done.’’ This is truly a dangerous precedent. For the first time since President Ei-senhower created the security clear-ance process as we know it, the Presi-dent of the United States is abusing one of his most important national se-curity tools in order to punish his po-litical opponents. As one of my friends on the other side of the aisle men-tioned, it is something that would be more akin to something coming out of a banana republic. Perhaps even more troubling is the message this President is sending to those who are currently serving in gov-ernment service. It is pretty clear he is sending a message that says to think twice before working on anything this President doesn’t like, to think twice before you express a political opinion, even if it is in private. The White House broadcast this message loud and clear when it threatened to revoke the clearance of a midlevel employee at the Department of Justice. This is a clear attempt of intimi-dating others in the bureaucracy. If this President is successful in revoking this first wave of clearances, there is no question these actions will threaten the ongoing Russia investigation—an investigation that, again today, claimed two more guilty convictions, an investigation that has already re-sulted, prior to today, in 5 guilty pleas and 35 indictments. As I mentioned, today included the conviction of the President’s campaign manager. Unfortunately, the President’s ac-tions don’t just harm the individuals involved; these tactics threaten our na-tional security institutions them-selves. The Pentagon, the intelligence community, the FBI, the Department of Justice, and the rest of our national security structures depend on seasoned career professionals who do not act out of partisan motivations. Threatening their clearances—threatening their livelihoods and their families—is a clear attempt at undermining an ongo-ing, legitimate criminal investigation into what Russia did in 2016. If success-ful, the President’s actions threaten to politicize our national security institu-tions even more so than they have al-ready done. The President has significant author-ity as head of the executive branch, but there is widespread agreement that he should not be able to use these powers to get payback against Americans who criticize him. All of us in this body agree that no President should be able to order the IRS to audit political en-emies, and we all agree no President should be able to order wiretaps against those who displease him. We should also all agree that a President should not have the power to remove clearances for reasons that have noth-ing to do with national security and certainly not because an individual ex-presses his or her right to free speech. I ask my colleagues to support the Warner amendment. I ask the majority leader to make sure this amendment gets a fair vote, up or down, on the floor of the Senate because I believe the Senate must take a stand against any attempts to punish political speech or to threaten our national security professionals by arbitrarily taking away their security clearances. We currently have in place real and prudent guidelines for issuing and re-voking clearances, guidelines that are based on national security and not on political considerations. We cannot allow those to be supplemented by crass partisanship or attempts by this President to punish his enemies. We have come way too far from the dark days of Watergate to allow this type of attack against career professionals who have faithfully served our Nation with honor and dignity. We should de-mand better from this President. We can take that action by passing this amendment. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. R
UBIO). The Senator from Iowa. 
NOMINATION OF BRETT KAVANAUGH  
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as I have now for several weeks spoken to my colleagues about the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, I return to further elaborate on where we are in that process. Two weeks from today, Judge Brett Kavanaugh will appear before the Sen-ate Judiciary Committee for the first day of his confirmation hearing. I am quite excited to finally hear from him in that forum. He is one of the most qualified nominees to have ever been picked for the Supreme Court, and he has contributed a great deal to his community and the legal profession, besides being an outstanding judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. Apparently, the other side has found very little in his record that is objec-tionable. The only thing I keep hearing is their unprecedented demand for mil-lions and millions of pages of irrele-vant documents on top of the hundreds of thousands of pages we have already received. Indeed, the Senate Demo-cratic leaders have demanded the search of every email and every scrap of paper from every one of the hun-dreds of White House aides who came

and went for the entire 8 years of the George W. Bush Presidency. The Sen-ate Democratic leaders have even re-fused to utilize search terms—and other ways—in order to limit the uni-verse of millions and millions of pages of records that would require a con-secutive review by the Archives and both the former and incumbent Presi-dents’ teams of lawyers even before the Senate Judiciary Committee could have begun its own search. These re-views would have taken many months, and some people have said they would have taken beyond this year. We know the true reason for their unprecedented document demand, which is to deny Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation until after the midterm elections, when the Senate Democrats hope to win back the Senate and block Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination for-ever. Democratic leaders announced their opposition to Judge Kavanaugh imme-diately after he was nominated. Can you believe that? Some Senators an-nounced their opposition to any one of the 25 potential nominees before the President even announced he was pick-ing Judge Kavanaugh. The minority leader said he would oppose Judge Kavanaugh with everything he has. This desire to obstruct the entire process explains their partisan push to bury the Senate Judiciary Committee in a mountain of irrelevant paperwork. They also want to divert attention from the very impressive record Judge Kavanaugh has. Democratic leaders know Judge Kavanaugh is the exact type of Justice the American people want. By the way, when he was a can-didate—way before his election—the President named the people whom he was going to appoint and the types of people he was thinking. Judge Kavanaugh has served for 12 years on the DC Circuit Court of Ap-peals. During that time, he has au-thored more than 300 opinions and has joined in hundreds of others. In 13 sepa-rate cases, the U.S. Supreme Court has adopted legal positions that have been advanced by Judge Kavanaugh’s opin-ions on the DC Circuit. That is a very impressive record that few people on the circuit court of appeals can claim. The majority’s staff on the Senate Judiciary Committee has already re-ceived more than 10,000 pages of judi-cial opinions Judge Kavanaugh wrote or joined, more than 17,000 pages of ma-terials Judge Kavanaugh provided in response to the most robust question-naire ever submitted for a Supreme Court nominee, and more than 260,000 pages of emails and other records from Judge Kavanaugh’s executive branch legal service. This morning, the com-mittee received close to 170,000 pages of additional records from Judge Kavanaugh’s executive branch legal service. We now have more than 430,000 pages from Judge Kavanaugh’s time in the executive branch—by far, the most ever received for a Supreme Court nominee. The majority’s staff will fin-ish reading every one of these pages be-fore Judge Kavanaugh’s hearing, which will start the day after Labor Day. I am following the precedent that was established during Justice Kagan’s confirmation, when the Senate asked for many but not all of Justice Kagan’s executive branch documents. We re-ceived documents from two out of three executive branch positions that Justice Kagan held. We received docu-ments from Justice Kagan’s time in the White House Counsel’s Office and on the U.S. Domestic Policy Council. Senators from both parties agreed not to request internal documents from her time in the Office of the Solicitor Gen-eral because of their sensitivity. Like-wise, then, we are asking for docu-ments from two of Judge Kavanaugh’s positions in the executive branch but not from a third, which follows the practice of Justice Kagan’s confirma-tion. We have asked for documents from Judge Kavanaugh’s time in the White House Counsel’s Office and the Office of Independent Counsel, but we didn’t ask for documents from his time as Staff Secretary because, even more so than Justice Kagan’s Solicitor General doc-uments, they are incredibly sensitive to the executive branch. I will add that both positions for which we requested Judge Kavanaugh’s documents were legal positions. Those documents could shed some light on his legal thinking. The Staff Secretary, another position that Judge Kavanaugh held at the White House, is a nonlegal position, and it wouldn’t reveal anything about Judge Kavanaugh’s legal thinking. On the other hand, we didn’t receive documents from Justice Kagan’s time in one of the two legal positions that she held. We didn’t receive her Solic-itor General documents, despite a heightened need for them to assess Jus-tice Kagan’s legal thinking. After all, Justice Kagan had no legal or judicial experience. In other words, she was not a judge prior to going to the Supreme Court, as Judge Kavanaugh is. In contrast to Judge Kavanaugh’s 12- year judicial track record, the 307 opin-ions Kavanaugh wrote, and the hun-dreds more he joined, Judge Kagan wrote or joined zero opinions. Judge Kavanaugh wrote or joined over 10,000 pages of judicial opinions, compared to Justice Kagan’s zero pages. In short, we have received many more pages of more relevant documents for Judge Kavanaugh than we did for Justice Kagan. This more thorough and more trans-parent production is also on top of the thousands of pages of Judge Kavanaugh’s publicly available mate-rials, including his extensive and im-pressive judicial record. Nevertheless, Democratic leaders accuse me of hiding documents. Consider the hundreds of thousands that are available, and I am being accused of hiding documents. They are doing that because I have agreed to hold some documents as com-mittee confidential. But during Justice Kagan’s and Justice Gorsuch’s nomina-tions, we agreed to receive as com-mittee confidential documents that contain material that are restricted by the Federal law that we call the Presi-dential Records Act. As the current chairman, that is ex-actly what I have agreed to do this time. As I have explained many times over the last month, I agreed to receive documents on a committee-confiden-tial basis as an initial matter to allow the committee to accelerate our review of Judge Kavanaugh’s record, while at the same time making sure that re-stricted material, such as Social Secu-rity numbers for individuals, bank in-formation for individuals, or confiden-tial advice given to the President, are not exposed to the public, as everybody would expect us to be that careful. Then-Chairman L
EAHY also agreed to receive documents on a committee- confidential basis in 2010 ‘‘to permit the Committee prompt access to them.’’ I have done exactly the same thing in the case of Judge Kavanaugh. All of those documents don’t nec-essarily remain confidential forever be-cause there is a process. They are re-viewed a second time, and if they don’t contain any material restricted by law for public access, we quickly release those documents to the public. Thus, we end up in exactly the same place as we did with Justice Kagan and Justice Gorsuch: Material restricted by the statute is held committee confidential, while nonrestricted material is re-leased to the public. I would like to add that all docu-ments we have received, including committee-confidential documents, at this very moment are available to every Member of the Senate. My staff is happy to make these documents available to any Senator interested in reviewing them. Now, my friends on the other side of the aisle complain that a lawyer by the name of Bill Burck, rather than the National Archives, is deciding what is considered restricted, but that is not true at all. The National Archives has been reviewing Judge Kavanaugh’s emails, as I requested. These archivists are public employees, and they have in-formed President Bush and President Trump that, in the opinion of the pro-fessional archival staff, nearly two- thirds of the emails that these public servants have reviewed thus far con-tain restricted material and should not be released to the public. That means that under the same standard applied to Justice Kagan and Justice Gorsuch, the Committee will have to hold two- thirds of the documents reviewed by the National Archives as committee confidential when we receive them. Following historical practice, official records generally are produced to the Senate for our review, and personal records generally are not. The Obama- appointed Archivist of the United States and his team of career archi-vists are making the ultimate decision

on whether Judge Kavanaugh’s execu-tive branch records are official—avail-able to the committee and to the pub-lic—or personal. It is simply absurd to suggest that anyone is hiding any-thing. So I hope I don’t hear that com-plaint anymore. I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle put aside politics and reconsider their reckless demands for the immediate release—for the whole world to see—of documents that con-tain full names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, bank account num-bers, personal communications with family members, other sensitive mat-ters affecting personal privacy, and, of course, some of the more sensitive issues related to the President’s core constitutional duties.

TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL ‘‘TONY’’ DUNNE AND BRANDON ‘‘RAY’’ SEABOLT Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my honor to pay tribute today to two ex-ceptional Oklahomans and patriots, re-tired Army Chief Warrant Officer Mi-chael ‘‘Tony’’ Dunne of Webber Falls, OK, and retired Army Chief Warrant Officer Brandon ‘‘Ray’’ Seabolt of Skiatook, OK. On August 14, 2018, both were awarded the Office of the Sec-retary of Defense Medal for Valor, the highest civilian award presented by the Department of Defense. On August 7, 2015, Tony was working at Camp Integrity, just north of Kabul, Afghanistan, executing duties as con-tractors for the Department of Defense when a potent vehicle-borne impro-vised explosive device impaled the main gate and knocked down a guard tower. Without hesitation, Tony rushed to the fight and evacuated a wounded servicemember from the scene, undoubtedly saving their life. From his actions that day and others, Tony has been honored for exceptional gallantry in repeatedly putting himself in harm’s way to assist in countering multiple insurgent threats, helping to save lives at the risk of his own. On December 17, 2015, Ray was serv-ing as a counter-IED expert in congru-ence with U.S. Special Forces and Af-ghan partners when they were am-bushed by enemy fire. Without regard for his own life, Ray jumped to action and single-handedly fended off the in-surgent onslaught, allowing the recov-ery force to approach the scene with little resistance. Ray has deservedly been recognized for his bravery and confidence in supporting multiple en-gagements with the enemy with dev-astating effects and for providing tac-tical advice and assistance in the suc-cessful recovery of servicemembers. Oklahoma is truly honored and proud to claim Tony and Ray, two patriots that exemplify the ultimate in bravery and courage in support of our country’s most critical national security mis-sions both at home and overseas. Created in the aftermath of the Sep-tember 11 attacks, the Medal for Valor recognizes government employees and private citizens who perform an act of heroism or sacrifice, with voluntary risk to their personal safety in the face of danger. Tony and Ray’s well-de-served medals, along with one other awarded on August 14, bring the total number of Medals for Valor to 17 awarded since September 11, 2001. This exemplifies the recognition of immense sacrifice that this small group has made for our Nation. Now, Tony and Ray’s names will permanently reside in the Pentagon’s Hall of Heroes, distin-guished among our Nation’s best. f 
REMEMBERING OPHA MAY JOHNSON Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, August 13, 2018, marked the centennial of women serving in the U.S. Marine Corps. I am proud that Indiana was home to the first woman to serve in the Marine Corps, Opha May Johnson. Mrs. Johnson was born in Kokomo, IN, on May 4, 1878. Before becoming a marine at the age of 39, she graduated from Wood’s Commercial Business Col-lege and worked diligently for 14 years in the Interstate Commerce Depart-ment. Like many Americans during WWI, Mrs. Johnson heeded the Nation’s call and took the oath without hesitation on August 13, 1918. She was the first of 300 women who worked at the Marine Corps headquarters in Virginia. After 5 weeks in the service, she was promoted to the rank of sergeant and remained on Active Duty until February 1919, 3 months after the end of WWI. Mrs. Johnson remained in civil service until her retirement in 1943. Mrs. Johnson was the first of a group of trailblazing women in the Marine Corps, and it is with overwhelming pride that I recognize her service to this country. As a marine and Hoosier, I ask that you join me today in hon-oring Opha May Johnson and all of the courageous marines following in her footsteps.

TRIBUTE TO KEN FLANZ Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today, I wish to salute Ken Flanz, my longtime legislative director and senior-most legislative policy adviser who is retir-ing from the Senate, for his nearly 30 years of devoted congressional service. Next month, he joins his loving wife, Meghan, in her hometown in southern California. I was honored to attend their wedding in 2003 at St. John’s Church near the White House, with their families and friends.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5756 August 21, 2018 
Ken has been an integral part of my legislative team since he became part of my staff in 1997 during my service in the U.S. House of Representatives. He joined my staff after working for former Representative Martin Hoke, from 1993–1997 and former Representa-tive Bill McCollum, from 1990–1991. His tenure on Capitol Hill has a wide range, having worked in both legisla-tive bodies, in every Congress stretch-ing back to the 101st Congress, five Presidential administrations, leader-ship shifts, and staff changes. His in-tegrity, dedication, and longevity have served my State and our Nation well throughout. Beyond his leadership on my senior management team, Ken has taken on tremendous responsibilities, as I have counted on him to cover many dif-ferent issues over the years. He has been a trusted counsel, providing de-tailed work and advancing my policy agenda on diverse matters, including appropriations, international trade, in-telligence, foreign affairs, energy, the environment, government reform, and the Federal judiciary. This includes his work covering my role as a Commis-sioner on the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform and leadership with the Canada-U.S. Inter-parliamentary Group for many years. Ken understands the nuance, skill, and discretion needed to effectively navi-gate work with other countries and dif-fering viewpoints, and he has taken on the challenges with tact and diplo-macy. Ken also assisted with my assign-ments on at least six committees, in-cluding Senate Finance; Senate Bank-ing, Housing, and Urban Affairs; Sen-ate Environment and Public Works; Senate Judiciary; Senate Indian Af-fairs; and the Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans. During my tenure in the House, he also assisted me on the House En-ergy and Commerce and Agriculture Committees. He has always been ready and able to fill gaps and cover what needs to be done as he has supported and filled out the staff. In addition to his principal issue assignments, he has covered taxes, healthcare, and education when staff vacancies occurred or the need re-quired. Simply put, the complete list of policy issues he has handled through-out his time in Congress is extensive and likely too long test. Ken can also point to achievements in helping me enact legislation relat-ing to environmental protections, de-fense initiatives, Tribal sovereignty, land conveyances, and delivering as-sistance to Idaho communities and in-stitutions. He was also instrumental in advancing and confirming executive branch and judicial branch nominees important to Idaho. As legislative director, Ken has man-aged, led, and mentored over five dozen legislative team members and agency fellows. He has trained and guided so many young legislative minds into suc-cessful careers and shared his consum-mate understanding of the legislative process and policy efforts. It is telling on how much Ken has valued his relationship and mentorship with those on his staff when he re-quested, as a farewell gesture, photos with each one who could be available during his last month in my office. Without exception, they all trust and admire Ken and point to his guidance as part of their successes today. He has an extraordinary depth of knowledge and understanding that has been invaluable and will be deeply missed in and beyond the Senate com-munity where he has worked with many colleagues over the years. As a Stennis Congressional Fellow and a Woodrow Wilson Foreign Policy Fel-low, Ken deepened his knowledge and skills that have made him effective in his commitment to serve the public. I extend my deep gratitude to you, Ken, for the more than 21 years you have devoted to serving as member of my staff and the 28 years you have worked in Congress. Thank you for your thoughtful guidance all of these years. I wish you and Meghan all the best as you head West and start your next chapter.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING KRTV ∑Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the fine broadcasters at KRTV in Great Falls, MT, who are celebrating their 60th year on the air. On June 27, 1958, KRTV went live with its first broadcast, only to be promptly knocked off the air by a se-vere windstorm that damaged its tele-vision tower, but as they would prove, time and again, nothing could keep KRTV from bringing the news of the day to northcentral Montana. Three months later, they were back on the air, and they have been leading the way ever since. In 1960, KRTV pioneered the first live broadcast from the Montana State Fair. At the time, it was a historic technological development in northcentral Montana. In 1961, they began broadcasting in color, bringing life to storytelling and breaking news. Every day since, KRTV has set the standard for excellence in broadcast journalism in Montana, winning EB Craney newscast of the year numerous times. They have covered events large and small, from Presidential visits and his-toric flooding to six-man football and fall harvest. Legendary broadcasters like Norma Ashby laid the groundwork for the familiar faces of Tim McGonigal and Shannon Newth and so many others. They have brought the news to Great Falls and its sur-rounding market area with passion, grace, and persistence. For 60 years, KRTV has been a shin-ing example of how much local news matters to a community. I know the next 60 years will be as good as the first.∑ f

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. WYDEN: S. 3360. A bill to amend the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 to improve access to broadband telecommuni-cations services in rural areas, includ-ing by encouraging the provision of broadband loans and grants to increase broadband service in emerging harbor projects, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Broadband Internet for Small Ports Act to help small ports access broadband loans and grants, which will increase internet service in rural coastal communities nationwide. Nearly a third of Americans lack ac-cess to high-speed internet, and there is a considerable digital divide between rural and urban America. Rural com-munities must be brought up to speed so that all Americans can compete on-line in a global economy. In rural coastal areas people con-gregate near inland and small ports, and these harbors act as hubs for com-merce and tourism. This bill recognizes the importance of small ports to their rural economies. This bill will help small ports nationwide get Federal loans and grants and improve their broadband coverage, thereby enabling working-waterfronts to order inven-tory and coordinate deliveries, access real-time weather updates, and grow economically. Broadband loan and grant applica-tions submitted to the Department of Agriculture’s Rural Utility Service are assigned different levels of priority be-fore they are awarded. This bill recog-nizes the importance of small ports, and elevates the priority of applica-tions seeking to boost internet capac-ity. This bill states that broadband loan and grant applications from small ports will be considered equal in pri-ority to applications that are devel-oped with the participation of a non- profit or philanthropic organization. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD . There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows:

S.

ERDUE ) submitted the following reso-lution; which was referred to the Com-mittee on Homeland Security and Gov-ernmental Affairs: 
S. R ES. 611 Whereas Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a can-didate for Congress from New York, wel-comed the support of Occupy ICE LA, a group that called U.S. Immigration and Cus-toms Enforcement (in this preamble referred to as ‘‘ICE’’) a ‘‘genocidal ethnic cleansing machine’’ and ‘‘the Gestapo’’, and posted photos of ICE employees on the internet, en-couraging activists to ‘‘[k]now their faces, never allow them to feel safe’’; Whereas Cynthia Nixon, a candidate Gov-ernor of New York, stated that ICE ‘‘is a ter-rorist organization’’; Whereas a mob of leftwing activists re-cently surrounded an ICE office in southwest Portland, Oregon, trapping ICE employees inside the building; Whereas ICE employees were subjected to doxxing and violent threats after their social media profiles, phone numbers, and home ad-dresses were posted on the internet by left-wing activists; Whereas an ICE officer was reportedly fol-lowed and ‘‘confronted when he went to pick up his daughter from summer camp’’, and another ‘‘had his name and photo plastered on flyers outside his home accusing him of being part of the ‘Gestapo’,’’ according to the Wall Street Journal; Whereas the Mayor of Portland, Oregon, Ted Wheeler, barred the Portland Police Bu-reau from coming to the aid of ICE employ-ees, stating, ‘‘I do not want the @PortlandPolice to be engaged or sucked into a conflict, particularly from a Federal agency that I believe is on the wrong track . . . If they are looking for a bailout from this mayor, they are looking in the wrong place.’’; Whereas the ICE office in southwest Port-land was shut down for days due to threats and occupation; Whereas leftwing activists have similarly harassed and threatened ICE employees and targeted ICE offices for closure around the country; Whereas the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council’s representa-tive stated in a letter to Mayor Ted Wheeler that ‘‘[y]our current policy forbidding Port-land law enforcement agencies from assist-ing employees of the Immigration and Cus-toms Enforcement Agency who request law enforcement assistance while at or away from work’’ leaves ‘‘them vulnerable to vio-lence, harassment and even death . . . Your policy has created a zone of terror and law-lessness. We ask that you end your policy of not responding to calls for police services from ICE employees immediately. Our mem-bership has been the subjected to threats of physical violence and harassment since you announced your policy.’’; and Whereas the President of the Portland Po-lice Association, Daryl Turner, stated, ‘‘There is no place for personal, political bias when it comes to providing public safety services to our communities. In that respect, our Mayor, who is also our Police Commis-sioner, has failed miserably.’’: Now, there-fore, be it Resolved, That the Senate— (1) expresses solidarity with the men and women of U.S. Immigration and Customs En-forcement who bring human traffickers, drug traffickers, gang members, and violent criminals to justice; (2) condemns the doxxing and targeted har-assment of all officers and employees of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the violent threats they continue to endure from leftwing activists; and (3) calls on the Mayor of Portland, Oregon, Ted Wheeler, to immediately resign so that a leader committed to protecting all law-abid-ing citizens and public servants from harm can assume the duties of Mayor of Portland. f

(a) F INDINGS .—Congress finds the fol-lowing: (1) Texas, Wisconsin, Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Paul LePage (Governor of Maine), Mississippi (by and through Governor Phil Bryant), Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, and West Virginia have filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, arguing that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111–148; 124 Stat. 119), is uncon-stitutional and should be enjoined, by assert-ing that the Act’s requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage (commonly known as the ‘‘individual responsibility pro-vision’’) in section 5000A(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, is unconstitutional fol-lowing the amendment of that provision by the Act to provide for reconciliation pursu-ant to titles II and V of the concurrent reso-lution on the budget for fiscal year 2018 (Public Law 115–97) (commonly known as the ‘‘Tax Cuts and Jobs Act’’). (2) These State and individual plaintiffs also seek to strike down the entire Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as not severable from the individual responsibility provision. (3) On June 7, 2018, the Department of Jus-tice refused to defend the constitutionality of the amended individual responsibility pro-vision, despite the well-established duty of the Department to defend Federal statutes where reasonable arguments can be made in their defense. (4) The Department of Justice not only re-fused to defend the amended individual re-sponsibility provision, but it affirmatively argued that this provision is unconstitu-tional and that the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act guaran-teeing issuance of insurance coverage re-gardless of health status or pre-existing con-ditions (commonly known as the ‘‘guaran-teed issue provision’’), sections 2702, 2704, and 2705(a) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg–1, 300gg–3, 300gg–4(a)), and prohibiting discriminatory premium rates (commonly known as the ‘‘community rating provision’’), sections 2701 and 2705(b) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg(a)(1), 300gg–4(b)) must now be struck down as not severable from the individual re-sponsibility provision. (b) SENSE OF THE SENATE .—It is the sense of the Senate that the Senate Legal Counsel should be authorized to represent the Senate in Texas v. United States, No. 4:18–cv–00167– O (N.D. Tex.), including seeking to— (1) intervene as a party in the matter; and (2) defend all provisions of the Patient Pro-tection and Affordable Care Act, the amend-ments made by that Act to other provisions of law, and any amendments to such provi-sions, including the provisions ensuring af-fordable health coverage for those with pre- existing conditions.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5780 August 21, 2018 
At the appropriate place, insert the fol-lowing: TITLE lll 
SEC. ll. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND DEC-LARATION OF PURPOSES. 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress finds the fol-lowing: (1) In 1984, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act (Public Law 98–417) (referred to in this Act as the ‘‘1984 Act’’), was enacted with the intent of facili-tating the early entry of generic drugs while preserving incentives for innovation. (2) Prescription drugs make up approxi-mately 10 percent of the national health care spending. (3) Initially, the 1984 Act was successful in facilitating generic competition to the ben-efit of consumers and health care payers, al-though 88 percent of all prescriptions dis-pensed in the United States are generic drugs, they account for only 28 percent of all expenditures. (4) Generic drugs cost substantially less than brand name drugs, with discounts off the brand price averaging 80 to 85 percent. (5) Federal dollars currently account for over 40 percent of the $325,000,000,000 spent on retail prescription drugs, and this share is expected to rise to 47 percent by 2025. (6)(A) In recent years, the intent of the 1984 Act has been subverted by certain settle-ment agreements in which brand name com-panies transfer value to their potential ge-neric competitors to settle claims that the generic company is infringing the branded company’s patents. (B) These ‘‘reverse payment’’ settlement agreements— (i) allow a branded company to share its monopoly profits with the generic company as a way to protect the branded company’s monopoly; and (ii) have unduly delayed the marketing of low-cost generic drugs contrary to free com-petition, the interests of consumers, and the principles underlying antitrust law. (C) Because of the price disparity between brand name and generic drugs, such agree-ments are more profitable for both the brand and generic manufacturers than competition and will become increasingly common unless prohibited. (D) These agreements result in consumers losing the benefits that the 1984 Act was in-tended to provide. (b) P
URPOSES .—The purposes of this title are— (1) to enhance competition in the pharma-ceutical market by stopping anticompetitive agreements between brand name and generic drug manufacturers that limit, delay, or oth-erwise prevent competition from generic drugs; and (2) to support the purpose and intent of antitrust law by prohibiting anticompetitive practices in the pharmaceutical industry that harm consumers. 
SEC. ll. UNLAWFUL COMPENSATION FOR DELAY. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—The Federal Trade Com-mission Act (15 U.S.C. 44 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 26 (15 U.S.C. 57c–2) the following:

IMITATIONS .—In determining whether the settling parties have met their burden under subsection (a)(2)(B), the fact finder shall not presume— ‘‘(1) that entry would not have occurred until the expiration of the relevant patent or statutory exclusivity; or ‘‘(2) that the agreement’s provision for entry of the ANDA product prior to the expi-ration of the relevant patent or statutory ex-clusivity means that the agreement is pro-competitive. ‘‘(c) E
XCLUSIONS .—Nothing in this section shall prohibit a resolution or settlement of a patent infringement claim in which the con-sideration granted by the NDA holder to the ANDA filer as part of the resolution or set-tlement includes only one or more of the fol-lowing: ‘‘(1) The right to market the ANDA prod-uct in the United States prior to the expira-tion of— ‘‘(A) any patent that is the basis for the patent infringement claim; or ‘‘(B) any patent right or other statutory exclusivity that would prevent the mar-keting of such drug. ‘‘(2) A payment for reasonable litigation expenses not to exceed $7,500,000. ‘‘(3) A covenant not to sue on any claim that the ANDA product infringes a United States patent. ‘‘(d) E

At the end, add the following: DIVISION C—RURAL EMERGENCY ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL ACT 
SECTION l01. SHORT TITLE. 
This division may be cited as the ‘‘Rural Emergency Acute Care Hospital Act’’. 
SEC. l02. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: (1) According to the University of North Carolina’s Center for Health Services Re-search, 55 rural hospitals have closed in the Unites States since January 2010. (2) In 2014, iVantage conducted a study for the National Rural Health Association and found 283 hospitals at risk of closure based upon performance indicators that matched those facilities already forced to close in this decade. (3) Researchers at the University of North Carolina identified inpatient volume as a substantial contributing factor to the finan-cial performance of rural hospitals, with many of the at-risk hospitals having an aver-age daily bed census of less than two. (4) Adverse impacts to the local economy and the loss of timely access to emergency medical care are 2 major effects of rural hos-pital closures. (5) According to the National Center for Rural Health Works, the typical rural hos-pital creates over 140 jobs and generates $6,800,000 in compensation while serving an average population of 14,600. (6) The 2014 iVantage study estimates that the 283 at-risk hospitals could result in the loss of 36,000 health care jobs, 50,000 commu-nity jobs, and $10,600,000,000 in gross domes-tic product. (7) Time is the most critical factor for achieving successful outcomes in emergency medicine, and emergency medical clinicians refer to the time-sensitive period during which successful outcomes may be best achieved as the ‘‘golden hour’’. (8) The National Conference of State Legis-latures states that 60 percent of trauma deaths in the United States occur in rural areas, where only 15 percent of the popu-lation is represented. (9) The disproportionate percentage of trauma deaths in rural areas is likely attrib-utable in large part to a combination of re-sponse time to the scene and distance to the nearest emergency room to stabilize trauma victims. (10) The percentage of trauma deaths oc-curring in rural areas could continue to in-crease as more rural hospitals close, further limiting access to emergency services and requiring patients to travel longer distances to receive emergency medical care. (11) The creation of a rural emergency hos-pital designation under the Medicare pro-gram will allow facilities in rural areas to provide emergency medical services without having to maintain inpatient beds. (12) In addition to providing emergency care, rural emergency hospitals could con-vert the space previously used for inpatient services to provide other medical services in-cluding, but not limited to, observation care, skilled nursing facility care, infusion serv-ices, hemodialysis, home health, hospice, nursing home care, population health, and telemedicine services.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF NEW ORLEANS ATTORNEY KENNETH CARTER 
HON. CEDRIC L. RICHMOND 
OF LOUISIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 21, 2018 Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and legacy of New Orleans At-torney Kenneth Carter, the first African Amer-ican tax assessor in New Orleans, who died on August 3, 2018 at the age of 74. A native of New Orleans, Mr. Carter grew up in the Calliope public housing development, also known as B.W. Cooper apartments. Mr. Carter, the father of Louisiana State Senator and state Democratic Party Chair-woman Karen Carter Peterson, was elected to the powerful post of tax assessor for the 1st Municipal District assessor’s job in 1985 and served until 1994. This district contains the Central Business District and much of the city’s most valuable real estate. Mr. Carter attended Xavier Prep in New Or-leans, received a B.A. degree in political science from the University of New Orleans (UNO) in 1976, and a J.D. degree from Loyola University New Orleans College of Law in 1978. He was a leader in the political organi-zation BOLD. Mr. Carter’s other leadership roles included a period as head of the New Orleans’ Alcoholic Beverage Control Board and president of the Freret Street Develop-ment Corporation. In 1994, Mr. Carter ran un-successfully for Mayor of New Orleans. Mr. Carter was also one of the attorneys in-volved in a Louisiana lawsuit against tobacco companies. He represented the plaintiffs and helped secure smoking cessation programs for people in Louisiana. Mr. Carter played basketball at Xavier Prep in New Orleans. In 1962, one-year before the 1963 March on Washington, Mr. Carter also made history by being one of the first four Afri-can-Americans to integrate Loyola University’s undergraduate program but could not join the basketball team because other colleges would boycott games rather than play against any African American players. The outright hostility shown by others, and ultimately not being al-lowed to play, caused Mr. Carter to give up his scholarship. It would take Mr. Carter a decade to return to college, the University of New Orleans, and ultimately back to Loyola for law school. Mr. Carter and his wife Gigi celebrated 50 years of marriage in May of 2015. His daugh-ter, Senator Peterson, and other state sen-ators presented the couple with a resolution honoring their golden anniversary. Mr. Kenneth Carter was a man of many firsts and deep conviction. He blazed trails as the first African American elected Assessor in the city and the first African American Presi-dent of the Louisiana Trial Lawyers Associa-tion. He believed in the power of civic engage-ment and worked hard to ensure government reflected the diversity of the citizenry. Addition-ally, he took the time to mentor young men and women who sought to make their mark in politics and business. While he is no longer with us, his legacy lives on. New Orleans is a better place because of his efforts. We cannot match the sacrifices made by Mr. Carter, but surely, we can try to match his sense of serv-ice. We cannot match his courage, but we can strive to match his devotion. Mr. Kenneth Carter is survived by his wife, Gigi; three daughters, Tara Hernandez, Karen Carter Peterson and Eileen Carter; and three grandchildren. Mr. Speaker, I celebrate the life and legacy of Mr. Kenneth Carter.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 50TH AN-NIVERSARY OF THE 1968 SOVIET INVASION OF CZECHOSLOVAKIA 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 21, 2018 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in remembrance of the 50th anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. Even at the height of the Cold War, the So-viet Union was struggling to maintain order in its brutally enforced communist bloc. Czechoslovakia, a vibrant democracy prior to the Second World War, had been annexed by the Nazis then subjugated by the Russians in the postwar Soviet takeover in 1948. For 20 years, the pro-Soviet government in-stalled in Prague stifled public dissent and maintained the charade of communist para-dise amidst a crumbling economy. But in early 1968, conservative leader Antonin Novotny was ousted as the head of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, and he was replaced by Alexander Dubcek. The Dubcek government ended censorship in Czechoslovakia, and in April, the Czech Government issued a formal plan for further reforms. Recalling the 1956 uprising in Hungary, leaders in Moscow worried that if Czecho-slovakia carried reforms too far, other satellite states in Eastern Europe might follow, leading to a widespread rebellion against Moscow’s control of the Warsaw Pact, the eastern bloc of nations created by the Soviets to rival the NATO alliance. These fears, rising from the Kremlin’s deter-mination to maintain totalitarian control of its subjugated peoples, was the chief reason for Russian aggression 50 years ago today. In addition, the Kremlin guessed—cor-rectly—that given past U.S. pronouncements on non-intervention in the Eastern Bloc, the United States would condemn the invasion but might refrain from intervening. An emboldened Soviet government under Leonid Brezhnev asserted as justification for the invasion ‘‘the Brezhnev Doctrine,’’ which held that Moscow would intervene in any na-tion where a communist government was under threat. Mr. Speaker, I hope to have spoken today of these egregious Russian violations of sov-ereignty and self-determination as a recollec-tion of times past; an episode consigned to the annals of history. But this history provides a lesson that we dare not ignore. In 2008, Vladimir Putin’s Russia invaded the nation of Georgia in coordination with separat-ists in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Putin’s Kremlin claimed that it was pro-tecting Russian nationals in the region, but the American intelligence community accurately assessed that Moscow’s involvement in South Ossetia and Abkhazia was a gambit to prevent Georgia’s accession to NATO. In Crimea and the Donbas, too, the Kremlin pursued its aggressive violation of inter-national laws to illegally occupy those terri-tories under the pretense of protecting Rus-sian nationals and Russian interests. The emboldened Putin regime continues its efforts to destabilize not only Georgia and Ukraine, which have expressed interest in join-ing the Western Alliance, but also linchpins of liberalism in Europe—from supporting populist nationalists in Austria and Hungary, to con-ducting extralegal assassinations in England, to influencing our very own elections in the United States. Putin’s actions have been further emboldened by the President’s pronounce-ments casting doubt on the value of the West-ern Alliance and his moral ambivalence on Russian violations of international law. Mr. Speaker, those who forget history are doomed to repeat it. Russian aggression in Georgia, Ukraine, and elsewhere—as well as the continued human suffering thereafter—unequivocally re-veals Vladimir Putin’s disregard for inter-national law and hostility to our Western alli-ance. When confronted with such a foe, the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia demonstrates that it is imperative that we draw our allies and partners in Europe closer, not antagonize them. Between its oppression of the Georgian people, poisoning of expatriates, assassination and imprisonment of dissenters, ruthless bombing of Syrian civilians, illegal occupation and deployment of mercenaries in Ukraine, and its active undermining of U.S. alliances and political systems, we must now, more than ever, stand fast with our allies and clearly signal our commitment to democratic institu-tions and international organizations and alli-ances. Mr. Speaker, our partnerships in Europe ad-vance U.S. interests and protect our allies from Russian aggression. So on this 50th anniversary of the Soviet in-vasion of Czechoslovakia, it is critical that the United States Congress reaffirm our nation’s unwavering commitment to Article 5 of the NATO Treaty and maintain its vigilance to the lasting humanitarian, social, and other costs that Russian aggression has imposed in Geor-gia, Ukraine, and elsewhere.

PALM HARBOR 9/11 MEMORIAL 
HON. GUS M. BILIRAKIS 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 21, 2018 Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay special tribute to the Palm Harbor 9/11 Memorial located at Curlew Hills Memory Gar-dens in Palm Harbor, Florida and to recognize all those who worked diligently to make this venerable memorial a reality. On September 11, 2001, the world was changed forever by a senseless act of ter-rorism; the worst attack against civilians on U.S. soil in our nation’s history. In August, 2011, Palm Harbor Special Fire Control and Rescue District received a steel beam from the remains of the World Trade Center, identi-fied as I–0053B. On December 12, 2011, the Palm Harbor Board of Fire Commissioners and Curlew Hills Memory Gardens entered into an agreement to lease the artifact as a focal point in a permanent 9/11 Memorial lo-cated at Curlew Hills Memory Gardens in Palm Harbor, Florida. Through the efforts of the original com-mittee, the Palm Harbor 9/11 Memorial was unveiled on September 11, 2012. Since then, the Palm Harbor 9/11 Memorial Planning Committee, consisting of members from Palm Harbor Fire Rescue, Curlew Hills Memory Gardens, Gene O’Kane Division of FDNY Re-tired, NYPD Retired Suncoast 10–13 Club, Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office, and others, organize the annual Palm Harbor 9/11 Memo-rial Ceremony. This ceremony is attended by thousands to pay tribute to the heroes who gave their lives on September 11 and to the countless others who have perished in de-fense of liberty since that day. I am proud of these wonderful and patriotic constituents and ask my colleagues to join me in acknowledging the efforts put forth by this committee to ensure that the events of Sep-tember 11, 2001, will never be forgotten.

IN MEMORY OF GENE CONNOLLY, CONCORD HIGH SCHOOL PRIN-CIPAL 
HON. ANN M. KUSTER 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 21, 2018 Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and remember the life of Gene Connolly, the beloved former Concord High School Principal, who inspired his community through his unmatched strength and grace in the face of adversity. Connolly epitomized the slogan ‘‘Connolly Strong’’. De-spite his diagnosis with ALS in 2014, Connolly constantly showed persistence, humility and courage, continuing to greet his students every morning as they arrived at school. Even after retiring in 2016, Connolly remained an educator at heart, dedicated to teaching and serving as a trusted mentor to many Concord High students. While Connolly commonly cited the Concord community and schools as sources of con-sistent and loyal support throughout his battle with ALS, I know that his fighting spirit and openness about his struggle also inspired and elevated the entire Concord community. The 2017 documentary, Mr. Connolly has ALS, highlights how Connolly inspired his students, colleagues and friends. The documentary, re-volving around questions submitted by his stu-dents, tells a powerful story of how disabled members of our society can still live fulfilling lives and give so much to their communities. As a proud alumna of Concord High School and the Concord public schools, I express my profound gratitude for Connolly and his many years of devoted service to New Hampshire’s students. He will be greatly missed, but his memory and spirit will live on in the students and the community he loved so deeply. I ex-tend my deepest condolences to his family and wish them and the entire Concord High School community comfort during this difficult time. May he rest in peace. f 
CONGRATULATING THE FIRST CHINESE BAPTIST CHURCH 
HON. NYDIA M. VELA´ZQUEZ 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 21, 2018 Ms. VELA´ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to ex-tend my congratulations to the First Chinese Baptist Church located in Chinatown, one of Manhattan’s historic neighborhoods, as it cele-brates its 92nd year anniversary on August 12, 2018. It is with great pride that I congratulate this longtime church from my district on its 92nd anniversary. The First Chinese Baptist Church, established in 1926, evolved from the Morning Star Mission in a then strife-torn neighborhood and became part of the rich fabric and history of the Chinatown community. Over the past 92 years, the church served as a safe haven for the community’s Chinese Americans and im-migrants during the early half of the 20th cen-tury at the time of the Chinese Exclusion Act and turmoil in China. Founded by Dr. Mabel Lee, a Chinese-American pastor, community organizer, feminist and suffragist, the church created a community that has served thou-sands of Chinatown residents. Lee advocated for continuous education and taught English to congregants who passed down her teachings to those who arrived later. Additionally, during World War II, many men from the church served in the United States Armed Forces. Today, the First Chinese Baptist Church continues to hold weekly worship services open to all and offers English classes, spon-sors basketball teams, manages youth sum-mer mentorship programs, and assists those seeking citizenship. It works with community- based organizations to conduct special events and support immigration rights and social jus-tice throughout the year. Its dedication to serv-ice for God and country, education, advocacy and respect for individuals has been the cor-nerstone of the First Chinese Baptist Church and has not diminished in its 92-year history. Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratu-lating the First Chinese Baptist Church and its leadership on this special 92nd year anniver-sary. The Church has long exemplified out-standing community and public service to the greater New York City community. I wish them continued success and many more years of service. CONGRATULATING VICTOR RAN-GEL ON ACHIEVING THE CON-GRESSIONAL AWARD GOLD MEDAL HON. FILEMON VELA 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 21, 2018 Mr. VELA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to con-gratulate Brownsville resident Victor Rangel. A student at Harmony School of Innovation- Brownsville, Victor is being honored with the Congressional Award Gold Medal, the only Congressional award specifically for young people. Recipients of the Congressional Award Gold Medal complete 400 hours of vol-untary public service, 200 hours of personal development, 200 hours of physical fitness, and a four-night expedition of their choosing. Victor went above and beyond these re-quirements on the path to the Congressional Award. For the public service component, Vic-tor completed over 450 hours of volunteer service at a local hospital in South Texas, helping with patient and family care. Addition-ally, Victor learned traditional martial arts for personal development, and pushed himself as he is now only one level away from the black belt. For physical fitness, Victor performed aerobic exercises to help build his strength. An enthusiast of history, Victor traveled from Brownsville to San Antonio to learn more about the rich history of Texas, immersing himself in the culture through observation and conversation. I am very proud of Victor’s success in earn-ing the Congressional Award. Most impor-tantly, I commend him for his dedication and passion to help those most in need and give to our community with an open heart. Victor demonstrated tremendous courage and lead-ership, and made a positive impact in our community. I am honored to congratulate Vic-tor Rangel on his special accomplishment.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 21, 2018 Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Honorable Edward A. Pease for his tireless commitment to the Boy Scouts and continued leadership within the Terre Haute community.

Pease has not only served as the chair-man of the organization but has also received the Distinguished Eagle Scout, Silver Ante-lope, and Silver Beaver awards in recognition of his outstanding volunteer service. Congratulations on another well-deserved recognition of service to our community and for leading by example.

IN MEMORY OF SPECIALIST CHRISTOPHER HARRIS 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 21, 2018 Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Specialist Chris-topher Harris, who was killed in action on Au-gust 2, 2017 while defending our nation as part of the 82nd Airborne Division. SPC Harris was a true American hero and our thoughts and prayers go out to his friends and family as they mourn the loss of this great man. Enlisting in the United States Army in Octo-ber of 2013, SPC Harris’ list of accomplish-ments speaks to his bravery and commitment to service. As an infantryman, he was as-signed to 2nd Battalion, 504th Parachute In-fantry Regiment, 1st Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division. He received numerous medals, including the Bronze Star for Valor and the Purple Heart. Men and women like SPC Harris represent the best our nation has to offer. As a Para-trooper, he was always prepared to fearlessly jump into enemy territory to defend his coun-try. That level of valor allows us to enjoy the blessings of liberty that have persevered for well over 200 years. When his country needed him most, he stood ready to answer the call to serve our great nation. Leaving behind a wife and a newborn daughter who he never met, our country can never repay the debt we owe to SPC Harris. He was a model citizen and soldier whose leg-acy will live on forever. He will always be re-membered and I will do everything in my power to honor his sacrifice. Mr. Speaker, please join me today in com-memorating the life of Specialist Christopher Harris for his service to God and country.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF MR. PAUL BEAULIEU 
HON. CEDRIC L. RICHMOND 
OF LOUISIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 21, 2018 Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and legacy of Mr. Paul Beaulieu, an educator and broadcaster, who died on July 24, 2018 at the age of 75. A native of New Orleans’ 7th Ward, Mr. Beaulieu graduated from St. Augustine High School and Xavier University in 1965, which led him to launching his teaching career. At St. Augustine High School, Mr. Beaulieu taught English and led the alumni association. He also founded the Cornerstone Club, which encouraged graduates to continue their ties to the school. Mr. Beaulieu shifted into broadcasting after writing an opinion column for The States-Item, New Orleans’ afternoon newspaper. At WVUE, he was the host of a public-affairs program called ‘‘Dimensions.’’ In 2007, he was named general manager of WBOK–AM. Until 2010, he also did another program, ‘‘Between the Lines,’’ with Lloyd Dennis. In addition to his other journalistic posts, Mr. Beaulieu started a newspaper, The Spectator New Journal. When Mr. Beaulieu retired in 2015, he was recognized for his work by the City Council. In May 2016, Mr. Beaulieu received the Asante Award for his work in media education. He was a proud member of Alpha Phi Omega, a service fraternity. Mr. Beaulieu loved the city and the people of New Orleans. His legacy will forever be a part of the city and his dedication to commu-nity embodies the spirit of New Orleans. We cannot match the sacrifices made by Mr. Beaulieu, but surely, we can try to match his sense of service. We cannot match his cour-age, but we can strive to match his devotion. Mr. Beaulieu’s survivors include his wife, Cynthia King Beaulieu; two daughters, Samantha Beaulieu of New Orleans and Lyndsey Beaulieu of Los Angeles; two broth-ers, Lovell and Marvin Beaulieu, both of New Orleans; and two sisters, Victoria Beaulieu Saulny and Karen Beaulieu Major, both of New Orleans. Mr. Speaker, I celebrate the life and legacy of Mr. Paul Beaulieu. f 
DEATHS FROM GUN VIOLENCE 
HON. ROBIN L. KELLY 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 21, 2018 Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because Americans continue to die from gun violence. They die on our streets, in their homes, in elementary schools and grocery stores. Yet, despite the shocking statistics, this Re-publican-controlled Congress does nothing. The Speaker offers ‘‘thoughts and prayers’’ on social media and then jets off for summer vacation or a fundraiser. Meanwhile, kids continue to die. Families continue to be torn apart and my GOP col-leagues gleefully cash their NRA checks. Money has poisoned our politics with deadly results. This Congress—controlled entirely by Republicans—continues to ignore the carnage taking place in our streets. It seems the zeros on the NRA checks have become blinders to reality. Mr. Speaker, I include in the R
ECORD the names of 191 New York residents, including an infant and numerous teenagers, who this House—controlled by you and Republicans— have failed by your continued inaction on gun violence.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-ognize the Del Rio Hispanic Chamber of Com-merce, a premiere resource for businesses and leading advocate of economic growth in the state of Texas. The Del Rio Hispanic Chamber of Com-merce has been a critical institution in the area since its founding in 2006. In just over 10 years, the Del Rio Hispanic Chamber of Com-merce has supported a range of businesses in the border area. This Chamber of Commerce has established itself as a leader in strength-ening and supporting small, minority and women-owned businesses and providing op-portunities for business development and growth in the community. I applaud the extraordinary efforts of this Chamber of Commerce and congratulate them for their recognition as the Small Hispanic Chamber of the Year. The work of this institu-tion resonates across Texas’ 23rd Congres-sional District, and will undoubtedly continue to have a lasting positive impact across Texas and the United States. f 
RECOGNIZING STEVE CRONIN 
HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 21, 2018 Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, the Com-monwealth of Pennsylvania is home to Amer-ica’s first volunteer fire company founded by Benjamin Franklin in 1736. Every day resi-dents across Pennsylvania rely on the 72,000 volunteer firefighters serving communities across the commonwealth to save lives and protect property. We owe a debt of gratitude to all of these men and women. Today, I rise to honor one exceptional vol-unteer firefighter in Pennsylvania’s eighth dis-trict, Mr. Steve Cronin. Mr. Cronin served the Midway Volunteer Fire Company as chief from 2008 through 2011. In 2013, Mr. Cronin was recognized as Firefighter of the Year by the Central Bucks Chamber of Commerce and the Burpee Family. Steve’s commitment takes him well beyond responding to fire calls. Steve is recognized by his fellow volunteers from Midway Volunteer Fire Company and the Bucks County Fire Chiefs Association for his leadership and ex-pertise. So today, on behalf of the constituents re-siding in Buckingham Township, Bucks County and surrounding area, I would like to express our gratitude to Mr. Steve Cronin, and thank him for his years of dedication and heroism; answering the call of duty and carrying out the mission of the Midway Volunteer Fire Com-pany.
