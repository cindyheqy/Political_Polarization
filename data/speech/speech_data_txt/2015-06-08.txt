PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. Eternal Father, to whom all hearts 
are open, and from whom no secrets are hidden, with reverence we pause to pray that You would make us good enough for the challenging times in which we serve. 
Lord, You made humanity to dream, 
so enable us to see that horizon that promises a better nation and world. Keep our eyes open to the everlasting hills, the illuminated skies, the bright sunrises of hope and beauty and truth. 
Keep ever before our lawmakers a vi-
sion of Your perfect Kingdom when all people will fulfill the law of love. Help our Senators to shut out all distracting sounds and obstructing movements that prevent them from receiving Your guidance. 
We pray in Your sacred Name. Amen.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. 
ERNST ). The minority leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. REID. Madam President, a few 
days ago, the majority leader was re-ported to have declared to a conserv-ative talk-radio show that under his leadership, the Republican Senate will 
shirk its constitutional duties by not continuing to confirm judges—period. He went on to say: We may confirm a few that come from States where only Republicans give the President the names, but other than that, we are going to do none. 
I assume this is accurate. I hope it is 
not, but I assume that it is. It would be a very stunning and disappointing dec-laration that the senior Senator from Kentucky, especially since he argued for the fair consideration of President Bush’s court nominees, would now switch his position. 
In July of 2008, here is what he said: 
‘‘Even with lameduck Presidents, there is a historical standard of fairness as to confirming judicial nominees, espe-cially circuit court nominees.’’ 
That is a direct quote from the ma-
jority leader. These are his words. Not a single word has been made up. That is what he said: ‘‘Even with lameduck presidents, there is a historical stand-ard of fairness as to confirming judicial nominees, especially circuit court nominees.’’ 
And the record is spread with many 
quotes he has given just the same. He also said in that same year: ‘‘No party is without blame in the confirmation process, but what is going on now—or, more accurately, what is not going on—is yet another step backward in po-liticizing the confirmation process— something we had all hoped that we would get beyond.’’ 
Earlier my friend from Kentucky 
said: ‘‘Judicial nominations need to be treated fairly and commitments need to be kept.’’ And even earlier than that, here is what he said: ‘‘On the issue of judicial confirmations, the ma-jority leader and I discussed this mat-ter publicly at the beginning of the Congress’’—he is saying that he and I are talking—‘‘and we agreed that President Bush, in the last 2 years of his term, should be treated as well as President Reagan, Bush 41, and Presi-dent Clinton were treated in the last 2 
years of their tenures in office because there was one common thread, and that was that the Senate was con-trolled by the opposition party.’’ 
So what he is saying there is that 
what he wanted was for Bush to be treated the same way that Bush 1, President Reagan, and President Clin-ton had been treated. He got that with large numbers of judges being ap-pointed. 
So we are here now with the state-
ments ringing loudly that the majority leader is intent on writing off the Sen-ate’s constitutional duty of offering our advice and consent now that Presi-dent Obama is nominating individuals to the Federal bench. 
The Republican leader is a student of 
the Senate. He says he is, and I believe that. I am confident that he under-stands that the Senate cannot and should not neglect the constitutional obligations we have. The Senate can-not simply ignore critical vacancies in the last 2 years of any President’s term—what a bad standard to set, espe-cially with the growth in certain com-munities. We have a number of judicial emergencies that have been deter-mined. 
It is all the more troubling that the 
majority leader wants to pick an un-necessary fight over judges just as Re-publican Senators are working with the President to fill vacancies in their States. The majority leader is essen-tially telling other Senators that their judicial recommendations simply don’t matter—Democrats, Independents, Re-publicans. The majority leader is tell-ing the chairman of the Judiciary Com-mittee that regardless of the judicial nominations his committee continues to report out, they could be blocked on the Senate floor. 
But I do say this just as a caveat: 
The present Judiciary Committee is doing the same thing that was done by the present chairman of the Finance Committee when he was chair of the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3850 June 8, 2015 
Judiciary Committee. He didn’t have 
to worry about a lot of names on the calendar because he simply held no hearings in the Judiciary Committee. The same situation is prevailing now. So we don’t have a lot of people on the calendar because they are not having any hearings to speak of in the Judici-ary Committee. 
I have spoken here on the floor before 
about the nomination of Felipe Restrepo for the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia. After re-peated, repeated, and repeated delays, the committee is finally considering his nomination on Wednesday. He has been waiting for months. This is an in-credibly qualified nominee who enjoys vast bipartisan support, including both Pennsylvania Senators, one a Demo-crat and one a Republican. The Repub-lican Senator from Pennsylvania has said that Judge Restrepo would be a ‘‘superb addition to the Third Circuit.’’ 
In that case we have waited months 
to even have a hearing. 
So it must have been shocking for 
the junior Senator from Pennsylvania to learn that his judicial pick would face another delay—a delay indefi-nitely, perhaps. This is a blatant rejec-tion of the Senate’s constitutional du-ties. 
Just as Senator M
CCONNELL argued 
for fairness for President Bush’s nomi-nations, it is not unreasonable for Democrats to expect that same meas-ure of fairness that President Bush got in the 110th Congress. 
Regardless of whether a State had 
two Democrats, two Republicans or a split delegation, Senate Democrats brought President Bush’s nominees up for a vote. By this point in the seventh year of George W. Bush’s Presidency, Senate Democrats confirmed 18 judges, including 3 circuit court judges. 
In almost 6 months, the Republican 
Senate has only confirmed four district court judges. To put this in perspec-tive, during the Presidency of Bush, we confirmed four in 1 month. 
So perhaps the majority leader’s 
comments about a judicial slowdown were just confirming what he has al-ready done to block the President’s nominees. I repeat. The committee is being run the same way that the present chair of the Finance Com-mittee did when he was chair of the Ju-diciary Committee—just holding no hearings. That way, there is nobody on the calendar—or very few. 
The Republican Senate hasn’t con-
firmed even a single circuit court judge—not even a consensus nominee such as Kara Stoll to the Federal Cir-cuit. She was reported out of com-mittee by a voice vote in April. Noth-ing so far—they are not even having hearings, I repeat, on most nominees. Therefore, there is no one to report to the floor. 
Actions speak louder than words, and 
the majority leader can demonstrate that his remarks were misinterpreted— and I would certainly hope so—by scheduling a prompt vote on the Stoll nomination. We should schedule a vote 
on her nomination no later than this week. Kara Stoll is the only appeals court judge awaiting a vote before the Senate. 
For the reasons I have just said, peo-
ple have been in the pipeline, but they won’t hold hearings. Both of these nominations—Restrepo and Stoll—need a vote now. Let’s hope the majority leader will reflect upon his past state-ments about fair consideration of judi-cial nominees, in comparison to what he said on a talk show—I guess appeal-ing to the rightwing even more than what has happened recently, and that is quite a bit. Let’s hope he does not treat judicial nominees as they have never been treated before. Let’s hope that the Senate will quickly confirm at least these two qualified judges. We need a lot more, but these two would be a step in the right direction. 
I note there is no one on the floor, 
and I ask that the Chair announce the business of the day.

Mr. M CCAIN. Madam President, I 
note with some interest over the week-end in the New York Times that ‘‘Rus-sia Wields Aid and Ideology Against West to Fight Sanctions.’’ 
On the front page of the New York 
Times: 
The war in Ukraine that has pitted Russia 
against the West is being waged not just with tanks, artillery and troops. Increas-ingly, Moscow has brought to bear different kinds of weapons, according to American and European officials: Money, ideology, and disinformation. 
Yesterday and today in the Wall 
Street Journal: ‘‘Iraqis Call for a Deep-er Overhaul of Army.’’ Also: ‘‘Mistrust of military leadership among troops is widespread in crisis of confidence.’’ 
Right below that: ‘‘Airstrikes Kill 
Dozens as Fighting in Yemen Intensi-fies.’’ 
The reporting of a world in turmoil, 
as described by my friend L
INDSEY  
GRAHAM as on fire, continues. 
To top it all off, today, speaking to 
reporters at the G7 summit in Ger-many, President Obama said: ‘‘We don’t yet have a complete strategy about how to combat ISIS.’’ 
I would remind my colleagues that 
on August 28, 2014, nearly a year ago, President Obama stated: ‘‘We don’t have a strategy yet to fight ISIS in Iraq and in Syria.’’ 
My friends, nearly a year after the 
President said we don’t have a strategy yet to fight ISIS in Iraq and in Syria, he said again: We don’t yet have a com-plete strategy about how to combat ISIS.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3851 June 8, 2015 
I would like to see the incomplete 
strategy. I would like to see some-thing. I would not like to see continue that 75 percent of the combat missions that are flown in Iraq and Syria return to base without firing a weapon be-cause we don’t have forward air con-trollers on the ground. 
When is this administration going to 
figure out that if we want to destroy the enemy, we have to be able to iden-tify the enemy, and that requires for-ward air controllers on the ground and that means U.S. troops. 
I know that whenever I and some 
others say we need additional U.S. troops, people recoil and say, Oh, no, here we go again. Well, what is going on now is ISIS is succeeding. Bashar Assad is hanging on. Iran is on the move. They now dominate four coun-tries: Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Lebanon. And the President of the United States says we don’t yet have a complete strategy. 
Well, the Pentagon is a pretty big 
place. There are hundreds of people who work for the National Security Advisor, and somehow, nearly a year later, we don’t yet have a strategy? Wow. ISIS goes from house to house in Ramadi with lists of names and they execute people and they kill 3-year-old children and they burn their bodies in the streets. And the atrocities in Syria continue as Bashar Assad barrel-bombs innocent men, women, and children— barrel bombs, by the way, supplied by Iran and Russia—and we don’t yet have a ‘‘complete strategy.’’ 
Well, I have never seen the world in 
more crises, nor has Henry Kissinger, nor have most other longtime observ-ers of our Nation and the world. 
I urge my colleagues to take a look 
at a map of the Middle East from Janu-ary of 2009, when President Obama was sworn in as President of the United States, and look at that same map today and color in where there is ISIS, where there is Iranian domination, where there is conflict, and where there is a complete lack, except in the State of Israel, of democratization or the kinds of freedoms the United States of America stands for. 
All I can say is one has to wonder 
whether this President just wants to wait out the next year and a half and basically do nothing to stop this geno-cide, blood-letting, and the horrible things that are happening throughout the Middle East, where, in the view of the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Director of the CIA, they say, as far as ISIS is con-cerned, they pose a threat to the secu-rity of the United States. Why do they say that? Obviously, because these thousands of young men who have gone to Syria and Iraq and are being radicalized and trained are going to go back to where they came from. Every-body knows that. 
On the day Baghdadi, the leader of 
ISIS, left our Camp Bucca—where he spent 4 years along with about 25,000 others—he said to the Americans: We will see you in New York. Mr. Baghdadi 
is not known for his sense of humor. 
What we are trying to do in this leg-
islation that is before the Senate is to provide the means, the training, the equipment, the care for the men and women, and the much needed reforms that I have been over and will continue to go over, whether it be in retirement, whether it be in acquisition, whether it be in a number of other areas of the Department of Defense and the way we defend this Nation. That is, in my view, long, long overdue. Now we see the President of the United States threatening to veto this legislation, if it gets through the House and the Sen-ate, over the issue of OCO. That, as my colleagues know, is overseas contin-gency operations, which began with the conflicts in Afghanistan and in Iraq as a means of providing additional funds to pay for and fund the operations in those countries as the name implies— overseas contingency operations. 
I have opposed sequestration. I think 
it is a terrible thing to inflict on the men and women who are serving in the military, much less on our national se-curity. I agree with our uniformed leaders, every one of whom has testi-fied before the Senate Armed Services Committee that if we continue seques-tration, it puts the lives of the men and women who are serving in the mili-tary at greater risk. I don’t know of a greater obligation that we have than to prevent putting the lives of the young men and women who have volunteered to serve this country at greater risk. But that has been lost on my col-leagues on both sides of the aisle. 
So now we have the OCO, and it funds 
the defense of this country at the lev-els the President requested. I don’t like it. I don’t like it because it can only give them 1 year of planning. What the military really needs is to be able to plan for at least 5 years ahead of time. We can’t build new weapons and new ships and new airplanes on a year-to- year basis. But it is better than the se-questration, which, as I said, increases the threat to this Nation’s security. 
Last week, the White House issued a 
Statement of Administration Policy threatening to veto this national secu-rity legislation. The threat hardly comes as a surprise. After all, the President has threatened to veto, for some reason or another, every Defense authorization bill since 2011. The White House’s compilation of complaints is long, but it is woefully short on sub-stance. 
The Statement of Administration 
Policy makes clear that the true basis for the administration’s veto threat has nothing to do with defense. Object-ing to the use of $38 billion in overseas contingency operation funds—or OCO— to meet the President’s request of $612 billion, the statement said the Presi-dent ‘‘will not fix defense without fix-ing nondefense spending.’’ 
It is incomprehensible that as Amer-
ica confronts the most diverse and complex array of crises around the world since the end of World War II, 
that a President of the United States, who has not yet been able to come up with a ‘‘complete strategy’’ for the challenges we face, would veto funding for our military to prove a political point. 
The threats we confront today are far 
more serious than they were a year ago and significantly more so since the 
Congress passed the Budget Control Act in 2011. That legislation arbitrarily capped defense spending and estab-lished the mindless mechanism of se-questration which was triggered in 2013. As a result, with worldwide threats rising, we as a nation are on a course to cut nearly $1 trillion of de-fense spending over 10 years. Every sin-gle military and national security leader who has testified before the Armed Services Committee this year has denounced sequestration and urged its repeal as soon as possible. This leg-islation doesn’t end sequestration, un-fortunately. Believe me, our com-mittee would have done so if the NDAA were capable of it, but it is not. The NDAA is a policy bill. This legislation is a policy bill. It is the appropriators who deal with the money. It only deals with defense issues, and it doesn’t spend a dollar. It provides the Depart-ment of Defense and the men and women in uniform with the authorities and support they need to defend the Nation. It fully supports President Obama’s budget request of $612 billion for national defense, which is $38 bil-lion above the spending caps estab-lished by the Budget Control Act. 
Let me repeat that. The legislation 
gives the President every dollar of budget authority he requested. The dif-ference is that this legislation follows the Senate budget resolution, which was voted on time after time all night long and was agreed to by both Houses of Congress. It is the Senate budget resolution. 
Now, this is not my preferred option, 
as I said. That is why the committee included a special transfer authority in this legislation that allows the Depart-ment of Defense to transfer the addi-tional $38 billion from OCO to the base budget in the event legislation is en-acted that increases the statutory lim-its on discretionary defense and non-defense spending in proportionately equal amounts. This was the product of a bipartisan compromise, and it was the most we could do in the Defense authorization bill to recognize the need for a broader physical agreement with-out denying funding for our military right now. 
Here on the floor we have heard a 
number of misconceptions about OCO funding, many of which have been fed by this administration’s rhetoric. While OCO is not the ideal way to budget our defense, technical and budg-etary consequences to using OCO fund-ing have been greatly exaggerated. OCO is authorized and appropriated on an annual basis, just like base funding. OCO funding is allocated to the same

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3852 June 8, 2015 
DOD accounts as base funding. In fact, 
the Defense bill purposely placed the additional $38 billion of OCO funding in the same accounts and activities for which the President himself requested the money. These activities have his-torically had a large share of OCO funding, and the account has been des-ignated by the President as OCO eligi-ble in the past, and there are no laws that make OCO funding expire any dif-ferently than base funding. 
The White House threat to veto this 
legislation and the desire for increases in nondefense spending are misguided and irresponsible. With global threats rising, it simply makes no sense to op-pose a defense policy bill—legislation 
that spends no money but is full of vital authorities that our troops need— for a reason that has nothing to do with national defense spending. The NDAA should not be treated as a hos-tage in budget negotiation. The polit-ical reality is that the Budget Control Act, which the President signed, re-mains the law of the land. So faced with a choice between OCO money and no money, I choose OCO, and multiple senior military leaders testified before the Armed Services Committee this year that they would make the same choice for one simple reason: This is $38 billion of real money that our mili-tary desperately needs and without which our top military leaders have said they cannot succeed. 
The bottom line is this. The NDAA 
authorized $612 billion for national de-fense. This is the amount requested by the President and justified by his own national security strategy. If the Presi-dent and some of my colleagues oppose the Defense bill due to concerns over nondefense spending, I suspect they will have a very difficult time explain-ing and justifying that choice to Amer-icans who increasingly cite national se-curity as a top concern. 
The Statement of Administration 
Policy raises specious concerns with the sweeping defense acquisition re-forms in the NDAA. For example, the White House asserted that transferring some acquisition authority back to the services is somehow inconsistent with the Secretary of Defense’s exercise of authority, direction, and control over all of the Department of Defense’s pro-grams and activities. I could not dis-agree more with that assertion. What this legislation does is merely switch who does what in certain cir-cumstances from different people who all directly report and serve under the authority, direction, and control of the Secretary of Defense. In this legisla-tion, for a limited number of programs to start with, the Secretary of Defense will look to the service Secretaries di-rectly for management of these acqui-sition programs rather than looking to the Under Secretary of Defense for Ac-quisition, Technology, and Logistics, or AT&L. This is not usurpation of the Secretary of Defense’s power. It is called streamlining of authorities and reducing layers of unnecessary bu-reaucracy. There is a section in the 
legislation that would allow the Sec-retary of Defense to continue to rely on more layers of management, if he chooses, but only if he certifies to Con-gress that this makes sense. There sim-ply is not any undermining of the Sec-retary of Defense’s authority in here. 
Another concern raised has been that 
the transfer of milestone decision au-thority to the services would reduce the Secretary of Defense’s ability— through AT&L—to guard against un-warranted optimism in program plan-ning and budget formulation. Unwar-ranted optimism is indeed a plague on acquisition, and there is not a monop-oly of that in the services. Nothing in this bill overrides a requirement to use better cost estimates from the Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evalua-tion. In fact, new incentives and real penalties imposed on the services in this legislation are designed to put some of this optimism in check. 
Some in the White House and the De-
partment of Defense want to perpet-uate the absurd fiction that the cur-rent system is working. Even after a wave of 25 program cancellations by former Secretary Gates, all of the pro-grams that are left under AT&L man-agement have over $200 billion in cost overruns. 
I want to repeat that. Under the su-
pervision of the Under Secretary of De-fense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, there are programs that have over $200 billion in cost overruns. AT&L is trying to have it both ways, claiming credit for the improvements in the acquisition system while blam-ing the services for its long list of fail-ures. 
This is exactly the program this leg-
islation is trying to address, blurred lines of accountability inside the De-fense Acquisition System that allow its leaders to evade responsibility for re-sults. The reality is that in the modern world the AT&L management process takes too long and costs too much. For example, an Army study looked at the time it would take to go through all of the AT&L reviews and buy nothing. I repeat: To go through all those reviews and buy nothing. What was the answer? Ten years—10 years to buy nothing. The Government Accountability Office looked at the much vaunted milestone reviews that the Office of the Secretary of Defense is touting as a success. Just one review takes on average 2 years. A similar review at the Missile Defense Agency takes about 3 months. Our ad-versaries are not shuffling paper. They are building weapons systems. It is time for us to do the same. 
I find it disappointing or maybe just 
outright laughable that the Statement of Administration Policy expressed concern about the Armed Services Committee’s decision to downsize and streamline the bureaucratic overhead of the Pentagon, while at the same time complaining that we are not let-ting them downsize the fighting forces. Let me repeat. The administration wants to keep more Pentagon bureau-
crats while drawing down our forces and cutting military equipment such as fighter aircraft. 
Is there any Member of this Chamber 
who believes we should increase the Army staff by 60 percent over a decade, and then turn around and slash our Army brigade combat teams from 45 to 32? Of course not. 
The administration cites reductions 
already taking place in headquarters activities, but ignores the fact that the Air Force is trying to achieve those re-ductions by playing a shell game—cre-ating two new organizations and shift-ing people around. Moving the deck chairs on the Titanic didn’t keep the ship from sinking, and shifting people around in a game of ‘‘hide the head-quarters staff’’ will not keep our na-tional security from sinking under the weight of bureaucratic empires. 
As the White House asks the Senate 
to preserve bloated staffs, the State-ment of Administration Policy laments the Committee’s effort to address dan-gerous strike fighter capacity short-falls across the services. As deliveries of the F–35 have continued to fall short of projections, the Air Force has con-tinued to drain combat power. Senior Air Force officials have repeatedly tes-tified to the alarming reality that their service is the smallest in its his-tory, with readiness at very low levels, all while our airmen perform ongoing combat operations in the Middle East, theater support packages in Eastern Europe, presence and reassurance to our allies in the Asia-Pacific, and maintain a strong strategic nuclear de-terrence posture. The misallocation of airpower resources over the past 6 years, coupled with the mismanage-ment of very expensive aircraft weap-ons systems procurement programs, places America’s national security in-terests in jeopardy and endangers the lives of our men and women in uni-form. 
Our military commanders know this 
is true. That is why, for example, the Chief of Naval Operations and the Com-mandant of the Marine Corps included in their unfunded priorities lists re-quests for 12 F–18 Super Hornets for the Navy and 6 F–35B Joint Strike Fighters for the Marine Corps. The NDAA funds these requests because senior Navy and Marine Corps leaders have repeatedly testified to significant strike fighter shortfalls in the maritime services due to unanticipated increased combat op-erations in the Middle East, aging and obsolete fighter aircraft, and signifi-cant delays in the F–35 Joint Strike Fighter delivery schedule. Bizarrely, the White House has apparently dis-regarded that testimony and instead labels these requests for more combat power from our military commanders as ‘‘unnecessary.’’ 
The Statement of Administration 
Policy opposes the strong oversight measures put in place by the NDAA on the Ford-class aircraft carrier pro-gram. The administration objects to a

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3853 June 8, 2015 
provision in this legislation that re-
duces the cost cap for the USS John F. 
Kennedy by $100 million from $11.498 
billion to $11.398 billion. But in the budget request, the Navy estimated the cost of this ship at $11.348 billion. In other words, the NDAA still provides a buffer of $50 million. The provision simply locks in the savings the Depart-ment has advertised, which comes after more than $2 billion in cost growth—$2 billion in cost growth of one aircraft carrier. Unless the budget request is misleading or inaccurate, this provi-sion should not result in reduced capa-bility or a breach of the cost cap as the administration claims. 
It is also unfortunate that the ad-
ministration doesn’t recognize the im-portance of conducting full-ship shock trials on the USS Gerald R. Ford , 
known as CVN–78. With the abundance of new technology, including the cata-pult, arresting gear, and radar, as well as the reliance on electricity rather than steam to power key systems, there continues to be a great deal of risk in this program. Testing CVN–78 will not only improve the design of fu-ture carriers but also reduce the costs associated with retrofitting engineer-ing changes. Absent this provision, the Navy will delay by up to 7 years full- ship shock trials and shift the test from the lead ship in the class to the second ship. That poses the risk that CVN–78 will deploy and potentially fight without this testing, putting the lives of our sailors at risk. 
The Statement of Administration 
Policy also raised objections to a num-ber of provisions related to military personnel. For instance, the adminis-tration bemoans the fact that the Com-mittee did not adopt its plan to raise existing TRICARE fees and implement new fees for Medicare-eligible retirees and their family members. The so- called Consolidated Health Plans would not have created a modern, value-based health care system. The administra-tion made no attempt at all to improve access to care, quality of care or bene-ficiary satisfaction. The NDAA, on the other hand, addresses those issues and more without raising enrollment fees or creating new fees. 
The White House expressed concern 
about the provisions in the NDAA that call for a plan to privatize com-missaries and a 2-year pilot program at no fewer than five commissaries in the largest markets of the commissary sys-tem to assess the feasibility and advis-ability of the plan. But the rationale is confusing. The administration claims that ‘‘there is an independent study un-derway to determine whether privat-ization is a feasible option and we should wait for those results prior to making any policy changes.’’ The bill did require a comprehensive review in fiscal year 2015 by an independent orga-nization of the management, food, and pricing options of the commissary sys-tem. But in that section, there was no requirement to study the feasibility of privatization of the commissary sys-tem. It is also curious that the admin-
istration warns against implementing a pilot program on privatization before the results of an independent study, 
while at the same time encouraging the Congress to adopt their own pro-posed pilot program. 
The White House’s policy statement 
reflects the President’s feckless policy towards Russia. Despite the advice of nearly every statesman and policy ex-pert who has appeared before the Armed Services Committee in recent months—Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, Madeleine Albright, Zbigniew Brzezinski, and others—and against the advice of both the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense, the President has refused to provide defensive lethal assistance to Ukraine. The President’s continued inaction, for fear of pro-voking Russia, is seen by Putin as weakness and invites the very aggres-sion we seek to avoid. 
The Ukrainian people aren’t asking 
for U.S. troops. They are simply asking for the right tools to defend themselves and their country, and those are the tools that this legislation would pro-vide. 
We have seen Vladimir Putin commit 
aggression, draw back, commit more aggression, draw back. We are now in the phase where any day now we will see continued aggression and territory- grabbing by Vladimir Putin as he es-tablishes his land bridge to Crimea and puts additional pressures on Baltic countries and Moldova. Meanwhile, we refuse to give the Ukrainians weapons with which to defend themselves. 
This bill does not force the President 
to provide lethal assistance to Ukraine. Trust me, if there were a way to do that, it would be in this bill. The Presi-dent has a decision to make on pro-viding lethal assistance to Ukraine. That decision has consequences far be-yond whether the President obligates the full amount of funds authorized in a decision that is long overdue. 
Making matters worse, the State-
ment of Administration Policy seeks flexibility to continue our Nation’s de-pendence on Russian rocket engines. The NDAA would put an end to this de-pendence by 2019 and stop hundreds of millions of dollars from going to Vladi-mir Putin and his cronies. It elimi-nates a launch subsidy that the com-mander of Air Force Space Command has stated impedes fair competition, and it directs the administration to stop playing games, develop a domestic rocket engine—not a new rocket sys-tem—to replace the Russian RD–180. 
The Russians are being paid billions 
of dollars for their rocket engines, and there is a ‘‘middle man’’ who has made tens of millions of dollars just by mov-ing those rockets from Russia to the United States. There is an individual who runs this outfit who has been sanc-tioned by the U.S. Government, and we have elements in the Pentagon who still want to deal with him for as long as possible. 
In testimony before the Armed Serv-
ices Committee in March, Gen. John Kelly, the commander of U.S. Southern 
Command, testified: ‘‘With the amount of drugs and people that move across our southwest border, it doesn’t seem all that secure to me.’’ General Kelly went on to state that the threat of ter-rorists crossing our southern border is ‘‘extremely serious’’ and that ‘‘if a ter-rorist or almost anyone wants to get into our country, they just pay the fare.’’ They just pay the fare. 
That is why this bill would provide 
$45 million for Operation Phalanx, in-creasing border security operations by the National Guard along the southern border, and boosting aerial surveil-lance of the region by up to 60 percent. To date, Operation Phalanx has di-rectly contributed to more than 96,000 apprehensions along the border and the interdiction of more than 282,000 pounds of drugs destined for our com-munities. 
The legislation directs the Secretary 
of Defense to provide up to $75 million in additional assistance to Customs and Border Protection operations to se-cure the southern border, potentially including the deployment of personnel, surveillance assets, and intelligence support from the U.S. military. The NDAA would authorize an additional $50 million to address U.S. Southern Command’s unfunded priorities to in-crease surveillance and interdiction op-erations in Central America—a pri-mary transit point for illicit traf-ficking into the United States. 
Finally, I am disappointed by the ad-
ministration’s puzzling response to provisions in the NDAA related to the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. The administration argues that this legislation’s limitations placed on Guantanamo Bay transfers are unnec-essary and beyond the scope of congres-sional authority. That is false. Con-gress has long had constitutional au-thority over wartime detention mat-ters, and there are good reasons for Congress to assert its authority in this instance. 
For over 6 years, the administration 
has stated that one of its highest pol-icy priorities is to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. But for that same period of time, Members of the Senate have repeatedly requested a plan that explains how the administra-tion will handle each of the detainees currently held there, and unfortu-nately, over the last 6
1⁄2years, the ad-
ministration has consistently failed to provide that plan. 
As the terrorist threat continues 
around the world and grows and metas-tasizes, the administration continues to demand that the facility be closed while failing to explain how it will do so. There are serious legal and security challenges inherent in moving this pop-ulation to other locations, whether in-side or outside of the United States. Congress is simply asking the execu-tive branch to explain where it will hold those set for trial, how it will con-tinue to detain dangerous terrorists pursuant to the laws of war, and how it

will mitigate the risks of moving this 
population. If the administration can provide those answers to these basic questions to the satisfaction of the American people, then congressional restrictions on the movement of these detainees will be lifted and the plan can be implemented. 
Now, Congress’s need for answers is 
even more acute after the administra-tion transferred five senior Taliban de-tainees under secret agreement to Qatar without prior notification to Congress as required by law. The Presi-dent of the United States blatantly violated the law—which required, be-fore these five detainees were trans-ferred to Qatar, that Congress be noti-fied 6 months ahead of time—using the rationale that they were afraid the in-formation might leak. Is that justifica-tion for breaking the law? And isn’t it understandable, the skepticism here on both sides of the aisle about any plan they may have or may not have? Isn’t it reasonable that the Congress of the United States should be presented with a plan, and shouldn’t the Congress of the United States express its approval or disapproval? 
The notification standard was en-
acted into law to allow the President the authority to implement his stated policy but with a good-faith under-standing that the people’s representa-tive could weigh in on these important decisions before the transfers hap-pened. The President’s failure to abide by the notification provisions under-mined any trust Congress had in the process. 
Now, as the Taliban continues to plot 
attacks against U.S. servicemembers in Afghanistan, the administration is scurrying to figure out how to keep those five terrorists from the battle-field. 
This is not congressional overreach; 
it is congressional oversight. The President has decided that the security risks of keeping Guantanamo open out-weigh the security and legal risks of closing it. Congress is seeking informa-tion that will allow the American peo-ple and Congress to understand that decision. 
The American people deserve an ex-
planation for how the President plans to execute one of his most repeated policy goals. There is some dispute about what percentage of those who have been released from detention in Guantanamo have reentered the fight. Some say it is as high as 30 percent, and some say it is as low as 7 or 8 per-cent. There is no debate that detainees who were released from Guantanamo have reentered the fight, placing the lives of American service men and women in jeopardy and in danger. Of course, the five who were released were amongst the toughest, the worst, the hardest cases. Now there is some ques-tion as to whether they will remain under strict supervision in Qatar. 
Let me conclude by simply saying 
that the NDAA is far too important to be held hostage in a budget negotia-tion. For 53 consecutive years, the Con-
gress has passed a national defense au-thorization act. With threats to our na-tional security multiplying around the world, I would hope this year would be no different. 
I thank my colleague from Rhode Is-
land for all of the hard work he and his staff and Members on that side of the aisle have done in order to have legis-lation that passed overwhelmingly through the Senate Armed Services Committee. I hope we can move for-ward on getting that legislation through the Senate, in consultation and in compromise with the House, and to the White House for the President’s signature. 
I would say again that I read care-
fully the administration’s objection to the legislation as it now stands. These are not valid in some cases. In other cases, we would be glad to negotiate with the White House as we go to con-ference with the House after com-pleting this. I sincerely hope and pray that—there are so many provisions there that are important to the lives of the men and women serving in the military that I would hope the Presi-dent would take into consideration how important this is to the men and women who are serving, their lives and their welfare, their equipment, their training, and their ability to defend this Nation.

MIAMI CONSERVANCY DISTRICT 
100TH ANNIVERSARY 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I wish 
to recognize the Miami Conservancy District as it celebrates the 100th anni-versary of its founding on June 28, 2015. 
After the Great Flood of 1913, the 
people of the Miami Valley vowed ‘‘never again’’ and proceeded to raise $2 million in 2 months to fund the design of a flood protection system for river-front cities on the Great Miami River

that now extends from Piqua to Ham-
ilton. 
Since the dams and levees were com-
pleted in 1922, the Miami Conservancy District’s protection system has pre-vented countless floods, preserving 35,000 acres of land for public use as walking trails, picnic areas and parks. 
In addition, the Miami Conservancy 
District assists in the management of Ohio’s largest state-designated water trail network with 265 miles of water-ways, providing paddling and fishing opportunities on the Great Miami, Stillwater and Mad Rivers. 
The Miami Conservancy District is 
also a leader on natural resource devel-opment and has been a key partner in projects like downtown Dayton’s RiverScape, which has improved the quality of life for Miami Valley resi-dents by bringing natural features into an urban environment. 
The Miami Conservancy District pro-
tects some of Ohio’s greatest natural wonders and I congratulate those in-volved in making its first 100 years a success.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
CONGRATULATING THE FRANCES 
PERKINS CENTER 
∑Mr. KING. Mr. President, I wish to 
congratulate the Frances Perkins Cen-ter on the designation of the Frances Perkins Homestead, located in New-castle, ME, as a National Historic Landmark. The Brick House was the home of the remarkable Frances Per-kins, the first woman appointed to a Presidential cabinet. This is an honor that has been given to only 2,500 other historic places in the United States and I applaud the Frances Perkins Cen-ter for receiving this distinction. 
Frances Perkins found that no mat-
ter where she lived during her life, her true home would always be in Maine. While she was born in Boston in 1880, both of her parents were native Mainers. She grew up living in Worces-ter and spending summers with her grandmother on the family’s saltwater farm in Newcastle. Frances credited her own character to be a direct result of her grandmother’s influence and their time together in Maine. 
Frances was a motivated and inquisi-
tive person from a young age. She at-tended Classical High School in Worcester and, though it was uncom-mon at the time, she went on to Mount Holyoke College where she was a stand-out student. Professors immediately noticed Frances’ ambition and natural intellect. Frances graduated from Mont Holyoke in 1902 with a major in physics and minors in chemistry and biology. 
Throughout her life, Frances was de-
voted to improving the lives of Amer-ican workers. After college, Frances moved to Illinois, working as a teacher and volunteering in settlement houses. She then received her master’s degree from Colombia and subsequently began her extraordinary career in public serv-
ice, working for the New York City Consumers League and then the New York State Industrial Commission. 
The impressive work by Frances for 
the Industrial Commission led to newly elected New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt to name her New York State Commissioner of Labor. She re-ceived attention and admiration in this role for her ceaseless commitment to improving work conditions in New York. In February 1933, Roosevelt ap-pointed Frances Secretary of Labor in his Presidential cabinet. Frances was the first female Federal cabinet offi-cial, which remains one of her most no-table and outstanding achievements. 
Frances’ accomplishments as Sec-
retary of Labor had, and continue to have, a profound impact on American lives. Frances was the lead architect in designing New Deal policies during the Great Depression; however, her work did not stop there. She was incredibly influential in creating legislation for Social Security and establishing a 40- hour work week. Frances is also known for her major role in prohibiting child labor, enforcing worker’s rights, and designing unemployment insurance as well as workers’ aid. 
Frances’ beliefs, values, and spirit 
grew from her strong connection to Maine. Frances regularly returned to her Maine home, especially when she desired a haven to rest and remember her roots. She owned and maintained the family farm in Newcastle from 1927 until she died on May 14, 1965 at the age of 85. She is buried nearby the homestead. 
I am thrilled at the nomination of 
the Frances Perkins Homestead as a National Historic Landmark. Frances was a fearless leader who exemplified American values of hard work and de-termination. Frances’ work lives on as an essential benefit to countless Amer-ican citizens. I am proud that her leg-acy is a part of Maine’s history and I warmly congratulate the Frances Per-kins Homestead, and all those involved with achieving this accomplishment, on its dedication as a National Historic Landmark. ∑

GIRL SCOUTS OF AMERICA 103RD 
ANNIVERSARY 
∑Mr. KING. Mr. President, I wish to 
recognize the Girl Scouts of America on the occasion of their 103rd Anniver-sary. The Girl Scouts were created in 1912 in the midst of the progressive movement by Juliette Gordon Low for the purpose of empowering young women and instilling them with char-acter, honesty, patriotism, and leader-ship skills. The independence and in-tegrity that young women develop with the Girl Scouts is a priceless resource for these girls later in life. 
For 103 years, the Girl Scouts have 
influenced female leaders, and have led the fight for equality and inclusiveness in leadership positions. The fact that former girl scouts make up 60 percent of the women in the House of Rep-
resentatives and over 50 percent of cur-rent female business owners dem-onstrates the organization’s ability to cultivate leaders. Through the Girl Scouts, girls have gained skills that are essential tools to help women achieve equality in leadership posi-tions. 
The Girl Scouts have also developed 
and implemented programs to help middle and high school girls become fi-nancially literate and independent. In-deed, the Girl Scout Cookie Program is the largest girl-led business in the world and is a hallmark program that helps girls across the country develop the skills, such as money management, customer interaction, and business eth-ics, which are essential to life-long suc-cess. They have also invested in science and mathematics programs to empower young women who have an interest in those fields. Through their continued efforts to develop girls’ leadership abilities, confidence, and worldly knowledge, the Girl Scouts have played an important role in helping young women reach their full potential. 
Today, I mark the legacy and future 
of this invaluable organization. I ap-plaud the Girl Scouts of Maine, and America, for the immeasurable impact they have had on women’s rights, and women themselves, over the past 103 years. ∑

TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT 
COLONEL PETER W. OGDEN 
∑Mr. KING. Mr. President, I wish to 
honor the career of LTC Peter W. Ogden, who will retire this June as di-rector of the Bureau of Veterans’ Serv-ices. Peter has served in this role for the past 11 years and I am profoundly grateful for all that he has done for Maine and our esteemed veterans. 
Peter began serving the Nation and 
the State of Maine long before his posi-tion as director. He enlisted in the U.S Army Corps of Engineers in 1967 and in the following years he completed two combat tours in Vietnam. After grad-uating from Maine Military Academy as a Distinguished Graduate, Peter served in the Maine Army National Guard. In total, Peter spent an impres-sive 28 years of his life dedicated to military service. 
Peter is an excellent example of a 
person who brings personal and selfless commitment to his career. As a vet-eran himself, Peter has a complete and thorough understanding of the chal-lenges and issues veterans face on a regular basis. He has worked tirelessly to provide Maine veterans and their families with informational services, assistance programs, and strong rep-resentation. Through his work as direc-tor, Peter has improved the lives of countless Maine veterans and families. 
The programs and services Peter de-
veloped while director are essential to veterans as well as military men, women and families. I was particularly impressed by Peter’s work supporting

Gold Star families through projects 
such as House in the Woods. This project continues to help both families and veterans cope with loss by pro-viding a close support network and outdoor-related experiences, from fish-ing to hiking. 
I greatly value public servants like 
Peter and I have a high appreciation for the essential and high-quality serv-ice he has ensured for Maine veterans during his time as director of the Bu-reau of Veterans’ Services. I extend my sincerest congratulations and grati-tude to Peter for all of his accomplish-ments and I wish him all the best in his well-deserved retirement. ∑

CONGRATULATING SOUTHERN 
MAINE PLANNING AND DEVEL-OPMENT COMMISSION 
∑Mr. KING. Mr. President, today I 
bring to the fore an organization that serves as a model for coordinated eco-nomic development and environmental responsibility. Later this month, the Southern Maine Planning and Develop-ment Commission, or SMPDC, will cel-ebrate its 50th anniversary. This mile-stone is a testament not only to its longevity and breadth, but also to its ability to continually develop perti-nent projects for southern Maine’s economy. They are truly an inspiration for similar initiatives across the coun-try and around the globe. 
SMPDC is a Council of Governments 
enabled by State statute that serves the southern part of our great State in 39 communities. As this region forms the southern tip of Maine, it injects economic vitality to all corners of the State as the ‘‘Gateway to Maine.’’ It boasts 300 miles of breathtaking coast-line—with rocky points, quiet inlets, and sandy beaches. This coastline alone brings in thousands of tourists each year who wish to share the mar-vels of our distinct and special home. This region also extends westward to-ward the White Mountains, an area dotted with numerous lakes, fertile lands, dense forests, and crossed by the mighty Saco River. To help maintain this land for us and for future genera-tions, the folks at SMPDC offer com-prehensive planning and ordinance re-vision to communities to ensure they achieve the appropriate growth while preserving the land and shoreline that so characterizes the Maine way of life. 
Being the Gateway to Maine, and 
given the recent Federal gridlock over properly funding the Highway Trust Fund, I would be remiss not to mention the commission’s work to assist mu-nicipalities throughout the region in transportation project planning and management. They have rallied local leaders and first responders to address the emergencies on the roads and made the veins of our economy safer through their Traffic Incident Management Group—which in 2007 was given the Ex-cellence in Regional Transportation Award by the National Association of Development. Furthermore, with I–95 and Amtrak pouring resources and rev-
enue into the State, SMPDC has been essential to coordinating community action to ensure we make the most of these assets. 
And even while focusing on the larg-
est arteries of transportation in the area, the commission has not turned a blind eye to the scenic roads and healthy travel alternatives that en-courage people to get outdoors and re-affirms access and economic prospects for Maine’s vibrant eco-tourism indus-try. Teaming up with the Bicycle Coa-lition of Maine, SMPDC has success-fully implemented the York County Active Communities Network. This ini-tiative explores the potential for im-provements and funding opportunities for those looking to bike or walk safely and freely throughout their commu-nity. The group has also added further economic vitality to Maine through its work with the Pequawket Trail Scenic Byway, which winds its way through the White Mountains in western Maine and along the Saco River. This Cor-ridor Management Plan floods the sce-nic towns along it with visitors and economic opportunity from downtown Standish to historic Fryeburg. 
Perhaps what the commission is 
most widely recognized for is their suc-cess with the Brownfields Redevelop-ment Project, which is funded in part by the EPA’s Brownfield and Land Re-vitalization Program. Brownfields are abandoned or underused industrial and commercial properties that have some threat of environmental contamina-tion, whether it is real or perceived. Beginning in 2004, the Brownfield Rede-velopment Project started funding ven-tures throughout southern Maine to re-build old dams, mills, and other pre-viously condemned facilities to help re-introduce many of Maine’s beautiful, historic buildings to their commu-nities. South Berwick now boasts a fantastic renovated library and Kennebunk even retooled a gas station to create a community ice rink, while the mills in Sanford and Biddeford are teeming with hundreds of new busi-nesses. At an event earlier in the year, the EPA cited SMPDC as one of the top 10 in the Nation for their wide ranging success with these projects. This work is truly exciting and a perfect dem-onstration of SMPDC’s powerful im-pact on southern Maine. 
As the Southern Maine Planning and 
Development Council ushers in their 50th anniversary on June 24, we should take time to reflect on the countless dedicated public servants who have worked with unwavering commitment to better their communities. I am deeply grateful for their countless ac-complishments, and look forward to the many more inspiring and produc-tive projects they undertake in the fu-ture. ∑

2015 WOMEN’S WORLD CUP 
∑Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
wish to recognize the United States women’s national soccer team as it 
prepares for the first game in its pur-suit of World Cup glory in Canada. As with the men’s team last year, my home State is well represented on the women’s team, with four players: Tobin Heath, Carli Lloyd, Heather O’Reilly, and Christie Rampone, who call New Jersey home. 
These athletes and the 19 others se-
lected by head coach Jill Ellis have worked tirelessly to hone their skills in order to become some of the best players in the world. Despite being drawn into the so-called ‘‘group of death,’’ this U.S. team enters the tour-nament as one of the favorites, and I am confident that they will represent us well and make us all proud to be Americans. 
While much of the world considers 
the U.S. to be a relative newcomer to the global soccer community on the men’s side of the game, our women’s team is unmatched in its esteem, hav-ing won two World Cup titles since the tournament began in 1991 and never finishing below third place. I hope that this U.S. team will build upon its rich history of success at the seventh Wom-en’s World Cup. 
I believe that we will win. ∑

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and were referred or ordered to lie on the 
table as indicated: 
POM–33. A joint memorial adopted by the 
Legislature of the State of Washington urg-ing the United States Congress to support the conversion of the 81st Armored Brigade Combat Team of the Washington National Guard into a Stryker Brigade Combat Team with brigade units stationed in Washington, Oregon, and California; to the Committee on Armed Services. 
S
ENATE JOINT MEMORIAL 8008 
Whereas, The opportunity exists to add a 
second Stryker Brigade Combat Team to the Army National Guard’s force structure, and to locate this Brigade on the west coast; and 
Whereas, There are a variety of practical 
and strategic reasons which make the 81st Armored Brigade Combat Team a logical candidate for conversion; and 
Whereas, A Stryker Brigade Combat Team 
stationed on the west coast will strengthen our nation’s defense by maintaining Stryker capacity focused on the Asia-Pacific Region, enhance Regular Army/Army National Guard partnership, and provide a key domestic re-sponse capability; and 
Whereas, Transitioning the 81st Armored 
Brigade Combat Team to a Stryker Brigade Combat Team strategically places Strykers in Washington, Oregon, and California, and will save taxpayers thirty million dollars over the course of an army force generation cycle; and 
Whereas, The 81st Armored Brigade Com-
bat Team is headquartered at Camp Murray, Washington, located just across the street from Joint Base Lewis-McChord, which is the United States Army’s Stryker Center of Excellence and is within convoy range of the 
Yakima Training Center; and 
Whereas, The extensive Stryker infrastruc-
ture available at Joint Base Lewis-McChord and the Yakima Training Center represents a great advantage in leveraging shared re-sources; and 
Whereas, Furthermore, this places the 
Stryker Brigade Combat Team equipment sets brought back from overseas contin-gencies into mission-ready use, and available for overseas and domestic contingency re-sponse; and 
Whereas, Strykers will also give the gov-
ernors of Washington, Oregon, and California a fast, durable, and effective asset to save lives, protect property, maintain peace, and ensure the continuity of government in times of emergency; 
Now, therefore, Your Memorialists respect-
fully pray that as you consider force struc-ture balance in this era of constrained re-sources, coupled with the tactical, strategic, and domestic needs of our nation, you will support the conversion of the 81st Armored Brigade Combat Team of the Washington Na-tional Guard into a Stryker Brigade Combat Team with brigade units stationed in Wash-ington, Oregon, and California. 
Be it resolved, That copies of this Memo-
rial be immediately transmitted to the Hon-orable Barack Obama, President of the United States, General Frank J. Grass, Chief of the National Guard Bureau, the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and each mem-ber of Congress from the State of Wash-ington. 
POM–34. A joint memorial adopted by the 
Legislature of the State of Washington urg-ing the United States Congress to expedite appropriation of funds, for Columbia River Basin dreissenid efforts, to significantly en-hance monitoring and prevention efforts and to implement the intent of the Water Re-sources Reform and Development Act; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. S
ENATE JOINT MEMORIAL 8013 
Whereas, Maintaining a healthy suite of 
economic, environmental, and social eco-system services in aquatic systems is inte-gral to the quality of life in the State of Washington; and 
Whereas, Healthy aquatic habitats provide 
clean drinking water, flood control, trans-portation, recreation, purification of human and industrial wastes, power generation, habitat for native plants and animals, pro-duction of fish and other foods, marketable goods, and cultural benefits; and 
Whereas, Aquatic invasive species, includ-
ing Dreissenids (quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) and zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha)), are invasive spe-cies that cause irreparable ecological dam-age to many waters in the United States; and 
Whereas, Dreissenids have not yet been de-
tected in the Pacific Northwest. The esti-mated annual cost to address established populations of dreissenids in the Pacific Northwest economic region is almost five hundred million dollars annually; and 
Whereas, The Water Resources Reform and 
Development Act was signed in June 2014. It authorizes twenty million dollars for Colum-bia River Basin dreissenid efforts through the Secretary of the Army; 
Now, therefore, Your Memorialists respect-
fully request that Congress expedite appro-priation of these funds to significantly en-hance monitoring and prevention efforts and to implement the intent of the Water Re-sources Reform and Development Act. 
Be it resolved; That copies of this Memo-
rial be immediately transmitted to the Hon-orable Barack Obama, President of the United States, Sally Jewell, Secretary of the Department of the Interior, the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and each member of Congress from the State of Washington. 
POM–35. A joint resolution adopted by the 
Legislature of the State of Nevada urging the United States Congress to amend the Mi-gratory Bird Treaty Act or take any other appropriate action to ensure that the com-mon raven is not a protected species under the Act; to the Committee on Environmental and Public Works. 
A
SSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 2 
Whereas, The greater sage grouse 
(Centrocercus urophasianus) is a species of bird that inhabits much of the sagebrush habitat in Nevada as well as other western states; and 
Whereas, The United States Fish and Wild-
life Service has determined that the greater sage grouse is warranted for listing as endan-gered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 U.S.C. §§1531 et seq.; and 
Whereas, Through the enactment of Senate 
Concurrent Resolution No. 15, File Number 48, Statutes of Nevada 2005, at page 3022, the members of the 73rd Session of the Nevada Legislature found that the listing of the greater sage grouse as an endangered or threatened species would have a devastat-ingly negative impact on Nevada’s land de-velopment, land use, water use, mining, rec-reational activities and local economies; and 
Whereas, The desert tortoise (Gopherus 
agassizii) is a species of tortoise that inhab-its the desert habitat of the southwestern United States, including the Mojave desert region of southern Nevada; and 
Whereas, The desert tortoise is listed as a 
threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 U.S.C. §§1531 et seq.; and 
Whereas, The common raven (Corvus 
corax) is a species of bird that inhabits Ne-vada and much of the western United States, Mexico, Canada, Europe and Asia; and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3860 June 8, 2015 
Whereas, The International Union for Con-
servation of Nature estimates the global pop-ulation of the common raven as greater than 16 million and trending upwards, thus classifying it as a species of least concern; and 
Whereas, A known cause of decline in the 
sage grouse population is egg depredation by the common raven, and research conducted at Idaho State University has suggested that reductions in the raven population signifi-cantly increase sage grouse nest success; and 
Whereas, The United States Fish and Wild-
life Service has identified the common raven as the most highly visible predator of hatch-ling and juvenile desert tortoises, and re-search published by the Western Ecological Research Center of the United States Geo-logical Survey recommends controlling cer-tain raven populations to assist in the recov-ery of desert tortoise populations; and 
Whereas, The common raven is a protected 
species under regulations adopted pursuant to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, 16 U.S.C. §§1703 et seq., which drastically cur-tails the ability of this State to manage the population of the common raven in order to protect sage grouse nests and desert tor-toises: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the 
State of Nevada, Jointly, That the members of 
the 78th Session of the Nevada Legislature urge the United States Congress to amend the Migratory Bird Treaty Act or take any other appropriate action to ensure that the common raven is not a protected species under that Act; and be it further 
Resolved, That the members of the 78th 
Session of the Nevada Legislature urge the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to: 
1. Work with the Nevada Department of 
Wildlife to decrease common raven popu-lations in this State; and 
2. Adopt regulations allowing the State of 
Nevada to manage the common raven popu-lation and reduce the number of common ravens in this State; and be it further 
Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the As-
sembly prepare and transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of the United States as the presiding officer of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Rep-resentatives, each member of the Nevada Congressional Delegation, the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the President of the Nevada Cattlemen’s As-sociation, the President of the Nevada Farm Bureau Federation, the Chair of the Sage-brush Ecosystem Council and the Executive Director of the Western Governors’ Associa-tion; and be it further 
Resolved, That this resolution becomes ef-
fective upon passage. 
POM–36. A resolution adopted by the House 
of Representatives of the State of Michigan urging the President of the United States to allow an additional 25,000 refugee visas for certain displaced individuals, with pref-erence for placement in Michigan; to the Committee on the Judiciary. 
H
OUSE RESOLUTION NO. 9 
Whereas, The United States has long been 
a safe harbor for persecuted foreign nation-als. Through the U.S. refugee visa program, individuals and their families who are har-assed, oppressed, or have faced harassment or oppression at home because of their race, religion, nationality, public opinion, or so-cial association can find relief in the U.S. When a humanitarian crisis occurs, the U.S. may also grant eligible individuals refugee visas. Once in the country, federal resettle-ment agencies help match refugees with local communities that can help support their needs; and 
Whereas, The number of refugee visas 
available is determined and set by the Presi-dent of the United States. In consultation 
with the cabinet and the House and Senate committees on the judiciary, the President assesses all concerns of humanitarian and national interest to determine the number of visas that will be available for the upcoming fiscal year; and 
Whereas, The recent crisis in Syria and 
Iraq has forced hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, largely from religious minorities in the region—many of which are Assyrians, Chaldeans, Syriacs, and Yazidis—from their hometowns that have been ransacked by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Those displaced persons are unable to return to their homes, and most do not have access to resources needed to fulfill basic needs, in-cluding food, water, and shelter. Moreover, these refugees face constant fear of persecu-tion due to nothing more than the faith they claim, and their pronouncement of faith has led to violence as explicit as crucifixions, be-headings, and slavery. Minimal support has been offered to many of the more than three million Iraqis refugees, two million of which were displaced last year alone, and those for-tunate to remain in temporary shelters are overburdening and overcrowding neighboring nations and communities who stand on con-stant guard for fear that they will be the next target of ISIL. As this regional conflict endures, the displacement and imminent mi-gration and persecution of refugees will con-tinue; and 
Whereas, Displaced Iraqi refugees must be 
offered relief from this regional instability and granted entry into the United States. Iraqi refugees have complemented our Amer-ican society with a proven history of con-tributing to the economic and social well- being of this nation. In the Chaldean or Catholic Iraqi community of Metro Detroit, which is the largest concentration of Chaldeans outside of Iraq, 61 percent of households founded their own business, and this network of businesses is indispensable to the local economy. Moreover, organiza-tions like the Chaldean Community Founda-tion offer resources to bind and strengthen the community as well as welcome and sup-port refugees, in part by using community businesses to invest in new members and en-courage the advancement of the community; and 
Whereas, The current allotment of refugee 
visas may not be adequate to accommodate these individuals. When an unforeseen emer-gency arises, the President has the flexi-bility to issue emergency refugee visas for an affected group if the remaining annual allot-ment is insufficient to assist these displaced individuals, and 
Whereas, The Chaldean Church and its 
bishop have garnered support for this request and driven a body of people able and willing to sustain and support the incoming refu-gees. The community stands ready to assist persecuted Iraqis and victims of war rebuild their lives in the U.S.: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives, 
That we urge the President of the United States to allow an additional 25,000 refugee visas for displaced Iraqis, being the Assyr-ians, Chaldeans, Syriacs, and Yazidis dis-placed because of their faith; and be it fur-ther 
Resolved, That we urge that these refugees 
be given preference for placement in the state of Michigan; and be it further 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
transmitted to the President of the United States, the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan congressional delegation. EXECUTIVE REPORT OF

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 194—WEL-
COMING THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA ON HER OFFICIAL VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES AND CELEBRATING THE UNITED STATES-REPUBLIC OF KOREA RELATIONSHIP, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES 
Mr. GARDNER (for himself and Mr. 
C
ARDIN ) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. R ES. 194 
Whereas the Government and people of the 
United States and the Republic of Korea share a comprehensive alliance, a dynamic partnership, and a personal friendship rooted in the common values of freedom, democ-racy, and a free market economy; 
Whereas the alliance between the United 
States and the Republic of Korea is a linchpin of regional stability in Asia, includ-ing against the threats posed by the regime in Pyongyang; 
Whereas cooperation between our nations 
spans across the security, diplomatic, eco-nomic, energy, and cultural spheres; 
Whereas the relationship between the peo-
ple of the United States and the Republic of Korea stretches back to Korea’s Chosun Dy-nasty, when the United States and Korea es-tablished diplomatic relations under the 1882 Treaty of Peace, Amity, Commerce, and Navigation; 
Whereas the United States-Republic of 
Korea alliance was forged in blood, with cas-ualties of the United States during the Ko-rean War of 54,246 dead (of whom 33,739 were battle deaths) and more than 103,284 wound-ed, and casualties of the Republic of Korea of over 50,000 soldiers dead and over 10,000 wounded; 
Whereas the Korean War Veterans Rec-
ognition Act (Public Law 111–41) was enacted on July 27, 2009, and President Barack Obama issued a proclamation to designate the date as the National Korean War Vet-erans Armistice Day and called upon Ameri-cans to display flags at half-staff in memory of the Korean War veterans; 
Whereas the Republic of Korea has stood 
shoulder-to-shoulder alongside the United States in all 4 major engagements the United States has faced since World War II—the Vietnam War, the Persian Gulf War, in Af-ghanistan, and in Iraq; Whereas, since the 1953 Mutual Defense 
Treaty, to which the Senate gave its advice and consent to ratification on January 26, 1954, United States military personnel have maintained a continuous presence on the Ko-rean Peninsula, and currently there are ap-proximately 28,500 United States troops sta-tioned in the Republic of Korea; 
Whereas, in January 2014, the United 
States and the Republic of Korea success-fully concluded negotiations for a new five- year Special Measures Agreement (SMA), es-tablishing the framework for Republic of Korea contributions to offset the costs asso-ciated with the stationing of United States Forces Korea (USFK) on the Korean Penin-sula; 
Whereas the United States Government 
supports mutual efforts by the Republic of Korea and Japan to overcome the past and work together to contribute to peace, secu-rity, and economic prosperity in the Asia- Pacific region; 
Whereas the Governments and people of 
the United States and the Republic of Korea share a deep commitment to addressing the continued suffering of the people of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea due to the human rights abuses and repression of the regime in Pyongyang; 
Whereas, on March 15, 2012, The United 
States-Republic of Korea Free Trade Agree-ment entered into force, which both sides have committed to fully implement, and the Republic of Korea is the United States’ sixth-largest trade partner, with United States goods and exports to Korea reaching a record level of $44,500,000,000 in 2014, up over 
7 percent compared to 2013; 
Whereas, on May 7, 2013, the United States 
and the Republic of Korea signed a Joint Declaration in Commemoration of the 60th Anniversary of the Alliance Between the Re-public of Korea and the United States; 
Whereas, on May 8, 2013, Her Excellency 
Park Geun-hye, the President of the Repub-lic of Korea, addressed a Joint Session of Congress; 
Whereas the United States Government 
notes the address delivered by President Park Geun-hye in Dresden, Germany, on March 28, 2014, and recognizes her efforts to promote peace, stability, and cooperation in Northeast Asia; 
Whereas there are deep cultural and per-
sonal ties between the peoples of the United States and the Republic of Korea, as exem-plified by the large flow of visitors and ex-changes each year between the two coun-tries, including Korean students studying in United States colleges and universities; 
Whereas Korean-Americans have made in-
valuable contributions to our nation’s secu-rity, prosperity, and diversity; 
Whereas, from June 14-17, 2015, President 
Park Geun-hye will visit Washington for a second official visit to the United States since her election as President; and 
Whereas the United States Government 
looks forward to continuing to deepen our enduring partnership with the Republic of Korea on security, economic, cultural issues, as well as embracing new opportunities for cooperation on emerging regional and global challenges: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) welcomes Her Excellency Park Geun- 
hye, the President of the Republic of Korea, on her official visit to the United States; 
(2) reaffirms the importance of the alliance 
between the United States and the Republic of Korea, as enshrined in the Mutual Defense Treaty of 1953, that is vital to peace and se-curity in Northeast Asia, and welcomes op-portunities to strengthen security ties, in-cluding on space, cyber, and missile defense; and 
(3) encourages the United States Govern-
ment and the Government of the Republic of Korea to continue to broaden and deepen the 
alliance by enhancing cooperation in the se-curity, economic, scientific, health, and cul-tural spheres.

SEC. 1085. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING 
COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL VACANCIES REFORM ACT OF 1998 WITH RESPECT TO INSPECTORS GENERAL. 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress finds the fol-
lowing: 
(1) There are 4 Presidentially-appointed In-
spector General vacancies for which a nomi-nation is not pending before the Senate. 
(2) Sections 3345 through 3349d of title 5, 
United States Code, (in this section referred to as the ‘‘Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998’’) prohibit an acting officer from serving in that position for longer than 210 days. 
(3) Under the Federal Vacancies Reform 
Act of 1998, the actions of an acting officer serving beyond the 210-day period ‘‘shall have no force or effect’’, but this does not apply to an acting Inspector General. 
(4) The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 
1998 provides an exception to the enforce-ment clause for acting Inspectors General to ensure a President cannot leave a watchdog 
in place who has no power or authority and therefore provides no mechanism to enforce the 210-day limit for acting Inspectors Gen-eral. 
(5) For 6 of the 7 Presidentially-appointed 
Inspector General vacancies, the individual serving in the office in an acting capacity has been serving for more than 210 days, in violation of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998. 
(b) S
ENSE OF THE SENATE .—It is the sense 
of the Senate that— 
(1) the President should comply with the 
Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 and fill vacancies of Presidentially-appointed posi-tions, including Inspectors General, within 210 days of the position becoming vacant; and 
(2) the President cannot avoid this require-
ment merely by changing the title of an act-ing officer if that officer still retains the same or substantially similar duties as an acting officer in that office.

following: 
SEC. 1085. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING 
NOMINATING A PERMANENT IN-SPECTOR GENERAL OF THE DE-PARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress finds the fol-
lowing: 
(1) There are 4 Presidentially-appointed In-
spector General vacancies for which a nomi-nation is not pending before the Senate. 
(2) It is vital that Offices of Inspectors 
General remain independent. 
(3) In the absence of a permanent Inspector 
General, an Office of Inspector General is run by an acting Inspector General who, no mat-ter how qualified or well-intentioned, is not granted the same protections afforded to an Inspector General who is confirmed by the Senate, as the acting Inspector General— 
(A) is not truly independent; (B) may be removed by the head of the 
agency at any time; 
(C) only serves temporarily and does not 
drive the policy of the Office; and 
(D) is at a greater risk of compromising 
the work of the Office to appease the agency or the President. 
(4) One of the current Presidentially-ap-
pointed Inspector General vacancies is the Inspector General of the Department of Vet-erans Affairs, which has been vacant since December 31, 2013. 
(5) The acting Inspector General of the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs, who has served in the position since December 31, 2013, is not properly independent from the Department of Veterans Affairs, is unresponsive to Con-gress, lacks transparency to the public, and has lost the trust of whistleblowers at the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
(b) S
ENSE OF CONGRESS .—It is the sense of 
Congress that the President should nominate a permanent Inspector General of the De-partment of Veterans Affairs not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act. SA 1803. Mr. JOHNSON submitted an

(a) F INDINGS .—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings:

bat areas, members of the Armed Forces and civilian employees of the Department of De-fense are at risk of illness, injury, and death.

tational Travel Authorizations ensure that 
next of kin are able to witness the dignified transfer of remains at Dover Port Mortuary, Delaware. 
(4) Department of Defense Instruction 
1300.18 and the Joint Federal Travel Regula-tions provide for Government funded travel for next of kin to witness the dignified trans-fer of remains at Dover Port Mortuary only when the casualty occurs in a combat area, excluding deaths associated with other oper-ations or training, including humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations. 
(5) The Department of Defense Instruction 
and the Joint Federal Travel Regulations do not reflect the realities and risks of modern day deployment and contingency operations, and do not provide relief for the families of members of the Armed Forces and civilian employees of the Department involved in so- called ‘‘phase zero operations’’.

(B) An action plan and timeline for making 
the changes described in subparagraph (A).

(2) E
XCEPTION .—The Secretary is not re-
quired to modify the policies of the Depart-ment as described in paragraph (1) if, by not later than March, 1, 2016, the Secretary cer-tifies, in writing, to the congressional de-fense committees that such action is not in 
the best interest of the United States. The certification shall include the following: 
(A) An assessment and reevaluation by the 
Secretary of the rational for excluding the next of kin from Government funded travel if the death of a member of the Armed Forces or civilian employee of the Department over-seas occurs in a non-combat area.

lowing findings:

strategically important given its location in the Indian Ocean. 
(2) Increasing human rights violations in 
the Maldives fuel instability and therefore pose a threat to regional security issues. 
(3) Since January 2015, President Abdulla 
Yameen has cracked down on dissent both within his own party and in the political op-position. (4) The arrest of former President 
Mohamed Nasheed this year was widely con-demned as politically-motivated and his con-viction and sentence of 13 years in prison has been condemned by Amnesty International as a ‘‘travesty of justice’’. 
(5) United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad described ‘‘fla-grant irregularities’’ in the trial of President Nasheed, including conflicts of interests by the judges and the court’s refusal to allow him to present any defense witnesses. 
(6) On May 1, 2015, tens of thousands of pro-
testers took to the streets in Male, Maldives, and were met with violence, tear gas, and stun guns by security forces. More than 200 people were arrested. 
(7) In his speech in Sri Lanka on May 2, 
2015, Secretary of State John Kerry said ‘‘[W]e’ve seen even now how regrettably there are troubling signs that democracy is under threat in the Maldives where the former president Nasheed has been impris-oned without due process. And that is an in-justice that must be addressed soon’’. 
(8) On June 2, 2015, the Government of the 
Maldives charged three more leaders of oppo-sition parties with terrorism. 
(b) S
ENSE OF CONGRESS .—It is the sense of

SEC. 1614. COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF POLI-
CIES AND PRACTICES FOR PLAN-NING AND ACQUIRING SATELLITE SYSTEMS AND ARCHITECTURES. 
(a) S ENSE OF CONGRESS .—It is the sense of 
the Congress that— 
(1) consistent with National Space Policy 
issued on June 28, 2010, the United States Government should make maximum use of mature commercial space capabilities and acquisition practices for national security systems for which the required performance can be met with commodity technology to reduce acquisition timelines and costs, pro-mote competition, capitalize on the pace of commercial technology advances, and avoid unnecessary government-unique invest-ments; 
(2) investments by elements of the intel-
ligence community and the Department of Defense in technology development utilizing a unique, dedicated industrial base should be reserved for cases in which commercial com-modity technology does not exist or in which revolutionary technology is judged to be achievable and worth the risk, cost, and time to acquire; 
(3) satellite systems and architectures 
should be designed in such a way that a num-ber of elements common to multiple space-craft could be standardized, to reduce costs, simplify execution, and preserve a competi-tive industrial base; 
(4) the entire overhead satellite architec-
ture of the United States, including pro-grams funded by the Department of Defense or by an element of the intelligence commu-nity, commercial providers, and foreign part-ners, should be viewed and treated as an in-tegrated whole, not simply as a series of independent and unrelated satellite systems; 
(5) deficiencies in, and improvements to, 
the current state of the space systems archi-tecture, and planning for the future architec-ture, should receive priority personal atten-tion from the President, the senior national security and scientific advisors to the Presi-dent, the Director of National Intelligence, the Secretary of Defense, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to ensure that ar-chitecture planning— 
(A) meets the needs of the United States in 
peace time and in war time; 
(B) responsibly stewards the taxpayers’ 
dollars; 
(C) accurately takes into account cost and 
performance tradeoffs; 
(D) meets realistic requirements; (E) produces and fosters excellence, inno-
vation, and competition; 
(F) aims to produce innovative satellite 
systems in less than 5 years that are able to leverage common, standardized design ele-ments and commercially available tech-nologies; 
(G) takes advantage of rapid advances in 
commercial technology, innovation, and commercial-like acquisition practices; and 
(H) fosters competition and a robust indus-
trial base.

the National Space Policy.

NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
appreciate the courtesy of the Pre-siding Officer in the Chamber in allow-ing me to speak this late in the day about issues that are vital to our na-tional defense, which will be addressed tomorrow and during the course of the week in votes on the National Defense 
Authorization Act. 
The task before the Senate in the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act is nothing less than to craft a sustain-able, long-term strategy to defend America. In fact, it is to sustain our global leadership in a time of shifting alliances, significant challenges, and emerging threats, while bringing a long-term balance and sustainability to our military. 
This defense measure is a solid start, 
but it must be made stronger to better meet the needs of our military men and women and our Nation as we enter this supremely perilous time. The danger to America has never been greater. Our foes have never been more insidious and pernicious, and many of the States opposing us have never been more will-ing to take measures that fundamen-tally contravene not only our security but our sense of moral right and wrong. 
I approach the National Defense Au-
thorization Act with this principle in mind. Neither the United States nor our troops, nor anyone involved in our national defense should ever face a fair fight. Our men and women in uniform should never be challenged in the air, on the sea or on land with a fair fight. It should be one-sided and in our favor. That is the basic principle. We must be superior in our military Armed Forces. 
I am grateful to the chairman of our 
committee, Senator M
CCAIN of Ari-
zona, an extraordinarily distinguished veteran and a partner in a number of amendments to this measure, and to the ranking member Senator J
ACK 
REED, also a public servant of extraor-
dinary distinction and a veteran. I am grateful for their leadership in bringing us to this point on a bill that attracted bipartisan support—overwhelming sup-port—on the Armed Services Com-mittee, where I am privileged to serve. 
The provisions in this bill will enable 
us to remain the strongest country militarily in the world. At the end of the day, our values, our way of life, and our democracy give us our real strength, but the military is necessary to defend those values and our quality and way of life. The military defends our values and traditions and our fun-damental rights and liberties, which we worked hard last week to uphold in the USA FREEDOM Act. 
I have filed a number of amendments 
that underscore the need for con-tinuing improvement in this bill. They are forward-looking amendments. One of them would modernize the National Guard’s helicopter fleet by providing vital capabilities for the military as well as the sustainability and growth for Connecticut’s dedicated defense in-dustry. 
To protect our heroes in uniform, I 
have also proposed an amendment that would provide stronger legal tools against predatory lending and other abuses targeting our military men and women nearby the very bases they are stationed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3886 June 8, 2015 
Mr. President, I refer my colleagues 
to these two amendments, Nos. 1820 and 1564. 
I also joined Ranking Member R
EED 
in cosponsoring his amendment, which will set forth a responsible and sustain-able budget strategy by ending seques-tration in our military budget and al-lowing us to ensure that all of our Na-tion’s key security priorities are ad-dressed. 
Tomorrow, this body will vote on 
that amendment. It is a critical vote. It allows us to choose sides as to whether we will put close to $40 billion, in effect, on our national debt rather than in our budget or on our credit card rather than find a sustainable means to pay for it. Each of us will have to decide whether we want to end sequestration, which I am committed to ending, or instead whether we will continue sequestration-and the very real harm it imposes on our nation-by putting an extra $40 billion in the over-seas contingent operations account known as OCO. Sequestration cannot be allowed to become a permanent fix-ture. We must work together in a bi-partisan manner to end it. 
In my time in the U.S. Senate, I have 
fought for our national defense funding because I believe our troops in harm’s way deserve our full, uncompromising, unyielding, and unstinting support. We owe them the best equipment, the best training and supplies, as well as the best institutional support and health care that the world has to offer because they are the best fighting force that our world has ever seen. They fight for a nation that is the best, strongest, and greatest in the history of the world— not only in its military strength but in its fundamental values and freedom that allow us to speak as we wish in this very Chamber, to criticize author-ity, to speak truth to those in power, to debate, to come together, as we did this past weekend to worship and gath-er together and say whatever we please and think as we wish. 
I hope we will address this vital in-
terest in making sure we provide a sus-tainable source of funding by ending sequestration rather than relying on the overseas contingency operation ac-count, which is a form of borrowing. It increases the deficit; it doesn’t reduce it. It diminishes stable and sustainable funding; it doesn’t enhance it. It sim-ply provides more uncertainty rather than a long-term strategy. 
This measure, which I support, en-
hances our security by providing for the construction of Virginia-class sub-marines—that are necessary. In fact, the NDAA provides $800 million in ad-ditional funding over what the Presi-dent requested, and it endorses equip-ping all future attack submarines with-in an enhanced payload capability. 
Naval warfare, and particularly un-
dersea warfare, is as relevant and im-portant now as it ever was, and these submarines will do much to enhance our readiness, our nuclear deterrence, our special operations, and our surveil-lance. They are the stealthiest, strong-
est weapons platform under the sea ever known to man. Likewise, the re-search and development in the Ohio re-placement program will continue to go forward. 
The bill provides for $1 billion for six 
additional Joint Strike Fighter air-craft for the Marine Corps—this is pro-foundly significant—as well as $17 mil-lion in new military construction for the Connecticut National Guard. 
There are other measures, but apart 
from the hard work is an important step for fairness and keeping faith and dealing fairly with our men and women in uniform. This legislation provides for a 1.3 percent pay raise and $85 mil-lion to be directed toward improving fi-nancial literacy among our service-members. That is really the very least we can do. 
Our military men and women do not 
do this for the pay or the financial compensation, but for their families’ sake, we need to deal with them fairly and keep faith with them. In my role as ranking member of the Veterans’ Af-fairs Committee, I have paid special at-tention to ensuring that this bill helps to ease the transition of military per-sonnel into civilian life by establishing a new ‘‘R
ECORD of Service’’ card upon 
their separation that will help prevent identity theft and financial fraud. I urge the DOD, as does the Armed Serv-ices Committee, to discontinue its use of Social Security numbers on military records. It will help prevent identity theft and the kinds of breaches that put our servicemen and their families at risk financially, just as they are often at risk physically in combat. 
The bill also directs DOD to stem the 
tide of opioid prescription drug abuse, and it helps military retirees get smok-ing cessation assistance. I would go further and provide for stronger meas-ures to deal with over-prescription through education programs and drug formularies that provide alternatives, and that is one of the amendments I will offer. 
Finally, two principal amendments I 
propose are an amendment to provide additional helicopters for the Army National Guard, which I will speak on now and seek to make pending at a later point, and an amendment improv-ing consumer protections for military personnel and their families, which is currently pending. 
First, we can greatly strengthen this 
bill by making a commitment to our National Guard to provide additional helicopters. The UH–60 Black Hawk helicopter is one of the most versatile and heavily used aviation capabilities in the Army National Guard, as well as by all the states in which they serve. The UH–60A is the oldest model Black Hawk in service and is currently flown almost exclusively by the Army Na-tional Guard. 
We can strengthen this bill by ful-
filling our commitment to the Na-tional Guard in providing 15 additional UH–60M Black Hawk helicopters that are the workhorse of our warriors who 
serve in our National Guard, warriors who have distinguished themselves not only in combat but also in emergencies and disasters at home. These heli-copters will help them serve at home and abroad, which is one of the reasons that acquiring more of these heli-copters, M model Black Hawks, are one of the priorities of the National Guard Association. 
I have listened to the National Guard 
leaders in Connecticut, and I have lis-tened to distinguished warriors and veterans of the National Guard from around the country, and I know these UH-60 Black Hawks are the work-horses. They are important in medium- lift capability to the National Guard in support of homeland defense and re-sponse to emergencies. The UH–60A models now lack onboard capabilities— modern capabilities that would enable them to be deployed overseas in hostile environments without significant up-grades to others parts of their configu-ration. They need that upgrade to be configured properly. The new aircraft would flow to states all across the country and ensure the National Guard is ready to deploy both at home and abroad. 
Under the Army’s current budget 
projections, the Army National Guard will not replace their aging UH–60A Black Hawk helicopters until 2025. We need to do better, we need to do it more promptly, and that is why I am proposing amendment No. 1820. 
The amendment is fully paid for by 
an offset from the Foreign Currency Fund. The upside of a strengthening American dollar is that the Army can put more funds towards buying Amer-ican helicopters and spend less in for-eign currency expenses. 
The other principal amendment, 
which I have made pending to the bill, improves the consumer protections af-forded to our servicemembers and their families by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. On the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, penalties, quite blunt-ly, are too low, and that is why I wish to thank my colleagues Ranking Mem-ber R
EEDas well as Senators D URBIN , 
MURRAY , and W HITEHOUSE , all of whom 
have been working tirelessly and have joined me in proposing stronger protec-tions in the Servicemembers Civil Re-lief Act by doubling the penalties and making them as high as $110,000 for a first violation and $220,000 for a second or subsequent violation. This legisla-tion provides deterrents, punishment, and a stop to this kind of financial abuse that may take place, literally, within sight of military bases. 
Recently, the Department of Justice 
used this authority to obtain a civil penalty against Capital One and Sallie Mae. We have seen financial abuse by Capital One, when it foreclosed improp-erly on servicemembers’ homes. These practices can include these kinds of abuses involving foreclosure and other kinds of exploitation which Sallie Mae, unfortunately, engaged in. ‘‘Federal

law protects our servicemembers from 
having to repay loans under terms that are unaffordable or unfair.’’ Student lender Sallie Mae sidestepped require-ments by charging excessive rates to borrowers who filed documents proving they were members of the U.S. mili-tary. For over a decade Sallie Mae vio-lated SCRA by failing to provide over 60,000 military servicemembers with the 6 percent interest rate cap they were entitled to on their student loans. This type of conduct is more than just inappropriate, it is inexcusable, and it will not be tolerated. 
In addition, my colleagues have been 
working to make other important im-provements to the SCRA. For example, Senator R
EEDhas worked tirelessly to 
ensure servicemembers can terminate leases on rental properties without early termination fees if they are as-signed to, or relocate to, government quarters. Senator W
HITEHOUSE has 
sought to make permanent a one-year post service protection from fore-closure for returning servicemembers and Senator D
URBIN has been fighting 
to make sure our servicemembers with student loan debt can take advantage of the protections of the SCRA. I ap-preciate my colleagues tireless advo-cacy and look forward to working to-gether to advance these important pro-visions. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in 
voting for Senator R
EED’s amendment 
tomorrow. We face critical decisions ahead. This measure has extraordinary 
merit. We must keep faith with those who serve, and I hope we will when we vote this week on the National Defense Authorization Act.

HONORING MR. JACK HEARN 
HON. JEB HENSARLING 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Monday, June 8, 2015 
Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize Jack Hearn, a veteran of World War II, for his exceptional service to our country. 
Beginning his service just after graduating 
high school, Mr. Hearn enlisted in the Texas National Guard in 1940. Soon after, the Army incorporated all guardsmen for active duty. From November 1940 to November 1945, Mr. Hearn served in the U.S. Army, initially as an enlisted man in the field artillery division of the 36th battalion. He was promoted to Staff Ser-geant shortly after and ultimately received a direct commission to Second Lieutenant. Dur-ing the twenty-five months he spent in the Eu-ropean theater, Mr. Hearn fought in many bat-tles and helped fight the Germans through France to the Rhine River. He was wounded in action in December of 1944 after running over a land mine. For his exceptional and brave service, Mr. Hearn was awarded the Purple Heart, FAME ribbon with four battle stars, the Invasion Arrowhead, American De-fense Ribbon, Good Conduct Medal and Dis-tinguished Unit Citation. 
Humbly, I echo the words of President Ron-
ald Reagan, ‘‘We will always remember. We will always be proud. We will always be pre-pared, so we will always be free.’’ And hum-bly, I offer my sincere gratitude to Mr. Jack Hearn for his service and acts of bravery that allow us the freedoms we enjoy today.

PUBLIC SERVICE OF THE HONOR-ABLE MARY H. MELFI 
HON. LEONARD LANCE 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Monday, June 8, 2015 
Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to cel-
ebrate the public service of the Honorable Mary H. Melfi, County Clerk of Hunterdon County, New Jersey who is celebrating her sixtieth birthday. Mary is currently serving in her second five year term as County Clerk, where she has built a reputation as a trusted resource for information, manager of public af-fairs and public servant. 
Mary oversees a tremendous operation, 
managing numerous departments and pro-grams that deliver community services at the speed of the 21st century. Her style brings de-pendability to this important constitutional of-fice and her management has instituted great-er accessibility and transparency of critical governmental functions for constituents. To the benefit of residents, businesses and tax-payers, public information is readily available and put to good use for County projects. 
The County Clerk is the chief election officer 
and master pollworker in charge of overseeing the essential process of administering free and fair elections. This major undertaking includes the oversight of dozens of election districts, numerous polling machines and poll workers and thousands of ballots cast in each elec-tion—both in-person and through the mail. 
Mary has lived her life in Hunterdon County, 
growing up in Lebanon Borough and grad-uating from North Hunterdon Regional High School. Her public service started with mem-bership on the Flemington Borough Planning Board and Board of Adjustment. She was elected to serve on the Borough Council for 12 years. 
I thank and congratulate the Honorable 
Mary H. Melfi for her work for the residents of Hunterdon County and wish her continued professional success, good health and happi-ness.

RECOGNIZING THE UNIVERSITY OF 
TEXAS SYSTEM FOR THEIR OUT-STANDING ACHIEVEMENTS 
HON. LAMAR SMITH 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Monday, June 8, 2015 
Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, gradua-
tion season is once again upon us, and con-gratulations go to all who have accomplished the outstanding goal of attaining a high school diploma or college degree. I also want to rec-ognize the hundreds of thousands of teachers in my home state, the great state of Texas— from pre-K to post-grad. 
One of the great higher education systems 
in the nation is the University of Texas Sys-tem, which just happens to be headquartered 
in my district. Each year, UT System institu-tions confer more than one-third of Texas’ un-dergraduate degrees and educate two-thirds of the state’s health care professionals. Over-all, the UT System includes more than 210,000 students across the state, a group of young Texans that includes first generation Americans striving to improve their place in society, engineers, computer scientists, histo-rians, educators, inventors, and future doctors. 
The UT System is also one of the largest 
employers in Texas. Across its fourteen cam-puses, the System employs more than 90,000 faculty, staff, and administrators, all focused on three aligned objectives: educate the future leaders of our nation, innovate and create the discoveries and tools of tomorrow, and ad-vance scholarly knowledge beyond current boundaries. 
The UT System family includes three of the 
nation’s 68 National Cancer Institute cancer centers—one of which, the UT Health Science Center in San Antonio, is located in my dis-trict. In addition, the UT Health Science Center in San Antonio is one of the four UT System medical centers to have received continuous Clinical and Translational Science Awards from the National Institutes of Health for their proven success in quickly delivering to pa-tients the drugs and therapies they discover. 
UT San Antonio was the first university in 
Texas, and twenty-third nationwide, to be rec-ognized by the NSA as a national leader in the emerging field of cybersecurity research and training and designated a Center for Aca-demic Excellence. 
UT’s MD Anderson Cancer Center, located 
at the Texas Medical Center in Houston, is often recognized as the top cancer center in the world. It conducts more cancer clinical trials than any institution across the globe, re-ceives more National Cancer Institute funding than any other institution, and is responsible for more than one-third of all new FDA-ap-proved cancer drugs. 
UT Austin is home to more than 200 mem-
bers of the National Academies and 12 recipi-ents of the National Medal of Science. And it has 43 academic programs considered to be in the Top 10 nationally; 50 in the Top 25. 
The UT Medical Branch is home to the Gal-
veston National Laboratory, the only oper-ational BioSafety Level 4 National Lab on a university campus in the United States. Sci-entists there are playing a leading role in re-searching and developing treatments and vac-cines for global infectious diseases, and were recently included in the group of Ebola fighters Time Magazine chose to represent their Per-son of the Year. 
Last year, UT El Paso was selected by 
Washington Monthly as one of the top 10 uni-versities in the nation, grouped with Stanford, Harvard, UC Berkeley, UCLA and UC San Diego and ranked #1 for the third consecutive year among all U.S. universities in the social mobility category for its success in helping stu-dents achieve the American Dream.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks E850 June 8, 2015 
The UT Southwestern Medical Center in 
Dallas is home to six Nobel Laureates—a dis-tinction no other medical school in America can claim. 
UT Arlington is the largest producer of bac-
calaureate educated nurses in Texas and the largest not-for-profit college of nursing in the nation, training nearly 8,000 on-line and in- person students. 
The extraordinary emergency care doctors 
of UT Health Science Center Houston who manage the world’s busiest Level 1 Trauma Center at Memorial Hermann Hospital were featured this year in the Lifetime Network se-ries ‘‘Life flight: Trauma Center Houston.’’ 
UT Dallas was ranked 15th in the 2014 
Times Higher Education magazine list of the world’s most outstanding young universities. One of the criteria contributing to this ranking is the high standing of the university’s stu-dents. The average SAT score for incoming freshman consistently is the highest among public universities in Texas. 
UT Health Science Center Tyler, northeast 
Texas’ only university medical center, is ranked by Axial and Becker’s Hospital Review as one of the top 100 hospitals in the country for patient healthcare, including quality, patient satisfaction, and communication. 
UT Tyler is a leading innovator for providing 
students with multiple options to complete a degree from remote locations. It is the only university in Texas to offer three distance- learning campuses where students can take classes close to home. In addition, the UT Tyler Houston Engineering Center provides a seamless pathway to a four-year degree in civil, electrical, or mechanical engineering in partnership with Houston Community College. Students can take lower-division courses at HCC and upper-division courses from UT Tyler at the Alief-Hayes Road Campus in Houston. 
The University of Texas of the Permian 
Basin (UTPB) has created Early College High Schools with several West Texas school dis-tricts at which at-risk high school students have the opportunity to earn a high school di-ploma and up to sixty college credit hours. The first UTPB Early College High School within the Presidio Independent School District was the first in Texas where college courses are delivered online. 
But, Mr. Speaker, the UT System is not 
resting on its laurels. In fact, it is preparing for the future on several fronts. 
It is in the process of opening what will be-
come the second-largest Hispanic-serving in-stitution in the nation. UT Rio Grande Valley will incorporate multiple locations throughout South Texas and will have a transformative ef-fect on the health, economy and overall well- being of the region. When UTRGV opens its doors, the UT System will also become the only university system in America to open a new university with a medical school in the 21st century. 
In fact, the UT System is the only university 
system in the country currently building two new medical schools—in addition to UTRGV, the System is creating the new Dell Medical School as a part of UT Austin’s growing pres-ence. 
Mr. Speaker, as you can see I am proud to 
represent the University of Texas System, which rightfully has been recognized as one of the great university systems in the U.S. HONORING MR. JOSHUA RAY 
JOHNSON 
HON. JEB HENSARLING 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Monday, June 8, 2015 
Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize Joshua Ray Johnson for his sacrifice and service to our country. Upon graduation from Eustace High School, Petty Officer 3rd Class Johnson enlisted in the Navy in October 2006. 
Petty Officer Johnson served stateside in 
the Military Police before being deployed over-seas. He was assigned to the MOB Account-ing OPS unit. Petty Officer Johnson’s assign-ment was part of NATO’s International Secu-rity Assistance Force (ISAF) that was estab-lished after the regime change in Afghanistan in 2001. Initially, the ISAF was established to train the Afghan National Security Forces and assist Afghanistan in rebuilding key govern-ment institutions. When Josh arrived in the Middle East, the ISAF had expanded its oper-ations to more intensive combat operations and part of this involved reconnaissance mis-sions to evaluate, account and report on the status of residential occupants. Petty Officer Johnson was wounded in Iraq when an impro-vised explosive device detonated and he suf-fered a bullet wound in his arm. He was hon-orably discharged in April of 2010 and was the recipient of the Purple Heart. 
While serving his country bravely and coura-
geously, Petty Officer Johnson battled en-emies and faced danger and possible death every day. Today, Petty Officer Johnson faces the toughest fight ever. He was diagnosed with Stage IV cancer that is inoperable and in-curable in November 2014, on the day before Veterans Day. We will continue to keep him, his family and medical personnel in our pray-ers daily, that he will overcome this battle. 
Humbly, I echo the words of President Ron-
ald Reagan, ‘‘We will always remember. We will always be proud. We will always be pre-pared, so we will always be free.’’ And hum-bly, I offer my sincere gratitude to Petty Officer 
Joshua Ray Johnson for his service and acts of bravery that allow us the freedoms we enjoy today.

Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the memory of Sandra Vogelson, for her achievements, contributions, and her serv-ice to the people of New Jersey as a commu-nity leader and a health advocate. Mrs. Vogelson passed away at the age of seventy- three. Sandra was revered throughout her community and she will truly be missed. 
Sandra graduated from my alma mater, 
Camden County Community College, with a degree in Art, and dedicated her life to the community of South Jersey. She served as a member of Cooper’s Ferry Development Asso-ciation, where she was always seeking new ways to improve the City of Camden. 
Sandra founded a philanthropic event, ‘‘Pink 
Roses and ‘‘Teal Magnolias.’’ This event raises funds to continue the fight against breast and gynecologic cancers. Over the years, ‘‘Pink Roses and Teal Magnolias’’ be-came a staple within our community, by rais-ing tens of thousands of dollars for research and other clinical programs at the MD Ander-son Cancer Center at Cooper. 
Furthermore, she took a keen interest in the 
education of New Jersey’s young people. In 1992, Sandra established the Camden County College Foundation, and served on the board for the next two decades. Her leadership pro-vided critical fundraising efforts for the college, allowing it to expand and serve as an exem-plary educational institution for the students of Camden. 
Mr. Speaker, Sandra Vogelson was a pillar 
of society who lived a life full of virtue service. She left a great mark on South Jersey, and is survived three daughters, five grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren. I join the Cam-den County community and the state of New Jersey in honoring the achievements and the life of this extraordinary woman.

Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chair, I rise 
today to support the Cohen amendment and urge the House to oppose the excessive cuts to the nonprofit and independent Legal Serv-ices Corporation. 
Legal Services has a mission to ‘‘provide 
equal access to the system of justice’’ in America. It is the most important provider of civil legal aid for Americans who cannot afford high-priced legal counsel. In fact, legal rep-resentation often is out of reach for many

American families. This amendment will make 
the lives of millions of American families even more challenging. Plus, if you take away legal counsel, you also complicate the resolution of disputes for businesses and others as well. You all know Legal Services is not a Wash-ington-based bureaucratic program. To the contrary, there are legal aid attorneys and pro-fessionals in every State, with more than 800 offices. Legal Services’ moneys are put to work back home across America outside of Washington. 
In my Tampa Bay community, Bay Area 
Legal Services helps to keep the wheels of justice turning for everyone. What type of legal help? Foreclosure, consumer assistance, do-mestic violence. Many of the domestic vio-lence victims are simply trying to keep their children safe and their families together. Oth-ers include veterans returning from war, fami-lies with housing issues, those that were hit hard by natural disasters and are dealing with the aftermath, and families involved in child custody disputes. I have seen these advo-cates in action. Many Members of Congress actually refer cases to Legal Services groups in our area. They help families navigate the justice system. They also boost the economy through avoided costs and swift resolution of disputes. 
I would also like to remind my colleagues 
that Legal Services has already undergone significant cuts over the past few years. Fund-ing for Legal Services was $420 million in fis-cal year 2010. It was cut—especially after se-questration in 2013—and any further cuts will do severe damage. This amendment jeopard-izes access to justice and the rule of law. 
This year’s bill is a destructive step back-
wards which threatens these vital community services by slashing funding by $75 million. This is the lowest level of funding since FY 1999. These devastating cuts will terminate over 1,000 full time staff including 430 attor-ney positions. Under these draconian cuts, Legal services offices across the country will be forced to close 25 offices, complete 150,000 fewer cases, and serve 350,000 fewer people. 
In exacting such severe cuts, your advice to 
families is, ‘‘You can’t get help’’. ‘‘You can’t avoid a foreclosure’’. ‘‘You can’t escape an abusive relationship or defend yourself against consumer scams’’. 
We cannot allow hundreds of thousands of 
American veterans, elderly victims of fore-closure, and women and children desperate to escape domestic violence to be denied assist-ance. 
So I strongly urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the 
Cohen amendment.

SPEECH OF  
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Wednesday, June 3, 2015 
The House in Committee of the Whole 
House on the state of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2577) making ap-propriations for the Departments of Trans-portation, and Housing and Urban Develop-
ment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other pur-poses: 
Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. 
Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to the FY16 Transportation and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill. 
In short, this bill is shortsighted and fraught 
with handouts to special interests at the ex-pense of the safety of the American people. 
Once again, the Majority in this body has 
squandered an opportunity to invest in our na-tion’s crumbling roads and infrastructure, and it has squandered an opportunity to combat homelessness and provide access to safer, af-fordable housing for millions. 
Our future prosperity and economic growth 
depend on the investments we make now to ensure America remains the most competitive nation in an increasingly global economy. 
Instead of investing in safer rail to prevent 
accidents like the recent and fatal derailment of Amtrak in Philadelphia, this bill cuts Am-trak’s budget by nearly $290 million and sub-sequently hampers its ability to implement proven technologies that would have pre-vented this tragedy and countless others. 
Instead of supporting the Federal Aviation 
Administration’s efforts to implement NextGen technologies to keep our skies the safest in the world, this bill cuts the agency’s capital in-vestment program by $100 million from the FY15 enacted level and $355 million below the President’s budget request. 
This bill cuts funding to programs like 
Choice Neighborhoods and the Community Development Block Grants that would revi-talize our communities, the Lead Hazard Con-trol and Healthy Homes programs that would keep our families safe from harmful materials, and programs such as Housing for the Elderly that helps deliver the dignity and assistance for our most vulnerable populations. 
This is just a bad bill, Mr. Chair, and these 
are just a few of the reasons why this is a ter-rible bill, and one that will surely be vetoed by the President. 
I urge my colleagues to reject this bill and 
bring this legislation back to the drawing board.

HONORING MR. JOHN J. DAWDY 
HON. JEB HENSARLING 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Monday, June 8, 2015 
Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize Mr. John J. Dawdy for his courageous service to our country. A graduate of Mabank High School, Private First Class Dawdy served in the 1 Marine Expeditionary Force (1 MEF) during Operation Iraqi Free-dom. 
On March 19, 2004, Pfc. Dawdy was driving 
a seven-ton truck in his unit’s convoy. Shortly after leaving Camp Fallujah, Iraq, the convoy hit an improvised explosive device. With his leg torn with shrapnel, Pfc. Dawdy still man-aged to maintain control of his truck and ma-neuvered nearly one hundred yards before pulling off to the side of the road and losing consciousness. As a testament to his bravery and leadership, a fellow Marine called Pfc. Dawdy a ‘‘father figure’’ who made ‘‘all the wise decisions.’’ Pfc. Dawdy was awarded the 
Purple Heart for the injuries he sustained in combat while bravely serving his country. 
Humbly, I echo the words of President Ron-
ald Reagan, ‘‘We will always remember. We will always be proud. We will always be pre-pared, so we will always be free.’’ And hum-bly, I offer my sincere gratitude to Pfc. John J. Dawdy for his service and acts of bravery that allow us the freedoms we enjoy today.
