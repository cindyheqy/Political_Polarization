RECOGNIZING MAY AS PREE-
CLAMPSIA AWARENESS MONTH 
HON. KRISTI L. NOEM 
OF SOUTH DAKOTA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, May 26, 2015 
Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recog-
nize May as Preeclampsia Awareness Month. 
Despite advances in treatment and tech-
nology across the medical field, the disease of preeclampsia continues to affect mothers and infants across the country. As one of the lead-ing causes of premature birth, illness, and ma-ternal death, preeclampsia afflicts one in 12 women, according to the Preeclampsia Foun-dation. 
Preeclampsia is characterized by high blood 
pressure, and its symptoms mimic common difficulties associated with pregnancy, like ab-dominal pain, the cause of headaches, vom-iting, and anxiety. Because they are so com-mon, many women may simply ignore these symptoms. Worse, little is known about preeclampsia. While current research sug-gests it is related to the placenta, we do not know why it occurs, we do not know how to cure it, and we are still learning about its long- term effects on mothers and their children. 
Our lack of understanding about 
preeclampsia is why I strongly support the work of groups like the Preeclampsia Founda-tion to educate women about the symptoms of preeclampsia and how they can find care. I also support the research being done at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. I am hopeful that research and support from NIH and the Preeclampsia Foun-dation will help us understand and address this disease.

HONORING PRIVATE FIRST CLASS 
WILLIAM JOSEPH OAKLEY 
HON. ELIZABETH H. ESTY 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, May 26, 2015 
Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor and remember Private First Class Wil-liam Joseph Oakley, the first casualty of the Vietnam War from Waterbury, Connecticut. 
At the age of 17, PFC Oakley enlisted in the 
United States Army. He was extremely proud to serve his country. On May 28, 1965, PFC Oakley was killed when two Army helicopters collided. He was only 18 years old and had served for less than a year. 
As we commemorate Memorial Day and re-
member all those who lost their lives while in service to our country, let us pause to think of PFC Oakley on the 50th anniversary of his death. 
This year also marks the 50th anniversary 
of the ground offensive in Vietnam. Over 58,000 names are written on the Vietnam Vet-erans Memorial Wall in Washington, DC. Thir-ty of these brave Americans, including PFC 
Oakley, called Waterbury home. 
The City of Waterbury and the Waterbury 
Veterans Memorial Committee will never for-get the service and sacrifice of the men and women who died while serving in our nation’s military throughout our history. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Waterbury Veterans Memorial Committee for all they do to honor our veterans.

RECOGNIZING KEVIN AND SIMA 
ZLOCK 
HON. MICHAEL G. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, May 26, 2015 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I am proud 
to join you today in recognition of Kevin and Sima Zlock for their efforts to advance and ex-pand the mission at Bucks County Community College. 
I am told, that Bucks County Community 
College will officially dedicate the new Kevin and Sima Zlock Performing Arts Center at the college’s Newtown, Bucks County campus today. 
This addition to an already amazing institu-
tion will enhance the educational experience of every Bucks student who walks through the door a valuable venue for the college and re-gion’s thriving arts community. 
I consider myself so fortunate to be able to 
represent Bucks County, Pennsylvania here in the House, and to have grown up around the Community College. 
The kindness of individuals, businesses and 
civic groups across my district continue to as-tound me, and the Zlock’s commitment to Bucks County Community College is just the latest in a long line of residents investing in the success of our community. 
So, I thank Kevin and Sima Zlock for their 
continued support of Bucks County Commu-nity College and wish the best for the dedica-tion of the new Kevin and Sima Zlock Per-forming Arts Center. Have a great day, Bucks County.

THE INTERNATIONAL DAY TO END 
OBSTETRIC FISTULA 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, May 26, 2015 
Ms. D ELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in rec-
ognition of the International Day to End Ob-stetric Fistula. 
Obstetric fistula, a debilitating condition, has 
left hundreds of thousands of women suffering in solitude and shame. It is perhaps one of the most telling examples of inequitable access to maternal health care and, until recently, one of the most hidden. Addressing this issue is not only a moral im-
perative for the United States, but it is also in our best strategic interest. When women are pushed out of society, they cannot contribute. By treating and preventing this condition, we empower women to care for themselves and their families, and be active participants in so-ciety, reducing global poverty. 
Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, United Nations 
Under-Secretary-General and Executive Direc-tor of UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, recently said, ‘‘Let us decide, as a glob-al community, that the world we want is one where fistula no longer exists. Let us, once and for all, put an end to this assault on wom-en’s and girls’ health and human rights, which steals from them their very dignity and de-stroys the most fundamental of human quali-ties: hope. Much of the world has already vir-tually eliminated fistula. It is time to finish the job. Let us all work together to wipe fistula off the map.’’ 
The International Day to End Obstetric Fis-
tula is an important opportunity to raise aware-ness of a condition that is not well-understood, even in societies where it is prevalent. I urge everyone to use the day of recognition to help raise awareness and intensify actions towards ending obstetric fistula.

HONORING JOSEPH STRZELCZYK, 
THE MAYOR OF SUMMIT, ILLINOIS 
HON. DANIEL LIPINSKI 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, May 26, 2015 
Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Joseph Strzelczyk, the Mayor of Sum-mit, Illinois who passed away on May 17, 2015 at the age of 75. Commonly known as ‘‘Mayor Joe’’ to residents of Summit, Joe Strzelczyk was recognized for his tremendous dedication to his town and its residents. 
Mayor Strzelczyk began his career in public 
service in 1978 when he worked as a special recreation instructor for the Chicago Park Dis-trict. In 1990, he was elected as a Village Trustee in Summit, a position which he held until he was elected mayor. 
Joe Strzelczyk was originally elected mayor 
in 1997 and won reelection four times. Over almost two decades as mayor, he focused on improving and revitalizing Summit through grassroots efforts along with attracting busi-nesses and revenue to the city. Mayor Strzelczyk played a vital role in ensuring a revenue sharing agreement with the Rivers Casino in Des Plaines which brought in more than $604,000 to Summit in the first year alone. Mayor Strzelczyk was also active in or-ganizing village cleanups. 
Mayor Strzelczyk’s love of his community 
stretched into all facets of his life. An avid softball player, he coached in the North Amer-ican Pro Softball League and later hosted a local cable TV show in addition to being a sports commentator on radio. In 2012, he was

honoring Mayor Joseph Strzelczyk. A truly dedicated public servant, Joe Strzelczyk made Summit a great place to live. His leadership and dedication to his community was unparal-leled and will truly be missed.

CELEBRATING THE 120TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF NEW HOPE BAP-TIST CHURCH 
HON. ELIZABETH H. ESTY 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, May 26, 2015 
Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to cele-
brate the 120th anniversary of New Hope Bap-tist Church in Danbury, Connecticut. This weekend, New Hope Baptist Church 
will celebrate over a century of visionary lead-ership and faithful service that has contributed 
to achieving a healthy, thriving community. In 1895, Rev. Thomas Garnett founded the New Hope Baptist Church of Danbury with area residents who were drawn together by faith and kinship. 
Eight pastors have led New Hope over the 
past 120 years, shepherding the parish through many periods of growth. Increasing membership throughout the decades also ne-cessitated expansions in church programs and services as well as physical additions to the church itself. This year, under the leadership of Rev. Leroy Parker, New Hope expanded its ministry to include services in Waterbury to reach even more individuals and families in western Connecticut. Rev. Parker is an inspir-ing preacher, and I was honored for him to join me at the National Prayer Breakfast in 
Washington, DC earlier this year. 
New Hope Baptist Church is an outstanding 
example of what a faith community can ac-complish through ministry and fellowship. The parishioners are welcoming and eager to share their faith with community members and visitors alike. I enjoy worshiping at New Hope and cherish the friendships I have made. 
Congratulations to New Hope Baptist 
Church on its 120th anniversary.
