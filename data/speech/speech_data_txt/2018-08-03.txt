RECOGNIZING THE 107TH BIRTHDAY OF ELEANORE SIMON 
HON. JOHN H. RUTHERFORD 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 3, 2018 Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a very special person, El-eanore Simon, who on July 25, 2018, cele-brated her 107th birthday. Eleanore is a native of Amelia Island, Flor-ida, where she still lives today. Even at 107 years-old, Eleanore drives her golf cart to and from water aerobics several times a week. She is always on the move, and from what I have learned about her, she has no plan to slow down any time soon. At her birthday party, Eleanore enjoyed cake and a glass of champagne surrounded by her family and friends. She has brought much joy to those around her, and those who know her say her smile and genuine spirit lights up every room. Today, I honor Ms. Eleanore Simon’s note-worthy longevity and tremendous life in our Northeast Florida community. I ask this entire body to join me in celebrating Eleanore’s 107th birthday. May we all aspire to live as long and full a life.

CONGRATULATING THE FULTON CHAIN OF LAKES ASSOCIATION ON ITS 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 3, 2018 Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate the Fulton Chain of Lakes Association on its 50th anniversary. Upon discovering pollution in the waters of the Adirondack Mountains, a group of lake-front property owners organized a network of dedicated volunteers to form the Fulton Chain of Lakes Association in 1968. Since then, the FCLA has worked tirelessly to protect the nat-ural beauty of the North Country’s waterways. With the help of over 600 members, the orga-nization works to maintain water quality and promote boating safety in the chain of eight lakes connected throughout Herkimer and Hamilton counties. The FCLA’s members have been excellent stewards of this unique area, allowing residents and visitors to continue en-joying all the water has to offer and ensuring that these magnificent lakes will endure for generations to come. On behalf of New York’s 21st district, I would like to thank the Fulton Chain of Lakes Association for 50 years of service to the North Country, and I wish them all the best in their next 50 years. IN REMEMBRANCE OF LUCAS SOARES SMITH HON. TED LIEU 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 3, 2018 Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in remembrance of young Lucas Soares Smith. I have had the honor of knowing Lucas and his family. Life doesn’t always allow for the time allotted and Lucas departed this world suddenly and unexpectedly. But within that short span of fifteen years, Lucas—the beloved son of the family—made an impres-sion on this world. Born in Rio de Janeiro, his family moved to Seattle, Washington where Lucas sang for the church choir, and played baseball and soccer. Lucas even earned himself a black belt in Tae Kwon Do. His family then moved to Redondo Beach, California when he was twelve. Lucas participated in activities such as surfing, swim-ming and Junior Life Guards. Lucas was a student at South High School in Torrance, California where he ran for Track and Field as well as Cross Country. His most passionate undertaking was his service as a Cadet Technical Sergeant in the Beach Cities Cadet Squadron 107 of the Civil Air Patrol at the Torrance Airport. Lucas was posthumously awarded the Red Service Rib-bon for two years of being a cadet member in good standing. He loved to fly and constantly reminded his parents that one day he would become a pilot. Lucas is survived by his father, Philip Smith and his mother, Marianna Smith and his younger sister, Julia Smith and their dog Rocky. In memory of their son, his parents would like to say, ‘‘Above the clouds and over our heads is where our dear son felt most at home. It is where we hope he finds his peace and continues to fly like a bird.’’

HONORING YDS CHICAGO 
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 3, 2018 Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize YDS Chicago for its outstanding service to our community and its work to promote peace, material well-being and spiritual growth. YDS Chicago is an international faith-based organization which practices the Swaminarayan sect of Hinduism. Under the guidance of its spiritual leader, H.D.H. Hariprasad Swamiji, YDS has a long history of community engagement, focusing on health care, education and spiritual development to promote harmony among all people. YDS tem-ples and cultural centers have provided free medical care, education and relief to victims of natural disasters and to the impoverished around the world. We are honored to celebrate YDS Chicago as it moves forward with building its new tem-ple and community center—the first Hindu temple constructed in Schaumburg, Illinois. The Nutan Haridham Temple is the product of years of planning, investment and close co-operation with local, state and federal govern-ment, and the success of this project required the sustained attention and devotion of the temple’s members and its leadership. The addition of the Nutan Haridham Temple to the 8th Congressional District is significant. The temple will serve as a center of religious practice, and as a home for Hindu culture in the greater Chicago area. Furthermore, in keeping with the focus of Hariprasad Swamiji on the education and spiritual development of our youth, the temple will be an important cul-tural center in the northwest suburbs of Chi-cago, offering camps and other educational programs for the next generation of Hindu- Americans in the area. Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize the great achievements of YDS, and acknowledge its tireless community service in the 8th Congres-sional District, as well as to all in need throughout the world. f 
HONORING AGAPITO MOLINA 
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 3, 2018 Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life of beloved Jim Hogg County Judge Agapito ‘‘Cuate’’ Molina, who passed away on July 3, 2018, in Corpus Christi, Texas. Judge Molina began working for his commu-nity after being elected County Commissioner Pct. 2 in 1978. Because of his continued de-votion, he was elected County Judge in 1999. Judge Molina became the first elected official from Jim Hogg County to obtain membership in the Texas Association of Counties (TAC), in which he served as Chairman of the TAC Health Insurance Committee for 11 years. In addition to the Health Insurance Com-mittee, he was also a member of the Risk Management Committee and Chairman of the Occupational Region of Community Affairs. Throughout his time with the TAC, Judge Molina advanced projects to improve his coun-ty and serve his constituents. Judge Molina routinely visited Austin, Texas, and Wash-ington, D.C., to advocate for communities in Jim Hogg. Aside from his accomplished career in pub-lic service, Judge Molina led a distinguished personal life. He was a member of the Knights of Columbus and a devout Catholic. He was a regular amongst friends at the U.S. Post Of-fice. Moreover, he had a loving wife, children, and family who succeed him. Mr. Speaker, South Texas lost one of our most excellent and beloved public servants. Judge Agapito Molina will be missed dearly by family, friends, and constituents alike.

HONORING CARYL CASTLEBERRY 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 3, 2018 Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of Caryl Castleberry, who passed away in May of this year. Born in Iowa and raised in southern Cali-fornia, Caryl Castleberry earned an Associates of Arts Degree at Citrus Junior College before going to Pitzer College on an arts scholarship. Caryl began her more than 30-year sculpting career in 1985 while working for the Los An-geles County Museum of Natural History. She would go on to become a renowned wildlife sculptor over the course of her career, and her work was on display at numerous museums, galleries, zoos, nature preserves, and private collections. Caryl also cared deeply for the community, volunteering with organizations such as the Valley of the Moon Children’s Home and Friends of the Petaluma River. Caryl is sur-vived by her husband of 51 years, three sib-lings, two children, and four grandchildren, and she will be missed by her family and many friends. Mr. Speaker, it is with the greatest respect and condolences that we honor the life of Caryl Castleberry and send her loved ones our regrets.

HONORING THE ADIRONDACK 46ERS ON THEIR 100TH ANNIVER-SARY 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 3, 2018 Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate the Adirondack 46ers on celebrating their 100th anniversary. One hundred years ago, Robert and George Marshall and Herbert Clark climbed to the top of Whiteface Mountain. Seven years later, they finished climbing 46 High Peaks in the Adirondacks, and a club was born. Formally established in 1937, the Adirondack 46ers have attracted hikers from near and far to the High Peaks, turning desolate mountain tops into destinations for the more than 10,000 people who have joined the organization since 1918. The Adirondack 46ers pride themselves on their community-oriented nature, and have turned their love for hiking into service. Due to the volume of visitors in the Adirondack high peaks, the organization started a trailhead stewardship program, pledging thousands of dollars to management of the beautiful moun-tains as well as putting in thousands of hours of volunteer trail work. Since 2001, the 46ers have given back $460,000 to the Adirondacks, including assistance after Tropical Storm Irene and youth scholarships. On behalf of New York’s 21st district, I want to congratulate the Adirondack 46ers on 100 years of accomplishment, camaraderie, and service. I know their impressive achievements will inspire future generations of hikers to con-tinue their remarkable tradition. MITCHELL RECOGNIZES LIEUTEN-ANT COLONEL DENNIS SURGRUE HON. PAUL MITCHELL 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 3, 2018 Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize and congratulate Lieutenant Colonel Dennis Sugrue of the United States Army Corps of Engineers for completing his tour of duty as the Commanding Officer for the De-troit District. Lieutenant Colonel Sugrue re-ceived his commission from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1999, and during his career he completed two deploy-ments in Afghanistan and one in Kosovo. He served as the Brigade Engineer and Executive Officer for the Special Troops Battalion, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division before becoming the Deputy District Com-mander of the Los Angeles District for the Army Corps of Engineers. After successfully serving and leading in these positions, Sugrue assumed command of the Detroit District for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, respon-sible for 4,000 miles of coast line along four of the Great Lakes and processing nearly 2,000 regulatory permits a year. I have had the pleasure of working with Lieutenant Colonel Sugrue on several projects, most notably on upgrading the Soo Locks; critical infrastructure essential to our nation’s defense and econ-omy. He is an articulate, consummate profes-sional; always receptive to concerns and un-derstanding of the complexities of the issues at hand. I am thankful to have worked with Lieutenant Colonel Sugrue in his current post-ing and I wish him the best of luck in his fu-ture endeavors.

NATIONAL KOREAN WAR VETERANS ARMISTICE DAY 2018 
HON. TED POE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 3, 2018 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, July 27th was National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, marking the day in 1953 when the armi-stice was signed at Panmunjom. The Korean War is often referred to as ‘‘the Forgotten War.’’ Our boys were largely ig-nored when they arrived home. There were no tickertape parades like at the end of World War II, and there were no violent protests against the war like with Vietnam. The Admin-istration did not even refer to the conflict as a war but rather as a police action. Well, Mr. Speaker, it was a war. It was a war where Americans went and fought. In 1950, communist North Korea, backed by brutal dictatorships in China and the Soviet Union, crossed the 38th Parallel in an invasion of free South Korea. The communist forces pushed the South Koreans back, nearly forc-ing them off of the peninsula entirely. With their heels touching the tide, South Korea called 911. America was not ready for another war. The Pentagon was in the process of downsizing the military, both in budget and in manpower. But, as history shows, when the world dials 911, America answers. So President Truman ordered troops to land at Pusan to aid the be-leaguered South Korean forces. Over the course of the next three years, the United States fought a grueling conflict but successfully managed to drive the communist forces out of South Korea. The fighting ceased when the armistice agreement was signed at Panmunjom, but to this day, no official peace document has been signed. Over 35,000 Americans died in this war, and more than 7,000 are still missing. Thou-sands more came home with the scars of war or suffered in prisoner of war camps. Most in uniform served with great distinction and dem-onstrated that the American soldier is a rare breed. One such individual was one of my late con-stituents, Sergeant Donald Foisie. Sergeant Foisie was pinned down on Hill 303 in August 1950, but he stood his ground. When the com-munist forces overran the hill, he and a friend hid in a rice paddy, using bamboo sticks to get air. The two survived and rejoined American forces when the hill was retaken. Mr. Speaker, the sacrifice and bravery of American soldiers in the Korean War should be remembered and honored. Just this week, Vice President PENCE accepted the remains of fallen Korean war soldiers, at last making their return home from North Korean soil. After 60 years, these noble ones who gave their lives will be forgotten no more. This is a welcome step following the June 12th meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-Un, however, we must continue to strive towards our goal of complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization by North Korea. These Ko-rean War patriots deserve our utmost respect and admiration, because the worst casualty of war is to be forgotten. And that is just the way it is.

RECOGNIZING THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT TYLER PATRIOTS 2018 NCAA DIVISION III NATIONAL BASEBALL CHAMPIONS 
HON. LOUIE GOHMERT 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 3, 2018 Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it is a great honor to celebrate with my fellow east Texans today the success of the University of Texas at Tyler Patriots on capturing the 2018 NCAA Division III National Baseball Championship, the first championship title in program history. Although the Patriots team was unranked and had no idea if it would even participate in the NCAA postseason, the undeniable bond between these teammates resulted in an un-precedented comeback after receiving an at- large bid to participate in the NCAA Baseball Championships in Appleton, Wisconsin. The Patriots swept the best of three series against Texas Lutheran University with scores of 8–1 and 9–6 to claim the national title. It is with great pride that all east Texans ex-tend our heartfelt congratulations to the na-tional champion Patriots: Josh Bums, Jared Pauley, Blake Wilson, Alex Bishop, Benjamin Romines, Henry Sanchez, Jordan Antley, Zachary Pavelock, Zane Wilkinson, Brandon Saddler, Evan Kissinger, Tanner Roach, Landon Shofner, Bowie Farris, Simon Sedillo, Blake Maddox, Kolton Forsythe, Christopher

Stodolka, Alexander Masotto, Ryan Cheatham, Sam Sitton, Nate Imig, Austin Schneider, Turner Givens, Graham Welch, and Dayton Loyd. Praise is also extended to reserve Patriots: Cole Clinton, Adam Nelson, Adam Biesiadny, Justin Olivarez, Braden McMahan, Colston Lloyd, Tyler Hollingsworth, Christian Reeves, Ethan Cherry, Max Page, Raby Hampton, Caden Ledbetter, Tyler Johnson, Jeremy Moore, Sam Plotkowski, Patrick Rogers, Joey Gennusa, Brady UsherWood, Cameron Ja-cobs, and Blake Ross. Credit is owed not only to the talented ath-letes, but to the dedicated faculty and staff of the University of Texas at Tyler, including: Brent Porche, Head Coach; Erik Grafton, As-sistant Coach/Recruiting Coordinator; Wade Pope, Assistant Coach; Cade Bowen, Pitching Coach; Kody Gautreaux, Assistant Coach; Sam Lane, Assistant Coach; Dalton Smith, As-sistant Coach; Connor Green, Strength & Con-ditioning Coach; Andrew Cage, Athletic Train-er; and Dr. Howard Patterson, Director of Ath-letics. Enough cannot be said regarding the sup-port the Patriots received from the entire Tyler community. The love and support from people all around the area surely served as an inspir-ing force behind this incredible run. It is also amazingly fitting that the last sea-son Robert and Mary Irwin, the benefactors for whom the team’s home field is named, got to experience together before Robert’s passing was the team’s first national championship. With the support of coaches, teachers, ad-ministrators and their entire east Texas com-munity, these young men bear witness that anything is achievable through hard work and determination. These are guiding principles that lead to success not only on the field, but will undoubt-edly resonate through every endeavor these valiant championship players undertake throughout their lives.

HONORING THE PULIDO FAMILY 
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 3, 2018 Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Pulido family for their contributions to South Texas, both through their musical talents and dedication to civil service. Roberto Pulido, his brother Eloy Pulido, and his son Bobby Pulido have been active participants in the South Texas commu-nity since the 1970s when Roberto made his mark as a Tejano musician. At the age of 12, Roberto began his musical career when he decided to repair his grand-father’s old guitar. Roberto grew to become a pioneer of Tejano music. Roberto’s brother Eloy also participated in his family’s music leg-acy. In the mid 80’s, Eloy began his career as a civil servant, later becoming the 27th Hi-dalgo County Judge. As County Judge, Eloy lived by a creed of ‘‘effectiveness and ac-countability.’’ He strived to make government more accessible and produce positive results through regional problem solving. Roberto’s son Bobby continued his father’s musical legacy by introducing Tejano music to new generations of Mexican-Americans. He became an idol among the young and old alike and is credited as one of the most influ-ential Tejano recording artists. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to share Ro-berto, Eloy, and Bobby’s contributions to South Texas. Their family’s music and public service have had a significant impact on the lives of South Texans. I find it proper and fit-ting to honor them and the Pulido family today. f 
RETIREMENT OF LEROY MARSH 
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 3, 2018 Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with great admiration and respect that I stand be-fore you today to honor Mr. Leroy Marsh for his outstanding coaching career and to wish him well upon his retirement from his position as the head coach of the Munster High School football team. Leroy’s outstanding forty-five year career was driven by his dedication to making a difference in the lives of his students and athletes by building character and setting a good example. Coach Marsh deserves the utmost praise for his lifetime of devotion to the youth of his community as a coach, educator, and leader. Leroy Marsh grew up in Northwest Indiana and graduated from East Chicago Roosevelt High School in 1986. He went on to further his education, earning a bachelor’s degree from Augustana College in 1972 and then a mas-ter’s degree from Purdue University Calumet in Hammond. Following college, Leroy be-came an educator and defensive coordinator at Munster High School, and in 1980, he was offered the head coaching position. Coach Marsh has had a noteworthy career, leading his team to five sectional titles, one regional title, and nine conference titles. He leaves the program with an impressive 228–166 record. In addition, he coached fifty-nine first: team all-state players and was inducted into the In-diana Football Hall of Fame. For his remark-able career, Leroy was named ‘‘coach of the year’’ several times by the Indiana Football Coaches Association. During his forty-five years of coaching at Munster, Coach Marsh has served as a tremendous inspiration to nu-merous students and athletes, and he is wor-thy of the highest praise. In addition to coaching, Leroy’s philanthropic efforts throughout Northwest Indiana have been a great source of pride. Among his nu-merous charitable endeavors, Mr. Marsh start-ed the Mustang Toy Roundup, in which the football team helps to collect money for under-privileged children during the Christmas sea-son. Additionally, in honor of their son, Ryan, who tragically passed away, Leroy and his wife, Jamie, created the Ryan Marsh Founda-tion. The organization helps send children with disabilities to Camp Riley in Indianapolis, an outstanding organization that allows these chil-dren to experience and attend summer camp. As you can see, Leroy Marsh is kind and giv-ing and often puts others’ needs before his own. Mr. Marsh’s dedication to his community is exceeded only by his devotion to his loving family. His wife, Jamie, runs the press box for football games, while his son, Chris, is a vol-unteer assistant on the field. In addition, his grandson, Patrick, is an offensive lineman for Wabash College. Football is a passion shared by the Marsh family. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in com-mending Mr. Leroy Marsh for his outstanding career and his lifetime of mentorship to Munster’s youth. His impact will be felt for years to come through his countless selfless acts. I wish Leroy well on his retirement and thank him for his lifelong dedication to our community. For his many contributions, he is worthy of our highest gratitude and apprecia-tion. f 
HONORING THE REMARKABLE LIFE OF JOHNNY HARRIS, JR: SON, FATHER, GRANDFATHER, PATRIOT, OUTSTANDING AMER-ICAN, TEACHER, AND COMMU-NITY LEADER 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 3, 2018 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Johnny Harris, Jr., a great American, who dedicated his life in serv-ice to making this great country a better place and educating the next generation of leaders. Living by the creed that knowledge and edu-cation could change your life and perceptions making you a better person, Mr. Johnny Harris Jr. obtained his bachelor’s degree in business and two master’s degrees in business and education. During his life he sold insurance and owned his own businesses, but later returned to his passion of educating and coaching the next generation of future leaders. His love for football extended to him coach-ing football at Zaragoza Air Base in Spain and later at Estacado High School in Lubbock, Texas. In addition, he also taught at Lincoln Middle School, Edison Middle School, and Lee Middle School respectively. In life and work, he was committed to inspir-ing excellence in all people. He exuded love, friendship and compassion. Mr. Johnny Harris Jr. loved mentoring local high school students and founded the non- profit Center for Athletic and Academic Place-ment (CAAP), of which he was extremely proud, to help high school student athletes im-prove their academics and obtain scholarships for college. During the past 20 years, Mr. Johnny Harris Jr. and his wife helped mentor hundreds of students and assisted them into college. Mr. Johnny Harris Jr. believed no child should suffer and even in his last days sought to empower and enrich causes dedicated to helping eradicate diseases prevalent among children, and terminal diseases generally. He lived by the quote ‘‘God, family, and education’’ and it was evident in all the he did. On April 26, 2018, he succumbed to illness, but not without inspiring a new generation of leaders. As we go forward, it is of the upmost impor-tance to provide experimental treatment to those facing terminal diagnoses. As we have seen, it can literally mean the difference between life and death or essential comfort during the final days of life.

HONORING MARY PAT SHELY 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 3, 2018 Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mary Pat Shely from Clark County, Ken-tucky. Pat has deep roots in Kentucky, as her ancestors settled in historic Boonesboro short-ly after its founding by Daniel Boone. As a young woman, Pat was a talented ath-lete and a champion in tennis, fencing, swim-ming, and golf. She taught herself to fly the Piper Cub that her father purchased for her. She was one of the first females allowed into the Civil Air Patrol in 1942. She served her nation honorably as part of the Kentucky Wing and earned the rank of 2nd Lieutenant. Following her service during World War II, Pat graduated from the University of Kentucky in 1946. She later earned a master’s degree from Columbia University. Pat had a career in education, teaching in colleges across the country. In 1963, she returned to Kentucky and began a career in agriculture on her fam-ily’s farm in Clark County. Mary Pat Shely is a well-respected member of her community, a good steward of the land, and an American patriot. As part of what has been described as The Greatest Generation, she served her nation well during World War II. For her faithful wartime service during this time, 2nd Lieutenant Shely and other mem-bers of the Civil Air Patrol were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. This prestigious award, one of the highest civilian awards be-stowed by the United States government, was presented to ‘‘unpaid volunteer members of the Civil Air Patrol during World War II pro-viding extraordinary humanitarian, combat, and national services during a critical time of need for the nation.’’ It is my honor today to recognize this ex-traordinary Kentucky woman, Mary Pat Shely.

SPRING WOODS HS SPEECH AND DEBATE 
HON. TED POE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 3, 2018 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as the 2017–2018 school year came to a close, the Spring Woods High School Speech and De-bate Team concluded another successful year with a strong performance at the National Speech and Debate Association’s National Tournament in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. Two members of the team logged notable performances in Florida. Anahi Torres, a sen-ior, advanced to the semi-finals of the Prose Interpretation. Coming off of a 3rd place finish at the state tournament, junior Hunter Brown rose above the field to qualify for the finals of the Congressional Debate. In the finals, he rose to speak on proposed legislation ad-dressing the U.S. Navy, oversight of the Jus-tice Department, and other topical issues. He ultimately placed 13th, earning him the right to return to Nationals next year as a senior. Success at the national and state level has long been a part of Spring Woods Speech and Debate team history. This year marked the 18th time Spring Woods appeared at Nation-als, and Brown’s performance this past June made it seven consecutive years that Spring Woods has advanced to the final round of the Congressional Debate at this particular tour-nament. The team has qualified for the Univer-sity Interscholastic League State (UIL) tour-nament for the past 11 years, boasting UIL state champions and finalists during this pe-riod. Currently, SWHS is ranked 10th in the state of Texas for qualifications at the Texas Forensic Association’s State Tournament, and at this year’s tournament, SWHS had quarter- finalists, semi-finals, and finalists. It is often said that a team takes on the per-sonality of the head coach. No statement could be truer for the SWHS debate team. Under the phenomenal leadership of Victoria Beard, director of Forensics at SWHS for the past 13 years, the team has not only put in impressive performances at local, state, and national tournaments, but also provided valu-able skills to its members. The students expe-rience gained through the tournaments and the long, arduous hours of practice balanced between studying for AP exams and finals pays off after graduation. Quite literally, as many Spring Woods debaters earn full schol-arships to prestigious institutions around the country such as Yale, George Washington, and the University of Texas. This past spring, a SWHS alum and former debater, Christian Rice, gave the commencement address at Yale. The other speaker that day—former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Mr. Speaker, as a proud graduate of Springwoods Senior High School and a former member of the debate team myself, it is my honor to recognize the debate teams hard work and achievements. Congratulations to all who took part this year, and may there be many more that follow in your footsteps in the future. And that is just the way it is. f 
IN HONOR OF GUY E. CARR 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL

Mr. Carr served in the U.S. Air Force from December 27, 1950 until November 3, 1953. Mr. Carr was trained as a Senior Turret Systems Mechanic and Gunner, but upon ar-riving in Kunson, Korea he was retrained to be a flight systems engineer as they did not have a need for gunners. He nonchalantly likes to state ‘‘we only crashed once’’while in Korea. Mr. Carr flew 54 combat mission while serv-ing in Korea, and earned the Distinguished Flying Cross, two Air Medals, the United Na-tions Korean Service Medal, and the Korean Service Medal. Mr. Carr truly exemplifies the Warrior Spirit that has seen our Nation through trying times. I’m honored to present Guy E. Carr replace-ment medals for his service in Korea and for his sacrifice to our nation. f

From its beginning, settlers have come from countries around the world to the United States in search of better lives for their fami-lies. Oath ceremonies are a shining example of what is so great about the United States of America—that people from all over the world can come together and unite as members of a free, democratic nation. These individuals realize that nowhere else in the world offers a better opportunity for success than here in America. On August 10, 2018, the following people, representing many nations throughout the world, will take their oaths of citizenship in

Although each individual has sought to be-come a citizen of the United States for his or her own reasons, be it for education, occupa-tion, or to offer their loved ones better lives, each is inspired by the fact that the United States of America is, as Abraham Lincoln de-scribed it, a country ‘‘. . . of the people, by the people, and for the people.’’ They realize that the United States is truly a free nation. By seeking American citizenship, they have made the decision that they want to live in a place where, as guaranteed by the First Amendment of the Constitution, they can practice religion as they choose, speak their minds without fear of punishment, and assemble in peaceful pro-test should they choose to do so. Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating these individuals who will be-come citizens of the United States of America on August 10, 2018. They, too, are American citizens, guaranteed the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We, as a free and democratic nation, congratulate them and welcome them.

IN MEMORY OF ROBERT ‘‘RED’’ M
CKEON 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 3, 2018 Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reflect on the life of the legendary Robert ‘‘Red’’ McKeon, Chief of Occum Volunteer Fire Department in Norwich, CT. Red passed away in March, and the village has felt his loss deeply. His life’s work was improving fire and emergency services anywhere he could. He was an institution in his own right and I’d like to take a moment to reflect on his life of serv-ice at the local, state, and national level. Red McKeon was born in Putnam, CT and was a U.S. Army veteran who served in the Korean War. He joined the Occum Volunteer Fire Department in 1944, and in 1960, he be-came chief—a position he held for 34 years. During his tenure, Red was an innovator and he established an ambulance service at his station which was one of the first volunteer op-erations in Connecticut to have one. He also pushed for the creation of a pension system for Norwich volunteer firefighters. This benefit has been imitated by many volunteer depart-ments as an effective tool to recruit and retain volunteers. After his retirement he made him-self available to offer advice to the next gen-eration of community leaders. He even chan-neled his energy and newfound spare time into the development of a neighborhood park that was ultimately named in his honor. Red’s activism went beyond his hometown. He became one of the first certified EMTs in the state and he lobbied for stronger EMT training criteria across Connecticut. He was also a member of the Connecticut State Fire-man’s Association, serving briefly as president and maintaining a position as treasurer for 20 years. In 2009, he became a member of the first class of honorees inducted into the asso-ciation’s hall of fame. Red’s leadership extended just as far on the national stage as it did at home. He and his team worked with the Center for Disease Con-trol to certify the development of training for EMT and MRT personnel which was then im-plemented nationally. He joined forces with the CDC once more to develop OSHA training and guidelines pertaining to AIDS. He also helped create the Public Safety Officers’ Ben-efits Program as well as the National Volun-teer Fire Council on which he served as chair-man from 1991 to 1995. He was awarded the council’s E. James Monihan Director Award for achievements that exemplify outstanding performance and have gone above normal ex-pectations. On a personal note, when I was first elected to Congress in 2006, Red was a frequent vis-itor to my district office and was an invaluable source of advice and help on Department of Homeland Security Programs such as the As-sistance to Firefighters Grant that has bene-fitted small departments all across eastern Connecticut. He was always quick with a smile and corny jokes for me and my staff and we welcomed his visits over the years. Red, from the little village of Occum, led a remarkable life, representing the United States at World Federation of Firefighters con-ferences all over the world. He even had audi-ences with multiple high-level dignitaries in-cluding President George H.W. Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle, then First Lady Hillary Clinton, and even Pope Pius XII and Pope John Paul. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to please join me in honoring the memory of Red McKeon. He was a shining example of what it means to be a citizen-servant and Occum will not be the same without him.

IN REMEMBRANCE OF RONALD V. DELLUMS, HOUSE ARMED SERV-ICES COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN, MARINE CORPS VETERAN, ANTI- WAR ACTIVIST, MAYOR OF OAK-LAND, CO-FOUNDER OF CON-GRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS AND CONGRESSIONAL PROGRES-SIVE CAUCUS, AND TIRELESS CHAMPION FOR SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHTS 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 3, 2018 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise to remember and pay tribute to Ronald V. Dellums, the pioneering, legendary, brilliant, and dynamic former Chair-man of the House Armed Services Committee who represented the residents of California 9th Congressional District in this body for 27 years. Ronald Dellums died peacefully on July 30, 2018, at his home in Washington D.C. after waging a heroic but losing battle against pros-tate cancer; he was 82 years old. Born November 24, 1935 in Oakland, Cali-fornia, to Verney and Willa Dellums, Ronald Vernie Dellums would go on to lead a con-sequential life marked by public service, active engagement, and passionate leadership. These qualities—service, engagement, pas-sionate commitment—were Dellums family traits; Ron’s father was a longshoreman and active in the labor movement and his uncle, Cottrell Laurence Dellums, helped A. Philip Randolph organize the Brother of Sleeping Car Porters, before being elected President of the union in 1966. In 1954, after graduating from high school, and during the height of the Cold War, Ronald Dellums enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and served two years before being hon-orably discharged in 1956. His honorable service to the nation enabled him to attend college on the G.I. Bill and in 1958 he earned an Associate of Arts degree from Oakland City College, followed by a Bachelor of Science degree in 1960 from San Francisco State University, an M.S.W. from the University of California at Berkeley in 1962. Upon graduation from UC-Berkeley, Ronald Dellums worked as a psychiatric social worker for the California Department of Mental Hy-giene and taught at San Francisco State Uni-versity and the University of California at Berkeley, work which soon led him to become involved in local politics. In 1967, at the age of 32, Ronald was elect-ed to the Berkeley City Council, where he served until 1970, when he was elected to Congress as an anti-Vietnam War activist, de-feating the incumbent in the primary, and win-ning the general election in a landslide. In 1972, Ronald Dellums was reelected to the 93rd Congress and to the succeeding Congresses, never winning election with less than 57 percent of the vote. During his tenure in Congress, Ronald Del-lums served on the House Committees on Foreign Affairs, the District of Columbia, Post Office and Civil Service, the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and Armed Serv-ices, which he chaired from 1993 to 95 and was Ranking Member from 1995 until his re-tirement from the House in 1998. Throughout his congressional career, Ron-ald Dellums, who cofounded the Congres-sional Black Caucus in 1971 and the Congres-sional Progressive Caucus in 1991, was one of the Capitol’s leading authorities and voices challenging the underlying assumptions of the U.S. military budget. Ronald Dellums also led the congressional opposition to the apartheid regime in South Af-rica, winning passage of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986 by congressional override of President Reagan’s veto, the first override in the 20th century of a presidential foreign policy veto. Ronald Dellums championed for equal rights for Americans and was one of the first to call for the integration of gays and lesbians into the military. In addition to championing equal rights, Ron Dellums was a strong supporter of historic preservation.

He emerged as one of the most radical and outspoken Congressmen in Washington, and a spokesperson for African American commu-nity affairs and for his radical political beliefs. After retiring from Congress in 1998, Ronald Dellums served as president of Healthcare International Management, an organization that worked with the newly democratic South African government to develop low cost, af-fordable healthcare and bring awareness, pre-vention and treatment in response to the AIDS epidemic. Mr. Speaker, Ron Dellums lived a long and fulfilling life and made his mark in the world by making a difference in the lives of untold num-bers of individuals. I hope that Ron’s family and loved ones are comforted by the fact that the lives of millions of people here at home and around the world were touched by the service of one of the great social activists, political leaders, and statesmen of the 20th century. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to observe a moment of silence in memory of Ronald V. Dellums, a tireless and eloquent voice for jus-tice and equality, who did so much to ensure that America always strives to live up to the promise of its founding ideals and remain a beacon and example for the world.

HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 3, 2018 Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a special man, Mr. Frank Zupan of Frenchburg, Kentucky. Mr. Zupan is part of a special group of heroes that served our nation during World War II. Mr. Zupan volunteered for the United States Army in 1942. Growing up in a suburb of De-troit, Michigan, he never handled guns. He learned quickly in the Army and was trained to fire a M1919 Browning machine gun. Mr. Zupan made his first beachhead landing in the Battle of the Aleutian Islands as U.S. troops fought to reclaim U.S. owned islands west of Alaska. He fought in many more battles in the Pacific as the war raged. Mr. Zupan’s heroism earned him the Silver Star and the Bronze Star. He also received a Purple Heart after being injured in battle. Mr. Zupan and his fellow veterans are true heroes. As members of the ‘‘Greatest Genera-tion’’, they willingly served to protect and de-fend the freedoms that we enjoy today. I am humbled to honor the service of Mr. Frank Zupan before the United States Congress.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the House of Representatives to join me in honoring the Mamie Johnson Little League for winning the District of Columbia’s Little League championship title on July 24, 2018. Only three years since its inception, Mamie Johnson is the first all-African American team to win the Little League championship title in the annual tournament’s 31 years in the Dis-trict. Mamie Johnson won the title game against Capitol Hill Little League, and will move on to compete in the regional tournament, in Bristol, Connecticut, with their sights on the Little League World Series. Keith Barnes, president of the Mamie John-son Little League, founded the league just four years ago in Ward 7, here in the District of Columbia. He named the team after Mamie ‘‘Peanut’’ Johnson, the first female pitcher in the Negro Leagues, who lived and died in D.C. Johnson herself was present to see her namesake Little League make it to the finals in last year’s tournament. This year’s cham-pionship game was played at the Washington Nationals Youth Baseball Academy, located in Fort Dupont. One of the reasons the District had no teams east of the Anacostia River is there was no place to play until recently. The land for the Academy was secured through a federal land transfer from the National Park Service to the District in 2010—an effort in which I was proud to play an essential role. In 2017, Major League Baseball’s opening- day rosters had the lowest percentage of black players since 1958. In 2018, that num-ber of 7.1 percent increased to 7.8 percent, or 68 African Americans. This modest increase has been attributed to youth programs such as the Academy’s ‘‘YBA Play’’ program. At a time when African American participa-tion in America’s favorite pastime has been declining, the Mamie Johnson Little League presents a different future for baseball. They have already been an inspiration to kids in the District and have reintroduced an appetite for the sport in young children. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Represent-atives to join me in honoring the Mamie John-son Little League for their win in the District’s Little League championship and for making tournament history as the first all-African American team to take the title. f 
ROBERT GHIRELLI 
HON. MIMI WALTERS 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 3, 2018 Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the retire-ment of Orange County Sanitation District (OCSD) Assistant Manager Robert P. Ghirelli. For almost four decades, Mr. Ghirelli has worked to advance the quality of our Nation’s water resources. He is a graduate of my alma mater, University of California, Los Angeles with an undergraduate degree in bacteriology and a doctorate in environmental science and engineering, and holds a master’s degree in health science from California State University Northridge. In his most recent role as OCSD’s Assistant General Manager, Mr. Ghirelli oversaw the third largest clean water agency west of the Mississippi River, which services 2.6 million residents and delivers high quality water im-provements throughout Orange County, Cali-fornia. Mr. Ghirelli previously served for 13 years as the Executive Director of the California Re-gional Water Quality Control Board, Los Ange-les/Ventura Region, where he administered the region’s clean water programs and man-aged 100 water quality professionals. Mr. Ghirelli joined OCSD as its Director of Technical Services in 1998, managing the Dis-trict’s environmental affairs and regulatory compliance programs, environmental labora-tories, and industrial waste control programs. He also worked closely with elected officials and senior executives across all levels of gov-ernment. Mr. Ghirelli has dedicated his career to de-veloping common sense approaches to water protection, mentoring the next generation of water professionals, and delivering high quality water to my constituents in Orange County, California. After decades working to improve our water resources, I wish Mr. Ghirelli the best in his retirement. f 
CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 5515, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA-TION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 
SPEECH OF  
HON. JEB HENSARLING 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, July 26, 2018 Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the conference report and want to congratulate my friend and fellow Texan, Chairman M
ACTHORNBERRY for his leadership and hard work to get us to this point and his willingness to work with the Fi-nancial Services Committee on a number of provisions where we have shared jurisdiction. I wish to address one title in particular: the Foreign Investment Risk Review Moderniza-tion Act, or FIRRMA, which reforms the Com-mittee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). FIRRMA represents the first significant update to CFIUS since passage of the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007. In the intervening 11 years, a number of gaps in CFIUS’s jurisdiction have emerged that FIRRMA now seeks to close, particularly in the realm of sensitive non-con-trolling investments and real estate trans-actions near national security-related sites. This is not to say that everything outside CFIUS’s jurisdiction qualifies as a gap. Far from it. Although the House and Senate both produced their own versions of FIRRMA, the House approach was generally more cautious in the authorities it delegated to CFIUS. If CFIUS needed to review transactions that genuinely posed a national security risk, the House worked in good faith to determine which additional powers were called for, but also circumscribed those powers appropriately to prevent overreach and unintended con-sequences. The final version of FIRRMA adopts many important provisions from the House’s bill (H.R. 5841), which passed this chamber in June by a vote of 400 to 2. For instance, the text that we have nego-tiated focuses on U.S. businesses that own, operate, or supply—and by ‘‘supply,’’ we mean provide—critical infrastructure, targeting spe-cific information or influence that could be transferred. This approach is designed to pre-vent CFIUS from sweeping up entire economic sectors regardless of a business’s connection to national security.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1123 August 3, 2018 
Even within the scope of ‘‘critical infrastruc-ture,’’ FIRRMA makes explicit that CFIUS is only to focus on the subset of systems and assets that are likely to be important to na-tional security. There are technically a number of assets that fall within critical infrastructure sectors broadly, including everything from res-taurants to amusement parks, but the bar for inclusion under FIRRMA is much higher. FIRRMA makes this clear. CFIUS must also limit its new jurisdiction to certain categories of investors, which is meant to include foreign persons connected with problematic countries. Those categories of for-eign persons are not intended to target our al-lies. As under current law, CFIUS will continue to have jurisdiction over foreign investments in U.S. businesses when a transaction could re-sult in control of the business. Under FIRRMA—and we have confirmed this point with the Treasury Department—CFIUS will continue to be limited to transactions involving a U.S. business only to the extent of its activi-ties in interstate commerce. Finally, a key innovation originating in the House is the protection of sensitive personal data of U.S. citizens that may be exploited in a manner threatening national security. While some had sought to expand this language to include personally identifiable information more broadly, the conference committee re-jected that approach in order to focus only on sensitive data with a clear link to national se-curity. Again, the need for CFIUS modernization was clear, and the conference committee has worked to address it through FIRRMA. At the same time, we have ensured that expansions to CFIUS’s jurisdiction are themselves appro-priately limited in order to preserve our coun-try’s open investment climate. It is this open-ness to investment that drives forward our pro-ductivity, innovation, and growth, making openness itself indispensable to national secu-rity. I want to thank Members on both sides of the aisle who helped ensure that the will of the House was reflected in the conference report. I especially want to acknowledge the author of the House’s CFIUS bill, Mr. P
ITTENGER of North Carolina who has been a tireless advo-cate for reform, and my fellow conferees from the Financial Services Committee: the gen-tleman from Kentucky, Mr. BARR, who chairs our Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee, as well as the Ranking Member of the Full Committee, the gentle lady from California, Mrs. W
ATERS . This legislation is narrowly fo-cused on national security while keeping America’s doors open to investment. For that reason, it deserves our support.

INTRODUCTION OF LEGISLATION TO DIRECT THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR TO CONVEY CER-TAIN FACILITIES, EASEMENTS, AND RIGHTS-OF-WAY TO THE KENNEWICK IRRIGATION DIS-TRICT, AND FOR OTHER PUR-POSES 
HON. DAN NEWHOUSE 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 3, 2018 Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce an important piece of legislation authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to transfer title of certain Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) assets to the Kennewick Irrigation Dis-trict (KID) in Central Washington. This straightforward legislation, in accord-ance with a December 2017 Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the Kennewick Irri-gation District and BOR, will transfer title of works beginning at the KID’s head gate and extending 40 miles east. The transfer includes the conveyance of land and project facilities and should be completed no later than two years after the enactment. In working toward a successful transfer, the KID will include an Environmental Assessment under the National Environmental Policy Act as well as all necessary Endangered Species Act review, National Historical Preservation Act review, and a hazardous materials review. The KID and BOR have also committed to en-sure that all stakeholders, tribal concerns, and local interests have a seat at the table throughout the process. In addition to ensuring the proper reviews are completed, KID will repay their allocated share of construction costs to the federal government. Throughout Central Washington, there are several irrigation districts which work to man-age and maintain reliable water supplies to cit-ies, farmers, tribes, and recreational interest and they have done so successfully for many decades. The KID is no different. By com-pleting this title transfer we can ensure there will be a safe, reliable, and efficient water sup-ply for the next generation. f 
HONORING THE FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH RICHMOND, KY 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, August 3, 2018 Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to rec-ognize the First Baptist Church in Richmond, Kentucky on their 175th anniversary. In 1843, Madison Campbell and other slaves came together in faith. They first built a log church that was the foundation for present day First Baptist Church. As the church grew, they built a brick building and ex-panded facilities over the years. Reverend Campbell served as pastor until 1896. The church has been led by nine devoted pastors over its history. Reverend A.C. Goodloe was the church’s eighth pastor and was active in the civil rights movement. First Baptist Church’s current pastor is Rev-erend Dr. Robert Blythe, who has served since 1981. Under his pastorate, the fifth church building was constructed on the his-toric site of that first log cabin church. The church is an active part of Madison County, serving those in need. Over the past 175 years, countless lives have been touched by the word of God received at First Baptist Church. From humble beginnings, this church has grown and affected many lives in a pow-erful way. They have been Lighting the Way since 1843. I congratulate the members of First Baptist Church in Richmond on their 175th anniver-sary and wish them many more years of suc-cessful ministry, serving God and reaching out to the community.
