PRAYER 
The Presiding Officer offered the fol-
lowing prayer: 
Let us pray. Father, You are the One who forgives 
and restores in a place where pride comes really easy. I pray that You will give us the ability to humble ourselves so that we can encourage those who are broken and need help. Help us to speak with integrity in a day when this Na-tion needs role models. 
We understand full well that You are 
our protector and shield, so we ask You to watch over us. Take care of our Na-tion. Take care of those dedicated men and women around the world who also protect and serve us. 
We are grateful for Your wisdom, 
Your mercy, and Your loving kindness. Help us not to forget today that You are our Creator and You are the guide of this country, and we are Your serv-ants. God, help us today to live and speak like it. 
In the Name of Jesus, I pray. Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The Presiding Officer led the Pledge 
of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the

CLOTURE MOTION  
We, the undersigned Senators, in accord-
ance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the mo-tion to proceed to H.R. 2048, an act to reform the authorities of the Federal Government to require the production of certain business records, conduct electronic surveillance, use pen registers and trap and trace devises, and use other forms of information gathering for foreign intelligence, counterterrorism, and criminal purposes, and for other purposes.

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. On this vote, the yeas are 57, the nays are 42. 
Three-fifths of the Senators duly cho-
sen and sworn not having voted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected. 
The majority leader. Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
enter a motion to reconsider the vote. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The motion is entered. 
Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
Senate has demonstrated that the House-passed bill lacks the support of 60 Senators. I would urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the 2-month extension. Senator B
URR, the chairman of the Intelligence 
Committee, and Senator F EINSTEIN , the 
ranking member, as we all know, have been working on a proposal that they think would improve the version that the Senate has not accepted that the House sent over. It would allow the committee to work on this bill, refine it, and bring it before us for consider-ation. So the 2-month extension, it strikes me, would be in the best inter-est of getting an outcome that is ac-ceptable to both the Senate and the House and hopefully the President. 
Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President. Mr. M
CCONNELL. So I would urge a 
‘‘yes’’ vote. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from California. 
f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— 
H.R. 2048 
Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that since a strong bipartisan majority of the Senate voted to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the USA FREEDOM Act, that the motion to proceed be agreed to, that the bill then be read a third 
time, and the Senate vote on passage of the USA FREEDOM Act. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there objection? 
Mr. BURR. Objection. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Objection is heard. 
Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, let’s be 
clear what happened here. We tried with the majority—— 
Mr. M
CCONNELL. Regular order. 
Mr. BURR. Regular order. Mrs. BOXER. To protect this coun-
try, and the Republicans objected. Let’s be clear. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Regular order has been called for. Debate is not in order. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the 
Chair. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Debate is not in order. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if I 
may a point of personal privilege. 
Mr. President, I would like to correct 
the majority leader, regretfully. I did not support the Burr bill. I do not be-lieve that is the way to go. I have taken a good look at this. For those who want reform and want to prevent the government from holding the data, the FREEDOM Act is the only way to do it. The House has passed it. The President wants it. All of the intel-ligence personnel have agreed to it, and I think not to pass that bill is really to throw the whole program—that whole section 215 as well as the whole busi-ness records, the ‘‘lone wolf,’’ the rov-ing wiretaps—into serious legal jeop-ardy. 
Mr. M
CCONNELL. Regular order, Mr. 
President. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Regular order.

CLOTURE MOTION  
We, the undersigned Senators, in accord-
ance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the mo-tion to proceed to S. 1357, a bill to extend au-thority relating to roving surveillance, ac-cess to business records, and individual ter-rorists as agents of foreign powers under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 until July 31, 2015, and for other purposes.

vidual terrorists as agents of foreign powers under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 until July 31, 2015, and for other purposes, shall be brought to a close?

Three-fifths of the Senators duly cho-
sen and sworn not having voted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected. 
The majority leader. Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
would say to my colleagues that it is clear there aren’t 60 votes in the Sen-ate for the House-passed bill, and there aren’t 60 votes for a 60-day extension. 
So I am going to propound a series of 
unanimous consent requests to see if we can avoid having the program ex-pire roughly 1 week from now. 
f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUESTS 
Therefore, I ask unanimous consent 
that the Senate now proceed to a bill to extend the expiring provisions until June 8, and that the bill be read a third time and passed with no intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3315 May 23, 2015 
The Senator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. Reserving the right to ob-
ject, we have entered into a momen-tous debate. This is a debate about whether or not a warrant with a single name of a single company can be used to collect all of the records—all of the phone records—of all of the people in our country with a single warrant. 
Our forefathers would be aghast. One 
of the things they despised was general warrants. This is a debate that should be had. The reason I am objecting is be-cause I have made a very simple re-quest—to have amendments, to have them voted on, and to have a guarantee that they are voted on. 
I started out the day with a request 
for six amendments. I am willing to compromise to have two amendments and a simple majority vote. 
I think that is a very reasonable po-
sition. And if we can’t have that and we can’t have an extensive debate over something we have had 4 years to pre-pare for, I will object, and I do. 
I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
renew my unanimous consent request with an amendment to extend expiring authorities until June 5. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. WYDEN. I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The majority leader. Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
renew my unanimous consent request with an amendment to extend expiring authorities until June 3. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Kentucky. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I will defer 
to the Senator from New Mexico if he wishes to make an objection. 
Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I ob-
ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
renew my unanimous consent request with an amendment to extend expiring authorities until June 2. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Kentucky. Mr. PAUL. I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.

CCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
enter my motion to reconsider. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The mo-
tion is entered. 
Mr. M CCONNELL. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.

ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, 
here is where we are. We are unable to clear any short-term extension, and the current law expires at midnight on Sunday. So the Senate will be back in session Sunday afternoon—a week from Sunday—on May 31, with one more op-
portunity to act responsibly and not allow this program to expire. 
This is a high-threat period. We know 
what is going on overseas. We know what has been tried here at home. Do we really want this law to expire? 
We have 1 week to discuss it. We will 
have 1 day to do it. So we better be ready next Sunday afternoon to pre-vent the country from being in danger by the total expiration of the program we are all familiar with. 
Unless there is objection, and I un-
derstand there is not an objection, we will pass the highway extension on a voice vote tonight and we will be back in session Sunday a week. 
Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a 
question? 
Mr. M
CCONNELL. I yield for a ques-
tion. 
Mr. REID. We would be happy to co-
operate in passing a surface transpor-tation bill by voice, but I do say this— and I mentioned this to my colleague away from the microphones. For those of us living in the West, we cannot get back on a Sunday afternoon. I think it is very difficult for us to get back here on a weekday before 5 o’clock, so I would hope on a Sunday we wouldn’t be expecting the Senate to come in ses-sion before 5 o’clock because we can’t get here. 
I am protecting the western part of 
my caucus, which is pretty big, but I am not going to agree to anything un-less we can come in at least after 5 o’clock. 
Mr. M
CCONNELL. Well, as my friend 
the Democratic leader knows, I would be happy to work with him on that. He also knows I just tried to get a short- term extension of a variety of different lengths in order not to put us in this position, but we are left with this op-tion only. 
We will work with the Democratic 
leader about the actual time, but the law expires at midnight Sunday a week. I doubt if there are many of us comfortable with that—maybe a hand-ful—but we need to act responsibly here on behalf of the American people. 
Mr. REID. I agree. 
f 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-ate proceed to a period of morning 
business, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
am not sure I made it clear to everyone that there will be no more votes to-night. We will see you in a week. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Carolina. 
Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I suggest 
the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
NATIONAL SECURITY 
LEGISLATION 
Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I 
wanted to speak earlier because I want-ed to encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come to a resolu-tion on this problem. We cannot let this country go dark in terms of its ability to do its duty to defend the United States of America. We have to get off of what we are doing here and start getting down to the business of what we need to do. 
I have to believe that tonight the 
world is watching us and they are say-ing: There goes the United States Sen-ate, and there they go home, ha, ha, ha. They have a program that someone tried to render helpless in terms of our ability to protect ourselves. Edward Snowden literally tried to disgrace the United States. 
Now here we are working on a pro-
gram that went through the respective committees, that has the sound and sensible solution, and we have rejected it. 
I am not here to talk about the pro-
gram, but I will tell you whom I am ready to talk about—the thousands and thousands and thousands of people who work at the National Security Agency, and I want to talk about what they go through every day. They are out there working a 36-hour day trying to defend the United States of America, and they want to work under a law that is con-stitutional, is legal, is authorized, so they can do the necessary work to de-fend the United States of America. They thought they were doing that under the old FISA bill. They thought they were doing that. They were proud of what they were doing. They mus-tered everything they could give to this country. Then along comes Eric Snowden. Then along come the leaks. Then along comes the pontificating about ‘‘My, my, my, we have to worry about privacy.’’ 
I worry about privacy, too, but I also 
worry about the safety and security of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S3316 May 23, 2015 
the United States of America. And I 
watched the Nation vilify the men and women who work at this Agency. 
So now, as we work under the current 
law—which will expire; make no mis-take, it will expire—we don’t have it together to pass a new law. So they have been vilified for what they have done. They have been vilified for what they have done, in many instances at-tacked by their neighbors, their chil-dren picked on and bullied because their parents work at this Agency. Mo-rale was at a low ebb. Finally, now we are trying to deal with and cope with that. They are proud of their work. And what are we doing? We can’t even pass a law. We can’t even pass a law. I think that is absolutely outrageous. 
I am so sorry we are going home. I 
am so sorry we are going home. So now we will come back next Sunday. I real-ly urge those people—who I know are of good will and well-intentioned—to really work to find a way that when we come back next Sunday, we will be able to vote and move forward and not end up in this ongoing parliamentary quag-mire. 
I worry about our country, and I 
worry about our ability to govern. This is as serious as it gets. What is the role of a National Security Agency? To be able to operate and function in a way that is constitutional, legal, author-ized, and obviously of necessity. 
So I really feel very strongly about 
this. And I have watched all this go back and forth. So we spent hours and days and days and days on all of these amendments on trade. That is good. I am glad we did it. But I am not glad we took that long. We had this bill. We knew we had this bill. We waited until the last minute. We got ourselves into a jackpot. Now we really have to find our way out. 
I just cannot speak more forcibly and 
enough about this. Well, I will have more to say next week. But I really urge others to do their very best. I know there are people here, such as my colleague Senator F
EINSTEIN and oth-
ers, who have worked on this. 
I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
HIGHWAY AND TRANSPORTATION 
FUNDING ACT OF 2015 
Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consider-ation of Calendar No. 89, H.R. 2353. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 2353) to provide an extension of 
Federal-aid highway, highway safety, motor carrier safety, transit, and other programs 
funded out of the Highway Trust Fund, and for other purposes. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
further debate? 
The Senator from Illinois. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, is there 
going to be a unanimous consent re-quest made at this point? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Chair understands there will be. 
Mr. DURBIN. I will reserve the right 
to object at that point. 
Mr. President, in the interest of 
time—I know it is early in the morn-ing—I would like to make a statement. I am not going to object to proceeding to this measure, but I would like to 
make a matter of record what I am sure the Senator from South Dakota already knows: that absent our action at this moment, the Federal highway program authority will expire May 31. 
We have just spent the better part of 
the evening contemplating the expira-tion of important law relative to our national security, and we have not re-solved it. 
What is happening here, of course, is 
a request for a 60-day extension of the Federal highway program. I might say—and I am sure the Senator from South Dakota is well aware of this— this is the 33rd short-term extension of our Federal highway program. 
I think all of us understand that the 
program that once was considered to be the centerpiece of America’s infra-structure and its economy has now de-teriorated to the point where we are extending it for 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months at a time. Frankly, it does not serve our country and it doesn’t serve our economy. It is a reflection on the lack of leadership by those who have the authority in committees and in the House and Senate to propose a measure that becomes a long-term highway program. 
I just want to make it clear that in-
stead of enacting a 6-year transpor-tation program worthy of our great Na-tion, this Congress continues to limp along down a political highway of ex-cuses. It is coming to an end. 
There have been lengthy discussions 
in our Democratic caucus that these continued short-term extensions are unacceptable in this great Nation. And I would just say that although we will agree to this 60-day extension, we are serving notice on the majority leader in the Senate as well as the Speaker to do their job and to enact a law that provides the kind of infrastructure that could build America’s economy. 
So I will not object to this request, 
but notice is given that in this 60 days, it is time for this Congress to act. 
I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there 
is no further debate, the question is on the third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to a third read-
ing and was read the third time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill 
having been read the third time, the question is, Shall the bill pass? The bill (H.R. 2353) was passed. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Dakota. 
Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider be made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I sug-
gest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.

GIRLS COUNT ACT OF 2015 
Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consider-ation of Calendar No. 91, S. 802. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER pro tem-
pore. The clerk will report the bill by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 802) to authorize the Secretary of 
State and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Develop-ment to provide assistance to support the rights of women and girls in developing countries, and for other purposes. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill, which had been reported from the Committee on Foreign Relations, with an amend-ment to strike all after the enacting clause and insert in lieu thereof the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Girls Count Act 
of 2015’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: (1) According to the United States Census Bu-
reau’s 2013 international figures, 1 person in 12, or close to 900,000,000 people, is a girl or young woman age 10 through 24. 
(2) The Census Bureau’s data also illustrates 
that young people are the fastest growing seg-ment of the population in developing countries. 
(3) Even though most countries do have birth 
registration laws, four out of ten babies born in 2012 were not registered worldwide. Moreover, an estimated 36 percent of children under the age of five worldwide (about 230,000,000 chil-dren) do not possess a birth certificate. 
(4) A nationally recognized proof of birth sys-
tem is important to determining a child’s citizen-ship, nationality, place of birth, parentage, and age. Without such a system, a passport, driver’s license, or other identification card is difficult to obtain. The lack of such documentation can prevent girls and women from officially partici-pating in and benefitting from the formal eco-nomic, legal, and political sectors in their coun-tries. 
(5) The lack of birth registration among girls 
worldwide is particularly concerning as it can exacerbate the disproportionate vulnerability of women to trafficking, child marriage, and lack 
of access to health and education services. 
(6) A lack of birth registration among women 
and girls can also aggravate what, in many places, amounts to an already reduced ability to seek employment, participate in civil society, or purchase or inherit land and other assets. 
(7) Girls undertake much of the domestic labor 
needed for poor families to survive: carrying water, harvesting crops, tending livestock, car-ing for younger children, and doing chores. 
(8) Accurate assessments of access to edu-
cation, poverty levels, and overall census activi-ties are hampered by the lack of official infor-mation on women and girls. Without this rudi-mentary information, assessments of foreign as-sistance and domestic social welfare programs are difficult to gauge. 
(9) To help ensure that women and girls are 
considered in United States foreign assistance policies and programs, that their needs are ad-dressed in the design, implementation, and eval-uation of foreign assistance programs, and that women and girls have the opportunity to suc-ceed, it is important that girls be counted and have access to birth certificates and other offi-cial documentation. 
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States to— (1) encourage countries to support the rule of 
law and ensure girls and boys of all ages are able to fully participate in society, including by providing birth certifications and other official documentation; 
(2) enhance training and capacity-building in 
key developing countries, local nongovern-mental organizations, and other civil society or-ganizations, including faith-based organizations and organizations representing children and families in the design, implementation, and monitoring of programs under this Act, to effec-tively address the needs of birth registries in countries where girls are systematically under-counted; and 
(3) incorporate into the design, implementa-
tion, and evaluation of policies and programs measures to evaluate the impact that such poli-cies and programs have on girls. 
SEC. 4. UNITED STATES ASSISTANCE TO SUPPORT 
COUNTING OF GIRLS IN THE DEVEL-OPING WORLD. 
(a) A UTHORIZATION .—The Secretary and the 
Administrator are authorized to prioritize and advance ongoing efforts to— 
(1) support programs that will contribute to 
improved and sustainable Civil Registration and Vital Statistics Systems (CRVS) with a focus on birth registration; 
(2) support programs that build the capacity 
of developing countries’ national and local legal and policy frameworks to prevent discrimination against girls in gaining access to birth certifi-cates, particularly where this may help prevent exploitation, violence, and other abuse; and 
(3) support programs and key ministries, in-
cluding, interior, youth, and education min-istries, to help increase property rights, social security, home ownership, land tenure security, inheritance rights, access to education, and eco-nomic and entrepreneurial opportunities, par-ticularly for women and girls. 
(b) C
OORDINATION WITHMULTILATERAL ORGA-
NIZATIONS .—The Secretary and the Adminis-
trator are authorized to coordinate with the World Bank, relevant United Nations agencies and programs, and other relevant organizations to encourage and work with countries to enact, implement, and enforce laws that specifically collect data on girls and establish registration programs to ensure girls are appropriately counted and have the opportunity to be active participants in the social, legal, and political sectors of society in their countries. 
(c) C
OORDINATION WITHPRIVATE SECTOR AND  
CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS .—The Secretary 
and the Administrator are authorized to work with the United States, international, and local

private sector and civil society organizations to 
advocate for the registration and documentation of all girls and boys in developing countries, in order to help prevent exploitation, violence, and other abuses and to help provide economic and social opportunities. 
SEC. 5. REPORT. 
The Secretary and the Administrator shall in-
clude in relevant evaluations and reports to Congress the following information: 
(1) To the extent practicable, a breakdown of 
United States foreign assistance beneficiaries by age, gender, marital status, location, and school enrollment status. 
(2) A description, as appropriate, of how 
United States foreign assistance benefits girls. 
(3) Specific information, as appropriate, on 
programs that address the particular needs of girls.
