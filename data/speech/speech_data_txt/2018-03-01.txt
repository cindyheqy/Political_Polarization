EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will pro-ceed to executive session to resume consideration of the following nomina-tion, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of A. Marvin Quattlebaum, Jr., of South Carolina, to be United States District Judge for the District of South Carolina. RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER  
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-jority leader is recognized. 
MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR —H.R. 1865 
Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the desk due for a second reading. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill by title for the second time. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 1865) to amend the Commu-nications Act of 1934 to clarify that section 230 of such Act does not prohibit the enforce-ment against providers and users of inter-active computer services of Federal and State criminal and civil law relating to sex-ual exploitation of children or sex traf-ficking, and for other purposes. 
Mr. M CCONNELL. In order to place the bill on the calendar under the pro-visions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-tion having been heard, the bill will be placed on the calendar. 
REMEMBERING BILLY GRAHAM  
Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, yes-terday we welcomed the President, the Vice President, and the family of the late Reverend Billy Graham as he lay in honor in the Capitol. This is a very rare tribute—even rarer for an Amer-ican without government or military service—but it perfectly suits the re-markable man whose preaching in-spired millions worldwide, who coun-seled Presidents and world leaders across generations, and whom an entire nation came to know as America’s pas-tor. Billy Graham’s powerful preaching and his historic revivals brought so many closer to God because his work was not ultimately about him. ‘‘The se-cret of my work,’’ he explained, ‘‘is God. I would be nothing without him.’’ His personal strengths and talents were mighty, but it was his kindness, his hu-mility, and his total fidelity to faith and family that defined his life and his ministry. I am glad that Congress could honor the great Reverend Graham in this way. Yesterday, thousands—thou-sands—of Americans packed the Ro-tunda down the hall to pay their re-spects. All across the country, people are giving thanks for the extraordinary contributions of this good and faithful servant. TAX REFORM  
Mr. President, on another matter, it has been just over 2 months since the united Republican government deliv-ered historic tax reform to middle- class families all across the country. How is it working? We have all seen the national news. Walmart is giving raises or new benefits to more than 1 million hourly workers. Boeing is in-vesting $300 million in workforce devel-opment and corporate giving. Apple is bringing hundreds of billions of dollars back home. But no less important are the stories making front-page news in hometown newspapers all across our country. Thanks to tax reform in North Lima, OH, Sheely’s Furniture & Appliance is planning to issue $1,000 bonuses to full- time workers and expand the sales floor by 4,500 square feet. In Cushing, OH—population of 220 people—tax reform is allowing John Anfinson to give $1,000 bonuses and 5 percent pay raises to all of his employ-ees at the farm store that his grand-father founded in 1918, 100 years ago. ‘‘I work every day shoulder to shoul-der with everyone,’’ Mr. Anfinson ex-plained. ‘‘When you work every day with a group of people, you know them and their family. . . . They are the most valuable asset in any business.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES1296 March 1, 2018 
His customers will also likely be breathing easier. Tax reform is ena-bling farmers and ranchers across America to immediately expense the cost of important investments, and it is taking a big bite—a big bite—out of the death tax. Senators heard stories just like these during last week’s State work period. Just ask Senator T
OOMEY what tax re-form is doing in Pennsylvania. He stopped by New Hudson Facades, a manufacturer in Linwood. Tax reform enabled them to increase wages by 5 percent, and a partner company is con-tributing $3,000 to every factory work-er’s 401(k). How about in Montana? Senator D
AINES ’ trip across his State took him to Pacific Steel in Great Falls, where sales are up 25 percent—sales are up 25 percent—since tax reform passed. In West Virginia, Senator C
APITO  joined a roundtable at the Huntington Regional Chamber of Commerce. She heard from local business leaders about ‘‘increased optimism.’’ In Nevada, 90 percent of the small business owners Senator H
ELLER re-cently spoke with said they plan to raise wages, increase benefits, award bonuses, hire more workers, or invest in their operations. It is a shame our Democratic col-leagues still haven’t been able to ex-tract themselves from their lockstep opposition to this historic law. If they had gotten their way, none of this good news would have happened—none of it. Only one of the Senators from Pennsyl-vania voted for the law that is allowing that Linwood manufacturer to expand. Only one Senator from Ohio voted for the new law that is helping those work-ers in North Lima. Only one Senator from Nevada voted to give small busi-nesses the flexibility to invest more in their employees. Only one Senator from West Virginia and one Senator from Montana voted to take money out of Washington’s pocket and put it back in the pockets of the middle class. Every single Senate Democrat—every one of them—did all they could to block tax reform. Fortunately, every Republican voted to pass it. And be-cause Congress passed tax reform and the President signed it into law, work-ers and small business owners are al-ready reaping the benefits. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
GUN VIOLENCE  
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, on Fri-day, I visited Wilde Lake High School in Columbia, which is located in How-ard County, MD, between Washington and Baltimore. I wanted to talk to stu-dents about the tragic Valentine’s Day shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, FL, which left 17 students and faculty members dead. This is the deadliest high school shooting in American history. I went to Wilde Lake because one of their own teachers, Laura Wallen, was shot to death in September 2017, and her former boyfriend is now on trial for her murder. I was extremely impressed by the passion of these students. They had a great deal of interest in the subject matter; they were extremely articu-late; and they asked great questions. I found it extremely encouraging for the future of Howard County, MD, and this Nation. These students are rightfully concerned about their safety and the safety of their classmates. It has been 2 weeks since a disturbed young man invaded Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The reaction seems to be like clock-work after each shooting. There is bi-partisan shock, anger, and horror. Pre-dictably, the question comes out: Will this time be different? The answer for the Republican leaders in Congress has always been ‘‘no’’ as the outrage and call to act quickly falls back to NRA talking points versus reality. This time, the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and the students in Maryland and across the country are not taking ‘‘no’’ as the final word. This time, the survivors are leading the way and are speaking out in a forceful way like we have not heard before. Students like Ryan Deitsch, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, want to know why these stu-dents—the children—need to be the ones to speak out ‘‘just to save inno-cent lives,’’ he said. He wants to know why the adults cannot be the adults and do what is necessary to protect children. I think the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School have had a clear, articulate message that this carnage needs to stop. They want to feel safe in their schools again. Armed with their cell phones and their stories, they have taken up the banner of hashtag ‘‘never again’’ and are changing the face of this debate to make this country safer from gun vio-lence. Alex Wind, another survivor from Stoneman Douglas, laid out the larger problem of why students are mobi-lizing: We’re marching because it’s not just schools. It’s movie theaters, it’s concerts, it’s nightclubs. This kind of stuff can’t just happen. You know, we are marching for our lives, we’re marching for the 17 lives we lost. And we’re marching for our children’s lives and our children’s children and their chil-dren. 
So what can we do? There are several pieces of legisla-tion that are ready to go. The Demo-crats and some Republicans have been willing and ready to act. Leader M
CCONNELL could move any one of these bills right now. Let’s start by making it clear that weapons of war are not needed by civilians of any age. I have cosponsored S. 2095, the Assault Weapons Ban of 2017, offered by Sen-ator FEINSTEIN . This legislation would, one, ban the sale, manufacture, transfer, and impor-tation of military style assault weap-ons; two, ban any assault weapon that accepts a detachable ammunition mag-azine and has one or more military characteristics; three, ban magazines and other ammunition feeding devices that hold more than 10 rounds of am-munition, which allow shooters to quickly fire many rounds without needing to reload. The bill also requires a background check on any future sale, trade, or gifting of an assault weapon that is covered by the bill, and it prohibits the transfer of high-capacity ammunition magazines. It also bans bump fire stocks and other devices that allow semiautomatic weapons to fire at fully automatic rates. Congress should also pass the Background Check Expansion Act, S. 2009, which I have cosponsored and has been offered by Senator M
UR-
PHY. This bill would expand Federal back-ground check requirements to include the sale or transfer of all firearms by private sellers, just as licensed dealers are required to conduct checks for sales under the existing Brady Law. The bill requires background checks for the sales or transfers of all firearms from one private party to another even if either party is not a federally li-censed dealer. This requirement ex-tends to all unlicensed sellers whether they do business online, at gun shows, or out of their homes. According to a recent poll, a record 97 percent of those surveyed said that they support requiring background checks for gun buyers—97 percent. Why can’t we get this done? It is not a heavy lift. Americans are with us on this. We need to recognize that saving children’s lives is more important than the National Rifle Association. Congress also should ease restric-tions on gun violence research and pre-vention efforts by removing onerous re-strictions on the Centers for Disease Control research. We can improve States’ sharing of information with Federal databases that screen gun buy-ers. At a townhall last week, Senator R
UBIO, when questioned by an audience of students and parents from Stoneman Douglas, said that ‘‘the problems we are facing here today cannot be solved by gun laws alone.’’ With that, I agree, but these gun laws will make a dif-ference. Yes, there is no single solu-tion, but we should be united in our willingness to do what we can to save lives. I agree with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that we must devote more resources to mental health prior-ities to identify young people who may be about to cause harm to themselves or others.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1297 March 1, 2018 
Let’s attack this problem from mul-tiple directions. We cannot raise our hands in the air and give up because there is no one law that can solve the problem. Sitting on the sidelines is not an option when our children are being killed, sometimes by other children, and surrendering to the false logic that the problem is too big to address falls well short of what the American people deserve. We were sent here to our Na-tion’s Capitol to make the tough deci-sions and to do the right thing. I agree with Alex Wind that this problem we need to tackle is larger than simply school safety, but I would like to talk about that specifically for one moment. In an effort to turn the conversation away from an assault weapons ban or closing loopholes in background checks, the President decided to latch on to this idea that we should arm teachers and educators in our schools. We do not need, as President Trump has suggested, more guns in the schools, and we do not need teachers carrying guns. We do know that teach-ers are hired to teach, not to be secu-rity guards. Let’s listen to our educators and say no to this proposal. The answer to keeping guns and gun violence out of our schools is not to bring more guns into the school. The students I talked to at Wilde Lake High School in Co-lumbia, MD, understood that adding more guns would not help the situation and could lead to more problems in the schools themselves. They certainly want to see their buildings more se-cure, but we can do that through infra-structure improvements, technology, and school resource officers. Why are these things happening in the United States with such alarming frequency and not elsewhere around the world? Gun-related deaths unfold in tragic circumstances across this country daily, with more than 1,800 people killed by guns this year alone, according to the Gun Violence Archive, a not-for-profit group. Mass shootings often shine the spotlight on the United States and its position as a global outlier. The number of firearms available to American civilians is estimated to be around 310 million, according to the 2009 National Institute of Justice re-port. According to the Small Arms Survey, the exact number of civilian-owned firearms is impossible to pinpoint be-cause of a variety of factors, including arms that go unregistered due to ille-gal trade and global conflict. Esti-mates indicate that Americans own nearly half of the 650 million civilian- owned guns in the world today, which is nearly one gun for every man, woman, and child in the United States. Our Nation is well armed. India is home to the second-largest civilian firearm stockpile, estimated at 46 mil-lion. Americans own the most guns per person in the world, with about 4 in 10 saying they either own a gun or live in a home where there is a gun, according to the 2017 Pew Center study. Forty- eight percent of Americans said they grew up in a house with guns. Accord-ing to the survey, a majority—66 per-cent—of U.S. gun owners own multiple firearms. The No. 2 country in the world for the largest number of guns per capita is Yemen—a country that is in the throes of a 3-year-old civil war. They trail significantly behind us. They have 54 guns per 100 in Yemen; we have 88 guns per 100 in the United States. When it comes to gun massacres, the United States is an anomaly. There are more public mass shootings in America than in any other country in the world. The United States makes up less than 5 percent of the world’s population but holds 31 percent of global mass shoot-ers. In Australia, for example, four mass shootings occurred between 1987 and 1996. After those instances, public opinion turned against gun violence, and Parliament passed stricter gun safety laws. Australia hasn’t had a mass shooting since. Gun safety laws work. The public de-mands that we take action to make our communities safer. Gun homicide rates are about 25 times higher in the United States than in other developed countries. The United States has one of the highest rates of death by firearms in the devel-oped world, according to World Health Organization data. The calculations based on OECD data from 2010 show that Americans are 51 times more like-ly to be killed by gunfire than people in the UK. Most American gun owners say that a major reason they own a gun is for personal protection, according to the Pew study. However, the majority of firearms-related deaths are attrib-utable to self-harm. Gun-related sui-cides are eight times higher in the United States than in other high-in-come nations. Thinking of Stoneman Douglas High School, we all wonder out loud, what drove this young man to kill indiscriminantly? There is no one sin-gle reason, but that is no excuse for Congress and lawmakers in all of our States to remain frozen and fail to act to try to stop a future shooting from happening. If anything, it should be the impetus for us to move forward on many fronts and to take many actions to support our children and support our communities so more lives are not lost in such a violent way. We cannot allow the story of this shooting to end like all the others in recent history. We should have taken action after three students were killed and five wounded in December 1997 at a high school in West Paducah, KY. We should have taken action after two stu-dents opened fire on April 20, 1999, in Columbine High School in Littleton, CO, killing 12 classmates and a teacher and wounding 26 others. We should have taken action after a gunman fa-tally shot 32 people in a dorm and classrooms at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, VA, on April 16, 2007. Columbine, Virginia Tech—for a pe-riod, these names became a code for some of the worst killings in our his-tory. Nearly 5 years later, it happened again. Three students were killed and two wounded in a shooting on February 27, 2012, that started in a school cafe-teria in Chardon, OH, as students wait-ed for buses to other schools. Then there was Sandy Hook. I know we all remember a 20-year-old gunman, in De-cember of 2012, killing 20 first grade children and 6 educators inside Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, CT—elementary school students. These were first graders, for goodness’ sake, young children who should clearly have moved us to action. But no. The killings continued because the Repub-lican leadership has been unwilling to budge from the NRA-approved message. We have had bipartisan support for some of this legislation, as we do today, but too many are so afraid of the NRA response that they lose sight of the fact that children are being killed right before our eyes. On September 8, 2016, a 14-year-old girl died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after shooting and killing an-other female student at Alpine High School in West Texas. Just 20 days later, on September 28, a 6-year-old boy was fatally shot on the playground of Townville Elementary School in South Carolina by a 14-year- old boy who had just killed his father. Another child and a teacher were struck by bullets but survived. I know some of you are thinking: I haven’t heard about these shootings. That is a problem in and of itself. School shootings have become so com-monplace and so much a part of our lives that children dying in our schools may not make it into the paper. We might miss it. We cannot let this be-come commonplace. It cannot be the new norm. Another incident you may not have heard of happened last April. A gun-man opened fire in the special edu-cation classroom of his estranged wife at North Park Elementary School in San Bernardino, CA, killing her and an 8-year-old boy and wounding another child. In September of last year, in Rock-ford, WA, a 15-year-old boy was killed at Freeman High School and three fe-male students were wounded when au-thorities say another 15-year-old boy opened fire with a handgun. In December of last year, two stu-dents at Aztec High School in New Mexico were killed by a gunman dis-guised as a student. Barely a month ago, in January, 2 students were killed and 14 wounded by gunfire when a student opened fire be-fore classes began at Marshall County High School in West Kentucky. A 15- year-old—a 15-year-old—is being charged for this crime. This time, the survivors are speaking out in a forceful way like we have not

heard before. I think the students speaking out have had a clear, articu-late message that this carnage needs to stop. I am not sure I know any law-maker or American who would disagree with the idea that our students need to be safe in their schools. It means that we need to act—really act this time. Setting aside the outrageous idea of arming teachers, it has been heart-ening to see the President move in the direction of legislative solutions, such as expanding background checks and banning bump stocks. The devil is al-ways in the details, and we will see how far the President is willing to stray from the NRA and whether the Republican leadership will back the President or remain on the sidelines of protecting the American people and es-pecially our children. On that Valentine’s Day, February 14, when I heard about the shooting in Parkland, FL, my immediate reaction was horror, pain, and outrage. How could we allow this to happen yet again? Schools should be a safe harbor for our children, not a place of killing and terror. I was in my office thinking about how tragic this is, not only for those who were killed but for all the children who were there. I am as frus-trated as the people across this coun-try. I want to pass commonsense gun safety legislation. Why shouldn’t we get these military-style weapons off the streets? It is hard to know what will motivate the congressional leadership to bring up this issue, what will jar them to ac-tion. I want action. We may not solve the problem entirely, but we need to try. We need to do something. A new CNN poll released just this Sunday finds that 70 percent of Ameri-cans now back tougher gun laws. This is a huge jump from 52 percent after the tragic, horrific October shootings in Las Vegas. This number includes 49 percent of Republicans, which I think is encouraging. Saving lives should not be a partisan issue. Commonsense gun safety legislation should not be a par-tisan issue. Public opinion polls may not be per-fect, but they are generally helpful to show trends. Americans are getting it. It is time that we do. This trend to-ward protecting the American people, and especially our children, is moving in the right direction. The American people are letting their voices be heard on this issue. Thoughts and prayers might console the grieving for a moment, but action speaks louder and will have a lasting impact. From my hometown of Balti-more to the many towns across Amer-ica that have had their names in the headlines because of gun-related trage-dies or mass shootings, people are call-ing upon Congress to act. I don’t care what the reasons are for a change of heart, but let’s get bills on the floor. What we are proposing are logical next steps to address the deadly problem that has been festering in this country for too long. Too many young lives have been lost. Will this time be different? Mr. President, in honor of the vic-tims of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, I ask unanimous consent that their names be printed in the R
ECORD . There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows:

Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, to all the victims of gun violence who have preceded them, let’s make the answer a resounding yes. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Texas. 
TEXAS INDEPENDENCE DAY  
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this morning, I would like to start off speaking about a very important day in the history of my State, a day that inspires pride in the hearts of all those who were born in Texas. I am here to commemorate Texas Independence Day, which will be celebrated tomor-row. On March 2, 1836, Texas adopted its Declaration of Independence from Mex-ico. It is worth reading, and I would recommend it to anyone. This hap-pened in the context of a struggle that is perhaps best remembered by the Bat-tle of the Alamo, which laid some of the groundwork for Texans’ eventual victory. On February 24 of that year, with his position under siege, an important fig-ure named William Barret Travis wrote a letter, which I would like to read. He was a lieutenant colonel in the Texas Army, and during the battle, his fellow soldiers were outnumbered nearly 10 to 1 by the forces of the Mexican dictator Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna. Here in the Senate, both Republicans and Democrats have had the honor of read-ing the fabled Travis letter since 1961, when then-Texas Senator John Tower started that tradition. The letter was addressed ‘‘To the People of Texas & All Americans in the World.’’ Travis wrote: 
I am besieged, by a thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Anna—I have sus-tained a continual Bombardment & can-nonade for 24 hours & have not lost a man— The enemy has demanded a surrender at dis-cretion, otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the sword, if the fort is taken—I have an-swered the demand with a cannon shot, & our flag still waves proudly from the walls— I shall never surrender or retreat. Then, I call on you in the name of Liberty, of patri-otism & everything dear to the American character, to come to our aid, with all dis-patch—The enemy is receiving reinforce-ments daily & will no doubt increase to three or four thousand in four or five days. If this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as possible & die like a soldier who never forgets what is due to his own honor & that of his country—Victory or Death. Signed, ‘‘William Barret Travis.’’ What a letter it is. It is a reminder for all of us that the 189 defenders of the Alamo lost their lives, but they did not die in vain. In fact, Texans wouldn’t be around today if it weren’t for them. The Battle of the Alamo bought pre-cious time for the Texas revolution-aries, allowing General Sam Houston to maneuver his army into a position for the decisive victory at the Battle of San Jacinto. I would just note that I am honored to occupy the same Senate seat first occupied by Sam Houston when he became a U.S. Senator after Texas became annexed to the United States in 1845. With that victory at the Battle of San Jacinto, Texas became a sovereign nation—the Republic of Texas—for 9 years. For 9 years, it thrived as a sepa-rate nation, and then in 1845 it was an-nexed to the United States as the 28th State. Many Texas patriots who fought in the revolution went on to serve in the U.S. Congress—Sam Houston being one of them. Every single day, I am hon-ored to have the opportunity to serve 28 million Texans—a chance I wouldn’t have had without the sacrifices made by the brave men like William Barrett Travis 182 years ago. 
TAX REFORM  
Mr. President, on another matter, we have come a long way since the days of the Texas revolution, but Texas re-mains a place of optimism, fortitude, and dedication to worthy causes. It is also a bustling State, full of entre-preneurs, investors, and risk-takers who have created jobs and opportuni-ties for the people who live there. I would like to mention briefly two iconic companies that are showing their devotion to Texas in a much dif-ferent but important manner. In Tyler, they are spreading the good news of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the law we passed in December, which overhauled our Tax Code. For those not familiar with where Tyler is, it is out in East Texas. We sometimes refer to that as ‘‘behind the pine curtain.’’ The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act effects have been far-reaching. They have positively affected communities all across the country for the past 2 months, and Tyler is no exception. The first company I would like to mention is Greenberg Turkeys, a fam-ily-owned operation that sells the fa-mous Thanksgiving bird to around 200,000 customers each holiday season. Four generations of the Greenberg fam-ily have worked in the company since the 1940s, and its turkeys have been featured on Oprah Winfrey’s website as one of her favorite things—twice, in fact. As a result of the tax reforms we have passed, the company plans to re-furbish its plant and give hourly em-ployees a raise. Sam Greenberg, the president, said:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1299 March 1, 2018 
This is a really good deal for businesses. It pays to treat people right, and so we want to share this with our workers. 
I couldn’t have said it better myself. The second Tyler company I want to mention briefly is Don’s TV & Appli-ance. The staff there has more than 150 years of combined experience. It buys products direct from manufacturers at the lowest possible cost in order to pro-vide customers with prices that are competitive with national chain stores. Recently, the owner, Don Thedford, and his son Donnie announced they would give their employees raises in 2018, which they were not able to do for the past several years, and they would not have been able to do it but for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Thanks to those reforms, Don has been able to help out his employees to provide them more take-home pay, and I am sure they appreciate the extra money in their paycheck each pay period. They can use these savings to invest, to pay for their children’s education, prepare for their retirement, or whatever they find best. So I just wanted to say to Don and other small employers who are making sure their employees see the benefit of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reforms: Thank you for paying the savings for-ward. I can’t wait to continue to hear more stories like these two in the months ahead. 
FIX NICS BILL  
Mr. President, on a final note, I would like to bring up one last topic we have been discussing a lot this last week; that is, ways we can prevent mass shootings from happening in the future. Of course, the most recent one occurred at Parkland, FL, at Stoneman Douglas High School. Last fall, my State saw another in-sidious shooting at Sutherland Springs near San Antonio, TX. Twenty-six peo-ple lost their lives that day worship-ping in a small Baptist Church in Suth-erland Springs, and 20 more were wounded, including a 6-year-old boy named Ryland Ward, who was shot five times. We are ecstatic Ryland survived and is now out of the hospital and has gone home. What we all learned in the aftermath of that event is that sometimes these horrific crimes are perpetrated by indi-viduals who never should have been able to purchase firearms in the first place. That is because, under current law, convicted felons, like the gunman at Sutherland Springs, are prohibited from legally purchasing firearms. The problem was that his convictions were not uploaded in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, what is commonly referred to as the NICS system operated by the FBI. I have introduced a bill that has al-ready passed the House that would ad-dress this problem and, I believe, would save lives in the future. It is a bipar-tisan piece of legislation cosponsored by the junior Senator from Con-necticut. Senator M
URPHY , along with his colleague Senator B
LUMENTHAL , come from the State that saw the hor-rific killings at Sandy Hook. We added 10 new cosponsors just this week, bringing the total number to 50 cospon-sors for this legislation. In my experi-ence, it is rare to see a piece of legisla-tion enjoy such broad, bipartisan sup-port—50 cosponsors. I have been saying all week that we need to pass this bill now. We should not wait, we should not go home emp-tyhanded, and we should not have to face the grieving families who lost a child or a loved one as a result of a fu-ture shooting that might have been averted had we acted. America is tired of the government’s response to these catastrophes which rip families apart, take lives, and pit people against each other. The response of their govern-ment has been largely either silence or bickering with no outcome, no result. There are other proposals we can consider as we continue to grapple with the questions posed in Parkland—ques-tions about failures of local law en-forcement, social media platforms, and the FBI. Yesterday, the President hosted an amazing meeting of 17 Mem-bers of Congress on a bipartisan basis and brainstormed about other things we might be able to do, but right now— right now—fix NICS is our best and only option to act in response. It is supported by the President, the major-ity and minority leaders are cospon-sors, and it is supported by gun groups like the NRA and Everytown for Gun Safety, which are at opposite ends of the ideological spectrum when it comes to the Second Amendment. As I said, this bill has 50 cosponsors in the Sen-ate and is ready for action, having al-ready passed the House of Representa-tives. I pledged to myself, after my wife and I visited Sutherland Springs a week after the terrible shooting there and attended a church service led by the pastor who lost his 14-year-old daughter in that shooting just 1 week before—it was a gut-wrenching, emo-tional service, but it was inspiring in its own way. I pledged then that I would never face another grieving fam-ily with empty hands, saying we could have done something that might have saved your child’s life or your loved one’s life by fixing the broken back-ground check system. I pledged I would never face them again, saying we didn’t try our best to save lives in the future by passing commonsense, bipartisan legislation like the Fix NICS bill. As I said, there are other things we might do, but, as we all know, the threshold for actually passing legisla-tion is 60 votes. What I don’t want us to do is to end up like we did on the DACA debate, where we started with a neutral bill—a shell which really did nothing—and all of the various pro-posals failed to get 60 votes, so we ended up emptyhanded on the DACA issue. I don’t want that to happen again, and I am not going to go home and tell my constituents in Texas I didn’t do my very best to make sure we did something and something meaning-ful that would save lives in the future. Fix NICS is the best way to do that and do that now. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CAS-
SIDY). Without objection, it is so or-dered. 
GUN VIOLENCE  
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the tragedy in Parkland and the responsibilities of the Senate to try to make our commu-nities safer. I am going to talk very personally about my own experience in confronting gun violence as a mayor of an urban area, Richmond, VA, and as the Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia. I will start by saying, I am a gun owner. I am a Second Amendment sup-porter. When I was an attorney in pri-vate practice, I was the lawyer who worked with an effort to amend the Virginia constitution to guarantee Vir-ginians the right to hunt and fish. The Second Amendment and private gun ownership is an important part of our framework. I support it, but I obvi-ously believe that we can do things consistent with the Constitution that will make our Nation safer, and I ask my colleagues to join in that effort. When I was elected to the Richmond City Council in 1994, Richmond, at that time, was only on one top 10 list that I am aware of. It is not the one you want to be on. We had the second highest homicide rate in the United States. We were not a high-crime area generally, if you looked at all crime, but in homi-cides and aggravated assaults—assaults committed with weapons—we were un-usually high. The weapons of choice in these homicides and aggravated as-saults were guns. I remember very early in my time at the city council getting called to a neighborhood, Gilpin Court, which is a public housing community in my city council district. There had been a gun crime that killed an entire family of five—adults and little children. Over the course of my 8 years of working in local government, I went to too many crime scenes and funerals and wakes. In some ways, the things that were the most memorable were the meetings in church basements of the families of homicide victims. We embarked upon a set of strategies to make our communities safer. Amidst all the bloodshed and the tears, we ac-tually found strategies—some dealing with reductions in guns, some dealing with law enforcement strategies, some dealing with police and community re-lations. We found strategies that, over the course of about 8 years, reduced the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES1300 March 1, 2018 
homicide rate in Richmond by 60 per-cent and the aggravated assault rate by an equivalent number. Out of the pain, what we learned is you can actually take concrete steps that will make your community safer and that will reduce gun violence. You will not eliminate it. That is beyond our power as humble people to do, but you can reduce it. If you know you can, then you must. You have a responsi-bility to do what you can. I was elected Governor of Virginia in 2005, and I will never forget April 16, 2007. I had just embarked on a trade mission. I had landed in Japan with a delegation to recruit business to my State. I had gone to the hotel, and I got a call after midnight from my chief of staff, who said: There is a shooting under way at Virginia Tech. I said: Book me on the next flight home. I have been here for just a few hours on what was going to be a 2-week trade mission, but let me fly back home. I flew back to what, at the time, was the worst shooting in the history of the United States. In April of 2007, 32 peo-ple were gunned down on the campus of Virginia Tech by a deranged youngster who had been adjudicated mentally ill and dangerous and was thus prohibited from having a weapon. But because of glitches and flaws in the background check system, he had been able to pur-chase multiple weapons, and he com-mitted that horrible crime. I empaneled a commission. I told them: Let the lawyers and lawsuits be damned. I want to know everything that went wrong, and I want to make public everything that went wrong and everything we can do to fix it. Over the course of a number of months, they produced a report with hundreds of rec-ommendations. The recommendations were about campus safety. The recommendations were about mental health, but there were also recommendations about fixes to our State and Federal gun laws to reduce the risk of this happening. I was able to make some changes on my own as an executive. I took other changes to my legislature that they rejected. Again, out of the painful situation— and it is a funny thing to say about your own State, about my State of Vir-ginia, about a place I love like Virginia Tech—I always hoped it would be the worst. I had always hoped that would have been the worst shooting in the history of the United States, but the Pulse nightclub shooting and the Las Vegas shooting now have claimed more victims. Other shootings, like those in Newtown and now Parkland—if the number of victims aren’t the same, the tragedy is nevertheless of equal mag-nitude. We learn through pain that you can make changes and improve. When I fixed a piece of the background check system flaw, it made us safer. It re-duced the risk of gun violence and gun deaths. My experience as mayor and Gov-ernor were painful, but I learned a les-son in both, which is you can take steps, including steps dealing with the rules about firearms that will make your communities safer. That is a pow-erful thing. You can take steps that will make communities safer. I dealt with three lies—three false-hoods—over the course of these efforts as mayor and Governor, as I tried to help us take steps to make us safer. The first lie was it is not about guns. It is about mental health; it is about other things. But that is just false. Equally false would be if we said that it is only about guns. That would be false as well. To say it is not about guns is a lie perpetrated by an organi-zation headquartered in Virginia, the National Rifle Association. It turned out to be false. The key to reducing the homicide rate in Virginia ultimately was that we embraced strategies to reduce the gun carry rate. That is a phrase that law enforcement professionals use for the percentage of time where people, in normal interactions with the police, are found to be carrying a weapon. In Virginia, the gun carry rate was unusu-ally high, and that meant when some-thing broke bad or there was an argu-ment, there would often be an aggra-vated assault or homicide committed with a weapon. We undertook strate-gies that drove down the gun carry rate. That didn’t make bad people good people, but it made it more likely that when things broke bad, there wouldn’t be an aggravated assault or a homicide. So it was about the guns. That is the first lie or falsehood that gets per-petrated: It is not about guns. It is not only about guns, but it is definitely about guns. A second lie or falsehood perpetrated by the same organization is that they would always say: You can’t improve. They would say: That will not solve every problem. You can’t solve every bit of gun violence if you do this. They would say this over and over again with any shooting. They would point out the number of things that wouldn’t have stopped it, as if not being able to eliminate gun violence means that you shouldn’t do anything to try to reduce gun violence. That is just a lie or a falsehood. I have learned from my ex-periences that if you take steps, you can make communities safer. The third lie or falsehood we had to confront repeatedly from the National Rifle Association was that gun safety rules violate the Second Amendment. That is just flatout wrong. In fact, the Second Amendment is the only amend-ment whose text even uses the word regulation. The need for a well-regu-lated militia gives individuals the right to bear arms. What does the term ‘‘well-regulated’’ mean? It is not a reference to the length of somebody’s beard or the kind of hat they should wear. There is an understanding that firearms are dan-gerous, and if individuals are to have the right to have them, there also must need to be some appropriate level of regulation. We are familiar with this in the rest of the Constitution. I am passionate about the First Amendment. There should be freedom of the press, but you can’t just libel or slander without consequence. The Framers, Madison and others, who put these amendments together, under-stood that the amendments to the Con-stitution included some limitations be-cause we have to live together, not just as individuals who are free agents, but we have to live together in society. Those three lies—it is not about guns; we can’t do anything about it; and the gun rules violate the Second Amendment—are wrong. I came to the Senate after the shoot-ing in Sandy Hook. The first meaning-ful debate we had after I came here was whether we would do something to re-spond to this horrible carnage of kids in an elementary school. The Presiding Officer was not in the Senate. I know you followed this as a citizen. I remember standing here in this Chamber in April 2013, casting a vote on a bill that I thought would have been a very good bill to do back-ground record checks. We were sur-rounded in the Chamber by Sandy Hook families. Many of them were sit-ting next to Virginia Tech families who had come to be in solidarity with them. There was a feeling of despair, with them around, that was like the great cloud of witnesses referred to in the letter of Paul to the Hebrews. We fell short. They were praying for us to suc-ceed, and we fell short. In the after-math of that horrible tragedy, this body did precisely nothing. Well, now we have experienced yet another horrible tragedy. There have been others since Sandy Hook, but it is my deep hope that after this horrible shooting in Parkland, something may be different in this body. The reason I think this one might be different is that these students are standing up and challenging us. The children of our Na-tion are asking adults to be adults. They are asking us to look in the mir-ror. They posed the question starkly: What is more important to you, your children or campaign contributions from an interest group? I think the advocacy of the children of Parkland who suffer, not only their advocacy but the advocacy of students all over the United States—I have held meetings with Moms Demand Action in Richmond and Northern Virginia in the last couple of days, and many students were in these meetings. The advocacy of students and their challenge to us may show us a way. I will conclude with a story that gives me hope and that suggests there may be some resonance to this mo-ment. Sometimes there is a movement, but there isn’t a moment. Sometimes the movement needs a moment to achieve a victory. Fifty-five years ago, in the spring of 1963, Dr. Martin Luther King was try-ing to desegregate public accommoda-tions in Birmingham, AL, with the

Southern Christian Leadership Con-ference. He had been going from com-munity to community. In some places, they were able to desegregate public accommodations relatively easily. Other places were tough but none tougher than Birmingham. At drug stores and department stores, Dr. King and others would have adults go sit in—African Americans and their al-lies—and be arrested. Yet wave after wave of arrests notwithstanding, in-cluding the arrest of Dr. King, the city leaders would not back down. They would not shed the discrimination that violated the equality provisions of the Constitution. As this was going on, children in the Birmingham schools started to come to Dr. King and say: We want to march too. Dr. King and his lieutenants really struggled with this. They were parents. They didn’t want their kids to be ar-rested. They didn’t want their kids to face guard dogs attacking them. They didn’t want their kids to face firehoses directed at them. They had a natural parental reaction: We are going to do this; we want to protect you. But the children kept coming and saying: We want to march too. Finally, they said: Isn’t this about us? As much as it is about adults, isn’t this about us, your children? And if it is about your children, why can’t we march? Dr. King, after a lot of prayer and discussion, finally said: It is about you. Mr. President, you know this, and for our pages especially, it was those chil-dren advocating—and they marched, and they did have firehoses turned on them, and they did have guard dogs re-leased on them. The photos of those children braving that ugly face of dis-crimination landed on the front pages of papers all over the United States and all over the world, and it was transformative of the civil rights movement. Adults in the Untied States knew there was discrimination, but they had become complacent to it or indifferent to it or had even said: I think it is wrong, but it will probably never change. But their children demanded of them: Adults, just be adults. Adults, you say you care about children; prove to us you care about children. And when the adults of America were con-fronted with the example of their own young people, they had to shake them-selves out of their complacency and in-difference and shoulder the burden that adults must shoulder. That is what these students at Park-land are saying to us now. That is what these students all over the country are saying to us now. They are saying: This is about our future. This is about your children. And they are asking us whether children matter more or polit-ical contributions matter more. I urge my colleagues, finally, let’s not produce another goose egg in this body. Let’s not come together after a horrible tragedy—when there are meaningful steps, such as background record checks, that we can put on the table to make us safer—and fail them yet again. I ask my colleagues and especially the majority leader to enable us to have this debate on the floor so that we can take meaningful steps of the kind that we know will make our commu-nities safer. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Vermont. 
YEMEN WAR POWERS RESOLUTION  
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, there should be no issue of more importance to Members of Congress than the issue of war and peace and when it is appro-priate to send the young people of our country into harm’s way, knowing that some of them will not return home alive. It goes without saying that every armed conflict the United States of America is engaged in must be con-sistent with the Constitution of the United States and be lawful. Let’s make no mistake about it—ar-ticle I, section 8 of the Constitution states in no uncertain terms that ‘‘Congress shall have the power to . . . declare war.’’ The Founding Fathers gave the power to declare war to Con-gress because Congress is that body most accountable to the people. For far too long, Congress—under Democratic and Republican adminis-trations—has abdicated its constitu-tional role in authorizing war. The time is long overdue for Congress to re-assert its constitutional authority. If you think that a military intervention makes sense, then let’s have that de-bate on the floors of the Senate and the House and cast a vote. But that is not what we have been seeing for a number of years. What Senator L
EEand Senator M UR-
PHYand I are doing with privileged res-olution S.J. Res. 54 is demanding that Congress once again take its constitu-tional responsibility for war and peace seriously. I thank Senators D
URBIN , W
ARREN , and B OOKER for coming on board that resolution. I hope this bi-partisan resolution will gain more and more support in the coming days. Many Americans are unaware that the people of Yemen are suffering today in a devastating civil war, with Saudi Arabia and their allies on one side and Houthi rebels on the other. In November of last year, the United Nations emergency relief coordinator said that Yemen was on the brink of ‘‘the largest famine the world has seen for many decades.’’ So far, at least 10,000 civilians have died, 3 million have been displaced, and over 40,000 have been wounded in this war. Fifteen million people lack access to clean water and sanitation. More than 20 million people in Yemen—over two- thirds of that country’s population— need some kind of humanitarian sup-port, with nearly 10 million in acute need of assistance. More than 1 million suspected cholera cases have been re-ported—1 million cholera cases have been reported—representing poten-tially the worst cholera outbreak in world history. Many Americans probably are not aware that U.S. forces have been ac-tively engaged in support of the Saudis in this terrible war, providing intel-ligence and aerial refueling of planes whose bombs have killed thousands of people and made this crisis far worse. We believe—and I speak for Senator LEEand Senator M URPHY —that as Con-gress has not declared war or author-ized military force in this conflict, U.S. involvement in Yemen is unconstitu-tional and unauthorized, and U.S. mili-tary support of the Saudi coalition must end. Without congressional au-thorization, our engagement in this war should be restricted to providing desperately needed humanitarian aid and diplomatic efforts to put an end to this terrible conflict. That is why yes-terday we introduced a joint resolution pursuant to the 1973 War Powers Reso-lution calling for an end to U.S. sup-port for the Saudi war in Yemen. The War Powers Resolution defines the introduction of U.S. Armed Forces to include ‘‘the assignment of members of such armed forces to command, co-ordinate, participate in the movement of, or accompany the regular or irreg-ular military forces of any foreign country or government when such mili-tary forces are engaged, or there exists an imminent threat that such forces will become engaged, in hostilities.’’ That is from the War Powers Resolu-tion. Assisting with targeting intel-ligence and refueling warplanes as they bomb those targets clearly meets this definition. This is not a partisan issue. Support for the Saudi intervention in Yemen began under a Democratic President and has continued under a Republican one. Senator L
EEis a conservative Re-publican. I am a progressive Inde-pendent who caucuses with the Demo-crats. In November of last year—and it is important that Members of the Senate hear this—the U.S. House of Represent-atives, by a vote of 366 to 30, passed a nonbinding resolution stating that U.S. involvement in the Yemen civil war is unauthorized. Every Member of the Democratic leadership voted for this. Democratic Leader N
ANCY PELOSI  voted for it. Minority Whip S
TENY  H
OYER voted for it. The ranking mem-ber of the House Foreign Affairs Com-mittee, E
LIOT ENGEL , voted for it, as did the Republican chairman of that committee, E
DROYCE . Here is the bottom line: If the Presi-dent or Members of Congress believe that support for this war is in the U.S. interest and that we should be involved in it, then let them come to the floor of the House and Senate, make their case, and then let’s have a vote. I believe we have become far too comfortable with the United States en-gaging in military interventions all over the world. We have now been in

Afghanistan for nearly 17 years—the longest war in American history. Our troops are now in Syria under what I believe are questionable authorities, and the administration has indicated that it may broaden that military mis-sion even more. The time is long overdue for Congress to reassert its constitutional role in determining when and where our coun-try goes to war. I am very proud to be working with Senators L
EE, MURPHY , and others on this vitally important issue. Thank you very much. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from New York. 
GUN VIOLENCE  
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the mass murder in Florida this month, and I rise to ask a simple question that millions of Amer-icans in every part of this country are asking at their kitchen tables right now: Is Congress finally going to do anything meaningful about gun vio-lence? When will enough be enough? What will it take for this body to move beyond the same talking points that we hear after every mass shooting and actually do something to prevent more deaths? Will Congress finally see what the vast majority of Americans see— gun owners and non-gun owners alike— that America’s gun problem isn’t going away unless Congress musters up the courage to take it head-on, or will Con-gress continue to give the lipservice of thoughts and prayers and then do abso-lutely nothing? We have to act because once again there was a massacre on American soil. Once again it was inside a school. Once again American children were gunned down. We keep living through a night-mare of gun violence that repeats itself in schools, movie theaters, churches, nightclubs, concerts, and every single day on the streets of cities in every State around this country—Sandy Hook, Aurora, Charleston, San Bernardino, Orlando, Las Vegas, Suth-erland Springs, and most recently, Parkland, FL. We can help stop this. We have the power to help stop this. The question is whether Congress has the political will to do it, whether this institution will finally put families first, our children first, and stand up to the gun manufac-turers and the NRA. I urge every Member of Congress to reflect on why they first ran for office. We are here as public servants to serve the people who sent us here, not to serve the gun industry’s profits, not to serve the organizations and companies and lobbyists who demand political ret-ribution when we do the morally right thing. Does Congress have the will to act? Does Congress have the basic cour-age this country needs? I am sorry to say, I don’t know, but we can put it to the test. There has been a lot of talk—more than normal even—about our need to act in this Chamber. So I will say this to my colleagues: Let’s make this time different. Let’s listen to the children from Stoneman Douglas High School. Let’s seize this moment. Let’s take ac-tion. I implore my colleagues to listen to what the country is saying about gun violence today, listen to the families, listen to the survivors from Parkland and tune out all the other noise. I did. It is possible. Ten years ago, I had an A rating from the NRA, just like many of my col-leagues today, but then I met the mother of Nyasia Pryear-Yard. Then I met her classmates. Nyasia was an honor student from Brooklyn. She was dancing with her friends, having fun, loving life. She was killed by a stray bullet in her community. Now I have an F rating from the NRA. I don’t understand how, after meet-ing with all of these families, after meeting with all of these children whose lives have been destroyed and torn apart by gun violence—I don’t un-derstand how any public servant would not vow to do what is necessary to make sure it never happens again. It is what we do after a terrorist at-tack, rightfully so. It is what we do as a country. We come together. We say never again, and we do whatever it takes to protect our country. We have to have the very same sense of urgency now. Plain and simple, it is a lie to say we have to choose between protecting law- abiding gun owners’ rights and pro-tecting our children from being mur-dered by assault rifles. It is a false choice to say we cannot end gun vio-lence without violating people’s con-stitutional rights. It is time for Mem-bers of Congress to stand up for what is right for America and do what is right for our communities, and say no to the NRA. I commend one of our colleagues in the House of Representatives—a Re-publican from Florida and an Army veteran—who is seeing this crisis dif-ferently now too. He wrote: 
I know that my community, our schools, and public gathering places, are not made safer by any person having access to the best killing tool the Army could put in my hands. I cannot support the primary weapon I used to defend our people, being used to kill chil-dren I swore to defend. 
That is what leadership looks like. I implore my colleagues in the Sen-ate to see our gun violence problem dif-ferently. See it with your heart. See it for what it is. It is a matter of national security, of public health, of public safety that will never go away unless Congress does its job. So, once and for all, let’s pass laws that actually are meaningful, that ac-tually can do something, not just something simple so we can say we did something and move on. I strongly agree with my colleagues that we need to improve the mental health system. Let’s make those investments, but it should not stop there. We have to address the fact that we have weapons of war on our streets today. We have to address the fact that it is so easy for people to buy a gun— people who should never have that privilege. Let’s vote to ban semiauto-matic assault rifles. Congress has already banned fully automatic weapons. Congress has al-ready recognized that some weapons have no place in the civilian world, and a weapon of war that was designed for military use, that can fire up to 100 rounds in 1 minute or 100 rounds if you just add a bump stock, a weapon that can completely outgun a police officer has no place in the civilian world. Will my colleagues vote with me to ban semiautomatic assault rifles? Then, let’s vote to ban the high-ca-pacity magazines that go with them. They are made for wars; they are not made to be in our schools, not in our cities. High-capacity magazines let killers fire dozens of rounds without having to frequently stop and reload. They are designed to let someone fire bullets at as many people as possible in the shortest amount of time. Let’s vote to ban high-capacity mag-azines, and let’s vote to pass universal background checks. That is something that is so commonsense, so obvious. Too many people who should not get their hands on these weapons are easily able to get them, and there are so many loopholes that allow people to buy semiautomatic assault rifles on-line, where there are no background checks. They allow people to buy semi-automatic assault rifles at gun shows, where there are no background checks. It simply doesn’t make sense that every person who buys a firearm doesn’t go through a basic background check system. Do you know who agrees with that? Ninety-seven percent of the American people. I can’t think of any other issue where there is such near- universal agreement across our entire population. So let’s do what our constituents are demanding from us—not what the NRA is demanding from us—and vote to pass universal background checks. When we do it, let’s make sure the effort is actu-ally sincere. If we are only voting on universal background checks, when it is tied to the issue of concealed carry reciprocity, then that is not a sincere attempt to fix our broken background check system. If Congress is saying we will only pass universal background checks if we pass a new law that says a stranger from one State has to be al-lowed into my State or your State when he has a gun hidden under his jacket, that is an insult to 97 percent of the American people who want Con-gress to pass universal background checks now. Then, let’s finally vote to overturn the outrageous law that has banned the Centers for Disease Control from even studying the issue of gun deaths. The CDC can study any other cause of death—heart disease, cancer, car crash-es, plane crashes—unless it involves a gun. Don’t you think it is strange that when we debate this issue, the two

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1303 March 1, 2018 
things related to gun violence that Congress has actually banned in recent years are research—research on gun vi-olence—and a ban on the ATF from using computers to keep records? Let’s vote to allow the CDC to conduct re-search on gun violence so we can fi-nally have the information and the data we need to fight gun violence as effectively as possible. Let’s also pass a law that finally makes gun trafficking a Federal crime. Over and over again, law enforcement officers keep finding illegally obtained guns being used in crimes. Numerous NYPD officers have been killed by guns that were illegally obtained by crimi-nals, and there is literally no Federal law to stop someone from loading his truck with guns in Georgia, driving up I–95, and selling them in a parking lot in the Bronx directly to criminals and gang members. I have a bill that would make this il-legal. It is called the Hadiya Pendleton and Nyasia Pryear-Yard Gun Traf-ficking and Crime Prevention Act. It is bipartisan, because both parties agree that gun trafficking is a source of gun violence in our cities. This bill is named after Nyasia, whom I mentioned earlier, and another teenager from Chicago who was also killed by a stray bullet. Both guns in those crimes were trafficked. So let’s pass this bill and finally make gun trafficking a Federal crime. If we are not trying to solve this problem now, then we are failing as elected leaders. Congress must solve America’s gun violence crisis now. It is urgent. Our country is demanding it. Americans deserve more from Congress than just banning bump stocks, just fixing NICS, which, while I strongly support both of them, will not do enough on their own. So let us not fail our country again. I would like to ask our colleagues to immediately vote to ban semiauto-matic assault rifles and bump stocks, to pass a universal background check system and close all of the loopholes, to allow the CDC to research gun vio-lence as a cause of death, to close the gun show loophole, and to finally make gun trafficking a Federal crime. I yield the floor. Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, it was 2 weeks ago yesterday that the tragic in-cident in Parkland took place—one of many that have impacted our country over the last decade and beyond. That community in Parkland, FL, and the residents of the State of Florida whom I represent—and, frankly, the entire Nation—have demanded not just action but immediate action. We know—and anyone who watches this process is well aware—that there are deep differences on how far and how much we should restrict the Second Amendment right of every American. We know there are deep differences about whether some of those proposed restrictions work. I imagine those de-bates and those differences will not be easily resolved and will continue, but I also know there is widespread support and agreement that we must act now— as soon as possible—to do everything we can to prevent another tragedy like Parkland from happening anywhere else ever again. That is a consensus po-sition. No matter where one falls on this debate, no matter how one feels about how far or how restricted restric-tions on gun sales in America should be, no matter what your views are on that, I don’t know of anyone who is in favor of school shootings, and I don’t know anyone who is in favor of seeing another one happen. There is common ground in that regard. What I have tried to do, over the last couple of weeks, is undertake efforts to determine what changes in Federal law not only could have prevented this at-tack but could prevent future ones. In that vein, I have met with State and Federal law enforcement investigators involved not just in this case but in gun laws in general. I have met with students and with teachers from Mar-jorie Stoneman Douglas High School, including two teachers who were in-jured in the attack. I have met with school board administrators. I have met with the community at large, in-cluding an appearance last week at a nationally televised townhall. I have been in contact with several of the par-ents of the victims who lost their lives. I have also spoken to experts in fire-arm sales. I have spoken to a number of federally licensed firearm dealers who talked about some of the frustra-tions they have with our existing law and their inability to address people who ultimately turn out to be individ-uals who should not own any gun of any kind. So based on these meetings, based on all of this input, and based on all of the other research that is out there leading up to now, the first thing I want to say is, I actually believe this attack could have and should have been prevented if current law had been fully enforced. This killer was a well-known danger to the school district. He was a well- known danger to the Broward Sheriff’s office. He was a well-known danger to his neighborhood. He was also the sub-ject of two separate and specific warn-ings to law enforcement agencies: a call to the Broward Sheriff’s office last November, a call to an FBI hotline in January. In essence, we are always telling peo-ple, if you see something, say some-thing. People saw something and peo-ple said something and other people saw it as well over a course of time. Yet somehow this deranged and violent individual was able to pass a back-ground check and purchase not 1 but 10 separate firearms, and this deranged and violent individual was ultimately able to walk right into the school a few minutes before dismissal and take the lives of 17 innocent Floridians. This tragedy is the result of a mas-sive multisystemic failure—a failure involving Federal agencies, State agen-cies, and local authorities who all failed to both identify the threat he posed and coordinate a response to stop him before he took action. It is this failure I hope we will focus on by ad-dressing the shortcomings and vulnera-bilities in our current laws and in our current policies. We may still have a debate on the broader issues of regu-lating gun sales, but irrespective of that debate, we still must and should do this. So today I wanted to come here for a few minutes and announce a com-prehensive plan—not a simple bill you just vote on and move on but a series of measures I believe could prevent these attacks before they happen and that also help schools protect their students and their teachers. I believe these ideas should all enjoy bipartisan support, and, if passed, could and should help prevent the next potential mass shooting. These are ideas I outline not just be-cause they work, but because I believe we can get the votes to pass them. Sixty votes in the Senate, a majority in the House, and the signature of a President—that is what it takes to turn an idea into a law, and these ideas I am about to outline both work and, I believe, could enjoy that widespread support. One of the things we have learned is, our schools are woefully unprepared to prevent an attack before it occurs. Furthermore, during my visits to the site of the attack and my followup meeting with teachers at the school, I learned of various changes to school fa-cilities and practices which could have stopped this attack or improved the re-sponse. Therefore, I will be joining later today with Senator O
RRIN HATCH  and others in introducing the STOP School Violence Act. If passed, this law would provide Fed-eral grants to do some important things that would have been really helpful in this case: strengthen school security infrastructure of the school, provide school training for everyone— administrators, teachers, even stu-dents—to be able to identify threats and to report them. Something that really would be helpful is the creation of a school threat assessment and crisis intervention team. There is a success-ful program in Los Angeles that does this. That is a team that is a coordina-tion between law enforcement, other State agencies, school districts and the like where they are all talking to each other about students and former stu-dents who may pose a threat of vio-lence and intervene before they act. A second issue we identified is that even if law enforcement, school admin-istrators, or family members believe an individual poses the risk of committing an act of violence, they have very few options to prevent them from pur-chasing any gun or taking away the guns they already have.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES1304 March 1, 2018 
Therefore, I intend to present a new law—perhaps in coordination with oth-ers who are working on it now—that will lead to the creation of gun vio-lence restraining orders, something that will give law enforcement and close family members the option of ob-taining a court order to prevent gun sales or remove guns from individuals who pose a threat. To be clear, the due process in such a situation would be on the front end, not on the back end. The third issue we uncovered is, Fed-eral law appears to discourage school systems from reporting dangerous stu-dents to law enforcement. I don’t sup-port criminalizing all school mis-conduct, but a student who has threat-ened violence, who has exhibited vio-lent behavior needs to be reported to law enforcement. A student who has committed a crime by issuing a threat of death using social media—a crime under Florida law—that needs to be re-ported, but under Broward County school policies, pursuant to something called the PROMISE Program, report-ing a student, a dangerous one, to law enforcement is the sixth step—step 6— in their plan. Therefore, I intend to propose changes to the Federal Youth PROMISE Program so a school district plan under this program does not delay and does not discourage law enforce-ment from being alerted to dangerous and violent or hazardous behavior. Fourth, we need to strengthen back-ground checks. That is why I have joined with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle pushing for the imme-diate passage of Fix NICS—something that will require all Federal agencies and incentivize every State to fully re-port relevant information to the na-tional background check database—be-cause a background check is only as good as the information that is on it. This deranged killer was able to buy guns on 10 separate occasions because he would have passed any background check because none of this stuff that was known about him was reported to that system. Fifth, we must begin to prosecute the purchase of guns by people prohibited from doing so. Next week, I hope to be joining a bipartisan group, led by Sen-ators T
OOMEY and C OONS , in filing the ‘‘Lie and Try’’ bill, which will require the FBI to notify States when someone who is not allowed to buy a gun, tries to buy a gun and fails the background check, so they can be investigated, so they can be prosecuted. In addition, we will be presenting a new law to provide more prosecutors to go after straw purchases, which is where someone buys a gun on behalf of someone else because that someone else could not pass the background check. Now, there are some additional re-forms that I am open to: the possibility of looking at age limits on semiauto-matic rifles, the notion of looking at what could be done with high-capacity magazines. We will continue to explore and look at those. These reforms do not enjoy the sort of widespread sup-port in Congress that the other meas-ures I have announced do, and, in order to successfully pass, these ideas will have to be crafted in a way that actu-ally contributes to greater public safe-ty but also do not unnecessarily or un-fairly infringe on the Second Amend-ment right of all law-abiding adults to protect themselves and their families, to hunt, or to participate in rec-reational shooting. Ultimately, there are things we can do that have widespread, bipartisan support that we can act on, that we can get passed, that will actually make a difference. These are impactful things. I urge the Senate and the House, all of my colleagues here, do not hold hos-tage a piece of legislation that would work and that we all support because it doesn’t have everything you want. There are things we can act on and do, and there are things we can continue to argue over, debate, and perhaps do in the future, but on the things we agree on—and they happen to be things that could have prevented this attack and will prevent future attacks—let’s get those done. I have outlined those here today. There may be others, but we owe it not just to the victims and the families of Parkland but to all Americans everywhere; for this attack may have happened in Southern Flor-ida, but there is no reason it can’t hap-pen somewhere else and, I fear, will happen somewhere else if we do not fix the deficiencies and the flaws in our policies, in our laws, and in the way they are enforced. We have learned from this incident what is wrong with our system. Let us fix it. We have an opportunity to do so while we continue to debate and work on the issues we do not agree on. That is what I hope we will do, and that is what I commit to doing everything I can to achieve. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.

IRAN LEGISLATION  
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, this Chamber is familiar with deadlines and has a habit of running up against them. We cannot lose sight of May 12, the deadline when President Trump will make a decision about sanctions on Iran. In January, the President waived sanctions for the last time, calling on Congress to ‘‘either fix the deal’s disas-trous flaws, or the United States will withdraw.’’ We now have less than 3 months—a period in which bipartisan consensus on the issue of Iran is abso-lutely necessary. To reimpose sanctions would effec-tively signal the end of America’s par-ticipation in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the JCPOA, an agree-ment better known as the Iran nuclear deal. The plan is flawed, and we cannot fix it without action. I ask my colleagues for cooperation and collaboration so that we can act in the national interest and prevent the nefarious aims of the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism. When it comes to Iran, we must put aside our differences and work together on a bi-partisan bill. I know that the chairman of the For-eign Relations Committee, Senator CORKER , has been working with Sen-ator C
ARDIN on this issue. Their efforts are commendable and necessary. Let me stress again that this effort must be bipartisan. One-sided legisla-tion would signal division and weak-ness on the issue of Iran. A partisan bill would also undermine our diplo-matic efforts with the P5+1 countries to improve the JCPOA through a sup-plemental agreement. I am confident we can do our part. First, Congress has repeatedly dem-onstrated its support for countering Iran’s malign activities. Second, Presi-dent Trump has laid out a clear road map for legislation that he would sign. Finally, this President has the will to walk away. He has made this promise, and I believe he will keep it. Let me explore these three points in turn. No. 1, we have a long history of acting in an overwhelmingly bipartisan fashion on this issue. Last August, the President signed the Countering Amer-ica’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. The legislation included tough new sanctions on Iran’s ballistic mis-sile program, on its sponsorship of ter-rorism, and its human rights abuses. The Senate approved it by a vote of 98 to 2, and it earned a vote of 419 to 3 in the House—bipartisan majorities. We also passed by voice vote Senator R
UBIO and Senator S HAHEEN ’s bill to crack down on illicit financing for Iran’s client Hezbollah. The House companion also passed by a voice vote. We have a blueprint for what to do. The President has outlined four pro-posals addressing critical flaws in the nuclear deal. One of those proposals is that Iran allow anytime, anywhere inspections. Currently, Iran is blocking inter-national inspectors from accessing military sites, such as the Parchin fa-cility. Inspectors also have to follow elaborate rules even to request and re-ceive access, despite Iran’s long history of concealment and deception. If Iran has nothing to hide, then it has no rea-son to object to anytime, anywhere in-spections. Second, the bill would ensure that Iran never comes close to getting a nu-clear weapon. The current nuclear deal attempts to keep Iran 1 year away from breakout—the point at which Iran

can rapidly develop a nuclear capa-bility. One year is not much of an in-surance policy, especially against the top state sponsor of terrorism. The bot-tom line is that Tehran should never come close to a nuclear weapon. Third, the bill needs to maintain re-strictions in perpetuity. The so-called sunset clauses are perhaps the most flawed part of the nuclear agreement. The way it currently reads, Iran does not need to cheat. They can simply wait us out. The conventional weapons ban sunsets in 2020. The ban on receiv-ing ballistic missile assistance sunsets in 2023. The ban on replacing old cen-trifuges with advanced models sunsets in 2026. And all nuclear restrictions— on centrifuges, on enrichment facilities and levels, and on heavy water produc-tion—sunset in 2031. The sunset clauses do not stop Iran but kick the can down the road—a road ending in just over a decade. Finally, the bill cannot overlook the connection between Iran’s ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs. The legislation must severely sanction the ballistic missile program. This is another no-brainer. A nuclear warhead is effective to the extent that it can be launched on a missile. Iran is not de-veloping long-range and sophisticated ballistic missiles to deliver conven-tional payloads. The architects of the Iran deal, unfortunately, took great pains to keep it focused solely on nu-clear. That has to end. These four demands constitute a sen-sible framework for the kind of bipar-tisan legislation that Congress can achieve. The final reason for my cautious op-timism is that we have a President who keeps his promises. When President Trump calls May 12 the last chance, I take him seriously. I would encourage my colleagues to do the same. This President is dead serious about coun-tering Iran’s agenda. He said that he would decertify the deal last October. He followed through. That should have erased any doubts. We should not wait until the elev-enth hour to deal with this issue. It is too important. By putting aside per-sonal or political feelings, we can abso-lutely achieve a bipartisan bill that fixes the Iran deal using the Presi-dent’s framework. Thank you. I yield the floor.

CONGRATULATING TEAM USA AND THE  
MINNESOTA OLYMPIC ATHLETES  
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Team USA and to recognize the contributions of so many Minnesotans at the 2018 Olym-pic Winter Games in South Korea. I am happy to be joined here by my Senate colleague from Minnesota, Sen-ator S
MITH. Why are Senator S MITH and I here today? We are here because we had an incredible Olympics, with Minnesota really leading the way when it came to the gold medals. Of course, our State is no stranger to the Olympics. We have sent athletes to compete in women’s basketball and cy-cling. But it shouldn’t be a surprise that it is the Winter Olympics where the bold northern State really shines. We have a couple of things going for us. The weather is kind of cold. There is snow, so people are able to practice. We also have a great athletic program at our high schools, and we have a lot of team spirit, which is especially helpful in the teams we were a part of that won the gold, including men’s curling and women’s hockey. Of the 243 athletes who were on Team USA, 23 have ties to Minnesota, mak-ing it the third highest represented State. These athletes competed at the highest level and showed the world just what our State could do. If Minnesota were competing as a country, it would be tied for 12th, globally in the number of gold medals won. But we are not a country; we are a proud State. This success is something all Minnesotans can celebrate. Mr. President, here are some exam-ples for you. Winning a gold medal was a first for Afton native Jessie Diggings and a first for the United States. Her road to the Olympics started on the cross-country skiing trails that cover Minnesota. Jessie worked to keep spir-its high in training and during the Olympic competition. She put glitter on her cheeks as a reminder of what made her fall in love with cross-coun-try skiing as a little girl. Her relent-less energy and drive were on full dis-play. She and her teammate, Kikkan Randall, became the first Americans to bring home a gold in cross-country team history. It is no surprise that they voted Jessie to be the flag-bearer for the closing ceremony. Jessie and Kikkan weren’t the only American women to bring home gold. The women’s hockey team won their first gold medal since 1998. It is no coincidence that the ‘‘State of Hockey’’ sent some serious talent. The American team included six cur-rent or former Gopher College players and two current or former Minnesota Duluth players. From Warroad to Minnetonka, the Minnesotans on Team USA brought pond hockey toughness and the experience that comes from growing up on the ice. This gold medal will help inspire the next generation of hockey players in Minnesota. I want to make a special note of our incredible goalie, Maddie Rooney. If anyone stayed up—which I did—to watch that shootout at the end, she showed such poise and such grace under pressure. I also want to make a little note of Warroad, MN, which produced the in-credible Gigi Marvin, along with many other gold medalists from the past. While Americans were fans of hockey well before the 2018 games, these Olym-pics helped introduce the country to a sport already loved by so many Min-nesotans—curling. I will note that Sen-ator C
ORNYN of Texas sent out a tweet saying that curling was an obscure sport. I don’t think anyone thinks that anymore. They might think it is kind of an interesting sport, but it has gone from obscure to cool. A lot of that has to do with the men’s curling team. Four out of five of the members of that team were from our home State of Min-nesota. In that game, the match went from 1 to 4 in the morning or midnight to 3. I can’t tell you how many Min-nesotans were up all night watching that and celebrating the gold medal. The success of Minnesotans has been inspiring, and I know Senator SMITH agrees. From frozen ponds to backyard hills, Minnesota helps bring the winter athlete out in everyone. I congratulate Team USA and all Minnesota athletes who made these games such a success. Senator S
MITH. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Minnesota. Ms. SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Presi-dent. Thank you, Senator K
LOBUCHAR , for organizing this colloquy on the Olym-pic contributions of Minnesotans. I was proud to work with you on this resolu-tion honoring our Olympians. While I have not yet given my first floor speech—which I plan to do in a couple of weeks—I couldn’t pass up the oppor-tunity to come down and talk about our State’s amazing athletes. As I am sure Senator K
LOBUCHAR  knows, as you have just heard from her, once a Minnesotan can walk, you can bet that his or her parents will try to get them on skis, skates, a sled, or maybe even on the curling rink. That early start—not to mention the fact that Minnesotans are the hardest working and most resilient people I know—helps explain why 23 of our ath-letes took part in this year’s Winter Games. As Senator K
LOBUCHAR said, that is the third most of any State in the country. And, boy, did they steal the show. Minnesotans brought home gold medals in women’s hockey, wom-en’s cross-country skiing, men’s curl-ing, and a bronze medal in women’s downhill skiing. I want to talk about Afton, Min-nesota’s own Jessie Diggins, who car-ried the Olympic torch for Team USA at the closing ceremony. As Senator K
LOBUCHAR said, Jessie began skiing at 4 years old and started racing against high schoolers at age 11. She earned her spot on the Olympic cross-country team and was the only woman to com-pete in all six women’s cross-country events—and compete she did. Along with her teammate, Kikkan Randall, Jessie won the first Olympic Gold Medal ever for the United States in cross-country skiing—and in dra-matic fashion. Jessie came from behind during the final stretch of the race, inching out her competitor as they crossed the finish line. I am amazed, but not all that sur-prised, by the accomplishments of my fellow Minnesotans. I am so happy to be able to join Senator K
LOBUCHAR in

saying we are glad the whole world had the chance to witness what we see every day in our jobs as Senators from Minnesota—Minnesotans doing amaz-ing things. I yield the floor. Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I know Minnesotans will look forward to Senator S
MITH’s actual first speech, but I think it is a tribute to our State that her first appearance on the Senate floor was about all of these Gold Med-als in hockey and curling and skiing. Thank you.

NO UNCONSTITUTIONAL STRIKE AGAINST NORTH  
KOREA ACT  
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to share my deep concern over what appears to be the Trump ad-ministration’s intention to go to war with North Korea. North Korea may have bent over backward to appear conciliatory during the recently concluded Winter Olym-pics in South Korea, but the Kim Jong Un regime has not stopped its dan-gerous activities—far from it. North Korea is a serious and ever-worsening threat to its people, to our allies and partners in the region, and to the United States, but the responsible course of action is to use all tools of American statecraft to reduce those threats. We have an obligation to American families, servicemembers, and our al-lies to say, unequivocally, that we did everything in our power to curb North Korea’s dangerous behavior without re-sorting to armed conflict. Instead, I fear that the Trump administration is beating the drums of war. While the North Korean regime was all smiles during the Olympics, its ma-lign behavior continued. Engineers race to perfect a nuclear-tipped inter-continental ballistic missile. North Ko-rean laborers around the world—mod-ern-day indentured servants—sent pay-checks home to the regime, helping fund its illicit military programs. Ille-gal ship-to-ship transfers of refined pe-troleum products continued. North Ko-rea’s army of cyber warriors grew ever more capable. North Korean military officers reportedly continued to assist and empower Bashar al-Assad’s chem-ical weapons program in Syria, and the Kim regime’s thugs made no efforts to scale back rampant human rights abuses. Many smiled as the North Korean re-gime won a gold medal in propaganda at the Olympics. All the while, it got ever closer to its ultimate goal of per-fecting a nuclear weapon that could reach the United States of America. We missed an opportunity to engage in talks with North Korea, and we did that at our own peril. While we must continue to ratchet up pressure on North Korea, other ele-ments of President Trump’s approach threaten to make an already bad situa-tion even worse. First, we are all too familiar with the President’s reckless rhetoric. Prom-ising ‘‘fire and fury’’ does not minimize tensions. Threatening to ‘‘totally de-stroy’’ North Korea only increases the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES1308 March 1, 2018 
chance of deadly miscalculation. Boasting about the size of a nuclear button only makes the United States less safe. How does Donald Trump think Kim Jong Un would react if he believed his rule were under immediate threat? Would Kim restrain himself? Second, contradictory statements from the Trump administration cause confusion that dampens the prospect of a peaceful solution. Is the Trump ad-ministration open to talks with North Korea? We certainly should be. If we are, what are the preconditions, and should we even have any? We hear dif-ferent thoughts on different days. President Trump routinely undercuts his Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, and with it, our diplomatic high ground. Confusing our allies in South Korea and Japan, whose assistance in helping resolve the North Korean crisis is indispensable, only serves to em-bolden Kim Jong Un, who seeks to drive a wedge between the United States and our allies. We saw this dur-ing the Olympics, and we cannot allow that effort to ever take hold. Third, the Trump administration’s recently released budget request for fiscal year 2019 would drastically cut State Department funding. Yet there is no explanation as to why the President believes that it is prudent to cut diplo-matic resources, especially in the mid-dle of a crisis. The State Department is already alarmingly understaffed to handle the significant and increasingly more potent threats from North Korea. Just this week, we found out that the Special Representative for North Korea Policy, Ambassador Joseph Yun—the lead American negotiator with North Korea—is stepping down tomorrow. He is one of the key players in any strat-egy with Pyongyang. But wait—there is more. We still don’t have a U.S. Am-bassador to South Korea more than a year into the Trump administration. We still don’t have a confirmed Assist-ant Secretary for East Asian and Pa-cific Affairs. We still don’t have a spe-cial envoy for North Korean human rights issues. We still don’t have a sanctions coordinator. It seems the only thing this administration has to show for its concern about North Korea is Donald Trump’s Twitter account. I sent a letter to Secretary Tillerson asking him to explain how the State Department is sufficiently staffed to execute a wide-ranging strategy of dip-lomatic engagement and pressure, but as I wait for his response, the talk of conflict persists and the drum beat of war grows louder. Sadly, we have heard this before. In less than 3 weeks, we will mark the 15th anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. To be clear, the current situation we face with North Korea is not the same as the one we faced in the runup to the Iraq war in 2003, but, as Mark Twain once said, while history does not repeat itself, it does tend to rhyme. We should recognize the similarities and learn the appropriate lessons regarding the use of military force. Unlike Iraq, North Korea has nearly completed development of long-range missiles, which will be capable of cre-ating nuclear mushroom clouds in our cities. We all agree that we need to act to ensure that this never happens, but nowhere is there a convincing argu-ment for military strikes. There might be a military option for the North Ko-rean nuclear threat, but there is no military solution. According to July 2017 polls, 76 per-cent of Americans are worried that the United States will become engaged in a major war in the next 4 years, and 86 percent of Americans believe the mili-tary should only be used as a last re-sort. We should listen to the American people. Congress must demand that the Trump administration exhaust all dip-lomatic and economic options in North Korea short of war. I am not the only one who thinks another Korean war would be horrific. Warnings about the consequences of conflict are coming from all corners, including from the senior-most national security and de-fense officials. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said that conflict on the North Korean Pe-ninsula would be ‘‘catastrophic.’’ Former Secretary of Defense Bill Perry said that a U.S. strike ‘‘could turn into a disastrous military oper-ation’’ and that ‘‘a war in the Korean Peninsula that extends to Japan and that goes nuclear would be 10 times worse than the first Korean War.’’ Victor Cha, who was to be nominated as U.S. Ambassador to South Korea be-fore being removed from contention, stated that ‘‘the answer is not, as some Trump administration officials have suggested, a preventive military strike.’’ Reports suggest that John Bolton, whom President Trump may be consid-ering to replace H.R. McMaster as Na-tional Security Advisor, apparently ‘‘supports preventive war through a massive strike, if sanctions fail.’’ He said that the United States would have to ‘‘simultaneously destroy all known North Korean ballistic missile sites, submarine bases, and artillery, mortar, and missile installments along the North’s border with South Korea.’’ That doesn’t include the sites we don’t know about. In October, the De-partment of Defense stated that the ‘‘only way to locate and destroy with complete certainty all components of North Korea’s nuclear weapons pro-gram is through a ground invasion.’’ Reports from a war game last week indicated that approximately 10,000 Americans could be wounded in combat in just the first few days of a new Ko-rean war. Apparently GEN Mark Milley, the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, stated that the ‘‘brutality’’ of conflict on the Korean Peninsula would ‘‘be beyond the experience of any living soldier.’’ Even before these comments, 74 per-cent of Americans were concerned about a ‘‘full-scale war with North Korea.’’ So we must ask some fundamental questions. On what criteria will the ad-ministration judge that all non-military options have been exhausted? Who will be the arbiter of that deci-sion? Will the administration fulfill its constitutional obligation and come to Congress to ask for support? How will the Members of Congress respond to such a request? It is because of these questions that I am here today. It is why I introduced the No Unconstitutional Strike Against North Korea Act. This bill would prevent the Department of De-fense and other Federal agencies from spending any money to carry out an at-tack, conventional or nuclear, on North Korea without congressional ap-proval, because we must only use the U.S. military—the most powerful fight-ing force in the world—if it is abso-lutely necessary. At the same time, I recognize that we must do more to stem the North Korea threat. That includes addressing ac-tions by China, the primary enabler of three successful generations of North Korean dictators. We should seek Chi-na’s partnership in this process, but we must not fear offending the Chinese Communist Party, nor fear China’s re-action. In the interest of our security and the interests of a peaceful resolution, we must, No. 1, cut off the flow of crude oil from China to North Korea— if we do not do this, then we are not going as far as we need to on a package of sanctions; No. 2, give the Kim re-gime a warning that we expect them to stop selling the slave labor of its people and, in fact, receiving the revenues from that slave labor in order to prop up their regime and to fund a ballistic missile and nuclear program; No. 3, eliminate North Korea’s illicit drug trade; No. 4, halt the procurement of key rocket fuel chemicals; and No. 5, restrict its use of the internet to evade sanctions through theft of cryptocurrencies and the committing of other cyber crimes. We must continue the pressure on North Korea, but it must be combined with simultaneous and direct engage-ment with North Korea. We have yet to use all of the sanctions that should be imposed upon the North Korean re-gime. We have a responsibility to en-sure that we exhaust all sanctions, and that includes doing everything we can to shut down the flow of crude oil into North Korea, which props up the re-gime, props up the ballistic missile program, and props up their nuclear weapons program. Talks with North Korea about these issues are not synonymous with con-cessions. Talks backed by targeted pressure and stronger alliances are the path pursued by countries that are strong, confident, and wise, while the drumbeat of war, on the other hand, is the sound of fear and insecurity. We are talking today about sanctions on imported steel and aluminum that come into the United States of Amer-ica, but we are looking at that as a

trade issue. If we want to do something about trade that truly endangers our country, we should be looking at the trade between North Korea and China. We should be looking at the crude oil that continues to flow into North Korea. We should not be talking about a military option until we have ex-hausted our diplomatic and our eco-nomic opportunities to bring North Korea to the table. Without China’s agreement on this, we will reach a debate on this floor talking about war with North Korea, but it will not be a debate that took place with the United States—the Trump administration—having ex-hausted all of the opportunities that a cutoff of crude oil would have and could have presented to bring North Korea to the table. It worked in 2006, it worked in 1994, and I expect, for the sake of the American people, that the President will try to make that work right now. He has not done that yet. This administration has not done that yet. It is wrong to be hearing this talk about military possibilities and mili-tary options before we have exhausted the cutoff of oil, of slave labor, of drugs, of cryptocurrency. We have to do that first. We owe that to history so we are not judged to have rushed irra-tionally into a war with North Korea that could quickly spiral out of con-trol. Let’s return to a United States of statecraft, allowing our diplomats to advance our interests using our eco-nomic tools, our economic strength, as a way of ensuring that we avoid a friv-olous loss of life in our country and other countries because we did not pur-sue a course that would work.

(vii) Sensitivity of Technology Contained in the Defense Article or Defense Services Proposed to be Sold: See Attached Annex. (viii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: March 1, 2018. *As defined in Section 47(6) of the Arms Export Control Act. 
POLICY JUSTIFICATION  Ukraine—Javelin Missiles and Command Launch Units The Government of Ukraine has requested to buy two hundred ten (210) Javelin Missiles and thirty-seven (37) Javelin Command Launch Units (CLUs) (includes two (2) Jav-elin CLUs to be used as spares). Also in-cluded are Basic Skill Trainers (BST); United States Government and contractor technical assistance, transportation, train-ing and other related elements of logistics and program support. The total estimated cost is not to exceed $47 million. This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United States by improving the security of Ukraine. The Javelin system will help Ukraine build its long-term defense capacity to defend its sovereignty and territorial in-tegrity in order to meet its national defense requirements. Ukraine will have no dif-ficulty absorbing this system into its armed forces. The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military bal-ance in the region. The prime contractors will be Raytheon/ Lockheed Martin Javelin Joint Venture of Orlando, Florida and Tucson, Arizona. How-ever, these missiles are being provided from U.S. Army stocks and the CLUs will be ob-tained from on-hand Special Defense Acqui-sition Fund (SDAF)-purchased stocks. There are no known offset agreements proposed in conjunction with this potential sale. Implementation of this proposed sale will require U.S. Government and/or contractor representatives to travel to Ukraine tempo-rarily in order to conduct training. There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-fense readiness as a result of this proposed sale. TRANSMITTAL NO . 18–02 Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act Annex Item No. vii (vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 1. The Javelin Weapon System is a me-dium-range, man portable, shoulder- launched, fire and forget, anti-tank system for infantry, scouts, and combat engineers. The system weighs 49.5 pounds and has a maximum range in excess of 2,500 meters. The system is highly lethal against tanks and other systems with conventional and re-active armors. The system possesses a sec-ondary capability against bunkers. 2. Javelin’s key technical feature is the use of fire-and-forget technology which allows the gunner to fire and immediately relocate or take cover. Additional special features are the top attack and/or direct fire modes, an advanced tandem warhead and imaging in-frared seeker, target lock-on before launch, and soft launch from enclosures or covered fighting positions. The Javelin missile also has a minimum smoke motor thus decreas-ing its detection on the battlefield. 3. The Javelin Weapon System is com-prised of two major tactical components, which are a reusable Command Launch Unit (CLU) and a round contained in a disposable launch tube assembly. The CLU incorporates an integrated day-night sight that provides a target engagement capability in adverse weather and countermeasure environments. The CLU may also be used in a stand-alone mode for battlefield surveillance and target detection. The CLU’s thermal sight is a sec-ond generation Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) sensor. To facilitate initial loading and subsequent updating of software, all on- board missile software is uploaded via the CLU after mating and prior to launch. 4. The missile is autonomously guided to the target using an imaging infrared seeker and adaptive correlation tracking algo-rithms. This allows the gunner to take cover or reload and engage another target after fir-ing a missile. The missile has an advanced tandem warhead and can be used in either the top attack or direct fire modes (for tar-get undercover). An onboard flight computer guides the missile to the selected target. 5. The Javelin Missile System hardware and the documentation are UNCLASSIFIED. The missile software which resides in the CLU is considered SENSITIVE. The sensi-tivity is primarily in the software programs which instruct the system how to operate in the presence of countermeasures. The overall hardware is also considered sensitive in that the infrared wavelengths could be useful in attempted countermeasure development. 6. If a technologically advanced adversary obtains knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the information could be used to develop countermeasures or equivalent systems that might reduce weap-on system effectiveness or be used in the de-velopment of a system with similar or ad-vanced capabilities. 7. A determination has been made that Ukraine can provide substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive tech-nology being released as the U.S. Govern-ment. This proposed sale is necessary to fur-ther the U.S. foreign policy and national se-curity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-tification. 8. All defense articles and services listed on this transmittal are authorized for release and export to the Government of Ukraine.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES1312 March 1, 2018 
REMEMBERING JOHN TUNNEY Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor a former Member of this Chamber, Senator John Tunney, whose seat I now hold. Senator Tunney passed away on Jan-uary 12 in Brentwood, CA, at the age of 83. His family and friends will gather on Monday to celebrate his life. The son of a world heavyweight box-ing champion, Senator Tunney was born in New York in 1934. After grad-uating from Yale in 1956, he went on to study law at the University of Vir-ginia. While attending law school, he was roommates with Senator Ted Kennedy, and the two became lifelong friends. After graduating in 1959, he began his career in public service as a JAG law-yer in the Air Force. He was eventually stationed in California, where he set-tled after leaving the military. He first ran for Congress in 1964, win-ning a House seat representing River-side and Imperial Counties. After three terms in the House, when he was only 36 years old, John challenged Senator George Murphy in 1970. It was highly contested election. Sen-ator Murphy shared the ballot with his good friend, then-Governor Ronald Reagan, who was seeking reelection. Despite the Governor’s popularity, Senator Tunney was able to win and by a wider margin of victory than the Governor. That campaign would serve as the inspiration for Robert Redford’s movie, ‘‘The Candidate.’’ Ever the statesmen, Senator Murphy went to Sacramento to meet with Gov-ernor Reagan immediately after the election. The two pledged to work to-gether for the betterment of California. That willingness to reach across the aisle allowed Senator Tunney to be an effective legislator during his career in the Senate. A champion of civil rights and envi-ronmental causes, he passed several major bills, including the Noise Pollu-tion Act in 1972 and an extension of the Voting Rights Act in 1975. He also authored the landmark Anti-trust Procedures and Penalties Act, commonly referred to as the Tunney Act. The antitrust bill gave the Justice Department oversight of corporate mergers and acquisitions. Senator Tunney also played a key role in keeping the United States out the Angolan civil war, pushing to end the Pentagon’s covert operations there. As a freshman Senator, he authored more than 38 bills, a record few of us here today could claim in our first term. That success can be attributed in part to the talented staff he hired, in-cluding future Congresswoman Jane Harman and Hadley Roff, who later served on my own staff. Despite his successful record, Sen-ator Tunney lost his reelection bid to S.I. Hayakawa during the anti-incum-bent wave that followed Watergate. Upon leaving office, he continued to practice law, becoming a partner at Manatt, Phelps, Rothenberg & Tunney in Los Angeles. He also served on the boards of sev-eral nonprofits, including Living With Wolves and UCLA’s Hammer Museum. After retiring, Senator Tunney spent most of his time in Idaho, enjoying po-etry, reading, fishing, skiing, and hik-ing with his family. Senator Tunney is survived by his second wife, Kathinka Osborne Tunney, his six children and stepchildren, and two grandsons. After his defeat in 1976, Senator Tunney famously said, ‘‘When you get into public life, you’ve got to be pre-pared to take your knocks.’’ On behalf of all Californians, I am grateful he was willing to take those knocks and thankful for his life of pub-lic service. 
f 
10TH ANNIVERSARY OF KOSOVO INDEPENDENCE Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish briefly to note that Saturday, Feb-ruary 17th, marked the 10th anniver-sary of the independence of Kosovo. I want to congratulate the people of Kosovo on reaching their aspirations for statehood 10 years ago and to sup-port their current aspirations to be part of a democratic, integrated, and peaceful Europe. I urge the government and people of Kosovo to use this anni-versary as an occasion to strengthen their commitments to democracy and human rights, to seek reconciliation with their neighbors, and to undertake and fully implement the reforms nec-essary to move forward in these areas. In 1998, the situation in Kosovo was markedly different. Still a province of Serbia, with its autonomy unilaterally revoked and its ethnic Albanian major-ity harshly repressed, Kosovo erupted in conflict. After years of passive re-sistance to Serbian rule, the people of Kosovo had enough and began to clam-or for their rights. Early international efforts to restore peace were unsustainable, and with U.S. leader-ship, the North Atlantic Treaty Orga-nization, NATO, Alliance was com-pelled to intervene militarily the fol-lowing year, placing Kosovo under the administration of the United Nations, UN, and opening the question of its status. The violent chaos of 1998 and 1999— marked by horrific war crimes, mas-sive displacement of populations, and ultimately the death of an estimated 12,000 or more people—made subsequent efforts to reach agreement on Kosovo’s status a challenge, and only in Feb-ruary 2008 could Kosovo assert inde-pendent statehood based on a plan de-veloped by the respected Finnish poli-tician, Martti Ahtisaari. This last decade has seen continued challenges as Kosovo has tried to achieve greater recognition of its inde-pendence abroad and to develop its democratic political institutions and economy at home. Perhaps the most important and positive development has been the direct dialogue since 2012 between Serbian and Kosovo officials in Brussels, under European Union, EU, auspices. These talks have sought to normalize relations between Belgrade and Pristina and to achieve practical progress that would improve the lives and protect the rights of the people in and from Kosovo. Some agreements have been reached, but implementation has been difficult. This work continues. As a Member of Congress, both House and Senate, I have been a witness to Kosovo’s history. As a member of the U.S. Helsinki Commission for more than two decades and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee since coming to this Chamber in 2007, I have visited Kosovo and participated in numerous hearings on developments there. I have met with its leaders, as well as those of Serbia and other neigh-bors, and engaged in critical debates on issues ranging from military interven-tion and peacekeeping operations to diplomatic recognition and bilateral support for the country’s democratic and economic development. As Kosovo moves into a second dec-ade of statehood, I urge those countries that have not yet recognized its inde-pendence to do so now, particularly those in the European Union. Kosovo’s independence is a reality, and full EU recognition will help pave the way to Kosovo’s European integration as it continues to take the necessary steps to strengthen its democratic institu-tions, respect human rights, and ad-here to the rule of law. Progress in these areas is desperately needed and something we should all want. With-holding recognition accomplishes noth-ing. While I make this call urging Kosovo’s recognition, I want also to urge Kosovo’s political leaders not to wait for outside incentives, but to see progress as in Kosovo’s own interest and to make this progress now. Noth-ing will strengthen support for Kosovo and its integration into Europe in the years to come more than its efforts to take responsibility now for doing the right thing. In this regard, I encourage the Kosovo Government to make clear its commitment to democracy. The polit-ical turmoil in the country has raised questions about the strength of this commitment. I hope to see steps in Kosovo to boost respect for human and property rights of members of minority communities, whether Serb, Roma, Turk, Bosniak, or any of the others who live in Kosovo. This has been one area where progress has been sadly lacking with regard to what we would expect. I also urge the Kosovo Government to make progress on justice for past atrocities by supporting the work of the special court established for that purpose and respecting its decisions and judgements. Upholding the rule of law for crimes that individuals in Kosovo have committed will boost Kosovo as a nation and contribute to a

sustainable peace and prosperous fu-ture. With its young and enthusiastic pop-ulation, I personally have little to question about Kosovo’s future being bright, but the job of Kosovo’s leaders today is to erase all doubts at home and abroad through accelerated progress on the democratic and human rights values we all hold dear. By doing so, Kosovo will make an even stronger claim to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe—OSCE— NATO, and EU memberships it deserves in the years to come. Let me conclude, by expressing my support for continued U.S. leadership in the Western Balkans, a leadership that ended a decade of regional con-flict, helped bring Kosovo to where it is today, and can make a difference still. With Russian and other outside influ-ences seeking to undermine the progress we have made, it is in our in-terest to engage more actively and offer a positive alternative to a dif-ficult past. It is in our interest to see Kosovo and the entire region stable and secure, reconciled and integrated, and—above all—prosperous. Let this be a time where we not only celebrate the progress we have made in the past dec-ade, but also commit to more rapid progress in the decade to come. Congratulations, Kosovo, on your 10 years of independence. You can count on the continued support of your friends in the United States.

RECOGNIZING THE RAVALLI COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this week I have the honor of recognizing the Ravalli County Sheriff’s Depart-ment and Sheriff Stephen Holton for their work to prevent an attack on the students and teachers of Darby School District. Just last week, on the heels of 17 tragic murders in Parkland, FL, a Darby High School senior allegedly made threatening comments and social media posts directed at fellow students and faculty at Darby High School. After receiving information about the concerning threats, Sheriff Holton took action, and law enforcement ar-rested the student on felony charges. While we will continue to investigate the tragedy in Florida and the perform-ance of law enforcement in that inci-dent, it is important that we commend students who speak up, school officials who respond, and those law enforce-ment officers who bravely act to keep our communities safe. The Darby stu-dents and school officials did the right thing. Sheriff Holton and the quick re-sponse of students and school officials may have prevented a tragedy in Mon-tana, and for that, we are very grate-ful. ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS RECOGNIZING SOUTH GEORGIA ∑Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, as the senior Senator from Georgia, it is my honor to pay tribute to South Georgia on its selection as a ‘‘2018 Great Amer-ican Defense Community’’ by the Asso-ciation of Defense Communities. Since 1941, this region of my State has been the proud home of Moody Air Force Base and some of the best air-men in the world. I congratulate the outstanding South Georgia Military Affairs Council, which is led by local chambers of com-merce in Berrien, Cook, Lanier, and Lowndes Counties, and the many com-munity members who work to support Moody Air Force Base. They take great pride in this installation, and they un-derstand how important the brave men and women who are based there are to our national security and to America. The Great American Defense Commu-nities Program honoring these special volunteers recognizes the overall sup-port that communities and regions in the U.S. provide to service members and military families to help ensure the highest quality of life possible. Se-lection for this honor is based on com-munity building and integration, sup-port and collaboration, educational and employment opportunities, and veteran and family support. I have seen firsthand how strongly the airmen and families associated with Moody Air Force Base are sup-ported and appreciated by the South Georgia community. It is much more than simply a place to live. For our military members serving at Moody, their community is a place to call home. It is family. Moody Air Force Base is the home to the 23rd Wing ‘‘Flying Tigers,’’ which consists of the 23rd Fighter Group, the Air Force’s largest A–10 fighter group, the 347th Rescue Group, and the Avon Park Air Force Range, among others. From close air support to combat search and rescue, the dedicated air-men of Moody Air Force Base play a critical role in our national defense and our ability to project power around the globe. Throughout Georgia, we are fortu-nate to be home to welcoming commu-nities for the servicemembers who are stationed at military bases across our State. South Georgia is a wonderful ex-ample of this spirit of service and pa-triotism. I congratulate this region and Moody Air Force Base on this distinct honor.∑

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS The following petitions and memo-rials were laid before the Senate and were referred or ordered to lie on the table as indicated: POM–174. A resolution adopted by the Sen-ate of the State of Michigan urging the United States Congress to enact legislation that provides the National Oceanic and At-mospheric Administration and regional man-agement councils additional tools to effec-tively and appropriately manage our na-tion’s important saltwater recreational fish-eries; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. S
ENATE RESOLUTION NO. 118 Whereas, U.S. saltwater fisheries are among the world’s largest and most sustain-able, providing significant economic impact across the nation. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and re-gional management councils set catch lim-its, ensure compliance with fisheries regula-tions, and reduce unintended catches to pro-vide continued economic and recreational opportunities; and Whereas, Inaccurate and inconsistent data used to make decisions concerning saltwater fishing stocks, as well as a one-size-fits-all management approach, have led to curtailed recreational fishing opportunities, frus-trating recreational anglers and adversely impacting Michigan companies that manu-facture recreational fisheries products. Michigan is home to several boat and fishing tackle manufacturers who sell their products nationwide. These companies employ thou-sands of skilled workers, having a substan-tial impact on Michigan’s economy; and Whereas, Improved data collection and im-plementing management tools more suitable for recreational fisheries will enhance public access to fish and continue to conserve our saltwater fisheries resources. Not only will recreational anglers benefit, but also thou-sands of fishing-related businesses that de-pend on reasonable angler access to healthy saltwater fisheries. The Modernizing Rec-reational Fisheries Management Act of 2017, S. 1520, would update federal fisheries man-agement for recreational angling by allowing alternative management techniques, im-prove data collection, ensure periodic review of allocations in important mixed-use fish-eries, and continue to rebuild overfished stocks, among other benefits, to anglers and the nation, now, therefore, be it Resolved by the Senate, That we memori-alize the Congress of the United States to enact legislation that provides the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and regional management councils addi-tional tools to effectively and appropriately manage our nation’s important saltwater recreational fisheries, and be it further Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan congressional dele-gation. 
POM–175. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislative Assembly of the Common-wealth of Puerto Rico requesting the United States Congress and the United States De-partment of Interior to take the necessary administrative and legislative actions in order to provide for the updating of the var-ious topographic and hydrographic maps of our Island; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. S. C
ON. RES. 1 
STATEMENT OF MOTIVES  The United States Geological Survey (hereinafter, the USGS) is a scientific orga-nization that provides unbiased information on the health of our ecosystems and the en-vironment; the natural hazards that threat-en us; the natural resources, based on the impact of climate change and land use; and the core science systems that allow us to provide timely, relevant, and useful informa-tion. As the Nation’s largest water, earth, and biological science mapping agency, the USGS collects, monitors, analyzes, and pro-vides scientific knowledge on the condition of the natural resources and any problems and issues related thereto. The agency’s di-verse scientific knowledge enables it to con-duct large-scale multidisciplinary investiga-tion, and to provide unbiased scientific infor-mation to resource managers, planners, and other customers. Likewise, the USGS works in conjunction with other federal agencies as well as the private sector through official memoranda of understanding and memo-randa of agreement in order to fulfill the agency’s scientific mission. The services offered by the USGS are of ut-most importance for Puerto Rico. The maps drawn by this entity are used for multiple purposes, such as the identification of drain-age basins and the topography, land classi-fication, localization, and the location of water resources, properties, delimitation, etc. As a matter of fact, the USGS’s plans are part of the requirements of the permit proc-ess carried out by the government agencies of Puerto Rico. However, the aforementioned maps are not up to date and most of them date back to many decades. As expected, our Island and its topography have been altered in the last forty (40) or fifty (50) years; there-fore, it is necessary to amend and update said maps. The USGS keeps evolving and, in 2010, the agency made changes to its structure in order to focus on or pay special attention to natural hazards. For such reason, the impor-tance of the accuracy in the records or docu-ments that the agency provides must be rec-ognized. Regarding the USGS’s maps of our Island, it is essential that these maps are up-dated in order to avoid issues in future devel-opments and make an orderly land planning feasible. In view of these circumstances and through this Concurrent Resolution, this Legislative Assembly hereby requests the United States Congress and the pertinent federal agencies to provide for the updating of the various topographic and hydrographic maps of our Island. Be it resolved by the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico: Section 1.—To request the United States Congress and the United States Department of Interior to take the necessary administra-tive and legislative actions in order to pro-vide for the updating of the various topo-graphic and hydrographic maps of our Island. Section 2.—It is hereby provided that a certification on this Concurrent Resolution shall be issued immediately to be delivered to the United States Congress and the United States Department of the Interior. Section 3.—This Concurrent Resolution shall be translated into English to be deliv-ered as provided in Section 2. Section 4.—This Concurrent Resolution shall take effect immediately after its ap-proval. POM–176.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S1315 March 1, 2018 
Muesas. At that time, cockfighting was al-ready a pastime in most European countries. It was so popular that, during the reign of King Henry VIII, cockfights were held in the Palace of Whitehall, in the courtyards and interiors of churches, and even in the British Parliament. Likewise, cockfights were so popular in France that they adopted the gamecock as their national symbol. In the United States, some presidents were fans of the sport, among them, George Wash-ington, Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, and Abraham Lincoln who was known as ‘‘Honest Abe’’ due to being a good pit judge. In fact, for many years, it was acceptable and encouraged in the United States for a gentleman to raise game fowls and be an ex-pert at the sport. Over the years, cockfight bans began ap-pearing all across the Nation. In 1898, the sport was banned after Puerto Rico became a territory of the United States of America, but underground cockfights continued. How-ever, as a result of the fight put up by the third President of the Senate of Puerto Rico, the Honorable Rafael Martı´nez-Nadal, who was a fan of the sport and defended this Is-land tradition, then Governor of Puerto Rico, Robert Gore, repealed the ban and pro-mulgated legislation which recognized cock-fighting as a legitimate sport in the Island. As a result of the above mentioned, the rule of law has recognized that the sport of cockfighting has been part of our culture and traditions. According to Jose´S. Alegrı´a, ‘‘the sport of cockfighting was a leveler that made a gentleman out of all those who vis-ited the pits, regardless of their standing in society.’’ This sport is known as the ‘‘gentle-men’s sport,’’ because the people who follow the same keep their word during the com-petitions, without the need for a contract or a similar document for such purposes. Although this sport has millions of fans in dozens of countries around the world, Puerto Rico is still considered ‘‘the Mecca’’ of cock-fighting. The sport is so well established that, unlike many other sports on the Island, cockfighting does not require subsidies from the Government of Puerto Rico. Moreover, it is estimated to generate over twenty-seven thousand (27,000) direct and indirect jobs. Likewise, this sport greatly impacts Puerto Rico’s tourism because we receive visitors from Mexico, the Dominican Republic, and other countries who travel to the Island to partake in the sport of cockfighting. Since its beginnings in Puerto Rico, the sport of cockfighting has faced great chal-lenges and has overcome them. In 2007, the Federal Government passed the Animal Wel-fare Act[sic], Pub. Law 110–22 which classi-fied as a felony the transport, sale, and pur-chase of tools and paraphernalia relating to this activity, among other things. At that time, the territories and places where cock-fighting was legal were excluded from the application of the Act. However, HR 4202 was introduced on No-vember 1 of this year, jeopardizing the con-tinuity of this sport in Puerto Rico. On this occasion, the express intent of the bill is to extend the total ban against animal fighting set forth in the ‘‘Animal Welfare Act’’ to the United States territories. Moreover, it pro-hibits the purchase, sale, or transportation of accessories to be used in cockfights, and even imposes penalties of imprisonment. The congress members who introduced this meas-ure consider these types of fights animal cru-elty. It is worth noting that the sport of cock-fighting in Puerto Rico is well regulated. For instance, safety measures are taken to guar-antee that participating gamecocks wear the same spurs and are of the same age, weight, and bet. Furthermore, pit judges are empow-ered to stop the fight if they notice either excessive punishment or that a gamecock is not fit to continue fighting. Once the fight is over, both gamecocks are examined by spe-cialized staff and treated accordingly for their prompt recovery. Hence, it is evident that our industry has taken measures to en-sure the protection of gamecocks. The enactment of HR 4202 shall threaten a century-old practice that is deeply rooted in our culture, history, and traditions. More-over, said bill shall affect various compo-nents of our economy that provide services related to this sport, such as veterinarians, game fowl breeders, agricultural stores, and trophies and awards manufacturers, among others. For all of the foregoing, the Legisla-tive Assembly is compelled to firmly and un-equivocally reject the enactment of HR 4202, since it does not take into account the ad-verse effect that such bill shall have on Puerto Rico’s economy and culture. Be it resolved by the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico: Section 1.—To express the firm and un-equivocal repudiation and opposition of the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico to HR 4202 of the United States House of Represent-atives that seeks to apply the ‘‘Animal Wel-fare Act’’ to United States territories and, consequently, prohibits cockfights in Puerto Rico. Section 2.—A certified copy of this Concur-rent Resolution translated into English shall be delivered to the members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives of the U.S. Congress and to the President of the United States of America. Section 3.—This Concurrent Resolution shall take effect upon its approval. 
POM–177. A resolution adopted by the Sen-ate of the General Assembly of the State of Indiana urging the President of the United States and United States Congress to in-struct the Environmental Protection Agency to remove Lake and Porter counties from the Chicago Nonattainment Area; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. S
ENATE RESOLUTION FOUR Whereas, The motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) programs in Lake and Porter counties were mandated by the fed-eral Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, based on Lake and Porter counties’ designa-tion as ‘‘nonattainment’’, along with north-east Illinois and southeast Wisconsin, under the one-hour ozone standard; Whereas, According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), cars and trucks collectively are the single greatest contributor to ground-level ozone, the major component of smog; Whereas, The purpose of an I/M program is to reduce ground-level ozone by ensuring that the emission control systems on vehi-cles are working correctly; Whereas, Generally, only vehicles reg-istered in Lake and Porter counties are sub-ject to the I/M programs in Lake and Porter counties; Whereas, Lake and Porter counties in northwest Indiana are intersected by Inter-state Highway 80/90 and Interstate Highway 94, two of the most heavily traveled high-ways in the Midwest, and Lake County is also intersected by Interstate Highway 65, another heavily traveled highway, linking major southern cities with Indianapolis and Chicago; Whereas, The citizens of Lake and Porter counties have been burdened with the cost of the testing and remediation required under the I/M program, even though thousands of out-of-state vehicles pass through these areas on a daily basis without the burden of submitting to the I/M program; Whereas, Lake and Porter counties are linked to the Chicago Nonattainment Area based on violations in northeast Illinois and southeast Wisconsin; Whereas, Under the standards promulgated in 2015 for ozone, nine monitors within the Chicago Nonattainment Area exceed the standard, but none of the monitors are lo-cated in Indiana; and Whereas, Lake and Porter counties have the most stringent suite of control measures in the Midwest, and have consistently met EPA’s objectives: therefore, be it Resolved by the Senate of the General Assem-bly of the State of Indiana: Section 1. That the Indiana General As-sembly urges the Honorable Donald J. Trump, President of the United States; the Honorable Michael R. Pence, Vice President of the United States; and members of the United States Congress from Indiana to in-struct the Environmental Protection Agency to remove Lake and Porter counties from the Chicago Nonattainment Area, and there-by eliminate the requirements under which the motor vehicle inspection and mainte-nance programs in Lake and Porter counties are operated. Section 2. That copies of this resolution be transmitted by the Secretary of the Senate to the Honorable Donald J. Trump, President of the United States; the Honorable Michael R. Pence, Vice President of the United States; the Honorable Joe Donnelly, the Honorable Todd Young, the Honorable Pete Visclosky, the Honorable Jackie Walorski, the Honorable Jim Banks, the Honorable Todd Rokita, the Honorable Susan Brooks, the Honorable Luke Messer, the Honorable Andre Carson, the Honorable Larry Bucshon, and the Honorable Trey Hollingsworth of the U.S. Congress; Scott Pruitt, the Adminis-trator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency; and Robert A. Kaplan, the Acting Regional Administrator for EPA Region 5 in Chicago. POM–178. A resolution adopted by the Sen-ate of the State of California relative to the 45th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. S
ENATE RESOLUTION NO. 72 Whereas, January 22, 2018, marks the 45th anniversary of the United States Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Roe v. Wade, which affirmed that every woman has a fun-damental right to control her own reproduc-tive decisions and to decide whether to end or to continue pregnancy, and is an occasion deserving of acknowledgment; and Whereas, Roe v. Wade has been the corner-stone of women’s ability to control their re-productive lives, allowing every woman in the United States the right to decide when, if, and with whom to have children, and how many children to have; and Whereas, Women’s ability to control their reproductive lives has helped and facilitated their participation in the economic and so-cial life of our nation; and Whereas, Roe v. Wade has drastically re-duced the maternal mortality rate for women terminating their pregnancies in the United States. In the years prior to the deci-sion, illegal abortion accounted for approxi-mately 17 percent of all reported deaths at-tributable to pregnancy and childbirth, and many women were severely injured as a re-sult of ‘‘back alley’’ abortion procedures; and Whereas, Interference with a woman’s right to choose causes women to be forced into illegal and dangerous abortions, as they often were in the United States before the Roe v. Wade decision. Many women are forced to make these decisions today in countries where abortion is illegal and un-safe. Each year between 4.7 percent to 13.2

percent of maternal deaths can be attributed to unsafe abortion. Many survivors of an ille-gal abortion suffer serious and often perma-nent injuries; and Whereas, Roe v. Wade continues to protect the health and freedom of women throughout the United States; and Whereas, The State of California stands in strong support of every woman’s funda-mental right, as confirmed in Roe v. Wade, to make her own decisions regarding her pregnancy; now, therefore, be it Resolved by the Senate of the State of Cali-fornia, That the Senate urges the President of the United States and the United States Congress to express their support for a wom-an’s fundamental right to control her own reproductive decisions, as well as their sup-port for access to comprehensive reproduc-tive health care, including the services pro-vided by Planned Parenthood; and be it fur-ther Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of Rep-resentatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, to each Senator and Representative from California in the Congress of the United States, and to the author for appropriate dis-tribution. f

SENATE RESOLUTION 419—DESIG-NATING THE WEEK OF FEB-RUARY 26 THROUGH MARCH 4, 2018, AS ‘‘NATIONAL EATING DIS-ORDERS AWARENESS WEEK’’ AND SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF RAISING AWARENESS AND UNDER-STANDING OF EATING DIS-ORDERS Mrs. CAPITO (for herself and Ms. B
ALDWIN ) submitted the following reso-lution; which was considered and agreed to: 
S. R ES. 419 Whereas eating disorders affect 30,000,000 individuals in the United States at some point during their lifetimes; Whereas eating disorders are caused by a complex interaction of genetic, biological, social, behavioral, and psychological factors; Whereas eating disorders include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating dis-order, avoidant/restrictive food intake dis-order, and other feeding or eating disorders; Whereas individuals with eating disorders have some of the highest mortality rates of all mental illnesses; Whereas there is a high prevalence of eat-ing disorders among members of the Armed Forces on active duty and veterans; Whereas many health professionals receive limited or no formal training about eating disorders or the identification and treatment of eating disorders; Whereas best practices for the treatment of an eating disorder includes the involve-ment of the patient, the family of the pa-tient, and a comprehensive team of profes-sionals such as social workers, mental health counselors, primary care practitioners, psy-chiatrists, psychologists, dietitians, and other specialty providers; and Whereas more research on eating disorders is needed to inform evidence-based treat-ments, promote prevention efforts, facilitate early identification, and provide insight on illness causation and the effects of eating disorders on minds and bodies: Now, there-fore, be it Resolved, That the Senate— (1) designates the week of February 26 through March 4, 2018, as ‘‘National Eating Disorders Awareness Week’’; (2) supports the goals and ideals of a na-tional week to raise public awareness and

understanding of eating disorders and the millions of families in the United States af-fected by eating disorders; (3) recognizes the need for treatment of in-dividuals with eating disorders; (4) acknowledges the need for further re-search on eating disorders; and (5) encourages Federal, State, and local governments, and citizens of the United States— (A) to support National Eating Disorders Awareness Week through programs and ac-tivities; and (B) to promote public awareness of eating disorders. f 
SENATE RESOLUTION 420—DESIG-NATING MARCH 3, 2018, AS ‘‘WORLD WILDLIFE DAY’’ Mr. COONS (for himself and Mr. I
NHOFE ) submitted the following reso-lution; which was considered and agreed to: 
S. R ES. 420 Whereas wildlife has provided numerous economic, environmental, social, and cul-tural benefits during the course of human history and wildlife conservation will secure those gifts for future generations; Whereas plant and animal species play an important role in the stability of diverse ecosystems around the world and the con-servation of that biodiversity is critical to maintain the delicate balance of nature and keep complex ecosystems thriving; Whereas observation of wild plants and animals in their natural habitat provides in-dividuals with a more enriching worldview and a greater appreciation of the wonders of the natural environment; Whereas tens of millions of individuals in the United States strongly support the con-servation of wildlife, both domestically and abroad, and wish to ensure the survival of species in the wild, such as rhinoceroses, ti-gers, elephants, pangolins, turtles, seahorses, sharks, ginseng, mahogany, and cacti; Whereas the trafficking of wildlife, includ-ing timber and fish, comprises the fourth largest global illegal trade after narcotics, the counterfeiting of products and currency, and human trafficking and has become a major transnational organized crime with an estimated worth of as much as $19,000,000,000 annually; Whereas increased demand in Asia for high-value illegal wildlife products, particu-larly elephant ivory and rhinoceros horns, has triggered substantial and rapid increases in poaching of those species; Whereas the trafficking of wildlife is a pri-mary threat to many wildlife species, includ-ing elephants, rhinoceroses, tigers, pangolins, and sharks; Whereas many different kinds of criminals, including some terrorist entities and rogue security personnel, often in collusion with corrupt government officials, are involved in wildlife poaching and the movement of ivory and rhinoceros horns across Africa; Whereas wildlife poaching presents signifi-cant security and stability challenges for military and police forces in African nations that are often threatened by heavily armed poachers and the criminal, extremist allies of those poachers; Whereas wildlife poaching negatively im-pacts local communities that rely on natural resources for economic development, includ-ing through tourism; Whereas penal and financial deterrents can improve the ability of governments to reduce poaching and trafficking and enhance the ca-pabilities of those governments in managing resources; Whereas assisting institutions in devel-oping nations, including by providing mate-rial, training, legal, and diplomatic support, can reduce illegal wildlife trade; Whereas wildlife provides a multitude of benefits to all nations and wildlife crime has wide-ranging economic, environmental, and social impacts; Whereas the African Elephant Status Re-port 2016 issued by the International Union for Conservation of Nature revealed that the elephant population of Africa has recently seen a dramatic decline, mainly due to poaching during the 10 years preceding the issuance of the report, and the continental population is now thought to be 415,428; Whereas the estimated African elephant population decreased by approximately 93,000 between 2006 and 2015, despite the inclusion of approximately 18,000 elephants that were previously uncounted, making the actual de-cline closer to 111,000; Whereas, from 2007 to 2012, the number of elephants killed in Kenya increased by more than 800 percent, from 47 to 387 elephants killed; Whereas, between 2002 and 2013, as a result of poaching, about 65 percent of the forest elephant population was killed and that spe-cies lost 30 percent of its geographical range; Whereas World Wildlife Fund elephant sur-veys conducted between 2014 and 2016 and covering 6,000,000 hectares confirmed this catastrophic trend, documenting losses of 66 percent of the remaining elephants between 2008 and 2016, placing forest elephants on track for extinction in the next decade; Whereas fewer than 50,000 wild Asian ele-phants remain and poaching of these popu-lations is on the rise, with an average of 1 elephant poached every week in Burma, driv-en by demand for elephant skin products; Whereas the number of rhinoceroses killed by poachers in South Africa— (1) dramatically increased from 13 in 2007 to 1,215 in 2014, an increase of more than 9,000 percent; and (2) was 1,028 in 2017; Whereas the 3 species of Asian rhinoceroses also remain under constant threat of poach-ing, with a greater 1-horned rhinoceros poached in Kaziranga National Park in India as recently as January 2018; Whereas pangolins are often referred to as the most trafficked mammal in the world; Whereas all 8 pangolin species spanning Af-rica and Asia are faced with extinction be-cause pangolin scales are sought after in the practice of traditional Chinese medicine and pangolin meat is considered a delicacy; Whereas approximately 100,000,000 sharks are killed annually, often targeted solely for their fins, and unsustainable trade is the pri-mary cause of serious population decline in several shark species, including scalloped hammerhead sharks, great hammerhead sharks, and oceanic whitetip sharks; Whereas the vaquita porpoise of Mexico, with fewer than 30 individual porpoises re-maining, is being driven to extinction through bycatch in gillnets set for the totoaba fish, the swim bladder of which feeds a lucrative illegal trade through the United States to Asia; Whereas tiger populations have plummeted by 95 percent over the last 100 years and Afri-can lion populations have declined by 40 per-cent over the last 20 years; Whereas fewer than 4,000 tigers remain in the wild throughout all of Asia; Whereas there are more than 7,000 tigers in farms in China, Laos, Thailand, and Viet-nam, which continues to stoke demand for il-legal tiger products and contributes to 30 percent of illegal trading with respect to that animal; Whereas the United States is developing and implementing measures to address the criminal, financial, security, and environ-mental aspects of wildlife trafficking; Whereas Congress has allocated specific re-sources to combat wildlife trafficking and address the threats posed by poaching and the illegal wildlife trade; Whereas Congress recently passed the Eliminate, Neutralize, and Disrupt Wildlife Trafficking Act of 2016 (16 U.S.C. 7601 et seq.) to strengthen the response of the United States to the global wildlife trafficking cri-sis; Whereas, in December 2013, the United Na-tions General Assembly proclaimed March 3 as World Wildlife Day to celebrate and raise awareness of the wild fauna and flora around the world; Whereas March 3, 2018, represents the fifth annual celebration of World Wildlife Day; Whereas, in 2018, the theme of World Wild-life Day is ‘‘Big cats: predators under threat’’; and Whereas, in 2018, World Wildlife Day com-memorations will raise awareness about the plight of big cats and galvanize support for the many global and national actions that are underway to save those iconic species: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate— (1) designates March 3, 2018, as ‘‘World Wildlife Day’’; (2) supports raising awareness of the bene-fits that wildlife provides to people and the threats facing wildlife around the world; (3) supports escalating the fight against wildlife crime, including wildlife trafficking; (4) applauds the domestic and inter-national efforts to escalate the fight against wildlife crime; (5) commends the efforts of the United States to mobilize the entire Federal Gov-ernment in a coordinated, efficient, and ef-fective manner for dramatic progress in the fight against wildlife crime; and (6) encourages continued cooperation be-tween the United States, international part-ners, local communities, nonprofit organiza-tions, private industry, and other partner or-ganizations in an effort to conserve and cele-brate wildlife, preserving this precious re-source for future generations. f

R ES. 423 Whereas a rare disease or disorder is one that affects a small number of patients, which in the United States is considered to be a population of less than 200,000 individ-uals; Whereas, as of February 2018, nearly 7,000 rare diseases affect approximately 30,000,000 people in the United States and their fami-lies; Whereas children with rare diseases ac-count for about half of the population af-fected by rare diseases in the United States; Whereas many rare diseases are serious and life-threatening and lack effective treat-ments; Whereas, as a result of the Orphan Drug Act (Public Law 97–414; 96 Stat. 2049), impor-tant advances have been made in the re-search and treatment of rare diseases; Whereas the Food and Drug Administra-tion has made great strides in gathering pa-tient perspectives to inform the drug review process as part of the Patient-Focused Drug Development program, an initiative that originated under the Food and Drug Admin-istration Safety and Innovation Act (Public Law 112–144; 126 Stat. 993); Whereas, although more than 600 drugs and biological products have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of rare diseases, millions of people in the United States have a rare disease for which there is no approved treatment; Whereas lack of access to effective treat-ments and difficulty in obtaining reimburse-ment for life-altering, and even life-saving, treatments still remain significant chal-lenges for people with rare diseases and their families; Whereas rare diseases and conditions in-clude aplastic anemia, porphyria, spina bifida, stiff person syndrome, Gaucher dis-ease, diffuse pulmonary lymphangiomatosis, adrenoleukodystrophy, Noonan syndrome, Rett syndrome, Moebius syndrome, Castleman Disease, epidermolytic ichthyosis, and short bowel syndrome; Whereas people with rare diseases experi-ence challenges that include— (1) difficulty in obtaining an accurate diag-nosis; (2) limited treatment options; and (3) difficulty finding physicians or treat-ment centers with expertise in rare diseases; Whereas the rare disease community gained important new tools during the 115th Congress with the enactment of the FDA Re-authorization Act of 2017 (Public Law 115–52; 131 Stat. 1005), which— (1) advanced and facilitated the develop-ment and timely approval of drugs and bio-logics for rare diseases, including diseases af-fecting children; (2) reauthorized user fees to help deliver safe and effective treatments to individuals with rare diseases; (3) supported the utilization of real-world evidence; (4) supported patient-focused drug develop-ment; and (5) supported the National Evaluation Sys-tem for Health Technology; Whereas both the Food and Drug Adminis-tration and the National Institutes of Health have established special offices to support and facilitate rare disease research and treatments; Whereas the National Organization for Rare Disorders (referred to as ‘‘NORD’’ in this preamble), a nonprofit organization es-tablished in 1983 to provide services to and advocate on behalf of patients with rare dis-eases, remains a critical public voice for peo-ple with rare diseases; Whereas 2018 marks the 35th anniversary of the enactment of the Orphan Drug Act and the establishment of NORD; Whereas NORD sponsors Rare Disease Day in the United States and partners with many other major rare disease organizations to in-crease public awareness of rare diseases; Whereas Rare Disease Day is observed each year on the last day of February; Whereas Rare Disease Day is a global event that was first observed in the United States on February 28, 2009, and observed in more than 94 countries in 2017; and Whereas Rare Disease Day is expected to be observed globally for years to come, pro-viding hope and information for rare disease patients around the world: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate— (1) designates February 28, 2018, as ‘‘Rare Disease Day’’; (2) recognizes the importance of improving awareness and encouraging accurate and early diagnosis of rare diseases and dis-orders; and (3) supports a national and global commit-ment to improving access to and developing new treatments, diagnostics, and cures for rare diseases and disorders. f

REMEMBERING MS. JO ANN FLIRT 
HON. BRADLEY BYRNE 
OF ALABAMA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 1, 2018 Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to re-member the life and legacy of Ms. Jo Ann Flirt. Jo Ann was a vibrant member of the Mo-bile community. To me, Jo Ann was a dear and trusted friend. Jo Ann attended both undergraduate and graduate school at the University of Alabama, where she went on to teach journalism and public relations. Upon returning to Mobile, she was a founding member and former president of the Press Club of Mobile and a founding member of the Mississippi-Alabama chapter of the Public Relations Society of Alabama. Jo Ann was known for her immeasurable work ethic. She started two businesses in Mo-bile, the Public Relations Counsel Inc., an ad-vertising and public relations firm, and the Mo-bile Record, a daily legal publication with real estate and other civil business news. She also founded a group called Alabamians Behind Local Education with the purpose of peacefully integrating schools in Alabama. Jo Ann was also a passionate advocate and champion for historic Blakeley State Park, where she served as director for almost fifteen years. It would not be a surprise to see Jo Ann out working on various projects at Blakeley, in addition to her administrative tasks. As a true testament to her character, Jo Ann was regularly called upon to serve in her community and was well known for her deter-mined, caring spirit. Sadly, Jo Ann passed away on February 2, 2018 at the age of 85. So, to her family and friends who will miss her dearly, I want to ex-tend my deepest sympathies and condo-lences. May they take comfort in the warm memories of Jo Ann and the lasting impact she had on so many.

BILL LOPER 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 1, 2018 Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of my close friend Bill Loper. My brother, sister and I grew up in one of the best neighborhoods a kid could ever grow up in. As youngsters we roamed from one house to another. No matter where we were, we knew we were under the watchful eyes of parents and adults who treated us like their own—the Wehdes, the Driftmiers, the Fisks, and especially, the Lopers. So, as I write this recognition and celebration of Bill’s life, I cannot do it in isolation and think of Annie and the other families and my own mom and dad. As close as we were to all of our neighbors, Bill and Annie and my mom and dad had something special. They all met at the Univer-sity of Colorado just after WWII, and from that time on were the best of friends and partners. This was due, in no small part, to the kindred spirit that Bill and my dad shared and still share even with Bill’s passing. Dad and Bill were native Coloradans, Bill from Olathe and Dad from Denver. Bill fol-lowed in his big brother Bob’s footsteps when he enrolled at CU after serving a hitch in the Navy at the end of WWII. My dad followed in his big brother Jack’s footsteps, when he en-rolled at Boulder. Both studied liberal arts, Dad—Political Science and Bill—Economics. They were friends, classmates and room-mates. Both enjoyed politics and were left in their leanings. They were pretty rebellious too and despite Joe McCarthy’s ‘‘Red Scare’’ of the late 40’s and early 50’s, they named their intramural softball team ‘‘The Social Science Reds.’’ Bill excelled at everything while at CU, except spelling. According to my dad, Bill’s friends had to help him correct his term pa-pers so he could graduate. After graduation, Bill announced he was moving to Alaska to find his fame and fortune, and follow his brother who had moved up to the Northwest. Apparently he didn’t find fame or fortune and wasn’t too enamored with his brother, because he returned to Colorado shortly thereafter. My dad, grandfather, Uncles Mike and Jack, and Aunt Ann knew Bill could build or fix just about anything and that whatever he worked at or worked on he would master. So, upon returning from Alaska, he joined them in busi-ness at Perlmutter & Sons Construction and Prestressed Concrete/Stanly Structures where he was the head of operations. As the head of operations, Bill learned and mastered new products and construction techniques for the next 50 years or so. Bill, together with the others, helped build much of the West, whether it was roads, bridges, apartments, hotels, offices, ware-houses or shopping centers. If there was a construction problem, Bill was the trouble shooter to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it. Bill helped build much of Vail and the Gore Valley, and even the precursor to the building hosting Bill’s memorial, the Tivoli. He was also a risk taker, helping to stake and support young entrepreneurial developers and owners like Bob Lazier, the owner and propri-etor of the Tivoli. Besides the Precast/ Prestressed Concrete Business, Bill also headed up the Air Structure business which built big air bubble structures to cover virtually anything from tennis courts to football fields. He founded Cygnus with his friend and fishing buddy, Tom Obermeyer, which made the pre-cast facia and cladding for buildings all over the country. But of greater importance to me, Cassie and Joe, was the way that Bill and Annie treated us, whether it was barbecues in their backyard on Upham Court (where the hamburgers were a little too rare) to badminton, or pool, or ten-nis or going to football games, or of course, skiing. We all spent countless hours together learning and playing and enjoying each other’s company. One time, Bill agreed to teach me how to drive a stick shift over Loveland Pass just after I got my learner’s permit. It was snowing and icy and I remember how scared I was; he must have been petrified, but he never showed it. Annie taught all of us, including my mom and dad, how to ski. When Annie was teach-ing a class, Bill was always with us and his kids on the slopes. It didn’t matter whether it was at Eldora, Winter Park, or Vail. We spent many nights and weekends bunking in the Loper’s cabin in Fraser or their condo at the Villa Cortina in Vail. Bill loved his sports, especially tennis, ski-ing, and squash. At one time he was one of the best squash players in Denver and was a regular at the downtown YMCA. He loved Bronco football and attended many games with Jerry Shpall and other Bronco fanatics. Whatever Bill did, he did it to his best ability. One of the things he did best was to encour-age people. He loved his children and grand-children and encouraged them in every way possible. That encouragement and support led Amy, Steve, and Ted to take risks and accom-plish things that most people fear to under-take, whether it’s starting a business, moving overseas or telemarking down the Minturn Mile. Bill loved politics. He and my dad were Democratic precinct committeemen in Wheat

Ridge and had all of us kids out walking pre-cincts for our local candidates at a very early age. Bill participated in so many civic and charitable organizations that are too numerous to list. But suffice it to say, local PTA’s, animal protection organizations, rotaries and industry groups benefitted from his leadership. Bill had a wry sense of humor and could find something funny in just about everything and every situation (with the possible excep-tion of the Trump Administration). He had many sayings but one that stands out for me is, ‘‘If you do somebody a favor, you can be sure they will remember it . . . the next time they need another favor.’’ Despite the sardonic humor, you can bet that Bill did favors for just about everyone, whether it was teaching somebody like me to drive over an icy pass or helping a young ski bum build his first hotel. I talked to Annie and Bill a couple of weeks before Bill passed away. As always, they both expressed interest in how I was doing, what it was like these days with Donald Trump in of-fice and how my family was doing. Bill contin-ued to encourage me to do my best for my constituents, no matter their means, and make sure that they had a voice in Washington. Bill was always concerned about the success of the little guy or the hardworking family down the street. Bill was one of the nicest, smartest, most generous men I’ve ever known. In that regard, he and my dad were not only kindred spirits, but twin brothers. Bill was like a second dad to me, Cassie, and Joe, and he will be sorely missed. As my dad so succinctly put it, ‘‘Bill worked hard. He played hard. And he kept faith with himself.’’ Bill lived a good life and was loved by anybody and everybody who knew him.

HONORING MR. MICHAEL MILONE 
HON. ELIZABETH H. ESTY 
OF CONNECTICUT  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 1, 2018 Ms. ESTY of Connecticut. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my friend Michael Milone and recognize his longtime service as Chesh-ire Town Manager. Michael will retire this com-ing June, and the Cheshire Chamber of Com-merce is honoring Michael at its awards dinner in my hometown of Cheshire, Connecticut for his service to our community over the past three decades. A longtime Cheshire resident and public servant, Michael joined the town’s government finance department thirty years ago, and his expertise in financial management has proven invaluable to our town and its elected leaders. He stepped up to become Town Manager al-most twenty years ago, and his long-term vi-sion has supported Cheshire’s success and ability to embrace the future. As a Town Councilor myself from 2005 to 2008, I had the pleasure of working closely with Michael, and I can testify to his dedication to the public, commitment to fiscal prudence, and knack for solving problems creatively. Michael’s leadership and accomplishments have not gone unnoticed in Cheshire—or out-side our town. Money Magazine and Con-necticut Magazine regularly laud Cheshire as one of America’s best small towns. Although our state has faced its share of economic challenges, under Michael’s commitment to fiscal responsibility, Cheshire has maintained a top credit rating from national rating agen-cies. Michael has also shared his time and ex-pertise with the next generation of leaders as a lecturer at the University of New Haven. Mi-chael’s legacy for our town will live on well after his retirement, and his commitment to re-sponsible leadership sets a tremendous exam-ple for our town’s—not to mention our state’s and country’s—future leaders. Mr. Speaker, Michael Milone has exempli-fied the best of what public servants bring to their roles. It is fitting and proper that we honor Michael here today, and I consider my-self lucky to count Michael as a friend and mentor. f 
RECOGNIZING THE PUBLIC SERVICE OF RON CARSON 
HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 1, 2018 Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to rise, on behalf of Congressman M
ORGAN GRIFFITH and myself, to recognize the achievements of Ron Carson who has made the plight of tens of thousands of disabled coal miners a central part of his life’s work. Through his decades of work directing three black lung clinics in Southwest Virginia, and tireless advocacy efforts across the coal fields of this country, he offered help and hope to miners whose lungs were irreversibly scarred with the scourge of black lung disease. Ron was born in Pennington Gap, Virginia during segregation. He attended a one-room primary school on land that his great-great- grandmother, Rachael Scott, had donated in 1939 for education of black children in Lee County. Ron and his wife Jill, a Member of the Town Council in Pennington Gap, founded the Appalachian African American Cultural Center in that same brick school house, which now preserves the life stories, history, heritage, cul-ture and events of African Americans in Southwest Virginia. Although segregated in housing and schools, African Americans found a measure of inclusion in Central Appalachia, where they were able to work free from the harsh conditions in the Deep South, and many received equal pay for their work mining coal. Ron worked for Westmoreland Coal Co. in Appalachia, Virginia as did his stepfather. His grandfather and great-grandfather both worked for many years for Blue Diamond Coal in Bonny Blue, Virginia. Ron later attended the Massachusetts School of Pharmacy, and in 1990 returned as an outreach worker in the black lung clinic operating out of the St. Charles Community Health Clinic. For the past 20 years he has served as the director of three black lung clinics which are now part of Stone Mountain Health Services. In addition to helping miners secure diagnostic tests, treat-ment and benefits counseling, Ron led an ef-fort to develop what is now the largest pro-gram for non-lawyers to successfully advocate for black lung benefits before the U.S. Depart-ment of Labor. There are very few attorneys who represent miners filing claims for black lung benefits. And, coal miners proceeding pro se are no match for the expert legal and medical re-sources that coal companies and insurers dedicate to each case. Ron and his team have worked to fill this void by providing training for clinics, doctors, lawyers and lay representa-tives in all 15 coal producing states. The lay advocates working for the Stone Mountain clinics have helped miners win over 2,000 black lung claims in the past 17 years. In recent years, Ron documented how min-ers with progressive massive fibrosis (PMF), the most advanced form of black lung disease, have flooded the clinics in southwestern Vir-ginia. Working with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), he recently co-authored an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association which verified an epidemic of this lethal form of the disease in Central Appalachia and helped to elevate national awareness. ‘‘Mining disasters get monuments, meanwhile black lung deaths get tombstones. And I’ve seen many a tomb-stone in the last 28 years from black lung,’’ he noted. At a roundtable Ron organized in Wise, Vir-ginia, disabled miners, physicians and lawyers explained how the current black lung adjudica-tion process keeps justice out of reach for far too many deserving miners and survivors. Ron Carson has been accessible to Mem-bers of Congress and provided wise counsel, as well as compassionate and enduring serv-ice to his community. He has been recognized by the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) and his peers in the black lung com-munity. On behalf of our colleagues in the House of Representatives, Congressman G
RIFFITH and I extend our appreciation for Ron’s service to those in need.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Isabel Lathrum of Winterset, Iowa, on the very spe-cial occasion of her 102nd birthday on Feb-ruary 26, 2018. Our world has changed a great deal during the course of Isabel’s life. Since her birth, we have revolutionized air travel and walked on the moon. We have invented the television, cellular phones, and the internet. We have fought in wars overseas, seen the rise and fall of Soviet communism, and witnessed the birth of new democracies. Isabel has lived through nineteen United States Presidents and twenty- four Governors of Iowa. In her lifetime, the population of the United States has more than tripled. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to represent Isa-bel in the United States Congress and I’m proud to recognize her today on this momen-tous occasion. I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating her and in wishing her nothing but continued happiness.

HONORING MR. SHELDON DILL

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my friend Sheldon Dill, who the Cheshire Chamber of Commerce is celebrating upon his retirement at its awards dinner in my hometown of Cheshire, Con-necticut. Sheldon has served as President of the Cheshire Chamber of Commerce for the past twelve years, and his leadership has proven invaluable through the challenges that our town, state, and nation have faced. Sheldon has led an impressive career in public service. He served on the Cheshire Town Council, in fact, I took over his position on the Council in 2005, and his ability to work with members of both political parties earned him the respect both of his fellow councilmembers and of our entire town. Cheshire residents know Sheldon as a dedi-cated and creative problem solver who is al-ways willing to advocate for our town. As President of the Chamber of Commerce, Sheldon has been a strong advocate for Cheshire’s small businesses and has worked to keep the American Dream a reality for fami-lies in our community. The past decade has seen big changes in Connecticut, but Sheldon has made sure Cheshire’s businesses have a strong voice. He leaves behind a legacy of service to our town, and his commitment to Cheshire sets a high bar for the rest of us working in public service to meet. I wish him a restful—and much deserved—retirement full of time spent with his loved ones. Mr. Speaker, Sheldon Dill has served the Cheshire community as an elected official, a volunteer, and an advocate for our business community. His leadership as President of the Cheshire Chamber of Commerce for the last twelve years has made our community strong-er and better able to lead in the 21st Century. It is proper that we honor him here today. f

GEORGE T. SANDERS COMPANY 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 1, 2018 Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and applaud the George T. Sanders Company for receiving the 2018 Commerce City Business on the Move Award. The Business on the Move Award recog-nizes businesses bringing new employment, growth in sales, or new capital investment to Commerce City. The George T.

I extend my deepest congratulations to the George T. Sanders Company for this well-de-served recognition by Commerce City. IN RECOGNITION OF THE VICTIMS OF THE SUMGAIT POGROMS HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 1, 2018 Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 30th Anniversary of the Sumgait pogroms, one of the most horrific at-tacks against the Armenian people committed at the hands of Azerbaijanis. On February 27, 1988, up to 200 Armenian civilians living in the city of Sumgait in Azer-baijan were indiscriminately killed, raped, maimed, and even burned alive for no reason other than their ethnicity. This senseless vio-lence was instigated by hostile, anti-Armenian rhetoric from Azerbaijani citizens and officials against these innocent individuals. For three decades, Azerbaijan has taken steps to cover up these crimes against hu-manity and dismiss the atrocities at Sumgait. Even more disturbing is that perpetrators of these events and similar violent attacks have since been lauded as national heroes. I condemn these horrific attacks. Tragically, the Azerbaijani government’s approach toward the Armenian people has not changed much since these attacks were perpetrated. In 2018, we hear the same violent rhetoric and witness the intimidation tactics by the Azerbaijani gov-ernment against the people of Nagorno Karabakh. If we do not condemn crimes against hu-manity, we only strengthen the resolve of those seeking to perpetrate these crimes in the future. The Armenian people have known this for too long, as we prepare to commemo-rate the 103rd Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide in April. I will continue to work with my colleagues on the Congressional Armenian Issues Cau-cus to remember the victims of the pogroms at Sumgait and to condemn all acts of violence against people who are targeted simply be-cause of their existence. I hope my colleagues will join me in rejecting violent rhetoric and in-timidation by renewing our commitment to achieving a collective and lasting peace.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Ian Kuehl, a student from Lena- Winslow High School, for earning the Class 1 A wrestling title for the Illinois State Cham-pionship in the 285lb weight class.

CELEBRATING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF ARIZONA PBS 
HON. RUBEN GALLEGO 
OF ARIZONA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 1, 2018 Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recog-nize the outstanding contributions made by Ar-izona PBS and to celebrate its long history of service to the children of the City of Phoenix and the State of Arizona. Arizona PBS is dedicated to supporting stu-dents, families and educators with content fo-cused on national, common core and state standards. Since 2010, the Arizona PBS Educational Outreach team has reached nearly 750,000 families and more than 60,000 teachers and teachers-in-training across the state through large-scale events and special community de-velopment workshops. In addition, Arizona PBS provides edu-cational assets through the Arizona PBS LearningMedia online portal in English, Span-ish and Navajo, as well as professional devel-opment services to help guide individuals into careers in early childhood education. I am especially grateful for PBS’s efforts to help families from diverse backgrounds to pre-pare their children to enter kindergarten by providing free online apps and games as well as off-screen activities for early learning. Last month, Arizona PBS launched a 24/7 children’s channel, Arizona PBS KIDS, fea-turing an array of programming to help young children master important skills, ranging from reading and basic math and science to prob-lem solving and emotional skills. This new channel is available over the air and online to educate, entertain and inspire children of all backgrounds across Arizona. In closing, I want to recognize an event held in my district on February 17, 2018 in which PBS invited children and families to the heart of downtown to celebrate education, commu-nity and exploration. Mr. Speaker, I also want to once again pay tribute to the outstanding work of Arizona PBS in helping to mold the young minds and future leaders of our great state.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF FRANCISCO CHARGUALAF MENO 
HON. MADELEINE Z. BORDALLO 
OF GUAM  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 1, 2018 Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Francisco C. Meno. Francisco was a proud son of Guam, faithful public servant, and a dear friend. He was born on November 28, 1939 to Felipe Q. and Fidela Chargualaf Meno, and he passed away on February 6, 2018 at the age of 78. Francisco graduated from George Wash-ington High School and went on to marry the love of his life, Rosa Rivera Meno. Together with Rosa, Francisco cared for his children and provided for his family. He was a member of Guam’s greatest generation who survived the occupation of Guam during World War II. Francisco went on to serve our local commu-nity as a fire fighter with the Guam Fire De-partment. He was fondly known as ‘‘Chief,’’ served in the Guam Fire Department for thirty years, retiring in 1988 as the department’s Fire Chief. In addition to his career as a fire fighter, Francisco was a skilled carpenter, mason, and fisherman. He was recognized by the Guam Council on the Arts and Humanities Agency as a Master of Chamorro Tradition as a ‘‘Master Kakahat Sagualle’’ or ‘‘Master Hut Builder.’’ Francisco’s huts were a part of many special celebrations throughout the island. He also graciously passed on his knowledge of hut building to all those who were willing to learn. Francisco was a firm believer of the need to pass down the traditions and culture of the Chamorro people. He also gave his time and talent to build many things for his village par-ish of St. Joseph Catholic Church in Inarajan. Francisco’s true passion in life was fishing. Francisco was known as a skilled fisherman and always shared his catch with family and friends. His involvement in village events and service in public safety were testaments of his leadership and commitment to the community of Guam. I am deeply saddened by the passing of Francisco C. Meno, and my thoughts and prayers are with his family, loved ones and friends. I join the people of Guam in cele-brating his life and remembering his many contributions to our island and his village of Inarajan. I extend my condolences to his wife Rosa, their children Frank, Joseph, Rosanne, Kurt, Brian, Dorinda, Melanie, Roderick, Vanessa, and numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren. He will be deeply missed, and his memory will live on in the hearts of the people of Guam. f

OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 1, 2018 Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an exceptional young Australian who is currently interning in my Washington D.C. office. Kristy Baxter came to our office as part of the Uni-Capitol Washington Internship Programme (UCWIP) and has been a valuable contributor to our efforts on behalf of New York’s Tenth Congressional District. UCWIP has worked with congressional of-fices to foster strong ties and understanding between the United States and Australian gov-ernments by bringing the best and the bright-est from top Australian universities to intern on Capitol Hill. I am proud to have personally hosted 14 Australians since 2003—each bring-ing their own unique outlooks on policy and desire to contribute. Kristy, a student from Deakin University, studying a Bachelor of International Studies, has interned in our office since January and has quickly proved herself to be a highly valu-able member of our team. Over the past weeks, it has been a pleasure to see her swiftly develop into an increasingly confident and pro-active individual. Her innate curiosity to learn, matched with her willingness to work hard, saw her tasked with researching Medi-care and the healthcare industry, tax havens and financial secrecy as well as attending for-eign affairs briefings on difficulties with post- conflict transition in Colombia and the involve-ment of the U.S. intelligence community in Sudan. Kristy is an exceptionally calm and af-fable presence in the office and encounters everyone she meets with respect. Through

Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize and honor Mr. Trenton ‘‘Trent’’ Jerome McCluskey on the occasion of his re-tirement as the Jail Administrator for Walker County, Alabama back on February 1, 2018. I am proud to recognize Mr. McCluskey for his many years of public service to our area. He is truly a man who embodies the American principles of hard work and devotion to one’s community, state and nation. Mr. Trent McCluskey is a native of Jasper, Alabama and a graduate of Walker High School. After graduating high school, he at-tended Walker State Technical College and then earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from International Bible College in 1985. He re-ceived a Criminal Justice Certificate from the University of Alabama in 1997 and his Juris Doctorate from the Birmingham School of Law in 2000. Trent began his career in corrections in 1991 working for the State of Alabama Depart-ment of Corrections. His career could have ended prematurely in 1993 when he was stabbed by an inmate and thrown from the second tier of the William E. Donaldson Cor-rectional Facility. However, after an 18-month recovery period, he returned to work at the Walker County Jail in 1995. In 1999, one year after the completion of the new jail, he was named as the Jail Administrator where he served until January, 2018. As Administrator, he supervised the daily operations including up to 290 inmates, 43 full-time employees and a $2.5 million dollar budget. Trent was also very active in his community and received a certificate of appreciation in 1997 from the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks.

OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 1, 2018 Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Judy Bland and her selfless contributions to the residents of Kane County, Illinois. For nearly 20 years, Ms. Bland has worked as a Victim Advocate for the Kane County State’s Attorney’s office. In 1996, Ms. Bland joined the office as an intern and soon after was offered a full-time position as Administrative Assistant. Less than two years later, she began working as a Vic-tim Advocate and was recently named as the Director of the Victims’ Rights Unit. Early in her career, she was asked to advocate for a mother whose 20-month-old daughter was a murder victim. Ms. Bland was there every step of the way and her persistence encouraged the mother to seek her own career as a para-legal. When the death sentence of Luther Casteel, who killed two and wounded 16 in Elgin, Illi-nois in 2001 was commuted, Ms. Bland per-sonally called the families of the victims and survivors informing them of what the Gov-ernor’s action meant. From Ms. Bland’s per-spective, everyone who witnessed the shoot-ing deserved a phone call. Ms. Bland helped coordinate crisis and grief counselors in the aftermath of the Northern Illinois University at-tack that killed five and wounded 17. Name a major crime or crisis in the last two decades and it is likely Ms. Bland helped people deal with the aftermath through her comfort, advo-cacy, and good counsel. It’s not an easy nor a glamorous job, but the important work that Ms. Bland has done has changed the lives of people when they were in the greatest need of support. Mr. Speaker, and distinguished colleagues; please join me in recognizing and thanking Ms. Judy Bland for her selfless contributions to the residents of Kane County, Illinois and her excellent example of public service.

ZIMBABWE AFTER MUGABE 
HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 1, 2018 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, yesterday we held a hearing on Zimbabwe. The hearing has been a long time in the mak-ing—for some 37 years since the birth of the modern nation of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe dominated the political landscape of this re-source rich and promising country, first as Prime Minister, then as President, always as Strongman. It was a 37-year rule which, sadly, betrayed the post-colonial aspirations of free-dom, one which was marked by misrule, mis-management and mistreatment of Mugabe’s fellow citizens. For many Zimbabweans, and for many years, envisioning a ‘‘Zimbabwe after Mugabe’’ was considered a fool’s errand. Elections—some more flawed than others— had come and gone, opportunities for reform fallen by the wayside, and through it all the domineering presence of one man haunted the dreams of his countrymen. Then, in a matter of weeks, culminating last November, the landscape changed. The once- invincible ruler in October 2017 set into motion a series of events which left him not only ousted from the Zimbabwe National Union-Pa-triotic Front party, or ZANU–PF, but pushed off his presidential perch. The drama began in earnest when Mugabe sought to prop up his wife Grace’s standing as his designated successor by ousting one of his two Vice Presidents, Emmerson Mnangagwa, presumably to elevate his wife to the position, while simultaneously moving against Mnangagwa’s allies in the government and in ZANU–PF, promoting a younger gen-eration aligned with Grace. Mnangagwa was part of an older faction in ZANU–PF, the generation that fought for lib-eration, with roots and strong connections in the military. As Rhodesian Bush War veterans and political survivors, Mnangagwa and his comrades could draw upon a reservoir of ex-perience and cunning; they were not to be so easily pushed aside. So while Mugabe sought to tighten the reigns of control in favor of his wife and her allies, the other Vice President and head of the Zimbabwe Defense Force, Constantino Chiwenga, made a bold statement on Novem-ber 13, saying in ‘‘matters of protecting our revolution, the military will not hesitate to step in.’’ This was declared ‘‘treasonous,’’ but be-fore Chiwenga himself could be arrested, the Zimbabwe Defense Forces did in fact step in and confined the long-serving President to his quarters while taking control of key points around the country. What followed were spontaneous popular demonstrations against Robert Mugabe, indi-cating that a spell had been broken. ZANU– PF convened a meeting which declared Mnangagwa to be interim leader of the party, and in the face of impeachment proceedings against Mugabe, the 93-year-old President re-luctantly stepped down, allowing Mnangagwa to assume the vacancy. This series of actions preserved a veneer of constitutional process, such that neither our country nor the African Union would label the events that took place a ‘‘coup;’’ indeed, if it were a coup, it was a popularly supported one, and one which sub-sequently received High Court ratification. So where does that leave us? Who is Emmerson Mnangagwa, the man who was sworn in as Zimbabwe’s President on Novem-ber 21? Critics call him ‘‘the Crocodile,’’ and recall his role as Mugabe’s right-hand man and con-fidant, including during the brutal period in the early 1980s, when in the newly independent nation Mugabe waged an internal campaign of repression against fellow revolutionary leader Joshua Nkomo, killing thousands of ethnic mi-nority Ndebele followers of Nkomo. During this time, Mugabe was assisted by military advi-sors from East Germany and North Korea, and by his Minister of State Security, one Emmerson Mnangagwa. Others, more charitably, admit that Mnangagwa was indeed once the Crocodile, but maintain that he has changed, undergoing a religious conversion to Evangelical Christi-anity. Indeed, his rhetoric since ascending to power has been reassuring, stating that he will restore democracy, rule of law, economic prosperity and trade while addressing endemic corruption. On the issue of land tenure, he said he would end the seizures of property that Mugabe had used to punish enemies and reward cronies. So we stand at a crossroads, perhaps fac-ing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity where Zimbabwe can chart a new course. Yet one cannot be Pollyanna, nor disregard the wise words of Pete Townshend, who once sang ‘‘Meet the new Boss, same as the old Boss . . . We won’t get fooled again.’’ On the issue of land seizures, for example, one notes that the newly-retired general and, as of December 28, 2017, the new Vice Presi-dent, Constantino Chiwenga—who issued the ‘‘treasonous’’ challenge that led to Mugabe’s ouster—is alleged to be a beneficiary of Mugabe’s past largess with other people’s land. Indeed, as we attempt to read the tea leaves and discern what the entrails portend, we will be assisted by a stellar panel. While the State Department is unable to send a wit-ness due to the immediacy of issues con-cerning the budget and Secretary Tillerson’s impending trip to Africa, we have with us a former Ambassador of the United States to Zimbabwe as well as one of the key imple-menters of our democracy promotion policy in Zimbabwe. We also have two Zimbabweans with us, who are extremely versed and in-volved in contemporary events in the country. Yesterday’s hearing looked at the prospects for true democratic and governance reform, as well as the potential restoration of rule of law. We truly hope that the arrival of a new gov-ernment signals an opportunity for establishing a mutually beneficial relationship between the United States and Zimbabwe, and that as the near future unfolds, events will allow us to re-evaluate some of the sanctions that were im-posed during the Mugabe years.

16TH DISTRICT CONGRESSIONAL TEACHERS AWARDS 
HON. VERN BUCHANAN 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, March 1, 2018 Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of outstanding public school teachers in Florida’s 16th Congressional Dis-trict. I was once told that children are 25 percent of the population, but they are 100 percent of the future. And it’s true. The education of a child is an investment, not only in that student, but in the future of our country. Therefore, I established the Congressional Teacher Awards to honor educators for their ability to teach and inspire students. An independent panel has chosen the fol-lowing teachers from Manatee, Sarasota, and Hillsborough counties for Florida’s 16th District 2018 Congressional Teacher Award for their accomplishments as educators: Ms. Michelle Brewster for her accomplish-ments as a sixth grade Math teacher at Eisen-hower Middle School. Ms. Karen Lewellen, for her accomplish-ments as a Math teacher at State College of Florida Collegiate School. Ms. Carrie Ling, for her accomplishments as a Math and Science teacher at Braden River Elementary School. Mr. Nelson Lopez for his accomplishments as an ELA and Journalism teacher Palmetto High School. Ms. Barb Rannigan, for her accomplish-ments as a third grade teacher at Alta Vista Elementary School. Ms. Es Swihart for her accomplishments as an English teacher at Riverview High School. Dr. Terri St. John for her accomplishments as an English teacher at Sarasota High School. Ms. Deborah Walker, for her accomplish-ments as a sixth grade Science teacher at Sarasota Military Academy Prep. On behalf of the people of Florida’s 16th District I congratulate each of these out-standing teachers and offer my sincere appre-ciation for their service and dedication.
