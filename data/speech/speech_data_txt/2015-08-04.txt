To the Lord, the Chief Shepherd and 
Saviour of our Souls: 
While Members of Congress are at 
home in their districts, we pray, give each Member rest. Cause them to lie down in green pastures. Lead them be-side the still waters. Restore and re-fresh their souls. Lead them in the paths of righteousness for Your name’s sake and our Nation’s benefit. 
While other Members are abroad, who 
may walk through the valley of the shadow of death, let them fear no evil. Assure them that You are near. Let Your rod and Your staff bring comfort. 
Prepare a table for all in the presence 
of their families. 
Anoint them with the oil of gladness. Finally, let them return to this 
Chamber to follow justice and justice alone so as to live and possess the land the Lord our God has given us. 
In Jesus Christ’s name, I now pray. Amen.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. Eternal God, our King, let the Earth 
rejoice and righteousness and justice strengthen the land we love. Lord, we live in a fugitive earthly scene, but it is permeated by Your eternal presence. Remind us that transiency will not have the last word in our universe. We are grateful that life’s changefulness is underlain and penetrated by Your un-changing purposes. 
Guide our Senators. In these days of 
upheaval, show them how to find the permanent amid the impermanent, the durable amid the fragile, and the truth amid the falsehood. 
Thank You for continuing to be the 
rock of our salvation, sustaining us in the best and worst of times. 
We pray in Your strong Name. Amen.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER

TON). The majority leader is recog-

f 
CYBER SECURITY 
Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
recently shared an AP news story with my colleagues, and I think it is worth sharing again. Here is the headline: ‘‘Federal Agen-
cies Are Wide Open to Hackers, Cyberspies.’’ 
I will read just a little bit of what it 
says. 
The federal government, which holds se-
crets and sensitive information ranging from nuclear blueprints to the tax returns of hun-dreds of millions of Americans, has for years failed to take basic steps to protect data from hackers and thieves, records show. In the latest example, the Office of Personnel Management is under fire for allowing its databases to be plundered by suspected Chi-nese cyberspies in what is being called one of the worst breaches in U.S. history. OPM re-peatedly neglected to implement basic cy-bersecurity protections, its internal watch-dog told Congress. 
That story should worry every one of 
us, Democrats and Republicans alike. The AP referred to the massive cyber attack that recently struck the Obama administration as ‘‘one of the worst breaches in U.S. history.’’ But while this massive breach may have been ‘‘one of the worst,’’ it certainly—unless the administration can be rescued from the cyber security Dark Ages—will not be the last. 
So the Senate will be considering bi-
partisan cyber security legislation this week that would help the public and private sectors defeat cyber attacks. The modern tools it contains, through the sharing of threat information, would provide for the construction of stronger defenses. The top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee says this bipartisan bill would also protect ‘‘individual privacy and civil lib-erties.’’ She is right. It contains strong measures to limit the use, retention, and diffusion of consumers’ personal information. Information sharing with the government would also be vol-untary under this bipartisan legisla-tion. 
No wonder my colleague from Cali-
fornia joined virtually every other Democrat and every other Republican to endorse this bipartisan bill over-whelmingly in committee 14 to 1. No wonder this bipartisan bill is backed by 
a diverse coalition of supporters, too— everyone from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to farm supply stores, to your local community bank. 
This is a strong bipartisan, trans-
parent bill that has been meticulously vetted by both parties in committee and that has been available online for literally months for anyone to read. My friend the Democratic leader has also publicly declared that the Senate could finish this bill in ‘‘a couple of days.’’ 
‘‘In a couple of days,’’ he said, ‘‘at 
the most.’’ 
So with cooperation, we can pass the 
bipartisan bill this week. There will also be an opportunity for Members of both parties to offer amendments. I urge colleagues who wish to do so to begin working with the bill managers right now. 
This legislation is the work of many 
Members. I mentioned Ranking Mem-ber F
EINSTEIN earlier, who has been a 
key player on this issue. I also wish to thank Chairman B
URR for his strong 
leadership and his hard work across the aisle in developing this bipartisan bill. I urge the Senate to allow us to act and pass it this week. 
The House of Representatives has al-
ready passed two similar White House- backed cyber security bills. The sooner we pass ours, the sooner we conference with the House to finally get a good cyber security law on the books, and the sooner our country can be better protected from more of these types of attacks. 
f 
NUCLEAR AGREEMENT WITH IRAN 
Mr. M CCONNELL. Mr. President, this 
September, the Senate will formally weigh in on the nuclear deal struck be-tween the White House and Iran. We will take a vote and answer a simple but powerful question: Will the agree-
ment actually make America and its allies safer? When we do, the Senate, as an institution, will be put to the test.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6248 August 4, 2015 
The first test will come in which an-
swer we arrive at. Some might take the view that releasing billions of dollars to a state sponsor of terrorism while leaving the regime with thousands of nuclear centrifuges, an advanced re-search and development program, and the means to improve its full-spectrum warfighting capability would represent an acceptable outcome. Those Senators will vote one way. 
Others will say that ending Iran’s nu-
clear program is worth the necessary exertion of political leadership—leader-ship to keep the coalition unified, to reveal Iran’s development of ballistic missiles and its support of terrorism, and to resolve the IAEA concerns over Tehran’s refusal to allow access to nu-clear scientists and facilities—because doing so would be in the best interests of our country and in the best interests of our allies. Those Senators will vote a different way. 
In answering this fundamental ques-
tion, every Senator will reveal his or her view of America’s standing, its leadership, and its capabilities in the modern world. They will demonstrate whether they think these things can and should be brought to bear to defend our interests and to defend against Iran’s aggressive expansion and its threatening nuclear program. 
We know that the next Senate and 
the next President will continue to be faced with a threat posed by Iran. So we should conduct this debate with our eyes on the future. This is a critical test, but it is not the only one. The other test comes not in which answer we choose but in how we answer the question. 
Can we join together to conduct a de-
bate worthy of the importance of this agreement? 
Can we call up the resolution and re-
spectfully debate it without employing delay tactics designed specifically to impede the Senate’s review of such a weighty matter? 
Are Senators willing to focus on a 
matter of interest to the institution, defer committee activities, and sit in their chairs to truly listen and debate their colleagues on a matter of such significance? 
Nearly every Member of both parties 
voted to have this debate when they passed the Iran Nuclear Agreement Re-view Act. Surely, Senators wouldn’t then turn around and block a proper debate from even proceeding. 
My hope is that the Senate could 
reach agreement to call up the appro-priate resolution, reach agreement to allow ample time for Senators to ex-press their views, and then proceed to a thorough, thoughtful, and respectful debate, because it is hard to overstate the importance of what we are about to consider: our role in the world, our commitment to our allies, the kind of future we will leave our children. It is all wrapped up in this issue. 
The debate we will conduct deserves 
the appropriate and respectful delib-eration that this body was designed to facilitate. Every Senator owes as much 
to this institution, and every Senator owes as much to this country and to the people we serve. 
We may disagree on the first test, 
but we should all agree on the second one.

f 
NUCLEAR AGREEMENT WITH IRAN 
Mr. REID. Mr. President, I agree 
with the Republican leader that we should work to come up with a way of proceeding in a dignified manner to this most important piece of legisla-tion. Certainly, I would lend my efforts to try to get that done. It is easier said than done, with the feelings on both sides of the aisle on this issue and other issues. 
f 
CLEAN POWER PLAN 
Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday 
President Obama took a very impor-tant step in addressing climate change and promoting clean energy. His Clean Power Plan is the strongest action ever taken by our government to fight cli-mate change. The Clean Power Plan would reduce the dangerous amounts of carbon pollution being pumped into the atmosphere. By reducing pollution, the Clean Power Plan would yield signifi-cant public health benefits for our en-tire Nation. 
Carbon pollution has many dev-
astating effects on our environment, as well as the health and well-being of all of us. Sadly, pollution from burning fossil fuels disproportionately affects low-income people and families of color. Exposure to air pollution can ag-gravate preexisting health problems, especially respiratory maladies such as asthma. 
For millions of Americans, carbon 
pollution affects their ability to breathe and exacerbates the problems they have with asthma. Consider these facts. Minority and lower income Americans are far more likely to live near coal-fired powerplants. Statis-tically, that is terribly accurate. Afri-can Americans are three times more likely to be hospitalized from asthma. African-American children have an 80- percent higher rate of asthma and are roughly three times more likely to die from asthma than their White peers. Roughly half of Latinos live in areas that frequently violate clean air rules, and Hispanic children are 40 percent more likely to die from asthma than non-Hispanic Whites. 
In Nevada, just a short distance out 
of Las Vegas, about 35 miles, there is an Indian reservation. Approximately 30 years ago, NV Energy—Nevada Power—built this huge coal-fired gen-erator there. Over the more than three decades it has been in existence, tens of 
millions of tons of coal have been burnt in that powerplant. It is a football field away from the reservation. Those Na-tive Americans have been really sick as a result of that. Now there has been a court settlement that gives them a little bit of economic strength as a re-sult of this, and, to its credit, NV Ener-gy’s new ownership has decided it is going to phase out that plant very quickly. That is good for the health of those Native Americans. 
Today the plant is being decommis-
sioned and solar is being built on the tribe’s reservation. It is wonderful to see that. They have a lot of jobs, and it is giving some economic viability, in addition to the court settlement I just talked about. 
President Obama put it best yester-
day: ‘‘If you care about low-income, minority communities, try protecting the air they breathe.’’ That is exactly what the President’s plan will do. It will clean the air we breathe, help curb health care costs, and improve the quality of life for all Americans. But that is not all. 
As the plan is implemented, we will 
see even more investment in clean and renewable energy, which is not only good for the planet and our health, but it is good for the economy. The Clean Power Plan will boost renewable en-ergy by 30 percent over the next 15 years, cutting pollution but, of course, creating tens of thousands of jobs for all Americans. President Obama’s plan encourages programs and incentives to make American homes more efficient and lower consumers’ utility bills. 
Under the Clean Energy Incentive 
Program, a jump start in new jobs is expected from construction and instal-lation of renewable energy and effi-ciency upgrades. This will incentivize new clean energy development and job creation before the new carbon stand-ards even go into effect. 
It has been disappointing, but not 
surprising, to see Republicans’ knee- jerk opposition to addressing climate change. It is all the more frustrating because they have no plan of their own, except to let the smoke keep billowing. Instead, Republicans are clamoring to show special interests such as the oil baron Koch brothers how far they are willing to go to kill commonsense pro-tections for our air and public health because it might hurt the bottom line of their coal and energy barons. 
Last month, House Republicans 
passed legislation that would rescind President Obama’s action addressing air pollution and climate change. Sen-ate Republicans, for their part, are try-ing the same thing with policy riders in the Senate Interior and Environ-ment appropriations bill. 
Republicans would leave our children 
and grandchildren to pay the dev-astating costs of climate change. The 
Republicans have no solutions. They are afraid to acknowledge that climate change is a problem. It is. 
President Obama’s Clean Power Plan 
is good for this country. It is the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6249 August 4, 2015 
strongest action we can take today to 
ensure a cleaner, healthier tomorrow for our children and grandchildren, and it has to be done administratively. We can’t get anything done legislatively. It is all opposed by the Republicans. 
It would be good for my State of Ne-
vada, where investment in clean energy is $6 billion. President Obama’s plan gives States further flexibility to tai-lor programs for reducing carbon emis-sions while protecting public health and keeping electricity affordable and reliable. 
Already the plan has wide support in 
Nevada. An article from the Associated Press yesterday reads: 
Several Nevada government business lead-
ers plan to voice support for a federal cam-paign to limit carbon pollution from power plants around the nation in an effort to ad-dress global climate change. . . . Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval’s energy chief, Paul Thomsen, says Nevada is well-posi-tioned to comply with the first national lim-its on carbon dioxide from existing power plants. 
Nevada understands the benefits 
clean energy brings to communities and the lives that will be improved by cleaning the air we breathe. Nevada is at the forefront of clean energy in the United States. Over the past decade, our clean energy infrastructure has ex-panded substantially, bringing good- paying jobs and new industries to Ne-vada. There can be no better place for President Obama to begin a dialogue with the Nation about the Clean Power Plan than Nevada. 
I am looking forward to President 
Obama’s visit to Nevada later this month to speak at the National Clean Energy Summit in Las Vegas on Au-gust 24. This is the 8th annual National Clean Energy Summit.

CYBER SECURITY 
Mr. REID. Mr. President, we all want 
to address cyber security. Repeatedly, in the last two Congresses, I worked to convene the chairmen and ranking members of the relevant committees to move cyber security legislation, and we worked hard and came up with a num-ber of bills, one of which we brought to the floor and was killed by the Repub-licans. What was good for our Nation’s security was bad for the tea party and the Republicans. They blocked the cyber security legislation. 
In this Congress, we have not been as 
uncooperative as the Republicans were when they were in the minority. Demo-crats are willing to proceed to the cyber security bill, if we can get assur-ance that Democrats can offer relevant amendments. It has to be done. 
For the majority leader to say, as he 
did here today, that well, on this mas-sive bill we had, I stuck the cyber secu-rity bill with a lot of other things—he knew it wouldn’t work there. It was only to check it off his list that he tried to do it. Realistically, we have al-ready been on this legislation. We should have been on this legislation. The Republican leader could have pro-
ceeded to cyber security instead of a politically motivated bill to defund ac-cess to health care for women. Unlike Republicans, we don’t need all the poi-son pill amendments that deal with dif-ferent subjects. 
Democrats have amendments rel-
evant to cyber security, and we must offer those. I have received a letter from Senators W
YDEN , L EAHY , 
FRANKEN , WHITEHOUSE , and C OONS yes-
terday that states: 
We understand that the Senate may soon 
consider the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act. We share the view that increas-ing the security of U.S. networks while pro-tecting Americans’ privacy is an important goal, and while we have different views on this legislation, we are all interested in of-fering relevant amendments that we believe would improve this bill in various ways. 
We look forward to working with you to 
ensure that there is an adequate process for considering a reasonable number of amend-ments. 
The way Republican Senators used to 
talk about an open amendment proc-ess, our request to have a few relevant amendments should be readily accept-ed by the Republicans. But then, look-ing at how the Republican leader has led the Senate this year, there is plen-ty of reason for Democrats to be con-cerned. 
Just look at the bill the Senate just 
considered last week—a major highway bill with more than 1,000 pages. The Republican leader filled the amend-ment tree twice, not allowing any amendments to be offered. Accord-ingly, if you look at what the Congres-sional Research Service says, the Re-publican leader could potentially fill the amendment tree more times than any other majority leader has done in the first year of a Congress. So far he has done that more than I ever did. 
Nevertheless, Democrats will work 
with Republicans to get on this bill and consider a reasonable number of impor-tant amendments. I hope the Repub-licans will cooperate with us. 
Would the Chair announce the busi-
ness of the day.

REPUBLICAN-LED SENATE 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, while Re-
publicans were campaigning last fall, we promised the American people that 
if they put us in charge, we would get the Senate working again. That wasn’t a campaign slogan. That was a com-mitment. 
I am proud to report that we are de-
livering on that promise. The first 7 months of the 114th Congress have been some of the most productive the Sen-ate has had in a long time. We have passed more than 70 bills to help strengthen our economy, reform our government, protect some of the most vulnerable, and strengthen our na-tional security. 
We passed bipartisan legislation to 
authorize the Keystone Pipeline, a val-uable infrastructure project that would support more than 42,000 jobs during construction and invest $5.3 billion in the U.S. economy, all without spending a dime of taxpayer money. 
We passed a bipartisan bill to 
strengthen our efforts to eradicate human trafficking in this country and to help its victims. This legislation, which passed the Senate with unani-mous support from Democrats and Re-publicans and was signed into law in May, gives law enforcement new tools to target traffickers, including in-creased access to wiretaps, and it sig-nificantly expands the resources avail-able to trafficking victims as they seek to rebuild their lives. 
As negotiations with Iran over a nu-
clear agreement were repeatedly ex-tended and as reports of significant compromises emerged, Democrats and Republicans alike grew concerned that the administration would fail to nego-tiate a deal that would be strong enough to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. To address these concerns, the Senate passed the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. This legislation, which passed the Senate with overwhelming support from Democrats and Republicans and was signed into law by President Obama, was designed to ensure that the Amer-ican people, through their elected rep-resentatives, would have a voice in any deal with Iran. 
Without the Iran Nuclear Agreement 
Review Act there would be no oppor-tunity for an up-or-down vote on this deal in Congress and no way to prevent the President from immediately waiving the sanctions that Congress put in place. Congress is currently re-viewing the final agreement announced by the President, an agreement that has been greeted, I might add, with bi-partisan skepticism. We will be holding a vote on this deal in September. 
Increasing access to jobs and expand-
ing opportunities for American work-ers is a priority of the Republican-led Congress. In May, with the support of 14 Democrats, the Republican-led Sen-ate passed legislation to reauthorize trade promotion authority, which is key to securing trade deals that are fa-vorable to American workers and busi-nesses. Since 2009, increasing exports have accounted for more than 1.6 mil-lion new jobs in the United States.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6250 August 4, 2015 
Manufacturing jobs that depend on ex-
ports pay an average of 13 to 18 percent more than other jobs in the economy. Thanks to the bipartisan trade pro-motion authority legislation, the ad-ministration now has a key tool to ne-gotiate trade agreements that will cre-ate more good-paying jobs for Amer-ican workers and open new markets for 
products labeled ‘‘Made in the U.S.A.’’ 
After taking up bipartisan legislation 
to protect our economy, the Senate turned to another key Republican pri-ority; that is, supporting our military men and women. The National Defense Authorization Act, which we consid-ered in June, passed the Senate with strong bipartisan support. In addition to authorizing the funding our military needs to defend our Nation, this bill contains a number of reforms that will expand the resources available to our military men and women and strength-en our national security. 
Among other things, this legislation 
targets $10 billion in unnecessary spending and redirects those funds to military priorities such as funding for aircraft and weapons systems and mod-ernization of Navy vessels. It imple-ments sweeping reforms to the mili-tary’s outdated acquisitions process by removing bureaucracy and expediting decisionmaking. That will signifi-cantly improve the military’s ability to access the technology and equip-ment it needs. It replaces the outdated military retirement system with a modern system that will extend retire-ment benefits to 75 percent of our serv-icemembers. 
During the month of July, the Senate 
built on its bipartisan achievements with two important pieces of legisla-tion: the Every Child Achieves Act and the DRIVE Act. The Every Child Achieves Act, which passed the Senate by an overwhelming margin, reauthor-izes Federal K–12 education programs and revokes problematic Federal man-dates such as those that resulted in the phenomenon of overtesting. This legis-lation restores control of education to those who know students the best, such as parents, teachers, and local school boards. 
The DRIVE Act, which passed the 
Senate by a strong bipartisan margin, is notable because it is the first Trans-portation bill in almost a decade to provide more than 2 years of funding for our Nation’s infrastructure needs. Around the country, hundreds of thou-sands of people and hundreds of thou-sands of jobs depend on the funding contained in Transportation bills. When Congress fails to provide the nec-essary certainty about the way trans-portation funding will be allocated, States and local governments are left without the certainty that they need to authorize projects or make long- term plans for transportation infra-structure. That means that essential construction projects get deferred, nec-essary repairs may not get made, and jobs that depend on transportation are put in jeopardy. The DRIVE Act will give States and local governments the 
certainty they need to plan for and commit to key infrastructure projects. 
Every bill I have discussed today 
passed the Senate with strong bipar-tisan support. One major reason for that is Senate Republicans’ commit-ment to opening up the legislative process here in the Senate. Under Democratic control, the legislative process of the Senate had almost ground to a halt. Instead of being de-veloped in committee, bills were fre-quently drafted behind closed doors, and not only the minority party but many rank-and-file Democrats were shut out of the process. 
When Republicans took control of 
the Senate in January, we changed all that. We opened up the committee process and debate on the floor. We made it a priority to ensure that every Senator—every Senator—both Demo-cratic and Republican, has an oppor-tunity to make his or her voice heard. During 2014, the Democratic leadership allowed just 15 amendment rollcall votes in the entire year—2014. Repub-licans allowed more than 15 amend-ment rollcall votes in our first month. So far this year, we have allowed more than 165 amendment rollcall votes, and we still have 5 months to go in the year. The Republican-led Senate has accomplished a lot over the past 7 months. But we know that we have a lot more to do. 
As the 114th Congress continues, we 
will continue to fight for the American people’s priorities. We hope the Demo-crats here in the Senate will continue to join us.

CYBER SECURITY 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, as I like 
to say, there are only two types of companies: those that have been hacked and those that know they have been hacked. This was recently seen at JPMorgan Chase. Last summer the company suffered a cyber attack that involved the theft of contact informa-tion for about 76 million households. In the aftermath, JPMorgan Chase is ex-pected to double its budget for cyber security efforts this year. But the case of JPMorgan is not unique nor a sim-ply cautionary tale for other major companies. 
In the last few months, we have seen 
one of the largest cyber attacks on our Nation’s technology infrastructure and other major cyber breaches affecting our financial and transportation sec-tor. I share these comments in the con-text of having worked as an executive for a cloud computing company for 12 
years prior to serving in the Senate. In the midst of these attacks, we see rad-ical Islamic terrorists infiltrating American social media networks to re-cruit Americans to join them as jihadists overseas. 
We must work to address these chal-
lenges, and our response must be meas-ured as well as thoughtful, not only about the immediate threats to our cyber infrastructure but also to the long-term effects on our national secu-rity and our constitutional freedoms. As we are seeing with the European Union, after years of debate, the EU is currently working on a policy to en-sure their citizens are notified of cyber breaches within 72 hours and that vic-tims of these attacks are notified with-out undue delay. 
This is the type of response we need 
in the United States, much like the no-tification reforms that I have worked for in Congress. On a near daily basis, we see headlines in our major news-papers that underscore the absolute importance of creating a concrete timeline for implementing timely noti-fication standards. 
Having spent more than 12 years 
working on technology, I know first-hand the power that Big Data holds. I also understand the importance of set-ting standards and clear guidelines. As we always said in 28 years of business, if you aim at nothing, you will hit it. It is important that we not only expect more but that we also inspect. We want to be assured that guidelines are being followed. 
It is unacceptable that any American 
is left in the dark when their person-ally identifiable information or PII may have been breached. That is why I have been fighting to strengthen notifi-cation requirements and ensure that the American people know when their personal information is compromised. When I was running customer service operations at RightNow Technologies and looking out for our customers, when we had a problem, our policy was that we notified our customers as soon as we were aware of the problem. Maybe we did not always understand the magnitude at the time of the prob-lem, but we believed we owed it to our customers to get back to them as soon as possible. 
The customers, the consumers of this 
country, should be served in a similar way. But as the Senate prepares to consider cyber security reforms, we also need to strike the right balance between protecting our cyber security infrastructure and the personal infor-mation of Americans, while also pro-tecting the constitutional rights and the liberty of the American people. We must protect our Nation’s security while also preserving our civil lib-erties. 
We must remain vigilant. We must 
ensure that we have robust and trans-parent debate about cyber protection and what reforms must be implemented to protect American civil liberties. We

see some of these protections in the 
legislation I cosponsored, spearheaded by Senators M
IKELEEand P ATLEAHY . 
The Electronic Communications Pri-vacy Act Amendments Act of 2015 mod-ernizes our Nation’s electronic privacy laws and brings protections against warrantless searches into harmony with the technological realities of the 21st century. 
The protections currently on the 
books may have been robust in 1986 when the ECPA was written, but they do not adequately defend our citizens against the mass data storage that cur-rently exists. Nobody in 1986 would have ever envisioned where we are today as to the massive amount of data that is collected and stored today on the American people. This bill ensures that the Federal Government gives our law enforcement officials the tools they need, while ensuring that Mon-tanans and the American people are not subjected to invasive and unwar-ranted searches. 
Privacy and security both matter. I 
believe we can find a balance that pro-tects both. I urge my colleagues to join me in finding reforms that stop cyber criminals from infiltrating our secu-rity networks and also preserve the privacy and the civil liberties that Montanans and Americans hold dear. 
f 
THE ADMINISTRATION’S CLEAN 
POWER PLAN AND COAL 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I would 
like to shift gears for a moment and share some comments about President Obama’s news that he made yesterday with the EPA. Yesterday, President Obama and the ‘‘Employment Preven-tion’’ Agency, the EPA, continued to wage their war on American energy, American families, and American jobs. As President Obama was announcing his plan to devastate Montana’s coal industry and the good-paying jobs it provides, yet another coal company filed for bankruptcy. 
At the same time, the J.E. Corette 
powerplant, in my home State of Mon-tana in Billings, is being dismantled as we speak in the aftermath of President Obama’s previous anti-coal regulation. In addition to supporting 30 jobs, the Corette powerplant has powered tens of thousands of Montana homes and con-tributed several million dollars in tax revenue to Montana and Yellowstone County every year. 
Over the past year, Montanans have 
braced themselves for the release of the Obama administration’s final regu-lations, which were already set to wreak havoc on our coal industry and make construction of any new coal- fired plant virtually impossible. The proposed rule was bad. The final rule is even more devastating to Montana jobs and to Montana families. 
The final rule announced by the 
Obama administration makes the re-tirement of existing coal-fired power-plants inevitable within the next few decades. The rules moved the goalposts and, I 
might add, to the wrong end of the field. These rules will most likely lead to the shuttering of Montana’s Colstrip Power Plant and countless others across the Nation. It would be dev-astating for our economy and hard- working families across the State. 
Energy rates will increase. Thou-
sands of Montana family-wage jobs would be lost. Critical tax revenue for schools, for our teachers, roads, and our infrastructure would evaporate. In the Obama administration’s final rule, they took an already bad rule and they made it worse. 
The so-called Clean Power Plan 
forces Montana to achieve even more aggressive standards than originally proposed. According to POLITICO, in 2012 Montana produced 2,481 carbon pounds per megawatt hour. 
Under the President’s plan, by 2030, 
he wants Montana to produce only 1,305 carbon pounds per megawatt hour. That is a 47.4-percent reduction in Montana’s carbon emissions because in Montana more than half of our elec-tricity comes from coal. In fact, my mobile device is powered by coal. Coal also powers good-paying jobs for thou-sands of Montanans, including Mon-tana tribal members and union work-ers, and generates nearly $120 million in tax revenue every year. 
America is poised to lead the world’s 
energy needs, but this will be done through American innovation, through American ingenuity, not more regula-tions. The Obama administration’s reg-ulations are completely out of touch with global realities, and this is why: Global demand for coal-fired energy will not disappear, even if the United States shuts down every last coal mine and coal-fired powerplant. 
Nations such as China, Korea, and 
Japan will continue using coal as it is reliable and it is affordable. These na-tions should be powered by cleaner Montana coal because the coal we produce in Montana is cleaner than Asian coal. 
In terms of the environmental pic-
ture for the world, we are better off using American coal, Montana coal— not coal from Asia. Rather than dis-missing this reality, the United States should be on the cutting edge of tech-nological advances in energy develop-ment and leading the way in promoting the use of clean, affordable American energy. 
In fact, according to the Inter-
national Energy Agency’s 2013 data, the world consumes about 6 billion 
metric tons of steam coal for power generation. Of that, the United States consumes 750 million metric tons. 
Let’s put that into apples-to-apples 
comparison. That means the United States consumes about 12 percent of the coal. The rest of the world con-sumes 88 percent. As the world sees an increased demand for power, it is clear we need to be leading the way in clean coal and energy innovation. 
The United States should be leading. 
Let’s be working toward clean coal, clean energy, and leading the world as 
our 12 percent could have an influence on the other 88 percent. 
America, we can and we should power 
the world, but we could only do it if the Obama administration steps back from its out-of-touch regulations and allows American innovation to thrive once again to not only lead America but to lead the world. 
I yield back the remainder of my 
time.

WASTEFUL SPENDING 
Mr. COATS. Mr. President, last week 
I delivered my 19th ‘‘Waste of the Week’’ and we actually reached our goal of $100 billion in savings for the taxpayer by identifying waste, fraud, and abuse. This was money spent by the Federal Government, money col-lected from hard-working earners who paid their taxes, sent them to Wash-ington, and expected they would be used for essential purposes, such as providing for our national security, supporting research at NIH for medical advances that would provide lifesaving techniques and medicines to Ameri-cans, funding the rebuilding of crum-bling bridges and highways, and any number of things the Federal Govern-ment is involved in that the American public agrees are essential functions that could be performed only by the Federal Government. 
What we want you to do though, they 
are saying, is be as efficient as you can. If there is excess money wasted on pro-grams that have no place in the Fed-eral budget, let’s identify those, let’s eliminate those, and either return our tax money and lower our tax rates or use it for something more essential. 
We have reached our goal of $100 bil-
lion of waste, fraud, and abuse identi-fied by nonpartisan agencies—not Re-publican agencies, not Democratic agencies or firms but nonpartisan agencies—that simply look at numbers, identify the projects, identify the spending, and ask the question: Do we truly need to do that? 
Particularly at a time when the def-
icit clock keeps ticking, when we con-tinue year after year after year to spend more than we take in, despite raising taxes, despite looking for ever more sources of income, it is clear we need to take the necessary steps not to spend more than is absolutely nec-essary to function on behalf of the American people. 
So today I am on the floor for speech 
No. 20. We reached the goal. It is just the beginning of August. The Senate has many more weeks in front of it, but we are going to keep going because it is amazing the amount of waste, fraud, and abuse that has been identi-fied by some of these nonpartisan groups looking at Federal expendi-tures. If we can add to our chart, I think we will have to add an extension to that chart or devise another one—

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6252 August 4, 2015 
perhaps put another gauge over here— 
because we are going to keep doing this every week the Senate is in session. 
Today, as I said, we are looking at 
No. 20. I looked at two agencies that exist in the Federal Government: the National Endowment for the Human-ities, NEH, and the National Endow-ment for the Arts, NEA. These two agencies are engaged in cultural projects. Some of these are—people would deem—somewhat essential, but we have looked at two agencies that we think ought to be identified today. 
The public probably will remember 
the 87th Academy Awards—better known as the Oscars—that took place in Hollywood a few months ago. Many Americans tune in and watch this high- profile event featuring America’s rich and famous. As always, a parade of ac-tors pull up in their stretch limousines and step into the bright lights of the entertainment industry’s media—the flashing lights, the march down the red carpet, and stop to have their pictures taken. There, in tailored tuxes and de-signer gowns—some of which cost, amazingly, over $100,000—everybody is trying to outdo everybody else. 
The bottom line is Hollywood is not 
short of money. As Americans watch this, they see the Oscars that are being offered. Then we look at that and say: What in the world is a $25,000 check from the Federal Government to Holly-wood doing in this process? 
It is hard to understand the concept 
that Hollywood needs support, needs a handout from the Federal Government, but they are developing an Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Holly-wood. Somehow they have applied for a $25,000 grant from the National Endow-ment for the Arts. Now, that is not a major amount compared to our budget problems here and the money we deal with, but the American public ought to be saying: Why in the world are we giv-ing a penny to Hollywood to support the building of a museum? 
It is simply because the process is 
open for anybody to submit for a grant. But who is reviewing these things? Who is looking at this? Does Hollywood truly need taxpayer money to con-struct a museum of motion pictures through the National Endowment for the Arts? 
We also discovered that the National 
Endowment for the Humanities got en-gaged in one of these efforts, spending considerably more—$914,000—to sup-port a conference entitled ‘‘What is Love? Romance Fiction in the Digital Age.’’ The conference was full of speak-ers networking with each other and even giving the opportunity for adults to design and color their own title page. 
Again, I am asking why. Why, given 
our $18.5 trillion debt growing every day, do we have to give away a nearly $1 million grant to support a con-ference on how in the digital age to de-velop romantic books? 
While it might be fun to go deeper 
into this and examine just exactly what goes on at this conference, that is 
not really why I am speaking on the floor today. I am simply here to ask why. Is this necessary? Is this the kind of thing we need to be supporting and doing with hard-earned taxpayer dol-lars that are sent to Washington, not for these purposes? 
So today, the cumulative runs close 
to $1 million—$939,000—of taxpayer sav-ings that would go onto our gauge, and we add yet another increment to the gauge in determining how tax dollars are spent. 
We are going to continue doing this. 
This is a small one today. You can see we had some major chunks and major dysfunctions in the Federal Govern-ment, but I think it is important for every Senator to be able to go home, talk to their people, and say: We are making every possible effort we can to be efficient and effective with the money you sent to Washington, and we are looking into every dollar to make sure it is spent on essential functions of the Federal Government. 
It is astounding how much is being 
sent, used, and wasted, how much fraud and waste takes place. We will con-tinue to identify that each week. 
That is our waste of the week. We 
will be back each week after our Au-gust recess when the Senate is in ses-sion to continue to identify ways in which we can save the taxpayers’ money.

FOR-PROFIT SCHOOLS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have 
come to the floor many times to talk about for-profit colleges and univer-sities. This is a problem and a chal-lenge we face. What you need to know are three numbers to understand the for-profit college and university indus-try in America. 
By way of preface, this is the most 
heavily subsidized private business in the United States of America. What are we talking about? The largest, the Uni-versity of Phoenix; Kaplan University; DeVry University; Rasmussen; Corin-thian—you have heard all the names because they advertise constantly, and the money they use to advertise comes from Federal taxpayers. 
There are three numbers—and if I 
were a college professor or law school professor, I would say this is going to be on the final—on for-profit colleges 
and universities. Ten percent of high school graduates attend for-profit col-leges and universities—10 percent. Twenty percent of all the Federal aid to education goes to for-profit colleges and universities. Why so much? They charge so much. Their tuition is so high. Ten percent of the students; 20 
percent of the Federal aid to education; 44 percent of all the student loan de-faults in America are at for-profit col-leges and universities. Ten percent of the students, 44 percent of the defaults. Why? They charge so much that the students can’t finish their education or they end up with a worthless diploma. That is the reality. 
There is a second reality. This indus-
try is in serious economic trouble. Last week we had news of another Federal investigation of a for-profit college. In a filing with the Securities and Ex-change Commission, the University of Phoenix—the largest for-profit college and university—revealed it is under in-vestigation by the Federal Trade Com-mission for unfair and deceptive prac-tices. 
This news comes just weeks after the 
Center for Investigative Reporting pub-lished a story about the University of Phoenix’s thinly veiled, dubious mar-keting and recruiting efforts on mili-tary bases—exploitation of our men and women in uniform. Over the past several years, the University of Phoe-nix has spent millions of dollars to sponsor events, including dances, par-ties, and concerts, on military bases. Is it because they love our men and women in uniform? No. It is because they want to sign them up. To the Uni-versity of Phoenix, these sponsorships were simply advertising and marketing events to enroll more men and women in uniform. 
When you serve our country, we show 
our appreciation by saying there is a GI bill waiting for you at the end of your service—in fact, in some cases, while you are still serving—and for your family, too, so that you will be prepared after you have served our country to have a good life with good education and training and job oppor-tunities. 
These for-profit colleges and univer-
sities can smell an opportunity to make even more money. The Univer-sity of Phoenix is after these men and women in uniform. They are after tui-tion assistance dollars. TA is a pro-gram that provides up to $4,500 a year, so servicemembers can use it toward a postsecondary education. And guess what. The money isn’t counted in the Federal 90/10 calculation that caps the amount of money these for-profit schools can receive from the Federal Government. Did you hear that? Nine-ty percent of their revenue comes from the Federal Government. That is why for-profit colleges and universities are the most heavily subsidized private for- profit businesses in America. To for- profit colleges, the money from serv-icemembers and veterans is unlimited

money. All they have to do is sign 
them up. And that is what they are doing with these sponsorships. 
After the article was published, I 
wrote to Secretary Ash Carter—De-
partment of Defense—to ask him to take action. The University of Phoenix reportedly is in clear violation of Exec-utive orders limiting the access of these schools to our men and women in uniform. The Department of Defense has confirmed to me they have opened an inquiry into the matter. 
During the Senate’s reconsideration 
of the National Defense Authorization Act, I filed an amendment to require the Department to post information on Federal and State investigations and lawsuits against schools on its online education resources for servicemem-bers. 
As part of the Tuition Assistance 
Program, the Department of Defense has created what it calls TA DECIDE. This allows servicemembers to find in-formation about specific schools when deciding where to use their tuition as-sistance benefits. It includes informa-tion such as the graduation and default rates. Do you know why? Because once that servicemember has used up that GI bill, it is gone. If they waste it on one of these for-profit colleges and uni-versities that give them little or noth-ing for their GI bill, they do not get a second chance. 
Of course, servicemembers need ac-
cesses to this information. Publicly traded companies such as the Univer-sity of Phoenix have to disclose the in-formation to the SEC when they are under investigation. Members of the military should know that, as well as the general public. It only makes sense. 
My amendment wasn’t taken up dur-
ing the Senate’s debate, but last week 12 Senators joined me in writing Sec-retary Carter. This commonsense step to ensure better information for serv-icemembers about their education op-tions is one the Department of Defense needs to make. 
I also want to say a word about an-
other for-profit college that is noto-rious for its exploitation of students— Ashford University. Ashford University first came to my attention when former Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa had an investigation. He took a look at this so-called university in his home State of Iowa. Do you know what he found? He found they had purchased a small Catholic girls college, purchased their accreditation, and then reopened it under the name ‘‘Ashford Univer-sity.’’ Do you know how many faculty members there were at Ashford? One faculty member for every 500 students. It wasn’t a real university; it was an online scam. They announced last week they are closing down their campus in Iowa. What a heartbreak that must be for the people of Iowa—to lose such a stalwart higher education citizen. That is the reality. 
I have run into students in Illinois 
who said they had just graduated from college. I said: Where did you go? 
They said: Ashford. And I thought, oh my goodness. What 
a disappointment. You have wasted your time and your money, you are deep in debt, and that diploma, sadly, is worth very little. 
The tide is turning against the for- 
profit colleges and universities. The question is whether this Senate, this Congress, this government will step up once and for all and defend those young men and women who are wasting their time and money and taxpayer dollars— and in many cases GI bill benefits—on these worthless for-profit schools. 
It is time for us to wake up to this 
reality. I am glad to see this industry is finally facing its day of reckoning. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

SCHEDULES THAT WORK ACT 
Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I come 
to the Senate floor today to talk about something that has been bothering me. Who is this Senate supposed to be working for? For years now, this econ-omy has been great for those at the top, but for everyone else, it is getting harder and harder to make it from pay-check to paycheck, harder and harder to build any real security. The world is changing, and Congress can make deci-sions that help working people stay in the game and help level the playing field or we can just turn our backs. 
What have the Republicans done over 
the past 6 months to try to make fami-lies a little more secure, to give people a fighting chance? What have they done? They have turned their backs. In the past 6 months, they have burned huge amounts of time as they tried to shut down Homeland Security, tried to build a pipeline to help a Canadian oil company, tried to turn a human traf-ficking bill into a referendum on abor-tion, and now tried to defund Planned Parenthood—all this instead of work-ing on the kinds of issues that would help level the playing field for hard- working people. 
You know, there is a lot we could do. 
For example, Democrats have been fighting to raise the minimum wage. And I strongly agree that no one—no one—should work full time and still live in poverty. I think a $7.25-an-hour minimum wage is disgraceful. I support the Federal bill to raise the minimum wage to $12 by 2020, and I applaud the fight for $15 that is springing up across this country. 
When I am asked about whether we 
should raise the minimum wage, I have three answers: Yes. Yes. Yes. But rais-ing the minimum wage is only the be-ginning. Half of low-wage workers have little or no say over when they work, and an estimated 20 to 30 percent are in jobs where they can be called in to work at the last minute. 
I want us to think about what this 
means for someone who is busting her fanny trying to build some economic security. Imagine trying to plan for 
anything—for childcare, for going back to school, for getting a second job— without knowing when you will be working next week. Imagine trying to plan a monthly budget when your work hours and paycheck can fluctuate 70 percent in a single month. Imagine try-ing to schedule a doctor’s visit or par-ent-teacher conference if you could get fired just for asking for a few hours off. This is the real world of millions of workers who struggle to make ends meet. 
This is something we can fix. A few 
weeks ago, I introduced the Schedules That Work Act, with 17 Democrats in the Senate and more than 60 Demo-crats in the House of Representatives. The bill is just common sense and basic fairness: A single mom should know if her hours are being canceled before she arranges for daycare and drives half-way across town to show up at work, a young man trying to put himself through school should be able to re-quest a more predictable schedule without getting fired just for asking, and a worker who is told to wait around on call for hours with no guar-antee of work should get something for her time. 
The Schedules That Work Act does 
two simple things: First, it gives all workers the right to request a change in their schedule without getting fired just for asking, and, second, it gives workers who face the worst scheduling practices—workers in retail, food serv-ice, and cleaning workers—2 weeks’ no-tice of their work schedules and some additional pay if they are required to wait on call but don’t get any work. 
Now, look, this bill recognizes that 
there are emergencies, and when em-ployers have unexpected needs they can reschedule their workers, but we are asking for a little basic fairness so that in ordinary times—day-by-day, week-by-week—workers will have a stable schedule and a chance to build some real economic security. 
Democrats want to get to work on 
changes in the law that would give working people a fighting chance. We want Republicans to let us take up these proposals and let us vote on them. Instead, Republicans are pushing a different agenda, focusing on defunding women’s health care and protecting those at the top. 
People say Washington doesn’t work, 
but that is wrong. Washington works great—for the right people. When the corporate lobbyists want a carve-out or giveaway, when a giant oil company wants the Keystone Pipeline or when Citibank wants to blast a hole in Dodd- Frank, Republicans fall all over them-selves to make it happen. When the rightwing wants to cut off access to health care, Republicans are ready to go, but when it comes to the things that will help families, they turn their backs. This has to stop. We are not here to work for the lobbyists. We are not here to make life easier for big oil companies or for big banks. We are

MARINE CORPS AUDIT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yes-
terday a very important Government Accountability Office report came out. I am going to present my view of that report in a little bit backward way by giving a summary before I speak about the fine points of this report. 
Broken bookkeeping has plagued the 
Pentagon for years. Under deadline pressure, the Marine Corps claimed to be ready for a clean audit. An outside auditing firm produced work papers in support of an opinion on a clean audit that employees in the Defense Depart-ment inspector general’s office found lacking. However, a manager in the in-spector general’s office overruled his lower level colleagues. That resulted in the inspector general’s release of a clean opinion on the audit of the Ma-rine Corps. 
Meanwhile, work papers began to 
creep out of the bureaucracy showing the unsupported basis for such a clean opinion. The inspector general was then forced to withdraw that opinion. 
Now the Government Accountability 
Office is releasing a report that exposes the whole house of cards. One senior employee with an apparent bias toward the outside auditing firm led his agen-cy down the wrong path. We need to get things back on track and prevent an embarrassing setback like this from ever happening again. 
I will go into those details. As I often 
do, I come to the floor to speak about the latest twist in the 25-year struggle to fix the Defense Department’s broken accounting system. Billions have been spent to fix it and achieve audit readi-ness, but those goals remain elusive. Defense dishes out over $500 billion a year. Yet the Department still can’t tell the people where all the money is going, and now the drive to be audit- ready by 2017—that is what the law re-quires—has taken a bad turn and be-come a fight over the truth. 
As overseers of the taxpayers’ 
money, we in Congress need to get the Audit Readiness Initiative back on track, moving forward in the right di-rection. 
I last spoke on this subject a long 
time ago—December 8, 2011. On that oc-casion, I commended the Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, for trying to get the ball rolling. He wanted to halt endless slippage in audit deadlines. He wanted to provide an accurate and reg-ular accounting of money spent to comply with the constitutional re-quirements. He turned up the pressure and in effect drew a line in the sand. He directed the Department to, in his 
words, ‘‘achieve partial audit readi-ness,’’ with limited statements by 2014, and, in his words, ‘‘full audit readi-ness’’ with all-up statements by the statutory deadline of 2017. 
Not one of the major DOD compo-
nents—including the Army, Navy, Ma-rine Corps, and Air Force—reached Leon Panetta’s 2014 milestone. None was or is audit ready today. 
That said, one component—the Ma-
rine Corps—stepped up to the plate and claimed to be ready for what Leon Pa-netta’s goal was. To test that claim, the accounting firm Grant Thornton was awarded a contract to audit five Marine Corps financial statements, 2010 to 2014. 
The first two, 2010 and 2011, were un-
successful. The Marine Corps was not ready. The third one was the 2012 audit, which is finally finished. 
The 2012 audit was put under a micro-
scope and subjected to intense review by the Office of Inspector General along with two other independent watchdogs. 
The Marine Corps audit was a dis-
aster. First, it took an ugly turn. It got twisted out of shape and turned upside down. Now it is getting turned right side up, thanks to the Government Ac-countability Office. 
Grant Thornton was required to 
produce a conclusion memorandum. This happens to be what we might call a quasi-opinion. Work was to be fin-ished by December 2012, but it took an extra year. So right off the bat it was running into trouble. The scaled-down financial statement did not meet con-tract specifications. So this was a showstopper that got glossed over. The contract was modified to accept a makeshift compilation that was cob-bled together. It is called a Schedule of Budgetary Activity. It covers only cur-rent year appropriations and not vast sums of prior year appropriations that are still lost in the statutory and money pipeline. Of course, that is a far cry from a standard financial state-ment. 
Even reducing the scope of the audit 
wasn’t enough to overcome all of the other problems. The Office of Inspector General audit team was responsible for issuing the final opinion. After com-pleting a review of Grant Thornton’s workpapers in early 2013, the team de-termined that the evidence presented did not meet audit standards. It con-cluded that an adverse opinion—or what they call a disclaimer—was war-ranted. The team’s rejection of Grant Thornton’s conclusions embroiled the opinion in controversy and foul play. The trouble began when the Deputy IG for Auditing, Mr. Dan Blair, intervened and reportedly overruled his team’s conclusions. He issued an unqualified or clean opinion that was not sup-ported by the evidence in the workpapers—quite a showboat ap-proach. 
Despite mounting controversy about 
the validity of the opinion, Secretary of Defense Hagel rolled out that opin-
ion December 20, 2013—with trumpets ‘‘ablast.’’ At a ceremony in the Penta-gon’s Hall of Heroes, he gave the Ma-rine Corps an award for being the first military service to earn a clean opin-ion. The Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. John Paxton, ac-cepted the award. According to press reports, he did so with ‘‘reluctance. . . . He mumbled something, then bolted from the stage at flank speed.’’ Why would General Paxton take off like a scalded dog? Was it because he sniffed a bad odor with this so-called clean report and all the colorful pres-entations that were made by Secretary Hagel? 
At that point, the word was already 
seeping out: The opinion was allegedly rigged. I heard rumblings about it and began asking Inspector General Rymer questions. Because of all the con-troversy, we asked his independent 
audit quality watchdog, Deputy Assist-ant IG Ashton Coleman, to review the audit. Mr. Coleman sent Inspector Gen-eral Rymer reports in October 2014 and May of this year. These reports ripped the figleaf clean off of Mr. Blair’s cha-rade. They reinforced the audit team’s disclaimer. After recommending ‘‘the OIG rescind and reissue the audit re-port with a disclaimer of opinion,’’ Mr. Coleman zeroed right in on the root cause of the problem. That root cause was impaired independence. In other words, the people involved in this cha-rade had an agenda that wasn’t about good handling of the taxpayers’ money, it was protecting somebody. 
Mr. Coleman concluded that Mr. 
Blair ‘‘had a potential impairment to independence.’’ He and a Grant Thorn-ton partner, Ms. Tracy Porter Greene, had a longstanding but undisclosed professional relationship going back to their service together at the Govern-ment Accountability Office in the early 1990s. According to Coleman, that relationship by itself did not pose a problem. However, once it began to 
interfere with the team’s ability to make critical decisions, he said it cre-ated an appearance of undue influence. Coleman identified several actions that led him in this direction. 
The appearance problem was framed 
by a four-page email on August 2, 2013, from Ms. Greene to Mr. Blair but seen by the team and others, including me. It was a stern warning. If a disclaimer was coming—and Ms. Greene knew it was—she wanted, in her words, ‘‘some advanced notice.’’ 
She needed time then, as she 
thought, to prepare the firm’s leader-ship for the bad news. A disclaimer, she said, would pose ‘‘a risk to our reputa-tion.’’ At the email’s end, she opened the door to private discussions to re-solve the matter. 
The record clearly indicates that 
both Blair and Greene began holding private meetings—without inviting Contracting Officer’s Representative Ball and the Office of Inspector Gen-eral team to participate in those dis-cussions. Both believed the contracting

officer’s representative and the team 
were—in the words of Greene and Blair—‘‘biased toward a disclaimer rather than considering all the facts.’’ I attributed those words to Greene and Blair, but those were Mr. Blair’s words. 
This shows how the independence of 
the audit and the review of the audit were questionable. To put these actions in perspective, I remind my colleagues that the inspector general was exer-cising oversight of the company’s work. The inspector general needed to keep top company officials like Ms. Greene at arm’s length, and holding private meetings with Greene wasn’t the way to do it. These meetings may have violated the contract. 
Why would the top IG audit official 
prefer to hold private meetings with Ms. Greene? Why would he seem so willing and eager to favor the firm over his team—even when the evidence ap-peared to support the team’s position? Why would he favor the firm over the evidence and over the truth? Why would he admit on the record that ‘‘OIG auditors were not independent of Grant Thornton’’? Why would he order the team to give the work papers to the firm so they could be ‘‘updated to reflect the truth’’? The firm was not even supposed to have those docu-ments, so we get back to impaired independence again. 
Coleman cited other indications of 
this impaired independence. Con-tracting Officer’s Representative Ball had rejected the firm’s 2012 deliverables because they were ‘‘defi-cient.’’ They did not meet quality and timeliness standards. The deliverables in question were the company’s final work product, including the all-impor-tant quasi-opinion called a conclusion memorandum. 
This posed a real dilemma. Until she 
accepted the 2012 deliverables, the fol-low-on 2013 contract with Grant Thorn-ton could not be awarded, and Blair wanted it done yesterday. 
The impasse was broken with a 
crooked bureaucratic maneuver. A sen-ior official, Assistant Inspector Gen-eral Loren Venable, provided a certifi-cation that there were no major per-formance problems and Grant Thorn-ton had met all contract requirements. Just then, with the stroke of a pen, that deceptive document cleared the way for accepting the disputed mate-rials, paying the firm all their money, and awarding them at the same time a follow-on contract. Yet the record shows that even Mr. Blair admitted that ‘‘we accepted deficient deliverables.’’ 
Why would a senior Office of Inspec-
tor General official attempt to cover up a major audit failure by Grant Thornton in order to reward the poorly performing company with more money and a new contract? For a series of audit failures, the firm got paid $32 million. 
These actions appear to show how 
undue influence and bias trumped ob-jectivity and independence. Alleged tampering with the opinion may be the 
most flagrant example of impaired independence. 
While the team identified major 
shortcomings with Grant Thornton’s work and disagreed with its conclu-sions, the team was blocked from exer-cising its authority to issue a dis-claimer. So where is the independence? Instead, that team was forced to do ad-ditional work in a futile attempt to find evidence to match the firm’s con-clusion, but there was no such evi-dence. 
Two weeks after Ms. Greene’s email 
warning that a disclaimer could de-stroy the company’s reputation, the front office resorted to direct action. With the team’s disclaimer staring him in the face and with complete disregard for evidence and standards, Mr. Blair gave the Office of Inspector General team a truly stunning set of instruc-tions. These were as follows: No. 1, the Marine Corps earned a clean opinion; No. 2, Grant Thornton has supported a clean opinion; and No. 3, do what it takes to reach the same conclusion as Grant Thornton. 
In the simplest of terms, this August 
14 edict says: There will be a clean opinion. Disregard the evidence. Figure out how to do it and make it happen. 
These instructions provoked an in-
ternal brawl. The team manager, Ms. Cecilia Ball, balked. She stated flatout: 
I cannot do that. Our audit evidence does 
not support an unqualified [clean] opinion. We are at a disclaimer. 
She wanted justification for Mr. 
Blair’s decision to overturn the team’s opinion. She asked: 
Show me where my work is substandard 
and where my conclusions are incorrect. And I want to know what standards Mr. Blair used to reach his conclusions. 
She never got a straight answer. 
From that point on, it was all down-hill. When the team ignored coaxing, they got steamrolled. 
Mr. Blair attacked their competence, 
professionalism, and independence. He repeatedly accused them of being ‘‘bi-ased.’’ The team’s top manager, Ms. Cecilia Ball, reacted to the abusive treatment. She said: 
I don’t appreciate the accusations to my 
professionalism and my team’s. I don’t think we are the right fit as our integrity is being questioned. 
She later quit the team in disgust. 
In early December, just as the clean 
opinion was about to be wheeled out, Ms. Ball made one final request for ex-planation: Why was ‘‘the team’s dis-claimer of opinion not the correct opinion’’? We repeatedly documented and explained why Grant Thornton’s conclusion was unsupportable. ‘‘The vast knowledge of the Front Office could have provided us insight as to where the team’s logic was flawed.’’ 
In this case, the front office was un-
willing to consider anything other than a clean opinion. These words are from the horse’s mouth. The clean opinion was handed down from on high. The front office was Mr. Blair’s domain. All of these actions, when taken to-
gether, appear to show a lack of inde-pendence and a flagrant disregard for audit ethics, audit standards, audit evi-dence, and accepted practices. 
In his oversight role, Blair had a re-
sponsibility to be independent, objec-tive, and professionally skeptical. If the firm’s work failed to meet stand-ards, as it did, then he had a responsi-bility to face the truth and tell it like it is. He needed to be a junkyard dog and issue the disclaimer. Maybe he lost sight of his core mission and turned into a Grant Thornton lapdog. It sure looks that way. 
Mr. Blair’s words, deeds, and prior as-
sociation with the Grant Thornton partner, Ms. Greene—when coupled with their many emails that were wide-ly distributed—gave the appearance of undue influence by the Grant Thornton partner. The tone and the substance of the Blair-Greene emails suggest a pro-fessional relationship that was just too cozy—a relationship that might have been wise to disclose according to audit standards and professional ethics. 
Inspector General Rymer disagrees 
with Mr. Coleman’s findings of im-paired independence. However, Mr. Rymer’s evidence does not square with evidence presented by Coleman. For these reasons, Senator J
OHNSON of Wis-
consin and I will be asking the Comp-troller General—the guardian of gov-ernment auditing standards—to review all relevant evidence. Since independ-ence is a cornerstone of audit integ-rity, we must be certain it has not been compromised. 
Now, just yesterday another block-
buster report has been rolled out. The Government Accountability Office has issued a highly critical report. It was prepared at the request of Senator J
OHNSON , Senator M CCASKILL , and Sen-
ator C ARPER . The Government Ac-
countability Office report is thorough and competent and tells the story as it happened. 
Over the last 2 years, the GAO team 
held endless meetings with the Office of Inspector General, including Jon Rymer and Dan Blair. So the IG has known for some time what was coming down the pike. They knew early on the GAO report concluded that the evi-dence in the workpapers did not sup-port the clean opinion of the Marine Corps audit. 
Echoing Ms. Ball’s unanswered pleas, 
the Government Accountability Office states: The OIG’s management’s deci-sion to overturn the disclaimer is—in their words—‘‘undocumented, unex-plained, and unjustified by evidence in the work papers as required by profes-sional standards.’’ 
This is the evidentiary gap identified 
by the Government Accountability Of-fice. There is no legitimate explanation for how the auditors got from point A— the disclaimer—to point B—the clean opinion. There is no crosswalk between the two poles. It is a bridge too far. 
Despite mounting questions about 
the opinion, the IG turned a blind eye

to Blair’s charade. The IG allowed it to 
go on and on. Countless man-hours and millions of dollars were wasted on cooking the books and on vicious in- fighting instead of productive problem- solving to right the ship. Mr. Coleman and the GAO got that done. 
On March 23, the day before the IG’s 
final exit briefing with the GAO, came a bolt from the blue. The IG stepped forward with a brave, bold announce-ment. The clean opinion was formally withdrawn. It was like a rush of fresh air in a very stuffy room. The inescap-able truth finally dawned on Inspector General Rymer. So I want to thank Mr. Rymer for having the courage to do the right thing. 
An audit failure of this magnitude 
should have consequences. This one is especially egregious. It leaves at least one former Secretary of Defense with egg on his face. Mr. Blair was removed as head of the Audit Office on June 10 but is still serving as the Office of In-spector General’s Deputy Chief of Staff. He is the chief architect of the now discredited clean opinion. He is the one who planted the seeds of de-struction when he allegedly quashed the audit team’s disclaimer. Of course, those responsible for what happened ought to be held accountable. 
Mr. Blair wants us to believe that the 
muffed opinion was the result of a rou-tine dispute between opposing auditors’ judgments over evidence, a mere dif-ference of opinion among auditors. True, it reflects an unresolved dispute between the audit team and the man-agement, and yes, that happened; how-ever, there is a right way and a wrong way to resolve the conflicts. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to complete this. I was told I would be given the time to do it, and I have about 4 minutes.

Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, and I won’t ob-ject, I want to make certain that after Senator G
RASSLEY has completed his 
remarks, I will have time to make my remarks for up to 15 minutes. It will probably be less than that. 
Is that all right, Senator? Mr. GRASSLEY. That is OK. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Those responsible 
for what happened ought to be held ac-countable. 
Mr. Blair wants us to believe the 
muffed opinion was the result of a rou-tine dispute between opposing auditors’ judgments over evidence and a mere difference of opinion among auditors. True, it reflects an unresolved dispute between the audit team and manage-ment, and yes, that happened; however, there is a right way and a wrong way to resolve such conflicts. According to audit standards cited in the GAO re-port, the dispute should have been ad-dressed, resolved, and documented in workpapers before the report was 
issued. It was not because the two opinions were irreconcilable. 
The team’s disclaimer was based on 
evidence measured against standards documented in workpapers. Blair’s so- called ‘‘professional preference,’’ by comparison, is none of these things. As the GAO’s evidence gap suggests, Mr. Blair’s opinion was hooked up to noth-ing. It was unsupported, and it was im-proper. So plain old common sense should have caused senior managers to realize that issuing the report with the opinion hanging fire was a senseless blunder. Doing it had one inevitable re-sult: The opinion had no credibility, and that opinion had to go. 
True, the integrity of the Office of 
Inspector General audit process may be damaged, but the final outcome of this tangled mess may help clear the way for recovery. That recovery ought to lead us to being able to have clean au-dits not only of the Marine Corps but all of the four services. The Marine Corps audit was the first big one out the box. If Inspector General Rymer had not embraced the truth, we might be staring at a bunch of worthless opin-ions awarded to the Army, Navy, and Air Force. The Department of Defense could have declared victory and buried the broken bookkeeping system for an-other 100 years. 
Hopefully, the Defense Department 
will begin anew with fresh respect for the truth, audit standards, and the need for reliable transaction data. Re-liable transaction data is the lifeblood of credible financial statements. Unre-liable transaction data doomed the Ma-rine Corps audit to failure from the get-go. Without reliable transaction data, the probability of conducting a successful audit of a major component is near zero. 
With the right leadership and guid-
ance, a plan with achievable deadlines can and should be developed. In the meantime, we watchdogs—and that is all of us in the Congress of the United States, or at least it ought to be all of us—must remain vigilant. My gut tells me we are still not out of the woods. 
I yield the floor.

CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM  
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, on No-
vember 19, 1863, standing on the blood-
stained battlefield of Gettysburg, Abra-ham Lincoln delivered one of the most significant and best remembered speeches in American history. At the conclusion of the Gettysburg Address, Lincoln stated ‘‘that we here highly re-solve that these dead shall not have died in vain . . . that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom . . . and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.’’ 
In the year 2015, with a political cam-
paign finance system that is corrupt and increasingly controlled by billion-aires and special interests, I fear very much that, in fact, government of the people, by the people, and for the peo-ple is perishing in the United States of America. 
Five years ago, in the disastrous Citi-
zens United Supreme Court decision, by a 5-to-4 vote, the U.S. Supreme Court said to the wealthiest people in this country: Billionaires, you already own much of the American economy. Now we are going to give you the op-portunity to purchase the U.S. Govern-ment, the White House, the U.S. Sen-ate, the U.S. House, Governors’ seats, legislatures, and State judicial branches as well. In essence, that is ex-actly what they said, and, in fact, that is exactly what is happening as we speak. 
As a result of Citizens United, during 
this campaign cycle, billions of dollars from the wealthiest people in this country will flood the political process. Super PACs—a direct outgrowth of the Citizens United decision—enabled the wealthiest people and the largest cor-porations to contribute unlimited amounts of money to campaigns. Ac-cording to recent FEC filings, super PACs have raised more than $300 mil-lion for the 2016 Presidential election already, and this election cycle has barely begun. This $300 million is more than 11 times what was raised at this point in the 2000 election cycle. What will the situation be 4 years from now? What will the situation be 8 years from now? How many billions and billions of dollars from the wealthy and powerful will be used to elect candidates who represent the rich and the superrich? 
According to the Sunlight Founda-
tion, more than $2 out of every $3 raised for Presidential candidates so far is going to super PACs and not to the candidate’s own campaign. This is quite extraordinary. What this means is that super PACs, which theoretically operate independently of the actual candidate, have more money and more influence over the candidate’s cam-paign than the candidate himself or herself. Let me repeat that. The mil-lionaires and billionaires who control

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6257 August 4, 2015 
the super PACs have more money and 
more influence over a candidate’s cam-paign than the candidate himself or herself. In other words, the candidate becomes a surrogate, a representative for powerful special interests and is not even in control of his or her own cam-paign. 
Mr. President, 35 individuals or com-
panies have already donated more than $1 million to super PACs so far. Ac-cording to the Associated Press, almost 
60 donors have accounted for nearly one-third of all of the money donated so far in the Presidential race, includ-ing donations to the campaigns them-selves. Donors giving at least $100,000 account for close to half of all funds raised. Let’s be clear. This is all taking place at the early stages of the cam-paign. We have a long way to go. 
We know, for example, that the Koch 
brothers, worth some $85 billion—the second wealthiest family in America— have made public that they intend to spend some $900 million on this elec-tion. This is more money than either the Democratic Party or the Repub-lican Party will spend. One family will be spending more money than either the Democratic Party or the Repub-lican Party. How do we describe a proc-ess in which one multibillion-dollar family spends more money on a cam-paign than either of the two major po-litical parties? Well, I define that proc-ess not as democracy but as oligarchy. 
Let’s be honest and acknowledge 
what we are talking about. We are talking about a rapid movement in this country toward a political system in which a handful of very wealthy people and special interests will determine who gets elected or who does not get elected. That is not, to say the least, what this country is supposed to be about. That was not, to say the least, the vision of Abraham Lincoln when he talked about a nation in which we had a government of the people, by the peo-ple, for the people. That is not what Lincoln’s vision was about. 
This is not just B
ERNIE SANDERS ex-
pressing a concern. Last week, this is what former President Jimmy Carter had to say about the current campaign finance system on the Thom Hartmann radio show. President Carter stated that unlimited money in politics ‘‘vio-lates the essence of what made Amer-ica a great country in its political sys-tem. Now, it’s just an oligarchy, with unlimited political bribery being the essence of getting the nominations for president or to elect the president. And the same thing applies to governors and U.S. Senators and congress mem-bers. So now we’ve just seen a complete subversion of our political system as a payoff to major contributors, who want and expect and sometimes get favors for themselves after the election’s over.’’ 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have President Carter’s state-ment printed in the R
ECORD . 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows: [From the Intercept, July 30, 2015]

Former president Jimmy Carter said Tues-
day on the nationally syndicated radio show the Thom Hartmann Program that the United States is now an ‘‘oligarchy’’ in which ‘‘unlimited political bribery’’ has cre-ated ‘‘a complete subversion of our political system as a payoff to major contributors.’’ Both Democrats and Republicans, Carter said, ‘‘look upon this unlimited money as a great benefit to themselves.’’ 
Carter was responding to a question from 
Hartmann about recent Supreme Court deci-sions on campaign financing like Citizens United.

said, ‘‘unlimited money in politics.’’ It seems like a violation of principles of democracy. . . . Your thoughts on that? 
CARTER: It violates the essence of what 
made America a great country in its polit-ical system. Now it’s just an oligarchy, with unlimited political bribery being the essence of getting the nominations for president or to elect the president. And the same thing applies to governors and U.S. Senators and congress members. So now we’ve just seen a 
complete subversion of our political system as a payoff to major contributors, who want and expect and sometimes get favors for themselves after the election’s over. . . . The incumbents, Democrats and Republicans, look upon this unlimited money as a great benefit to themselves. Somebody who’s al-ready in Congress has a lot more to sell to an avid contributor than somebody who’s just a challenger. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the 
need for real campaign finance reform is not a progressive issue. It is not a conservative issue. It is an American issue. It is an issue that should concern all Americans, regardless of their polit-ical point of view, who wish to preserve the essence of the longest standing de-mocracy in the world, a government which represents all of the people and not a handful of powerful and wealthy special interests. 
The need for real campaign finance 
reform must happen and it must hap-pen as soon as possible. That is why clearly we must overturn, through a constitutional amendment, the disas-trous Citizens United Supreme Court decision as well as the Buckley v. Vallejo decision. That is why we need to pass disclosure legislation which will identify all those wealthy individ-uals who make large campaign con-tributions. More importantly, it is why we need to move toward public funding of elections. 
Our vision for American democracy, 
our vision for the United States of America, should be a nation in which all people, regardless of their income, can participate in the political process, can run for office without begging for contributions from the wealthy and the powerful. Every Member of the Senate and every Member of the House knows how much time candidates spend on the telephone dialing for dollars—Re-publicans, Democrats, everybody. This is not what democracy should be about. 
Our vision for the future of this coun-
try should be one in which candidates are not telling billionaires at special 
forums what they can do for them. Our vision for democracy should be one in which candidates are speaking to the vast majority of our people—working people, the middle class, low-income people, the elderly, the children, the sick, and the poor—and discussing with them their ideas as to how we can im-prove lives for all people in this coun-try. 
Let us be frank. Let us be honest. 
The current political campaign finance system is corrupt and amounts to le-galized bribery. How can we in the United States tell developing countries how they can go forward in developing their democracies when our system is corrupt? Our vision for the future of this country should be a vision which is inclusive, which tells young people that if you are conservative, if you are progressive, if you are interested in public service, you can run for office without begging the rich and the pow-erful for campaign contributions. 
When Congress returns after the Au-
gust break, I will be introducing strong legislation which calls for public fund-ing of elections, which will enable any candidate, regardless of his or her po-litical views, to run for office without being beholden to the rich and the pow-erful. I hope very much the Republican leadership in the Senate will allow this legislation to get to the floor, I hope we can have a serious debate about it, and I hope very much we can go for-ward to restoring American democracy to a situation in which every citizen of this country has the right to vote and has equal power in determining the fu-ture of our great Nation. 
Mr. President, with that, I yield the 
floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L
EE). 
The Senator from California. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
would like to speak in support of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act. I had hoped Senator B
URR, the 
chairman of the committee, would be able to deliver the remarks initially. However, he has been unfortunately de-layed, and so I will go ahead with my remarks as vice chairman of the com-mittee. 
There is no legislative or administra-
tive step we can take that will end all cyber crime and cyber warfare, but as members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, we have heard over the course of several years now that im-proving the exchange of information and the sharing of that information, company to company and company to the government, can be very helpful and yield a real and significant im-provement to cyber security. 
Regrettably, this is the third at-
tempt to pass a cyber security informa-tion sharing bill. In the almost 5 years that I have been working on this issue, two things have become abundantly clear about passing the bill. First, it must be bipartisan. In 2012, I cospon-sored the Lieberman-Collins Cyberse-curity Act, which included a title on

information sharing based on a bill I 
had introduced. It was an important piece of legislation, but it received al-most no Republican support and could not gain the 60 votes needed to invoke cloture. It became clear to me then that no cyber security legislation could pass without broad bipartisan support. 
The second lesson that has been 
learned is, it must be narrowly focused. The Lieberman-Collins bill sought to address many critical challenges to our Nation’s cyber security. Then-Majority Leader H
ARRY REID, brought the chair-
men of all committees of jurisdiction on our side together and asked them to draft legislation on cyber security in their areas. It soon became clear that addressing so many complex issues makes a bill very difficult to pass. That bill died on the Senate floor in late 2012. 
Based on these lessons, we have tried 
to take a bipartisan and focused ap-proach so Congress can pass a cyber se-curity information sharing bill. In the last Congress, in 2013 and 2014, then- vice chairman of the Intelligence Com-mittee Saxby Chambliss and I sought to draft legislation on information sharing that would attract bipartisan support. We worked through a number of difficult issues together, and we were able to produce a bill that I be-lieved would pass the Senate. The In-telligence Committee approved the bill in 2014 by a strong bipartisan vote of 12 to 3, but it never reached the Senate floor due to privacy concerns about the legislation. 
This year, Chairman B
URRand I have 
drafted legislation that both sides can and should support. This bill is bipar-tisan, it is narrowly focused, and it puts in place a number of privacy pro-tections, many of which I will outline shortly. The bill’s bipartisan vote of 14 to 1 in the Senate Intelligence Com-mittee in March underscores this fact. 
I would like to thank Senator B
URR 
for his leadership and his willingness to negotiate a bipartisan bill that can and should receive a strong vote. As he often says, neither one of us would have written this bill this way if we were doing it ourselves. This Senator believes it is also true that by negoti-ating this draft, we will get substan-tially more votes than either of us can get on our own. I very much hope that is true. 
I note that this bill has strong sup-
port from the private sector because it creates incentives for improving cyber security and protects companies that take responsible steps to do so. Compa-nies are shielded from lawsuits if they properly use the authorities provided for in this bill. They can be confident that sharing information with other companies or with the government will not subject them to inappropriate reg-ulatory action. 
For these reasons, this bill has the 
support of over 40 business groups, and it is the first bill that has the support of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. It also has the support of the most impor-tant cyber security and critical infra-
structure companies in the Nation. 
Mr. President, I would like to ask 
unanimous consent to have those let-ters printed into the R
ECORD . 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the R
ECORD , as follows:

EAR MAJORITY LEADER MCCONNELL AND  
MINORITY LEADER REID: On behalf of our di-
verse members, we write today in strong sup-port of the Cybersecurity Information Shar-ing Act (S. 754), a bipartisan bill approved earlier this year on a near-unanimous basis by the Select Committee on Intelligence. We strongly urge you to bring up S. 754 as expe-ditiously as possible, defeat any amendments that would undermine this important legis-lation, and support the underlying bill. 
The threat of cyber-attacks is a real and 
omnipresent danger to our sector, our mem-bers’ customers and clients, and to critical infrastructure providers upon which we—and the nation as a whole—rely. S. 754 would en-hance our ability to defend the financial services sector and the sensitive data of hun-dreds of millions of Americans. It is critical that Congress get cybersecurity information sharing legislation to the President’s desk before the next crisis, not after. 
Our members and the broader financial 
services industry are dedicated to improving our capacity to protect customers and their sensitive information but as it stands today, our laws do not do enough to foster informa-tion sharing and establish clear lines of com-munication with the various government agencies responsible for cybersecurity. If adopted and signed into law, this legislation will strengthen the nation’s ability to defend against cyber-attacks and better protect all Americans by encouraging the business com-munity and the government to quickly and effectively share critical information about these threats while ensuring privacy. More effective information sharing provides some of the strongest protections of privacy, as it is sensitive information from our member firms’ customers that we are asking Con-gress to protect from those who attempt to steal or destroy that information. 
Each of our organizations and our respec-
tive member firms has made cybersecurity a top priority and we are committed to con-tinuing to work with you and your col-leagues in the Senate so that effective cyber threat information sharing legislation can be enacted into law.

EAR MAJORITY LEADER MCCONNELL AND  
MINORITY LEADER REID: The undersigned or-ganizations reiterate their support for cyber-
security information sharing and liability protection legislation and urge the Senate to promptly take up and pass S. 754, the Cyber-security Information Sharing Act (CISA) of 2015. Enactment of such legislation is ur-gently needed to further enhance and en-courage communication among the federal government, the North American electric power sector, and other critical infrastruc-ture sectors, thus improving our ability to defend against cyber attacks. 
While the electric sector already engages 
in significant information sharing activities and has in place mandatory and enforceable reliability and cybersecurity standards, there remains an urgent need for the govern-ment and industry to better share actionable security information in a timely and con-fidential manner, including protections against public disclosure of sensitive secu-rity information. CISA provides a framework to help foster even more meaningful infor-mation sharing while maintaining a critical balance between liability and privacy protec-tions. 
The electric power sector takes very seri-
ously its responsibility to maintain the reli-ability, safety, and security of the electric grid. Beyond mandatory standards, the in-dustry maintains an all-hazards ‘‘defense in depth’’ mitigation strategy that combines preparation, prevention, resiliency, and re-sponse and recovery efforts. We also work closely with the federal government and other critical infrastructure sectors on which the electric sector depends through the Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council, and share electric sector threat in-formation through the Electricity Sector In-formation Sharing and Analysis Center. Pas-sage of CISA will enhance these activities.

DEARSENATORS : I am writing on behalf of 
the members of the American Bankers Asso-ciation (ABA) to urge you to support the Cy-bersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA, S. 754) when it is brought to the Senate floor, and to defeat any amendments that would 
undermine this critically needed legislation. 
CISA is bipartisan legislation introduced 
by Chairman Richard Burr and Vice Chair-man Dianne Feinstein, and reported by a strong bipartisan 14–1 vote in the Senate In-telligence Committee. It will enhance ongo-ing efforts by the private sector and the Fed-eral government to better protect our crit-ical infrastructure and protect Americans from all walks of life from cyber criminals. Importantly, CISA facilitates increased cyber intelligence information sharing be-tween the private and public sectors, and strikes the appropriate balance between pro-tecting consumer privacy and allowing infor-mation sharing on serious threats to our na-tion’s critical infrastructure.

Cybersecurity is a top priority for the fi-
nancial services industry. Banks invest hun-dreds of millions of dollars every year to put in place multiple layers of security to pro-tect sensitive data. Protecting customers has always been and will remain our top pri-ority and CISA will help us work more effec-tively with the Federal government and other sectors of the economy to better pro-tect them from cyber attacks. 
We urge you to support this important leg-
islation and pass it as soon as possible to better protect America’s cybersecurity infra-structure against current and future threats.

EAR MAJORITY LEADER MCCONNELL AND  
DEMOCRATIC LEADER REID: On behalf of the 
members of the Information Technology In-dustry Council (ITI), I write to express our support for S. 754, the Cybersecurity Infor-mation Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA), and urge you to bring it to the Senate floor for debate and vote. Given the importance of cybersecu-rity threat information sharing to the high- tech industry, we will consider scoring votes in support of CISA in our 114th Congres-sional Voting Guide. 
ITI members contribute to making the 
U.S. information and communication tech-nology (ICT) industry the strongest in the world in innovative cybersecurity practices and solutions. We firmly believe that passing legislation to help increase voluntary cyber-security threat information sharing between the private sector and the federal govern-ment, and within the private sector, is an important step Congress can take to enable all stakeholders to address threats, stem losses, and shield their systems, partners and customers. It is important that the Senate act now to pass CISA and continue to move the legislative process forward, so that Con-gress can reconcile CISA with the House cy-bersecurity legislation, H.R. 1560, the Pro-tecting Cyber Networks Act, and H.R. 1731, the National Cybersecurity Protection Ad-vancement Act of 2015, and send a bill to the president. 
ITI believes that legislation to promote 
greater cybersecurity threat information sharing should: 
Affirm that cybersecurity threat informa-
tion sharing be voluntary; 
Promote multidirectional cybersecurity 
threat information sharing, allowing pri-vate-to-private, private-to-government and government-to-private sharing relationships; 
Include targeted liability protections; Utilize a civilian agency interface for pri-
vate-to-government information sharing to which new liability protections attach; 
Promote technology-neutral mechanisms 
that enable cybersecurity threat information to be shared in as close to real-time as pos-sible; 
Require all entities to take reasonable 
steps to remove personally identifiable infor-mation from information shared through data minimization; and 
Ensure private sector use of information 
received through private-to-private sharing is only for cybersecurity purposes, and gov-ernment use of information received from the private sector is limited to cybersecurity purposes and used by law enforcement only: 
For the investigation and prosecution of 
cyber crimes; 
For the protection of individuals from the 
danger of death or serious bodily harm and the investigation and prosecution of crimes involving such danger; and 
For the protection of minors from child 
pornography. We appreciate the progress made by the 
Senate Intelligence Committee to include provisions that would protect personally identifiable information while also allowing for a cybersecurity threat information shar-ing framework that will enhance our ability to protect and defend our networks. 
We look forward to working closely with 
you, your committee leadership, and the House of Representatives to further address outstanding issues in conference to ensure it adheres to our above cybersecurity threat in-formation sharing principles. ITI remains committed to refining the legislation and supporting a final product that can best achieve our goal of promoting greater cyber-security.

MINORITY LEADER REID: On behalf of BSA/ 
The Software Alliance, I write in support of bringing the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (S. 754) to the Senate floor for a robust debate. Enactment of bi-partisan legislation that enhances voluntary cyber threat information sharing while en-suring privacy protection will be an impor-tant step in bolstering our nation’s cyberse-curity capabilities. 
Our members are on the front lines defend-
ing against cyber attacks. Every day, bad ac-tors are attacking networks to extract valu-able private and commercial information. We believe it is now more important than ever to enact legislation to break down the legal barriers that currently discourage cyber threat information sharing between and among the public and private sectors. In-creased awareness will enhance the ability of businesses, consumers, and critical infra-structure to better defend themselves against attacks and intrusions. We are con-fident that all of these goals can be accom-plished without comprising the privacy of an individual’s information. 
I appreciate your leadership on moving 
this important legislation forward to a suc-cessful outcome in the Senate. We support this bipartisan effort and look forward to working with you in the process to ulti-mately move a cyber threat information sharing bill to the President’s desk for signa-ture.

PROTECTING AMERICA ’S 
CYBER NETWORKS COALITION , 
July 21, 2015. 
TO THE MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES  
SENATE : The Protecting America’s Cyber 
Networks Coalition (the coalition) urges the Senate to take up and pass S. 754, the Cyber-security Information Sharing Act (CISA) of 2015. Passing cybersecurity information- sharing legislation is a top policy priority of the coalition, which is a partnership of lead-ing business associations representing nearly every sector of the U.S. economy. 
In March, the Select Committee on Intel-
ligence passed CISA by a strong bipartisan vote (14–1). The Senate can build on the mo-mentum generated in the House to move CISA forward. In April, the House passed two cybersecurity information-sharing bills— H.R. 1560, the Protecting Cyber Networks Act (PCNA), and H.R. 1731, the National Cy-bersecurity Protection Advancement Act (NCPAA) of 2015—with robust majorities from both parties and broad industry sup-port. Our organizations believe that Congress 
needs to send a bill to the president that gives businesses legal certainty that they have safe harbor against frivolous lawsuits when voluntarily sharing and receiving threat indicators and defensive measures in real time and taking actions to mitigate cyberattacks. 
The legislation also needs to offer protec-
tions related to public disclosure, regu-latory, and antitrust matters in order to in-crease the timely exchange of information 
among public and private entities. Coalition members also believe that legislation needs to safeguard privacy and civil liberties and establish appropriate roles for government agencies and departments. CISA reflects sound compromises among many stake-holders on these issues. 
Recent cyber incidents underscore the need 
for legislation to help businesses improve their awareness of cyber threats and to en-hance their protection and response capabili-ties in collaboration with government enti-ties. Cyberattacks aimed at U.S. businesses and government bodies are increasingly being launched from sophisticated hackers, organized crime, and state-sponsored groups. These attacks are advancing in scope and complexity. 
The coalition is committed to working 
with lawmakers and their staff members to get cybersecurity information-sharing legis-lation quickly enacted to strengthen our na-tional security and the protection and resil-ience of U.S. industry. Congressional action cannot come soon enough.

CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF  
THEUNITED STATES OF AMERICA , 
February 14, 2015. 
TO THE MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES  
SENATE : As the Senate prepares to consider 
S. 754, the ‘‘Cybersecurity Information Shar-ing Act of 2015,’’ the U.S. Chamber of Com-merce, the world’s largest business federa-tion representing the interests of more than three million businesses of all sizes, sectors, and regions, as well as state and local cham-bers and industry associations, and dedicated to promoting, protecting, and defending America’s free enterprise system, writes to express our strong opposition to the adop-tion of amendments that would weaken or overly complicate this important bipartisan bill, including issues related to data secu-rity, breach notification, or commercial pri-vacy, which are best addressed in other con-texts. 
The Chamber believes that all provisions of 
S. 754 must support the important goal of protecting critical infrastructure. Unrelated issues, such as data security, breach notifi-cation, and commercial privacy legislation, have not yet received any consideration in the committees of jurisdiction and are not ready for consideration by the full Senate. These sensitive topics should proceed through the legislative process following regular order to ensure complete and delib-erate consideration separate from the pend-ing floor debate on cybersecurity informa-tion sharing legislation. 
Cybersecurity information sharing legisla-
tion meets a dire national security need, and though the Chamber would like to see mean-ingful data security, breach notification, and commercial privacy legislation become law, for the benefit of businesses and consumers alike, we are equally steadfast in our belief that cybersecurity information sharing leg-islation is important for national security and should be Congress’s immediate priority. 
There are 47 separate state laws which deal 
directly with data security and breach noti-fication. The business community has been working with members of Congress in both chambers and on both sides of the aisle to find the right path toward passage of a na-tional data security and breach notification law. However, much work remains to be done, as disagreement continues regarding certain provisions which would be contained in federal legislation. This disagreement is evident in virtually every one of the signifi-cantly different data security bills which have been introduced in the Senate during the last several Congresses. 
The Chamber has appreciated the oppor-
tunity to comment on and offer edits to the various bills and looks forward to working with their authors and cosponsors as legisla-tion works its way through the committee process. However, data security legislation deserves its own due consideration and delib-erate debate, separate from the complicated and pressing national security issue of cyber-security information sharing. For example, the House Energy and Commerce committee has held multiple hearings on proposed legis-lation in addition to a subcommittee mark-up and planned mark up at the full com-mittee level. Though there are issues which need to be resolved in that legislation, the Chamber appreciates the process and consid-eration given and that the bill has worked its way through the proper channels. 
Given the work that still needs to be done 
on data security proposals, the Chamber urges you to keep them separate and apart from cybersecurity information sharing leg-islation and not rush to make changes to the current landscape of state data security, data breach, and commercial privacy laws. Doing so would have a fundamentally nega-tive impact on a broad segment of the Amer-
ican business community. 
Sincerely, 
R. B
RUCE JOSTEN . 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. At the same time, 
the bill includes numerous privacy pro-tections beyond those contained in last year’s bill. Senator B
URRand I worked 
together to address the specific con-cerns raised by the administration, some of our Senate colleagues, and other key stakeholders. Because of these changes, the administration said yesterday that ‘‘cyber security is an 
important national security issue and the Senate should take up this bill as soon as possible and pass it.’’ 
I believe this is a good bill and will 
allow companies and the government to improve the security of their com-puter networks, but this is just a first- step bill. It will not bring an end to successful cyber attacks or thefts, but it will help to address the problem. 
What does this bill do? It provides 
clear direction for the government to share cyber threat information and de-fensive measures with the private sec-tor. 
Two, it authorizes private companies 
to monitor their computer networks and to share cyber threat information and defensive measures with other companies and with the Federal, State, local, and tribal government. 
And three, it creates a process and 
rules to limit how the Federal Govern-ment will and will not use the informa-tion it receives. 
Companies are granted liability pro-
tection for the appropriate monitoring for cyber threats and for sharing and receiving cyber threat information. This liability protection exists for both company-to-company sharing as well as company-to-government sharing consistent with the bill’s terms. Com-panies are also authorized to use defen-sive measures on their own networks for cyber security purposes. 
Since the bill is complicated, let me 
describe what the bill does in more de-tail. 
First, it recognizes that the Federal 
Government has information about cyber threats that it can and should share with the private sector and with State, local, and tribal governments. The bill requires the Director of Na-tional Intelligence to put in place a process that will increase the sharing of information on cyber threats al-ready in the government’s hands with the private sector and help protect an individual or a business. 
Importantly, as the first order of 
business, there will be a managers’ amendment which makes changes to specifically limit the ways the govern-ment can use the cyber security infor-mation it receives. This amendment was distributed on Friday. I would urge everyone to look at it because under the amendment, this bill can only be used for cyber security purposes—no others. It is not a surveillance bill; it is strictly related to cyber security. The bill previously allowed the government to use the information to investigate and prosecute serious violent felonies. That has drawn substantial opposition, and we have removed it in the man-
agers’ package. 
I would now like to take a minute to 
go over some of the privacy protections in the bill. 
No. 1, the bill is strictly voluntary. It 
does not require companies to do any-thing they choose not to do. There is no requirement to share information with another company or with the gov-ernment. The government cannot com-pel any sharing by the private sector. It is completely voluntary. 
No. 2, it narrowly defines the term 
‘‘cyber threat indicator’’ to limit the amount of information that may be shared under the bill. Companies do not share information under this bill 
unless it is specifically about a cyber threat or a cyber defense—nothing else. 
No. 3, the authorizations are clear 
but limited. Companies are fully au-thorized to do three things: monitor their networks or provide monitoring services to their customers to identify cyber threats; use limited defensive measures to protect against cyber threats on their networks; and to share and receive information with each other and with Federal, State, and local governments. 
No. 4, there are mandatory steps 
companies must take, before sharing any cyber threat information with other companies or the government, to review the information for irrelevant privacy information. In other words, the companies must do a privacy scrub. They are required to remove any per-sonal information that is found. Com-panies cannot, as it has been alleged, simply hand over customer informa-tion. 
No. 5, the bill requires that the At-
torney General establish mandatory guidelines to protect privacy for any information the government receives. These guidelines will be public, and they will include consultation with the private sector prior to them being put together. 
The bill requires them to limit how 
long the government can retain any in-formation and provide notification and a process to destroy mistakenly shared information. It also requires the Attor-ney General to create sanctions for any government official who does not fol-low these mandatory privacy guide-lines. 
No. 6, the Department of Homeland 
Security, not the Department of De-fense or the intelligence community, is the primary recipient of cyber informa-tion. In the managers’ amendment, we strengthen the role the Secretary of Homeland Security has in deciding how information sharing will take place. 
No. 7, once the managers’ amend-
ment is adopted, the bill will restrict the government’s use of voluntarily shared information, so the government cannot use this information for law en-forcement purposes unrelated to cyber security and cyber crime.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6261 August 4, 2015 
No. 8, the bill limits liability protec-
tions to monitoring for cyber threats and sharing information about them and only—and only—if a company com-plies with the bill’s privacy require-ments. The bill explicitly excludes pro-tection for gross negligence or willful misconduct. 
No. 9, above and beyond these manda-
tory protections, there are a number of oversight mechanisms in the bill, in-cluding reports by heads of agencies, inspectors general, and the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board. 
In sum, this bill allows for strictly 
voluntary sharing of cyber security in-formation and many layers of privacy protection. 
It is my understanding that the 
chairman of our committee is here, so I would like to skip to the conclusion of my remarks and then be able to turn this over to him. 
The House of Representatives has al-
ready passed two bills this year to im-prove cyber security information shar-ing. The Intelligence Committee has crafted a carefully balanced bill that passed by a 14-to-1 vote in March and it has improved significantly since then through the managers’ amendment. 
We very much need to take this first 
step on cyber security to address the almost daily reports of hacking and cyber threats. I very much hope the Senate will take action now. 
Now I will yield the floor. I want to 
thank the chairman. It has been a pleasure, Mr. Chairman, to work with you. I think I speak for every member of the committee. I am very pleased we have this bill on the floor. God willing and the Members willing, we will be able to pass it one day. 
I yield the floor to the chair of the 
Intelligence Committee. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Carolina. 
Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I want to 
thank my good friend and vice chair of the Intelligence Committee, Senator F
EINSTEIN . She has been in the trench-
es working on cyber security legisla-tion longer than I have. Her passion is displayed in the product that has come out. There has been no person more outspoken on privacy than D
IANNE  
FEINSTEIN . There is no person who has 
been more outspoken on the need for us to get this right than Senator F
EIN-
STEIN . 
Daily, she and I look at some of the 
most sensitive intelligence information that exists in this country. We are charged as a committee—15 individuals out of a body of 100—to provide the oversight to an intelligence commu-nity to make sure they live within the letters of the law or the boundaries set by Executive order. Every day we try to fulfill that job. 
We are sometimes tasked with pro-
ducing legislation, and that is why we are here today with the cyber security bill. It has been referred to that we are here because OPM got hacked. No. We are here because the American people’s data will be in jeopardy if government does not help to find a way to help 
minimize the loss. 
So where is the threat? The threat is 
to business, it is to government, and it is to individuals. There is no part of America that is left out of this. The legislation we are proposing affects ev-erybody in this country—big and small business, State and Federal govern-ments, and individuals, no matter where they live or how much they are worth. I think it is safe to say today that business and government have both been attacked, they have been penetrated, and data has been lost. In some cases that intent was criminal; in some cases the intent was nation- states. It was towards credit cards on one side or Social Security numbers, and on the other side it was plans for the next military platform or intellec-tual property that was owned by a company. But we are where we are, and now we have a proposal as to how we minimize. 
Let me emphasize this. You heard it 
from the vice chairman. This bill does not prevent cyber attacks. I am not sure that we could craft anything that would do that. What this bill does is for the first time it allows us a pathway to minimizing the amount of data that is lost and for the first time empowering government, once they get the perti-nent information, to push out to the rest of business and to individuals and to governments: Here is the type of at-tack that is happening. Here is the tool they are using. Here is the defensive mechanism you can put on your sys-tem that will provide you comfort that they cannot penetrate you and provide the company that has been attacked comfort that it might be able to mini-mize in real time the amount of data that is lost. 
So, as the vice chairman said, these 
are key points on this piece of legisla-tion: It is voluntary. There is no entity in America that is forced to report. It is a purely voluntary system. To have participation in a voluntary system, you have to listen to the folks who are the subjects of these attacks as to what they need to act in real time and to provide pertinent data. 
It is an information-sharing bill. It is 
not a surveillance bill. I say to those who have characterized it that way that we have done everything we can to clarify with the managers’ amend-ment that there is no surveillance. The only thing we are after is minimizing the loss of data that exists. 
Here is how it works. I want to break 
it into three categories. 
This bill covers private to private. It 
says that if I am a private company and my IT system gets hacked and I get penetrated, I can automatically pick up the phone and call the IT peo-ple at my competitor’s business, and I am protected under antitrust, that we can carry out a conversation so that I can figure out whether they got hacked, and if they did but they did not get penetrated, what software did they have on their system that secured their data. I can immediately go and 
put that on my system, and I can mini-mize the loss of any additional data. So we protect for that private-to-private conversation only for the purposes of sharing cyber information. 
We also have private to government. 
We allow any company, in real time— at the same time they are talking to a competitor, they can transmit elec-tronically the pertinent data that it takes to do the forensics of what hap-
pened. What tool did they use? They can transfer that to government, and they are protected from a liability standpoint for the transfer of that—the vice chairman got into all of this, so I do not want to rehash it—with the cor-rect protections of personal data. The company is required not to send per-sonal data. Any government agency that is the recipient of this data, as they go through it, if they see personal data that is not relevant to the deter-mination of what type of attack, what type of tool, what type of response, then they have to minimize that data so it is not released. 
In addition, we have government to 
private, which is the third leg. It amazed me that the government did not have the authority to push out a lot of information. What we do is we empower the government to analyze the attack, to determine the tool that was used, to find the most appropriate defensive software mechanism, and then to say to business broadly: There is an attack that has happened in America. This is the tool they used. This is the defensive mechanism that will protect the data at your company. 
If you ask me, I think this is what we 
are here for. This is what the Congress of the United States is supposed to do— facilitate, through minor tweaks, a voluntary participation to close the door and minimize potential loss. That is all we are attempting to do. 
I want to loop back to where the vice 
chairman was. We are now at the point where we are asking our colleagues for unanimous consent to come to the floor and actually take up this bill. Moving to the bill allows our col-leagues to come to the floor with rel-evant amendments to the bill, where they can be debated and voted on. 
I actually believe, Vice Chairman, if 
we could do that now, we could process this entire bill and all of the amend-ments that are relevant by this time tomorrow. That would mean we would have to work and we would have to talk and we would have to vote, but we could do it because I think when we look at the array of relevant amend-ments, they are pretty well defined. Some of them are duplications of oth-ers that people have planned to talk about. 
But to suggest that this is a problem, 
which it is—we have seen it with over 22 million government workers whose personal data and in some cases, be-cause of the forms they had to fill out for security clearance, their most sen-sitive data has gotten out of the OPM system.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6262 August 4, 2015 
Just because OPM was the last one, 
don’t think that somebody wasn’t seri-ous. Don’t think that Anthem Blue Cross wasn’t serious. Don’t think that some of the attacks that only acquired credit card information aren’t serious. 
What we are attempting to do is to 
minimize the degree of that loss. All we need is the cooperation of every Member of the Senate to say: I am will-ing to move to the bill. I am willing to bring up amendments—relevant amendments—willing to debate them and willing to vote on them. 
Process is where we are. At the end 
of the day, we can determine whether this is a bill that is worthy to move on. It is not the end of the road because once we get through in the Senate we have to conference the bill with the House of Representatives. As the vice chairman pointed out, they have pro-duced multiple pieces of legislation. It is the Senate that is now holding us back. 
I urge my colleagues: Let’s agree to 
move to the bill. Let’s agree to rel-evant amendments, and let’s process this cyber security bill so that when we come back from August, we can actu-ally sit down with our colleagues in the House, conference a bill, and provide the American people with a little bit of security, knowing that we are going to minimize the amount of data that is lost, because of a voluntary program between the private sector and the gov-ernment. 
I think the vice chairman shares my 
belief that we are not scared to have a debate on relevant amendments on this bill. We understand there are more views than just ours. But we have to get on the bill to be able to offer amendments, to be able to share what we know that might not necessarily support the amendment. 
Right now, we are sort of frozen be-
cause we cannot offer amendments, in-cluding the managers’ amendment, which I would say to my colleagues— and the vice chairman said this in a very specific way—if you will read the managers’ amendment, a lot of the concerns that people have will vanish. Nobody will call it a surveillance bill because we have addressed the issues that people were concerned with. Al-though we didn’t think they were prob-lems before, we clarified it in a way that it is limited only to cyber secu-rity. I could make a tremendous case that through the cyber security foren-sic process, if we found another crimi-nal act, the American people probably would want that reported—without a doubt. 
Mr. M
CCAIN. Will the Senator yield 
for a question? 
Mr. BURR. I am pleased to yield for 
a question. 
Mr. M CCAIN. In light of recent 
events that have dominated the news, including the breach of millions of Americans’ privileged information, which could be used in ways to harm them, do you think it is a good idea for the Senate to go out into a month-long recess without at least having debates, 
votes, and amendments on this issue? 
Does the Senator know of an issue 
right now that impacts the lives of ev-eryday Americans such as this threat of cyber security attacks on the citi-zens of the United States? 
Mr. BURR. I thank the Senator for 
the question, and I think he knows the answer. 
We should dispose of this. The easiest 
way, as I shared earlier, is that if we get on this bill and we process amend-ments, if we really wanted to, we could finish tomorrow. The reality is that it doesn’t take a long time to debate amendments, to vote on amendments, and to be done. 
At the end of the day, every Member 
would have to make a decision as to whether they are supportive or against the bill. But not getting on the bill, not offering amendments cheats the American people. 
Mr. M
CCAIN. I will just ask one more 
question. 
It is obvious that the Senator from 
California and the Senator from North Carolina have worked very closely to-gether on this issue. They are the two leaders on intelligence now for a num-ber of years. 
Wouldn’t it seem logical that with a 
bipartisan piece of legislation that ad-dresses an issue—I guess my question is this: How many Americans have been affected most recently by cyber attacks, and what would this legisla-tion do to try to prohibit that from happening again? Don’t we have some obligation to try to address the vulner-abilities of average American everyday citizens? 
Mr. BURR. I think the answer is 
there have been millions of Americans whose private data has been breached for numerous reasons. The Senator from Arizona is correct. We have an ob-ligation to do what we can to minimize that loss. 
Mr. M
CCAIN. And isn’t this a bipar-
tisan product? 
Mr. BURR. Well, this is very much a 
bipartisan bill, and I think it is a bi-cameral effort. It is not as if this is a limb we are walking out on and the House isn’t already out there. Em-phatically, I implore my colleagues: Let’s get on the bill. Let’s come and offer relevant amendments, and let’s process those amendments as quickly as we can. I think we can accommodate both, the need to leave for August and to go see the people we are married to and get away from the people we see every day who influence us in numer-ous ways—I am speaking of the Sen-ator from Arizona right now, and I know he is anxious to go somewhere other than here—and to process this bill, which is to do our work. To not get on the bill, to not offer amend-ments is to ignore the responsibilities that we have. 
Mr. M
CCAIN. I wish to just finally 
say to the Senator from North Carolina that I appreciate the hard work he and the Senator from California have put in on this issue. It has been said by our 
military leaders that right now one of the greatest vulnerabilities to national security is the possibility or likelihood of cyber attacks. The implications of that far exceed that of the invasion of someone’s privacy. 
I thank him and the Senator from 
California for their hard work on this. I think it at least deserves debate and amendments, and hopefully we can pass it before we go out for the recess. 
Mr. BURR. I thank the Senator from 
Arizona, who has worked closely with us since the beginning to try to move this bill together. Hopefully, at our lunches today, we will have an oppor-tunity to talk to our Members in the hopes that we can come back from lunch and maybe get started on this bill. 
With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes, recognizing that it is after 12:30 p.m. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
NUCLEAR AGREEMENT WITH IRAN  
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, in Novem-
ber 2013, the United States and five global powers, the P5+1, announced an interim deal to freeze Iran’s nuclear program and negotiate a diplomatic resolution to one of the most chal-lenging issues affecting global secu-rity. 
Since then, as a member of the Sen-
ate Armed Services Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee, I par-ticipated in scores of hearings, classi-fied briefings, meetings, and calls about this topic in Virginia, Wash-ington, and during five trips to the Middle East, including two trips to Israel. 
I have listened to the administration, 
to allies in the Middle East and else-where, to current and former Senate colleagues—especially former Armed Services Chairmen John Warner and Carl Levin—to national security and foreign policy experts, to critics and proponents of the deal, to American military leaders and troops, and also to my constituents. I helped write the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, under which Congress is currently en-gaging in a 60-day review period to ap-prove or disapprove of the suspension of congressional sanctions as part of the final deal announced July 15. 
Based on my review of this complex 
matter, I acknowledge that every op-tion before us involves risk with upside and downside consequences. 
I understand how people of good will 
can reach different conclusions, but I also conclude that the Joint Com-prehensive Plan of Action is a dramatic improvement over the status quo at improving global security for the next 15 years and, likely, longer. 
In this deal, America has honored its 
best traditions and shown that patient

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6263 August 4, 2015 
diplomacy can achieve what isolation 
and hostility cannot. 
For this reason, I will support the 
deal. 
Prior to the interim negotiation in 
November of 2013, and even in the face of a punishing international sanctions regime, Iran’s nuclear program was marching ahead. Iran had amassed more than 19,000 centrifuges to enrich uranium, and that number was grow-ing. Iran had produced more than 11,000 kilograms of enriched uranium, and that stockpile was growing. Iran had perfected the ability to enrich uranium to the 20-percent level, and that enrich-ment level was growing. Iran was con-structing a heavy-water facility at Arak capable of producing weapons- grade plutonium, and Iran only allowed limited IAEA access to its declared nu-clear facilities, shielding its operation and inspection of covert nuclear sites. 
The program, when diplomacy began, 
was months away from being able to produce enough enriched uranium to make a nuclear weapon. 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu told the United Nations in 2012: 
For over seven years, the international 
community has tried sanctions with Iran. Under the leadership of President Obama, the international community has passed some of the strongest sanctions to date. . . . It’s had an effect on the economy, but we must face the truth. Sanctions have not stopped Iran’s nuclear program. 
We must face the truth. A punishing 
sanctions regime did not stop Iran’s nuclear program. The nuclear program will only stop by a diplomatic agree-ment or by military action. While mili-tary action has to be an option, it is in America’s interest—and in the interest of the entire world—to use every effort to find a diplomatic resolution. In fact, that was the purpose of the Iranian sanctions to begin with—to open a path to a diplomatic solution. 
We now have a diplomatic solution 
on the table. The JCPOA is not perfect because all parties made concessions, as is the case in any serious diplomatic negotiation. But it has gained broad international support because it pre-vents Iran from getting sufficient ura-nium for a bomb for at least 15 years. It also stops any pathway to a pluto-nium weapon for that period, and it ex-poses Iranian covert activity to en-hanced scrutiny by the international community forever. 
Under the deal, Iran does the fol-
lowing: It affirms that ‘‘under no cir-cumstances will Iran ever seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons,’’ it re-duces its quantity of centrifuges by more than two-thirds, and it slashes its uranium stockpile by 97 percent to 300 kilograms for 15 years. This is dramati-cally less than what Iran would need to produce even a single weapon. It caps the enrichment level of the remaining uranium stockpile at 3.67 percent. It reconfigures the Iraq reactor so that it can no longer produce weapons-grade plutonium. It commits to a series of limitations on R&D activities to guar-
antee that any nuclear program will be ‘‘for exclusively peaceful purposes’’ in full compliance with international nonproliferation rules. Finally, Iran agrees to a robust set of international inspections of its declared nuclear fa-cilities, its entire uranium supply chain, and its suspected covert facili-ties by a team of more than 130 inter-national inspectors. 
After year 15, the unique caps and re-
quirements imposed on Iran are pro-gressively lifted through year 2025. After year 25, Iran is permanently obli-gated to abide by all international non-proliferation treaty requirements, in-cluding the extensive inspections re-quired by the NPT Additional Protocol, and its agreement that it will never ‘‘seek, develop, or acquire any nuclear weapons’’ continues forever. 
If Iran breaks this agreement, nu-
clear sanctions may be reimposed. The United States reserves the right to sanction Iran for activities unrelated to its nuclear program, including sup-port for terrorism, arms shipments, and human rights violations. 
Finally, and importantly, the United 
States and our partners maintain the ability to use military action if Iran seeks to obtain a nuclear weapon in violation of this deal. The knowledge of the Iranian program gained through extensive inspections will improve the effectiveness of any military action, and the clarity of Iran’s commitment to the world—in the first paragraph of the agreement—that it will never pur-sue nuclear weapons will make it easi-er to gain international support for military action should Iran violate their unequivocal pledge. 
This deal does not solve all out-
standing issues with an adversarial re-gime. In that sense, it is similar to the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty President Kennedy negotiated with the Soviet Union in the midst of the Cold War. Iran’s support for terrorism remains a major concern, and we must increase efforts with our regional allies to counter those malign activities. But at the end of the day, this agreement is not about making an ally out of an ad-versary, it is about denying an adver-sary a path to obtaining nuclear weap-ons. 
This deal takes a nuclear weapons 
program that was on the verge of suc-cess and disables it for many years through peaceful diplomatic means with sufficient tools for the inter-national community to verify whether Iran is meeting its commitments. I hope this resolution might open the door to diplomatic discussion of other tough issues with Iran. 
In conclusion, monitoring this agree-
ment and countering Iran’s nonnuclear activity will require great diligence by the United States, our allies, and the IAEA, and there will be an important role for Congress in this ongoing work. I look forward to working with my col-leagues on measures to guarantee close supervision and enforcement of this deal. That work will be arduous, but it 
is far preferable to allowing Iran to re-turn to a march toward nuclear weap-ons. It is also far preferable to any other alternative, including war. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

CYBERSECURITY INFORMATION 
SHARING ACT OF 2015—MOTION TO PROCEED—Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arizona. 
Mr. M
CCAIN. Mr. President, I would 
like to thank my friend from Florida, Senator N
ELSON , for allowing me to 
speak for 5 minutes. I ask unanimous consent that he be recognized imme-diately following me—not the Senator from New Mexico, the Senator from Florida. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. M
CCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in 
strong support of S. 754, the Cybersecu-rity Information Sharing Act. I want to thank my colleagues Chairman B
URRand Vice Chairman F EINSTEIN for 
their leadership on this critically im-portant legislation. This bill, of which I am an original cosponsor, was over-whelmingly approved by a 14-to-1 vote in the Senate Select Committee on In-telligence in March. 
Enacting legislation to confront the 
accumulating dangers of cyber threats must be among the highest national se-curity priorities of the Congress. Cyber attacks on our Nation have become dis-turbingly common. More recently, it was the Office of Personnel Manage-ment. A few weeks before that, it was the Pentagon network, the White House, and the State Department. Be-fore that it was Anthem and Sony— just to name a few. The status quo is unacceptable, and Congress needs to do its part in passing this legislation. But the President, as our Nation’s Com-mander in Chief, must also do his part to deter the belligerence of our adver-saries in cyber space. 
The threats from China, Russia, 
North Korea, and Iran—not to mention the aspirations of terrorist organiza-tions like ISIL and Al Qaeda—are steadily growing in number and sever-ity. And our national security leader-ship has warned us repeatedly that we could face a cyber attack against our Nation’s critical infrastructure in the not too distant future. I believe our re-sponse to such an attack, or lack thereof, could define the future of war-fare. 
To date, the U.S. response to cyber 
attacks has been tepid at best, and nonexistent at worst. Unless and until

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6264 August 4, 2015 
the President uses the authorities he 
has to deter, defend, and respond to the growing number and severity of cyber attacks, we will risk not just more of the same but emboldened adversaries and terrorist organizations that will continuously pursue more severe and destructive cyber attacks. 
As ADM Mike Rogers, the com-
mander of U.S. Cyber Command, told listeners at the Aspen Security Forum a couple weeks ago, ‘‘to date there is little price to pay for engaging in some pretty aggressive behaviors.’’ Accord-ing to James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, ‘‘we will see a progression or expansion of that enve-lope until such time as we create both a substance and psychology of deter-rence. And today we don’t have that.’’ 
According to the Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Dempsey, our military enjoys ‘‘a significant mili-tary advantage’’ in every domain ex-cept for one—cyber space. As General Dempsey said, cyber ‘‘is a level playing field. And that makes this chairman very uncomfortable.’’ Efforts are cur-rently underway to begin addressing some of our strategic shortfalls in cyber space, including the training of a 6,200-person cyber force. However, these efforts will be meaningless unless we make the tough policy decisions to establish meaningful cyber deterrence. The President must take steps now to demonstrate to our adversaries that the United States takes cyber attacks seriously and is prepared to respond. 
This legislation before us is one piece 
of that overall deterrent strategy, and it is long past time that Congress move forward on information sharing legisla-tion. The voluntary information shar-ing framework in this legislation is critical to addressing these threats and ensuring that the mechanisms are in place to identify those responsible for costly and crippling cyber attacks and, ultimately, deter future attacks. 
Many of us have spent countless 
hours crafting and debating cyber leg-islation back to 2012. Mr. President, 2012 was the last time we attempted to pass major cyber legislation. This body has come a long way since that time. We understand that we cannot improve our cyber posture by shackling the pri-vate sector, which operates the major-ity of our country’s critical infrastruc-ture, with government mandates. As I argued at that time, heavyhanded reg-ulations and government bureaucracy will do more harm than good in cyber space. The voluntary framework in this legislation represents the progress we have made in defining the role of the private sector and the role of the gov-ernment in sharing threat information, defending networks, and deterring cyber attacks. 
This legislation also complements 
actions we have taken in the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, currently in conference with the House. As chairman of the Armed Serv-ices Committee, cyber security is one of my top priorities. That is why the NDAA includes a number of critical 
cyber provisions designed to ensure the Department of Defense has the capa-bilities it needs to deter aggression, de-fend our national security interests, and, when called upon, defeat our ad-versaries in cyber space. 
The NDAA authorizes the Secretary 
of Defense to develop, prepare, coordi-nate, and, when authorized by the President, conduct a military cyber op-eration in response to malicious cyber activity carried out against the United States or a United States person by a foreign power. The NDAA also author-izes $200 million for the Secretary of Defense to assess the cyber vulnerabili-ties of every major DOD weapons sys-tem. Finally, Congress required the President to submit an integrated pol-icy to deter adversaries in cyber space in the fiscal year 2014 NDAA. We are still waiting on that policy, and this year’s NDAA includes funding restric-tions that will remain in place until it is delivered. 
Every day that goes by, I fear our Na-
tion grows more vulnerable, our pri-vacy and security are at greater risk, and our adversaries are further emboldened. These are the stakes, and that is why it is essential that we come together and pass the Cybersecurity In-formation Sharing Act. 
Mr. President, I thank again my 
friend from Florida, who is a valued member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, for his indulgence to allow me to speak. I thank my colleague. 
I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
NUCLEAR AGREEMENT WITH IRAN  
Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I rise to 
announce my decision on the Iranian nuclear agreement, the Joint Com-prehensive Plan of Action. 
This decision of mine comes after 
considerable study of the issue—as have our colleagues in the Senate taken this quite seriously. I have talked with folks on all sides of the issue. These include colleagues as well as constituents. It includes experts on the Middle East and Central Asia, arms control experts, foreign allies, and, as we say in my constituency, it includes just plain folks. I want to say that Sec-retary Moniz, a nuclear physicist, has been especially helpful. 
Needless to say, I wish that the three 
Americans jailed in Iran and Bob Levinson, a former FBI agent missing in Iran for 8 years, had been a part of an agreement—of this agreement—to return them. The Levinson family in Florida is anxious for information and help to return Bob. This is personal for me. 
I am a strong supporter of Israel, and 
I recognize that country as one of America’s most important allies. I am committed to the protection of Israel as the best and right foreign policy for the United States and our allies. 
I am blessed to represent Florida, 
which also has among our citizens a strong and vibrant Jewish community, including many Holocaust survivors 
and Holocaust victims’ families, some of whom I have worked with to help them get just compensation from Euro-pean insurance companies that turned their backs on them after World War II and would not honor their insurance claims. 
In our State we are also proud to 
have a Floridian, a former U.S. and Miami Beach resident, as the Israeli Ambassador to the United States. Am-bassador Ron Dermer grew up in Miami Beach. His father and brother are former mayors. He is someone I have enjoyed getting to know and have had several conversations with over the years and recently spent time talking to him about his opposition to this joint agreement. 
I acknowledge that this has been one 
of the most important preparations and will be one of the most important votes that I will cast in the Senate be-cause the foreign and defense policy consequences are both huge for the United States and our allies. 
Unless there is an unexpected change 
in the conditions and facts before the vote is called in September—and it will be called on the very first day that we return in September—unless there is an unexpected change, I will support the nuclear agreement between Iran and the P5+1—which are the United States, the UK, France, Russia, China, and Germany—because I am convinced it will stop Iran from developing a nu-clear weapon for at least the next 10 to 15 years. No other available alternative accomplishes this vital objective. 
The goal of this almost 2-year nego-
tiation—culminated in this deal—was to deny Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. This objective has been ful-filled in the short term. For the next 10 years, Iran will reduce its centrifuges— the machines that enrich the ura-nium—by two-thirds. They will go from more than 19,000 centrifuges to 6,000. Only 5,000 of those will be operating, all at Natanz, all the most basic mod-els. The deeply buried Fordow facility will be converted to a research lab. No enrichment can occur there, and no fissile material can be stored there. For the next 15 years, Iran’s stockpile of low-enriched uranium—which cur-rently amounts to 12,000 kilograms; enough for 10 bombs—will be reduced by 98 percent, to only 300 kilograms. Research and development into ad-vanced centrifuges will also be limited. Taken together, these constraints will lengthen the time it would take for Iran to produce the highly enriched uranium for one bomb—the so-called breakout time. It will lengthen it from 2 to 3 months that they could break out now to more than 1 year. That is more than enough time to detect and, if necessary, stop Iran from racing to a bomb. 
Iran’s ability to produce a bomb 
using plutonium will also be blocked under this deal. The Arak reactor— which as currently constructed could produce enough plutonium for one to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6265 August 4, 2015 
two bombs every year—will be rede-
signed to produce no weapons-grade plutonium. And Iran will have to ship out the spent fuel from the reactor for-ever. 
Iran signed the Nuclear Non-Pro-
liferation Treaty in 1968, in which they agreed they would not pursue nuclear weapons. Iran has reaffirmed this prin-ciple in this joint agreement. Iran also says they want to eventually make low-grade nuclear fuel, as other NPT- compliant nations do, in order to produce electricity. If they comply, they will eventually be allowed to do so under this joint agreement. Our ex-pectation is that in 15 years, when Iran can lift the limit of 300 kilograms of low-enriched uranium, if they have not cheated, they will continue to abide by their NPT obligations and use their fuel only for electricity and medical isotopes. If they deviate from those ci-vilian purposes, then harsh economic sanctions will result, and, very pos-sibly, U.S. military action. 
The world will be a very different 
place in 10 to 15 years. If we can buy this much time, instead of Iran devel-oping a nuclear bomb in the near fu-ture, then that is reason enough for me to vote to uphold this agreement. If the United States walks away from this multinational agreement, then I be-lieve we would find ourselves alone in the world with little credibility, but there are many more reasons to sup-port this agreement. 
The opponents of the agreement say 
that war is not the only alternative to the agreement. Indeed, they, as articu-lated by the Israeli Ambassador, say we should oppose the agreement by re-fusing to lift congressional economic sanctions, and the result will be that the international sanctions will stay in place, that Iran will continue to feel the economic pinch, and therefore Iran will come back to the table and nego-tiate terms more favorable to the United States and our allies. 
If the United States kills the deal 
that most of the rest of the world is for, there is no question in this Sen-ator’s mind that the sanctions will start to erode, and they may collapse altogether. We just had a meeting with all the P5+1 Ambassadors to the United States, and they reaffirmed that exact fact. Sanctions rely on more than just the power of the U.S. economy, they depend on an underlying political con-sensus in support of a common objec-tive. China, Russia, and many other nations eager to do business with Iran went along with our economic sanc-tions because they believed they were a temporary cost to pay until Iran agreed to a deal to limit their nuclear program. That fragile consensus in sup-port of U.S. policy is likely to fall apart if we jettison this deal. 
I think it is unrealistic to think we 
can stop oil-hungry countries in Asia from buying Iranian oil, especially when offered bargain basement prices. It is equally unrealistic to think we can continue to force foreign banks that hold the Iranian oil dollars— 
banks in China, India, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan that have seques-tered Iranians’ oil dollars—it is unreal-istic to expect that they will hold on to that cash simply because we threaten them with U.S. banking sanctions. How will such threats be taken seriously when these countries, taken together, 
hold nearly half of America’s debt, making any decision to sanction them extraordinarily difficult. Killing this deal by rejecting it means the sanc-tions are going to be weaker than they are today, not stronger, and the United States cannot simply get a better deal with Iran, with less economic leverage and less international support. That is a fact we are having to face. Of course, if we rejected it and if the sanctions crumbled, all of this would probably happen while Iran would be racing to build a bomb. Without this deal, Iran’s breakout time could quickly shrink from months to a handful of weeks or days. 
It is reasonable to ask why Iran 
would agree to negotiate a delay in their nuclear program that they have advanced over the years at the cost of billions of dollars. The simple answer is they need the money. The Iranian economy is hurting because of the sanctions, and Iran’s Supreme Leader needs to satisfy rising expectations of average Iranians, who are restless to have a bigger slice of the economic pie with more and better goods and sup-plies. 
So they have an interest in striking 
a deal, but does that mean we trust Iran’s Government? No, not at all. The Iranian religious leadership encourages hardliners there to chant ‘‘Death to America’’ and ‘‘Death to Israel.’’ Therefore, this agreement can’t be built on trust. We must have a good enough mechanism in place to catch them when and if they cheat; in other words, don’t trust but verify. 
I believe the agreement sets out a 
reasonable assurance that Iran will not be able to hide the development of a bomb at declared or undeclared sites. The International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors will have immediate access to declared sites—the Arak reac-tor and the enrichment facilities at Natanz and Fordow. 
For the next 20 to 25 years, inspectors 
will also have regular access to the en-tire supply chain, including uranium mines and mills, centrifuge production, assembly, and storage sites. That means inspectors will catch Iran if they try to use the facilities we know about to build a weapon or if they try to divert materials to a secret pro-gram. To confirm that Iran is not building a covert bomb, this agreement ensures that inspectors will have ac-cess to suspicious sites with no more than a 24-day delay. I know there has been a lot of conversation about that. It is broken off into days. At the end of the day, it must be physical access. Now, would this Senator prefer they get in instantaneously? Of course. Could Iran hide some activities rel-
evant to nuclear weapons research? Possibly. But to actually make a bomb, Iran’s secret activity would have to en-rich the fuel for a device—and they couldn’t cover that up if they had years, let alone do so in a few weeks. Traces of enriched uranium or a secret plutonium program do not suddenly vanish, and they can’t be covered up with a little paint and asphalt. So I am convinced that under the agreement, Iran cannot cheat and expect to get away with it. 
On top of the unprecedented IAEA in-
spections established by this deal is the vast and little understood world of American and allied intelligence. This Senator served on the Intelligence Committee for 6 years and now has clearances on the Armed Services Com-mittee. I can state unequivocally that U.S. intelligence is very good and ex-tensive and will overlay IAEA inspec-tions. Remember, we discovered their secret activities in the past, even with-out the kinds of inspections put in place by this joint agreement. So if Iran tries to violate its commitment— its commitment not to build nuclear weapons—and if the IAEA doesn’t find 
out, I am confident our intelligence ap-paratus will. 
What about the part of the joint 
agreement that allows the conven-tional arms embargo to be lifted in 5 years and missile technology to be lift-ed in 8 years? I understand it was al-ways going to be tough to keep these restrictions in place, and I don’t like that those restrictions are not there. Fortunately, even when the arms em-bargo expires, five other U.N. resolu-tions passed since 2004 will continue to be in force to prohibit Iran from ex-porting arms to terrorists and to mili-tants. These have had some success, al-beit limited, as in the case of the U.S. Navy stopping arms shipments to the Houthis in Yemen. These same U.N. resolutions will stay in place to block future Iranian arms shipments to oth-ers. We also have nonnuclear sanctions tools we can—and we must—continue to use to go after those who traffic in Iranian arms and missiles. 
Will this agreement allow Iran to 
continue to be a state sponsor of ter-rorism? Yes, but they now have the ca-pability to develop a nuclear weapon within months and still be a state sponsor of terrorism. I believe it is in the U.S. interest that Iran is not a nu-clear power sponsoring terrorism. As 
dangerous a threat that Iran is to Israel and our allies, it would pale in comparison to the threat posed to them and to us by a nuclear-armed Iran. 
Would I prefer a deal that dismantles 
their entire program forever and ends all of Iran’s bad behavior? Of course I would. But how do we get a better deal that the opposition wants? We don’t have that opportunity if the sanctions fall apart, and that is exactly what would happen if we reject this deal. Iran will emerge less isolated and less constrained to build a nuclear weapon.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6266 August 4, 2015 
Under the deal, we keep most of the 
world with us. That means, if the Ira-nians cheat, they know we can snap back the economic sanctions and cut off their oil money. This joint agree-ment declares that Iran will never ever be allowed to develop a nuclear weap-on. If they break their agreement, even in 10 or 15 years, every financial and military option will still be available to us, and those options will be backed by ever-improving military capabilities and more and better intelligence. 
So when I look at all the things for 
the agreement and against the agree-ment, it becomes pretty obvious to me to vote in favor of the agreement. 
I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, our 
government was recently struck by a devastating cyber attack that has been described as one of the worst breaches in U.S. history. It was a major blow to the privacy of millions of Americans. We know the private sector is vulner-able to attack as well. The House has already passed two White House- backed cyber security bills to help ad-dress the issue. Similar legislation is now before the Senate. It is strong, bi-partisan, and transparent. It has been vetted and overwhelmingly endorsed 14 to 1 by both parties in committee. 
It would help both the public and pri-
vate sectors to defeat cyber attacks. The top Senate Democrat on this issue reminds us it would protect individual privacy and civil liberties too. Now is the time to allow the Senate to debate and then pass this bipartisan bill. 
In just a moment, I will offer a fair 
consent request to allow the Senate to do just that. The Democratic leader previously said that both he and the senior Senator from Oregon believe the Senate should be able to finish the bill ‘‘in a couple of days . . . at the most.’’ And just today he said the Democrats remain willing to proceed to this bipar-tisan bill if allowed to offer some rel-evant amendments. The senior Senator from New York has also said that Democrats want to get to the bill and that they want to get a few amend-ments too. 
Our friends across the aisle will be 
glad to know that the UC I am about to offer would allow 10 relevant amend-ments per side to be offered and made pending. That is a good and fair start that exceeds the request from our friends across the aisle. 
Now that we have a path forward 
that gives both sides what they said they need, I would invite our col-leagues to join us now in moving for-ward on this bill. I invite our col-leagues to allow the Senate to cooper-ate in a spirit of good faith to pass a bill this week so we can help protect the American people from more dev-astating cyber attacks. 
I notified the Democratic leader that 
I would propound the following consent request: I ask unanimous consent that the cloture motion on the motion to proceed to calendar No. 28, S. 754, be 
withdrawn and that the Senate imme-diately proceed to its consideration. I further ask that Senator B
URRthen be 
recognized to offer the Burr-Feinstein substitute amendment and that it be in order during today’s session of the Sen-ate for the bill managers, or their des-ignees, to offer up to 10 first-degree amendments relevant to the substitute per side. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. REID. Reserving the right to ob-
ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The mi-
nority leader. 
Mr. REID. The Republican leader is 
my friend, and I don’t mean in any way to disparage him, other than to bring out a little bit of history. I can’t imag-ine how he can make this offer with a straight face. Have amendments pend-ing? That is like nothing. We tried that before, as recently as the highway bill. Having amendments pending doesn’t mean anything. 
We want to pass a good cyber secu-
rity bill. We have a bill that has been crafted in the intelligence committee. Other committees have been interested in participating in what we have here on the floor, but they are willing to say: OK. We have a bill from the intel-ligence committee. 
There have been no public committee 
hearings, no public markups. There has been nothing done other than a rule XIV which, of course, my friend said he would not do if he got to be the leader and there would be a robust amend-ment process. Having a robust amend-ment process has nothing to do with having amendments pending. 
We want to pass a good bill. But we 
want to have a reasonable number of amendments, and there will be votes on those amendments. We are not asking for longtime agreements. The Repub-lican leader’s proposal would not lead to votes on the amendments. He would allow the amendments to be pending, but if the Republican leader were to file cloture, as he has done repeatedly the last few months—and an example is what he did with the recent highway bill—all amendments that were not strictly germane would fall. 
Remember, we are not asking for ger-
mane amendments. We are asking for relevant amendments. We are willing to enter into an agreement that pro-vides votes on a reasonable number of amendments that would be germane in nature, and we should be working on that agreement. 
In contrast, if we fail to get that 
agreement, we are going to have a clo-ture vote an hour after we come in in the morning, and 30 hours after that— sometime late Thursday afternoon or early Thursday evening—he would have to file cloture on that. That puts us right into the work period when we get back on September 8. 
When we get back, we have the 8th to 
the 17th, including weekends and a hol-iday that is celebrated every year that we always take off, which includes 2 
days. It is a Jewish holiday. I can’t imagine why we would want this to interfere with what we are trying to do in the month of September. 
We are willing to do this bill. We can 
start working on these amendments right now if we can have votes on them, but we are not going to agree to some arrangement like this. If the Re-publicans are going to push this, we can come in here tomorrow, and we will vote. The 30 hours of time will go by—and we know how to use 30 hours; we were taught how to do that—30 hours of postcloture time. And Thurs-day afternoon, the leader can make whatever decision is necessary. 
We want a cyber bill. This bill is not 
the phoenix of all cyber bills, but it certainly is better than nothing. We should—following the recommendation and the suggestion and what the Re-publican leader has said he would do— be allowed some amendments to vote on. We can start that today. Today is Tuesday. We can finish these amend-ments—I would hope on the Demo-cratic side—in a fairly short order of time. 
As for the Republicans, I don’t know. 
All I heard following the caucus is one Republican Senator wanted to offer an amendment on the cyber bill dealing with auditing the Fed. I can’t imagine why that has anything to do with this bill. 
We are serious about legislating. We 
want to do something that is good, we believe, for the country, good for the order of the Senate. Otherwise, we will look at each other around here until Thursday afternoon, and the Repub-lican leader can look forward to this being the first thing we take up when we get back in September. We are will-ing to be fair and reasonable to finish this, with our amendments, in a very short period of time. So I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, let 
me say, I think there may well be a way forward here. What I thought I heard the Democratic leader say is that they are interested in passing a bill. That is important. He said when it was offered on the defense authoriza-tion bill that it was a 2-day bill, and we could agree to a limited number of amendments. 
I think we both agree this is an im-
portant subject. I can’t imagine that either the Democrats or the Repub-licans want to leave here for a month and not pass the cyber security bill. I think there is enough interest on both sides to try to continue to discuss the matter and see if there is a way for-ward. That would be in the best inter-est of the country if we could come to-gether and do this. This bill came out of the intelligence committee 14 to 1.

STEIN have been asking for floor time.

across the floor. I am hoping the Demo-
cratic leader and I can continue to dis-cuss the matter and that we can find a way forward. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Democratic leader. 
Mr. REID. Mr. President, I look for-
ward to that discussion. Keep in mind, being reported out of committee—this is a committee that holds everything in secret. They do nothing public. So having a 14 to 1 vote in a meeting that takes place in secret doesn’t give the other Senators who are not on that committee a lot of solace. 
I look forward to the Republican 
leader and me and our staffs working together to try to come up with some way to move forward on this legisla-tion. We want to do that. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, as 
my good friend the Democratic leader used to remind me, the majority leader always gets the last word. 
This is not a new issue. It was around 
during the previous Congress. Other committees acted—other committee chairmen like what Chairman B
URR 
and Vice Chair F EINSTEIN have done. 
Hopefully, we can minimize sort of manufacturing problems here that keep us from going forward when it ap-pears to me that both sides really would like to get an outcome and be-lieve it would be best for the country to get an outcome before we go into the recess. We will continue to discuss the matter and hope that we can find a way forward. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. 
L
ANKFORD ). The Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will be 
very brief. I understand there has al-ready been an objection. 
I will speak later in the afternoon or 
early evening in some detail about why I have significant reservations with re-spect to this legislation. 
To say—as we heard again and again 
throughout the day—that this is about voluntary information sharing is essen-tially only half true. The fact is, com-panies could volunteer to share their customers’ information with the gov-ernment, but they wouldn’t have to ask for permission from their customers before handing it over. That is one rea-son every major organization with ex-pertise and interest on privacy issues has had reservations about the bill. It may be voluntary for companies, but it is mandatory for their customers and their consumers. They are not given the opportunity to opt out. 
The legislation has been public for 
months, and dozens of cyber security experts have said it wouldn’t do much to stop sophisticated, large-scale at-tacks such as the horrendous attack at the Office of Personnel Management. 
On Friday, the Department of Home-
land Security—an absolutely essential agency as it relates to this bill—wrote a letter to our colleague, the distin-guished Senator from Minnesota, Mr. F
RANKEN , and said if this bill’s ap-proach is adopted, ‘‘the complexity and 
inefficiency of any information sharing program will markedly increase.’’ The Department of Homeland Security added that the bill ‘‘could sweep away important privacy protections.’’ That is a pretty strong indictment from the agency that would be in charge of im-plementing the legislation. 
As I have indicated a couple of times 
in the last day or so, I think the man-agers, Senator F
EINSTEIN and Senator 
BURR, have made several positive 
changes, but the bottom line is it doesn’t address the very substantial privacy concerns that relate to this bill. The fact is, cyber security is a very serious problem in America. 
Oregonians know a lot about it be-
cause one of our large employers was 
hacked by the Chinese. SolarWorld was hacked by the Chinese because they in-sisted on enforcing their rights under trade law. In fact, our government in-dicted the Chinese for the hack of my constituents and others. 
So cyber security is a serious prob-
lem. Information sharing can play a constructive role, but information sharing without robust privacy safe-guards is really not a cyber security bill. It is going to be seen by millions of Americans as a surveillance bill, and that is why it is so important that there be strong privacy guidelines. 
The fact is, in the managers’ legisla-
tion, the section allowing companies to hand over large volumes of information with only a cursory review would be es-sentially unmodified. The Department of Homeland Security asked for some specific changes to the language, which the managers’ amendment does not in-clude. So my hope is, we are going to have a chance to have a real debate on this issue. Personally, I would rather go down a different route with respect to cyber security legislation. In par-ticular, I recommend the very fine data breach bill of our colleague from Vermont Senator L
EAHY , but if Sen-
ators have their hearts set on doing the bill before us, it is going to need some very substantial amendments, both to ensure that we show the American peo-ple that security and privacy are not mutually exclusive, that we can do both, and to address the very serious operational reservations the Depart-ment of Homeland Security has raised. Neither set of concerns is thoroughly addressed by the managers’ amend-ment. 
So my hope is that we are going to 
have a chance to make some very sig-nificant reforms in this legislation. After seeing what has happened over the last few weeks, where the govern-ment isn’t exactly doing an ideal job of securing the data it has, and now we are going to propose legislation that has private companies, without the permission of their customers, for ex-ample, to dump large quantities of their customers’ data over to the gov-ernment with only a cursory review— this legislation is not going to be real attractive to the millions of Americans who sent us to represent them. In fact, in just the last few days, I 
read in the media that some of the op-ponents of this legislation have sent something like 6 million faxes to the Senate—and people wonder if there are still fax machines. I guess the point is to demonstrate it is important that we understand, as we look at digital com-munications, what the challenge is. 
I will have more to say about this 
later in the afternoon and in the evening, but I wanted to take this op-portunity, since we have just gotten out of the party caucuses, to make some corrections with respect to what we were told this morning and particu-larly on this question about how this is a voluntary bill. Ask millions of Amer-icans whether it is voluntary when companies can hand over their private information to the government with-out their permission. 
I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to be recognized as in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NUCLEAR AGREEMENT WITH IRAN  
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, cyber se-
curity is an important issue, but I come to the floor to talk for a bit about one of the most consequential decisions that I, as a Member of the U.S. Senate, and my colleagues will make, and that concerns the nego-tiated agreement between the P5+1 and Iran—the proposed Joint Comprehen-sive Plan of Action with Iran. In my view, it provides too much relief in re-turn for too few concessions. The deal implicitly concedes that Iran will be-come a nuclear power and will gain the ability and legitimacy to produce a weapon in a matter of years while gain-ing wealth and power in the meantime. 
I serve on the Senate Banking Com-
mittee. The sanctions that were cre-ated by Congress originate from that committee. Those sanctions were put in place to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear power—a country capable of delivering a nuclear weapon across their border. Those sanctions were not put in place to give Iran a path or a guideline to become a nuclear-weapon- capable country. The key is to keep nu-clear weapons out of the hands of Iran’s Government. The key to that is to permanently disable Iran from nu-clear capability and remove the tech-nology used to produce nuclear mate-rials. This deal fails to achieve this goal by allowing Iran to retain nuclear facilities. Though some of it will be limited in use in the near term, the centrifuges used to enrich nuclear mat-ter will not be destroyed or removed from the country. This deal allows Iran’s nuclear infrastructure to remain on standby for nuclear development when the restrictions expire. 
Also troubling is the agreement’s 
lack of restrictions on nuclear research and development. Iran seeks to replace its current enrichment technology

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6268 August 4, 2015 
with a more advanced centrifuge that 
more efficiently enriches nuclear mate-rial. By failing to restrict research and development now, we are priming Iran’s nuclear program to hit the ground running toward a bomb once the restrictions are lifted in a matter of years. 
Also, the inspection regime agreed to 
in this negotiation is dangerously ac-commodating. The agreement provides Iran a great deal of flexibility regard-ing the inspection of military sites just like those where Iran’s past covert nu-clear development work took place. The deal allows Iran to hold concerned international inspectors at bay for weeks, if not months, before granting access to a location suspected of being a site for nuclear development. 
The value of any access to suspected 
Iranian nuclear sites that inter-national inspectors ultimately do re-ceive will depend upon their under-standing of Iran’s past nuclear weapons research. A comprehensive disclosure of possible military dimensions to Iran’s nuclear research is necessary for inspectors to fully understand Iran’s current infrastructure and is critical to their ability to rule out any future ef-forts to produce nuclear weapons. 
The International Atomic Energy 
Agency, IAEA, has not made public its site agreement with Iran about their previous nuclear developments. This is an aside, but I would say none of us should agree to this negotiated agree-ment without seeing, reading, and knowing the content of that agree-ment. Under the proposed deal, that vital full disclosure of Iran’s nuclear past may not occur, diminishing the value of inspections and increasing the risk that another covert weaponization of Iran will take place. 
Painfully absent from the agree-
ment’s requirements is Iran’s release of American hostages: Saeed Abedini, Jason Rezaian, Robert Levinson, and Amir Hekmati. The freedom of Ameri-cans unjustly held in Iran should have been a strict precondition for sanctions relief instead of an afterthought. 
In return for very limited conces-
sions, this deal gives Iran way too much. If implemented, the agreement would give Iran near complete sanc-tions relief up front. This isn’t a Re-publican or Democratic issue. Common sense tells us that you don’t give away a leverage until you get the result that you are looking for, and this agree-ment provides sanctions relief upfront, delivering billions in frozen assets to the Iranian Government and boosting the Iranian economy. Included in this relief are sanctions related to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps, which were to be lifted only when Iran ceased providing support for international ter-rorism. 
The sanctions relief in this proposal 
not only fails to require preconditions and cooperation regarding nuclear dis-armament but will remove sanctions from the Iranian Guard, despite their status as a top supporter of terrorist groups around the Middle East and 
globe. 
This type of gratuitous flexibility for 
Iran is found elsewhere in the agree-ment. The P5+1 acceptance of Iranian demands for a relaxed U.N. arms em-bargo is both perplexing and scary. This deal would relax trade restrictions on missiles after 8 years, while imme-diately erasing limits on missile re-search and development. It would also lift restrictions on Iranian centrifuge use and development after just 8 to 10 years. The deal grants Iran the ability to more efficiently produce nuclear material just as it gains the ability to access the delivery weapons system. 
Earlier this month, the Chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, GEN Martin Dempsey, said: ‘‘Under no cir-cumstances should we relieve pressure on Iran relative to ballistic missile ca-pabilities and arms trafficking.’’ Lift-ing the U.N. arms embargo was ‘‘out of the question.’’ Yet, just 1 week later, negotiators announced the lifting of the embargo in 5 to 8 years or less. I wonder what has changed. Unless the menace of an increased flow of weapons in and out of Iran somehow substan-tially decreased during the intervening week, the consequence of this sudden capitulation should have us all greatly concerned. 
This fear of increased money flow to 
terror organizations linked to the Ira-nian Government is not based upon merely an outside possibility; it is a likelihood. Last week Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister stated: ‘‘Whenever it’s needed to send arms to our allies in the region, we will do so.’’ More money and more weapons in the hands of ter-rorist organizations are the fuel for in-creased violence and further desta-bilization in the conflict-torn Middle East. 
We have little reason to believe 
Iran’s behavior will change as a result of this agreement. In fact, their chants of ‘‘Death to America’’ become more real. 
Since the announcement of the 
agreement, the leader of Iran has been openly antagonistic to the United States. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has promised to continue to incite unrest and said Iran’s ‘‘policy towards the ar-rogant U.S. will not change.’’ These anti-American statements come from an Iranian leader whose commitment the Obama administration is relying on for the nuclear accord to work. It should trouble every American that the Obama administration is asking us to support a deal that relies on the total cooperation of those who, as I say, strongly state their commitment to bringing about ‘‘death to America.’’ 
Given the Obama administration’s 
troubling efforts to push through this deal to the United Nations and restrict the influence of the American people through this Congress in the decision, it is all the more important that we follow through with a serious assess-ment of this nuclear agreement. We are faced with a circumstance that, by the administration’s own previous stand-
ards, concedes too much and secures too little. 
I strongly oppose this nuclear deal. It 
is intolerably risky, and the result will be a new Iran—a legitimized nuclear power with a growing economy and en-hanced means to finance terror, to an-tagonize, and to ultimately pursue a nuclear weapons program. I will sup-port the congressional resolution to ex-press Congress’s explicit disapproval. 
President Obama has used fear in his 
agenda in seeking our support for this agreement. The warning has been that a vote against his policy is a vote for war with Iran. The President’s political scare tactics are not only untrue but also illogical. 
Incidentally, we were not at war with 
Iran when the agreements were in place before the negotiation. The ab-sence of agreeing to the negotiated agreement would not mean we will be at war thereafter. 
The President’s claims undermine 
numerous statements his own adminis-tration has made about the negotiation process, the nature of the Iranian nu-clear program, and the proposed agree-ment’s prospects for success. If true, the President’s words concede that his foreign policy has led America into a dangerous position. 
We would expect a President to pro-
vide the American people as many al-ternatives to war as possible, not just a single narrow and risky one such as this. According to the President, the only alternative to war is this agree-ment—a deal that results in better fi-nanced terrorists, a weakened arms embargo, and the need for boosting U.S. weapons sales to Iran’s regional rivals. If this prospect of war is his concern, the President would benefit by reevaluating the geopolitical con-sequences of the deal and seeking out much better options. 
I had hoped these negotiations would 
result in a strong but fair deal to dis-mantle Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. Again, the purpose of placing sanctions on Iran was to get rid of their nuclear capability as far as delivery of nuclear material across their borders. Yet this agreement leaves that infrastructure in place and puts them on a promising path toward that nuclear capability. 
Regrettably, that kind of deal was 
not reached. Now my hope is a simple one: that we are able to reverse some of the damage that is already done and that this agreement is rejected. 
I would say that there are those who 
argue that we would be isolated by re-jection of this agreement, that other countries would approve and the United Nations may approve. This is an issue of such importance that we need to do everything possible to see that Iran does not become a nuclear power, and we need to have the moral char-acter and fiber to say no to this agree-ment. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6269 August 4, 2015 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak as in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ECONOMIC SECURITY FOR OUR COUNTRY ’S 
WORKERS  
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, across 
our country today, so many of our workers clock in 40 hours a week. They work very hard, and yet they are un-able to provide for their families. 
Just last fall, NBC News interviewed 
a woman named Latoya who worked in a fast food restaurant. She was pro-testing as part of a fast food workers strike. Latoya is raising four children alone on $7.25 an hour. That is less than $300 a week and is well below the poverty line for her and her family. For part of last year, she was living in a homeless shelter. She told the reporter: ‘‘Nobody should work 40 hours a week and find themselves homeless.’’ On top of rock-bottom wages, Latoya said she and her colleagues experienced unpaid wages, unpredictable scheduling, and having to make do with broken equip-ment on the job. 
In today’s economy, too many of our 
workers across the country face the same challenges as Latoya. They are underpaid, they are overworked, and they are treated unfairly on the job. In short, they lack fundamental economic security. 
Several places around the country 
and in my home State of Washington are working to address this at the local level. This Senator believes we need to bring the Washington State way here to Washington, DC. In Congress, I be-lieve we need to act to give workers some much needed relief. We need to grow our economy from the middle out, not the top down, and we should make sure our country works for all Ameri-cans, not just the wealthiest few. 
There is no reason we can’t get to 
work today on legislation to do just that. That is why I have joined with my colleagues over the past few months in introducing several bills that will help restore some much need-ed economic security and stability to millions of workers. That is why I am hoping we can move some of these bills forward before we all go back home to our States. 
For too long we have heard from 
some Republicans the theory—a deeply flawed theory—that if we would only grant more tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans and if we would just keep rolling back regulations on the biggest corporations, those benefits would eventually trickle down and reach working families in our country. Not only does that theory not work, as we have seen over the past few decades, that trickle-down system has done real damage to our Nation’s middle class and our working families. While work-er productivity has actually reached new heights, workers have lost basic protections they once had. 
While trickle-down economics allows 
corporations to post big profits, too many of our workers are paying the 
price. Let me give some examples. Today the Federal minimum wage can leave a family in poverty even after working full time and even without taking a single day off. Not only that, today some businesses are using unfair scheduling practices to keep workers guessing about when they are going to be called in to work, with no guarantee of how much money they will earn in a given week. Those types of scheduling abuses take a real toll on workers’ lives and prevent them from getting ahead. Attending college classes is not an option when someone’s work sched-ule is always in flux. Taking on a sec-ond job to earn more money is nearly impossible when you can’t plan around your first job. And that is not all. Today, 43 million workers in this coun-try don’t have paid sick leave. When they get sick, they have to choose be-tween toughing it out at work and passing that illness on to others or staying at home and potentially losing their job. When their child is sick, they have to choose between losing money on their paycheck or missing out on caring for their son or daughter. If that is not enough, in our country women are paid just 78 cents for every dollar a man makes. That is not just unfair to women, by the way; it is bad for fami-lies and it hurts our economy. 
Many businesses are doing the right 
thing and are supporting their workers, but other corporations that don’t, put those businesses that are doing the right thing at a competitive disadvan-tage by running a race to the bottom and pulling their workers down with them. 
This worker insecurity isn’t just dev-
astating for the millions of workers and their families who are impacted by it, it is also hurting our economy. Truly robust and strong economic growth comes from the middle out, not the top down. When our workers lack security, when they are not treated fairly, they can’t invest in themselves and their children or spend money in their communities or move their fami-lies into a middle-class life. 
I believe we have to address this 
challenge on multiple fronts. We can start by making sure our workers are treated fairly so they can earn their way toward rising wages and increased economic security. 
There are important things we can do 
here in Congress to expand economic security and stability for millions of our working families today. For start-ers, we should pass the Paycheck Fair-ness Act that the senior Senator from Maryland has championed for so many years to finally close the pay gap be-tween men and women. The Paycheck Fairness Act would tackle pay dis-crimination head-on. This Senator hopes we can all agree that in the 21st century, workers should be paid fairly for the work they do, regardless of their gender. 
We should also raise the minimum 
wage to make sure hard work does pay off. My Raise the Wage Act increases 
the minimum wage to $12 by 2020 and is enough to lift a family of three out of poverty. It will put more money in workers’ pockets so they can spend it in their local communities. It will help to build a strong floor—a Federal min-imum—that workers and cities can build off of and go even higher where it makes sense, like in Seattle in my home State in Washington. It is a level that Republicans should be able to agree with and start moving toward right now. 
I have also worked on a bill, along 
with Senators W
ARREN and M URPHY , to 
crack down on the scheduling abuses I just talked about, so businesses would no longer keep their workers guessing on when they would be called in or how many hours they might get in a given week. 
In February I introduced the Healthy 
Families Act to allow workers to earn up to 7 paid sick days. I want to move forward on that legislation to give our workers some much needed economic security because no one should have to sacrifice a day of pay or their job alto-gether just to take care of themselves or their sick child. 
We as a nation should not turn our 
backs on empowering our workers through collective bargaining, espe-cially since strong unions ensure work-ers have a strong voice at the table. It is the very thing that helped so many workers climb into the middle class in this country. 
Enacting these critical policies won’t 
solve every problem facing our workers and their families today. It is not the only way that I and Senate Democrats will be fighting to protect workers and making sure the economy is growing from the middle out, not the top down. But these policies would be very strong steps in the right direction to bring back that American dream of economic security and a stable middle-class life for millions of workers who have seen it slip away. 
When workers succeed, businesses 
succeed and thus the economy suc-ceeds. We know this works. I have seen it in my home State of Washington where State and local governments have taken the lead on proposals such as raising the minimum wage and paid sick days. I think it is time to bring some of that Washington State way right here to Washington, DC. 
I recently heard from a small busi-
ness owner by the name of Laura. She owns a small auto repair shop in Renton, WA. She shared something that I hear all the time from business owners: Doing the right thing by work-ers starts a virtuous cycle. Laura said, ‘‘When workers have more money, businesses have more customers. With more customers, businesses can hire more workers, which in turn generates more customers.’’ 
Working families in our country have 
been waiting long enough for some re-lief from the trickle-down system that hurts the middle class. That is why I

Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arizona. 
Mr. M
CCAIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak for 3 minutes and that I be fol-lowed immediately by the Senator from Idaho. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. M
CCAIN. Mr. President, is the 
parliamentary procedure that there was an objection to the Senate moving forward with the consideration of the cyber bill? Is that correct? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There 
was an objection that was heard to the request of the majority leader. 
Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair. Mr. M
CCAIN. Mr. President, do I have 
the floor? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arizona has the floor. 
Mr. M CCAIN. I have the floor, I tell 
the Senator from Washington. 
This is unbelievable. It is unbeliev-
able that this body would not move for-ward with a cyber bill with the situa-tion of dire consequences and dire threats to the United States of Amer-ica. Admiral Rogers, the commander of U.S. Cyber Command, told listeners at the Aspen Security Forum that ‘‘to date there is little price to pay for en-gaging in some pretty aggressive be-haviors.’’ 
According to James Clapper, the Di-
rector of National Intelligence, ‘‘we will see a progression or expansion of that envelope until such time as we create both the substance and psy-chology of deterrence. And today we don’t have that.’’ 
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, General Dempsey, our military enjoys ‘‘significant military advan-tage’’ in every domain except for one— cyber space. General Dempsey said cyber ‘‘is a level playing field. And that makes this chairman very uncomfort-able.’’ The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is uncomfortable about the cyber threats to this Nation. 
What just took place is millions of 
Americans had their privacy hacked into. God only knows what the con-sequences of that are. The other side has decided to object to proceeding with a bill that passed through the In-telligence Committee by a vote of 14 to 1. This is disgraceful—this is disgrace-ful. I tell my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, by blocking this legis-lation, you are putting this Nation in danger. By blocking this legislation, you are putting this Nation in danger 
by not allowing the Senate of the United States to act against a very real threat to our very existence. 
I say this is a shameful day in the 
Senate. I urge the Democratic leader to come to the floor and allow us to con-sider amendments, move forward with this legislation because the security of the United States of America is in dan-ger. 
I thank my colleagues. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho.

SAWTOOTH NATIONAL RECRE-
ATION AREA AND JERRY PEAK WILDERNESS ADDITIONS ACT 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, is H.R. 
1138 at the desk? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator is correct. 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consider-ation of H.R. 1138, which has been re-ceived from the House. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 1138) to establish certain wil-
derness areas in central Idaho and to author-ize various land conveyances involving Na-tional Forest System land and Bureau of Land Management land in central Idaho, and for other purposes. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the bill be read a third time and passed, the mo-tion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the R
ECORD . 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The bill (H.R. 1138) was ordered to a 
third reading, was read the third time, and passed. 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President and fellow 
Senators, today is a historic day for the State of Idaho. This is the creation of a wilderness area in the Sawtooth area of Idaho, the Boulder-White Clouds area, and the Jerry Peak area. These two mountain ranges and one mountain peak area have been under consideration for about 10 years. 
I want to talk very briefly about 
what we are dealing with. These are some of the most magnificent pieces of land, not only in Idaho but in the United States. Before anyone goes abroad to see the Champs-Elysees or to see the magnificent works of art in Italy, you need to put on your list see-ing the Boulder-White Clouds area. It is truly a magnificent area. 
What we just did was we created a 
wilderness of about 275,000 acres that creates these three wilderness areas, plus a buffer zone around them. It is a great day for Idaho. This is an Idaho solution to an issue that has been pending for some time. 
I conclude by simply stating that all 
credit for this goes to Congressman M
IKESIMPSON . Congressman S IMPSON  
started working on this about 10 years ago and wanted to put together, in a collaborative fashion, a wilderness bill for this particular area. He did that. He brought it back to Washington, DC. Be-cause of the situation in DC at the time, the bill was changed greatly and was no longer an Idaho solution to the Idaho problem. 
Congressman S
IMPSON did not give 
up. He worked and he worked and he worked at it. It is truly his long-term commitment to this and his long work on this that got us to this point. What he did was take this land that there was virtually unanimous agreement should be in wilderness; that is, the heart of this area, the Boulder Range, the White Cloud Range, and the Jerry Peaks area. 
There was unanimous agreement 
that this is the kind of land that needs to be in wilderness. Indeed, when I was Governor, I wrote this rule for several million acres. This was included in it. It was protected as wilderness. This is not changing the character of it in that regard. What it does is put it in statute instead of in rule. 
The difficulty was, as always with 
these kinds of areas, the buffer area around what everybody agrees is truly unique ground that should be handled as wilderness. Obviously, it is an area that ingrains passion in people. It causes people to have strong feelings about the area. As a result of that, peo-ple fight to protect what they think should be protected, and just as much, people who use the buffer zones for dif-ferent reasons feel just as passionately the other way. 
What Congressman S
IMPSON was able 
to do was get everybody to the table in a very collaborative fashion, to where he got the wilderness preservationists, the hikers, the backpackers, the horse people, the motorized users, including snowmobile, ATV, and motorcycle peo-ple, to all agree to a management plan for everything that is included in this bill. 
Congressman S
IMPSON was tenacious 
on this. He gets the full credit for this. I think Idahoans will truly appreciate this for many years. There is no doubt in my mind that the efforts Congress-man S
IMPSON put into this will be 
greatly appreciated for years and years to come. 
With that, I yield the remainder of 
my time to my colleague, my good friend, Senator M
IKECRAPO . 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho. 
Mr. CRAPO. I thank Senator R ISCH. 
Mr. President, it is an honor for me 
to rise with my colleague J IMRISCH to 
celebrate the passage of this legisla-tion. It has been years and years in the making. This legislation culminates from the hard work by people all over Idaho. As Senator R
ISCH has indicated, 
the credit for making this all finally come together goes to Representative M
IKESIMPSON . I wholeheartedly agree 
with that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6271 August 4, 2015 
Passage of the Sawtooth National 
Recreation Area and Jerry Peak Wil-derness Additions Act, also called the SNRA+ Act, is the result of tremen-dous efforts by Representative S
IMPSON  
and Senator R ISCH. He deserves tre-
mendous credit as well. I do want to say that I honor Representative S
IMP-
SON’s dogged determination and his 
persistence to fight through many ob-stacles associated with this treasured region of our State for a very long pe-riod of time. 
Representative S
IMPSON ’s efforts 
have given Idaho a homegrown solution to what was rapidly becoming a na-tional problem. As I said, similarly, my colleague Senator R
ISCH has fought 
through many challenges in his pursuit of developing a consensus on this issue that has been hard to achieve. Both of my colleagues, in their respective ways, have expressed again the power of collaboration in the attempt to find consensus to deliver local solutions to longstanding public land management challenges in Idaho. 
Local governments and local stake-
holders must be empowered to shape and manage decisions relating to our public lands. In the process, such ef-forts must respect private property rights and the owners of private prop-erty as well as other impacted stake-holders. Such initiatives are never easy to achieve, and consensus takes dedica-tion, patience, and persistence. For too long, westerners have been saddled with top-down land management deci-sions that are both harmful to the landscape and the people living in and subsisting off of our natural treasures. The SNRA+ is a win for Idaho and an example of how local governments and interests can achieve solutions to some of the most persistent public land man-agement issues we face. 
I have to conclude by saying that 
while we have succeeded today in pass-ing a milestone in Congress, the focus must now shift to the hard work of suc-cessful implementation that will re-quire commitment from the various Federal agencies and all of the affected interests. 
Again, I commend Senator R
ISCH and 
Representative S IMPSON for their in-
credibly important work that has been accomplished today. 
I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nevada. 
Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I con-
gratulate my colleagues from Idaho on this particular piece of legislation, proving it can be done right. It was just a few weeks ago that the President unilaterally declared a monument in the State of Nevada the size of Rhode Island, with two counties that had no input in the process. Our delegation had no input. The collaborative effort that we saw from Idaho and how it works and how the system should work needs to be recognized. What happened in Nevada, I feel, was a disgrace. 
It is a shame we are standing here 
today with a monument in the State of Nevada the size of Rhode Island with 
no input from Nevada’s delegation or counties, just a single action made by one person. 
f 
CYBERSECURITY INFORMATION 
SHARING ACT OF 2015—MOTION TO PROCEED—Continued 
Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I would 
like to talk about personal privacy rights for American citizens. It was just 2 months ago that the Senate took action to restore privacy rights of American citizens through the USA FREEDOM Act—part of action that was taken, as I mentioned, just 2 months ago. Both Chambers of Con-gress and the President agreed it was time to end the bulk collection of American’s call records pouring into the Federal Government. 
I was a proud supporter of the USA 
FREEDOM Act and believed it was the right thing to do on behalf of U.S. citi-zens. My constituents all across Ne-vada—from Elko, to Reno, Ely, and Las Vegas—all understand how important these rights are and will not accept any attempts to diminish them. Today, I am here to continue protecting these privacy rights and uphold our civil lib-erties. 
Protecting privacy will always be im-
portant to Nevadans. It is nonnego-tiable to me, very important. Similar to many of my colleagues in the Sen-ate, I believe addressing cyber security is also important. 
When I was ranking member of the 
commerce committee’s consumer pro-tection subcommittee, I worked on these issues in detail. I understand very well the impact of data breaches, cyber threats. In fact, back in my State of Nevada, one of the top con-cerns is identity theft. Not only can these identity thieves wreak financial havoc on a consumer’s life, but these threats also pose a serious national se-curity concern. 
We saw with OPM’s breach that per-
sonal information for 21.5 million Fed-eral employees, even those who re-ceived security clearances, was com-promised. In my office, in fact, a mem-ber of my staff was breached three times in just the last 4 years. These thieves cross international borders. They break and enter into private homes. They hack their way to intru-sion with a keyboard and a simple click of the mouse. 
So I share the desire to find a path 
forward on information sharing be-tween the Federal Government and the private sector as another tool in the cyber security toolbox, but I have al-ways stood firm with these types of ef-forts that they must also maintain American’s privacy rights. 
The bill I see today, including the 
substitute amendment, does not do enough to ensure personally identifi-able information is stripped out before sharing. That is why I filed a fix. Let’s strengthen the standard for stripping out this information. Right now, this bill says the private sector and the 
Federal Government only have to strip out personal information if they know—if they know—it is not directly related to a cyber threat. 
I would like to offer some context to 
that. Let’s say you are pulled over for speeding, not knowing the speed limit 
does not absolve you of guilt. If your company fails to follow a Federal law or regulation, not knowing about the law does not exempt you from the con-sequences of violating it. Ignorance is no excuse under the law, so why should this particular piece of legislation be any different? 
My amendments ensure that when 
personal information is being stripped out, it is because the entity reasonably believes—not knows but reasonably be-lieves—it is not related to a cyber threat. One of my amendments ad-dresses the Federal Government’s re-sponsibility to do this, and the other addresses the private sector’s responsi-bility to do this. 
This term ‘‘reasonably believes’’—let 
me repeat that—‘‘reasonably believes’’ is an important distinction that this bill needs. It creates a wider protection for personal information by ensuring these entities are making an effort to take out personal information that is not necessary for cyber security. Our friends over in the House of Represent-atives already agree the private sector should be held to this standard, which is why they included this language in the cyber security bill which they passed. I hope to see this important 
protection retained in any conference agreement should this bill move for-ward. 
Furthermore, in a letter to a Senator 
last week, DHS directly acknowledged the importance of removing personally identifiable information and even went so far as to say this removal will allow the information-sharing regime to function much better. Even DHS agrees that with this amendment it would function much better. So what it comes down to is our Nation’s commit-ment to balancing the needs for shar-ing cyber security information with the need to protect America’s personal information. 
I believe my amendment, No. 2548, to 
hold the Federal Government account-able strikes that balance, and I will continue strongly pushing forward to get this vote. I encourage my col-leagues to support this commonsense effort to strengthen this bill and keep our commitment to upholding the rights of all U.S. citizens. 
As we discuss this issue, I hope we 
will continue having the opportunity to truly debate and make improve-ments to this bill. I believe that if given the opportunity, we can strengthen this legislation even more to protect against cyber security threats while also protecting American citizens’ private information. 
No bill is perfect, as the Presiding Of-
ficer knows, but that is why we are here and that is why there is an amend-ment process. That is why I wish to see

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6272 August 4, 2015 
the Senate openly debate and amend 
this bill, including my amendment. The privacy rights of Americans are too important an issue and a very im-portant issue to all of us. 
I acknowledge that some of my col-
leagues want the opportunity to debate issues related to the bill and those issues that are unrelated to the bill. I recognize there are many important issues Members would like to see ad-dressed before August—or at least the August recess—such as my friend from Kentucky, who filed an amendment re-garding firearms on bases. Like my col-league, I recognize the importance of this issue, which is why I introduced this legislation days ago. My legisla-tion would simply require the Sec-retary of Defense to establish a process for base commanders in the United States to authorize a servicemember to carry a concealed personal firearm while on base. Men and women who serve our country deserve to feel safe and should be able to defend them-selves while stationed in the United States. That is why I feel strongly that Congress should give our Nation’s base commanders the authority they need to create a safer environment for our heroes serving across America. 
At this time I recognize it is unclear 
if there will be an opportunity to de-bate this issue on this particular piece of legislation, but it is an important issue. Once again, I hope that as we continue to debate this bill that we will find a path forward on all amend-ments. 
I appreciate the willingness of both 
Senator B
URR and Senator F EINSTEIN  
to work with me on my amendments, and I look forward to continuing this debate. 
I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New York. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the next 30 minutes be equally divided between Senators S
CHUMER , B OXER , W HITE-
HOUSE , MARKEY , and S CHATZ . 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, 
may I ask for a modification that I be able to speak for 1 minute on the cyber issue before we go into that 30 min-utes? 
With that modification, I have no ob-
jection. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the request? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Thank you. 
Mr. President, in my 1 minute, I just 
wish to respond to what my friend, the Senator from Arizona, said. We are very keen to get a good, strong cyber security bill passed. 
My concern about the amendment 
process is that amendments that will strengthen the bill and make it a bet-ter cyber bill ought to have a chance to get a vote. I have one that I worked out with Senator G
RAHAM , who I think 
has good national security credentials and whom Senator M CCAINrespects, 
and another one with Senator B LUNT , 
who also has good national security credentials and whom I think Senator M
CCAINalso respects. I believe both of 
the bills have now been cleared by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, so they don’t have a business community ob-jection. But I also fear that if we fol-lowed the majority leader’s proposal, he would file cloture and they wouldn’t survive a germaneness test. 
So I think our leader’s offer, basi-
cally, of a specific list of amend-ments—none of which are ‘‘gotcha’’ amendments, all of which relate to this bill—would be a very good way to pro-ceed, get on the bill, and get something passed. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New York. 
Mr. SCHUMER. First, I thank my 
friend from Rhode Island. I think there is a broad agreement—I certainly do— that we want to move to this bill and, if given an agreement on a limited number of amendments, all relevant to cyber security, with no intention to be dilatory, and with time limits, we can get this done. But it is only fair on a major bill to offer some amendments and not just to fill the tree and have no amendments at all. 
CLIMATE CHANGE  
On the issue at hand, I thank Sen-
ators W HITEHOUSE , M ARKEY , SCHATZ , 
and B OXER for speaking today and par-
ticipating in this colloquy. I join my colleagues in appealing for meaningful action on climate change in this body, which thus far has been stymied by my friends on the other side of the aisle on behalf of special interests, and that is an absolute shame. 
Climate change is one of the defining 
challenges of our time. Left unchecked, the changing climate and rising seas will threaten our shoreline cities and communities, as I personally witnessed after Superstorm Sandy buffeted New York. Left unchecked, a changing cli-mate will have dramatic consequences for our children and grandchildren. Pope Francis’s papal encyclical rep-resents as much. He said climate change ‘‘represents one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day.’’ 
We know we have to act. We know 
the American people want us to act. According to a New York Times-Stan-ford University poll, 74 percent of Americans said the Federal Govern-ment should be doing a substantial amount to combat climate change. That is 74 percent. 
Democrats agree the Federal Govern-
ment must do something. We tried to pass several bills through Congress, but my friends on the other side of the aisle blocked action time and time again on behalf of the special interests in the fossil fuel industry. 
Now the President has a bold plan to 
reduce carbon emissions, which he an-nounced yesterday and today, but al-ready the groups on the other side are marshaling their forces. The New York Times reported today that fossil fuel 
lobbyists and corporate lawyers have been working since 2014, over 1
1⁄2years 
ago, to bring down these new rules. 
Some of these Republicans admit 
that climate change is real and a threat. Yet they still block and block and block. My friend, the distinguished majority leader, has urged governors across the country to simply ignore the new climate rules while they cook up lawsuits to delay and frustrate their implementation. 
OK. So you don’t like the actions we 
propose or what the President pro-poses. Fine. What do you propose? I say to those on the other side of the aisle: What is your plan to meet this existen-tial challenge? I have heard none. That is why this chart says: 
—WANTED— 
A GOP plan to combat climate change and 
reduce dangerous air pollution 
#WhatstheGOPClimatePlan 
There is none. We all know it is hap-
pening. Just look at the news, read the weather reports, and ask what sci-entists who are totally impartial and nonpolitical say. Unfortunately, I have a funny feeling that our colleagues on the other side are using the same play-book they are using on health care, im-migration, and a host of other issues. Block, repeal, oppose, but propose nothing. 
So I conclude my brief remarks by 
repeating the question. What is the Re-publican plan to act on climate change? Let me ask again in case they didn’t hear me. What is the Republican plan to act on climate change? 
Let me suggest that my friends on 
the other side join us in seeking solu-tions on climate change rather than obstructing our efforts and the wishes of the American people on behalf of special interests. Again, I thank my friends for organizing this colloquy. 
I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from California. 
Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what is 
the order in terms of time allocated? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty 
minutes have been allocated. Each Senator has about 6 minutes to speak. 
Mrs. BOXER. Will the Chair remind 
me when I have spoken for 5 minutes so I can wrap up? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator will be so notified. 
Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, 
Mr. President. 
In 2007, in its landmark decision 
called Massachusetts v. EPA, the U.S. Supreme Court found very clearly that carbon pollution is covered under the Clean Air Act. I think it is important to note that the Bush administration took the position that carbon pollution could not be covered under the Clean Air Act. They wasted about 8 long years litigating the matter, and we lost a lot of time. But when the Supreme Court finally spoke out, this is what they said, and I quote from the deci-sion:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6273 August 4, 2015 
Because greenhouse gases fit within the 
Clean Air Act’s capacious definition of ‘‘air pollutant,’’ we hold that EPA has the statu-tory authority to regulate the emission of such gases. . . . 
Following the Supreme Court deci-
sion, the Obama administration issued an endangerment finding which showed that current and future concentrations of carbon pollution are harmful to our health. This finding built on the work of the Bush administration, and we found some of the raw data from the Bush administration, and we went pub-lic with it. This is what the endangerment finding said, among other things: 
No. 1, severe heat waves are expected 
to intensify, which can increase heat- related death and sickness. 
No. 2, climate change is expected to 
worsen regional smog pollution, which can cause decreased lung function, ag-gravated asthma, increased emergency- room visits, and premature deaths. 
So once that endangerment finding 
was made, the Clean Air Act clearly re-quires the Environmental Protection Agency to act to control greenhouse gas pollution because it is determined that that pollution causes harm. 
I wish to say, when I still had the 
gavel of the Environment and Public Works Committee, we called four former EPA administrators who served under Republican Presidents from Richard Nixon to George W. Bush. Every single one of those Republicans called on us to act now to reduce car-bon pollution. 
In that hearing, former EPA adminis-
trator Christine Todd Whitman, who served under George W. Bush, summed it up best—and I know my friends re-member this. She said: 
I have to begin by expressing my frustra-
tion with the discussion about whether or not the Environmental Protection Agency has the legal authority to regulate carbon emissions that is still taking place in some quarters. The issue has been settled. 
This is a former Republican EPA ad-
ministrator under George W. Bush. Continuing: 
EPA does have the authority. The law says 
so, the Supreme Court has said so twice. That matter, I believe, should now be put to rest. Given that fact, the agency has decided, properly in my view, that it should act now to reduce carbon emissions to improve the quality of our air, to protect the health of our people and, as part of an international effort, to address global climate change. 
Now, I was so proud in that par-
ticular hearing because I haven’t found a Republican on the Environment and Public Works Committee who really even believes that climate change is real, to be honest. So to have a Repub-lican—the former head of the EPA under George W. Bush—tell us it is time to move was very heartening to me because I believe action can’t come too soon. The impacts that scientists predicted years ago are all around us and they are happening now. 
I wish to share a couple of charts. 
The prediction quite a while ago was that we were going to see extreme heat more frequently all around the world. 
Well, 2014 was the hottest year on record, according to NASA and NOAA, and 2015, the first half of this year, is the hottest on record, according to NOAA. 
Then, heat waves are more frequent. 
In Australia, in 2014, towns 320 miles northwest of Sydney hit 118 degrees. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator has consumed 5 minutes. 
Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. Areas affected by drought will in-
crease. Look at what is happening in my great State, the worst drought, ac-cording to scientists, in 1,200 years. Fires are increasing—same thing—and I am just so disheartened by the fact that we lost a firefighter, a visiting firefighter. Firefighters are fighting those fires right now and putting their lives on the line every single day. Trop-ical storms, hurricanes—this is all hap-pening—heavy precipitation, flooding events. Houston got 11 inches of rain in 24 hours in 2015. And there is decreas-ing polar ice, and, in addition, rising sea levels. 
So I will close with this. The evi-
dence of climate change is here. To say you are not a scientist is no answer. We know you are not a scientist. Poli-ticians as a group are not. But we should listen to the 98, 99 percent of scientists who are telling us our planet is in trouble. Our people are going to be in trouble. 
As long as I can stand up on my feet 
in this body, I am going to stand shoul-der to shoulder—well, not quite; in my high heels shoulder to shoulder—with my friends because this is a moment in our Nation’s history when our kids and grandkids will look back and ask: Why didn’t they protect us? Why didn’t they save us? As far as I am concerned, it is our duty and our moral responsibility. 
I thank the Chair, and I yield the 
floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
want to start my remarks with this photograph I have in the Chamber, which is a photograph of—I guess the miniplanet is what they call it now— Pluto. Why do I start remarks on cli-mate change and carbon pollution with a picture of Pluto? I do so because of the amazing achievement it was for our NASA scientists to fly a craft close enough to Pluto to take that picture. That is a heck of an accomplishment by our American NASA scientists. 
But that is not their only one. While 
this craft was shooting by Pluto taking these pictures, they had a rover rolling around on the surface of Mars. They sent a vehicle the size of an SUV to the surface of Mars and are driving it around. Do you think these scientists know what they are talking about when they say something as simple as climate change is real? Of course, they do. 
But our Republican friends can’t ac-
knowledge that. They have even said these NASA scientists are in on a hoax. Can you imagine anything more de-
meaning to the people who put a rover on Mars and shot this picture of Pluto than to say: Oh, they do not know what they are talking about. They are in on a hoax. Forget about it. That is just not true. 
The real issue is this. Here is Ken-
tucky’s electric generation fuel mix. That is its fuel mix. Guess what the gray is? Coal. That is basically all they have. There is a tiny little strip of blue at the bottom for the hydro. There is a little tiny strip here of red for oil. And there is a tiny little bit of natural gas here at the top, for which you need a magnifying glass. You can look and, with a magnifying glass, you can see this tiny little green line at the top that is their entire renewables port-folio. Really? 
The last I heard the sun shines bright 
on my old Kentucky home. Right? So why no solar? None. How about wind? Do you think the wind blows through the Kentucky hills? None. You have to use a magnifying glass to see it. They are not even trying. They are not even trying. The coal industry has that State so locked down they are doing nothing. 
Go to Iowa. There are two Repub-
lican Senators from Iowa—hardly some liberal bastion—and they get about 30 percent of their electricity from wind. It is not a Communist plot. It is not a Socialist fabrication. It is Iowa, and the farmers love it. 
But no, we have to protect coal at all 
costs. So this is the GOP signal for what they are doing on climate change. I think it would probably be wise to take out the smile and actually put a little band of tape over the mouth so that it is clear that nobody is allowed to say a word. 
This is really astonishing. Here we 
are, in which every State—just ask your home State university if climate change is real. You don’t have to go far. Ask the University of Kentucky, ask the University of Louisville, ask your home State university. They know. Everybody knows. The problem is the coal industry and the Koch brothers have this place locked down, and it is ridiculous. 
The Koch brothers have pledged to 
spend $889 million in this election through this group called Americans for Prosperity. And they have also said that ‘‘anybody who crosses us on cli-mate change will be at a severe dis-advantage.’’ When you are swinging a $900 million club and you are telling folks, disagree with us and you will be at a severe disadvantage, this is what you get—no plan on climate change. 
You are going to hear endless com-
plaining from our friends on the other side about the President’s plan. What are you not going to hear? What their plan is. What is the alternative? What have they got? If you have nothing, if you have nada, zip, you really have to get into this conversation because even your own Republican young voters are demanding it. Republican voters under

the age of 35 think climate denial is ig-
norant, out of touch or crazy—their words in the poll, not mine. 
So it is time we broke through. It is 
time the majority leader got away from this 100-percent coal situation that he is defending, allowed the future to take place, and allowed a conversa-tion to take place here in the Senate. We are ready for it. We are ready for it. 
I yield the floor to my wonderful col-
league, Senator M
ARKEY , who has been 
working on this a good deal longer than I have. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I thank 
my good friend from Rhode Island, my friend from California, Senator B
OXER , 
Senator S CHATZ from Hawaii, and all 
the Members who work on these issues. 
This is the big one. This is the issue. 
This is the threat to the entire planet. Young people want us to do something about it. They are wondering when the older generation is finally going to get around to doing something about it, from moving to sending pollution up into the air to moving to clean energy, moving to new energy technologies. 
So as they look at this, they look at 
coal, they look at a 19th century tech-nology—coal—and they say: When are we moving to the new era? Well, that is a good question because in 2005 in the United States of America we deployed a grand total of 79 megawatts of solar. In 2014, we deployed 7,000 megawatts of solar—100 times more—because we started to have a plan. 
Democrats put a plan in place by cre-
ating tax breaks for solar, by incentivizing more investment in solar across the country. Individual States started to put new regulations on the books—7,000 megawatts. Now we have 20,000 megawatts of solar in the United States. But we only deployed 79 in 2005. 
Now, if you really want some great 
news as to what is possible, in 2015 and 2016, we are going to deploy 20,000 
more—in just 2 years. So we are going to double the total amount of all solar ever deployed in the United States in just 2 years. 
Over on the wind front, we are going 
to have about 80,000 megawatts total deployed by the end of next year, bringing it up to 120,000 megawatts. How much is that? When you look at a big nuclear powerplant and you see the picture of it, that is 1,000 megawatts. So we are talking about 120 of them being deployed by the end of next year. 
So the young generation looks at us 
and they say: Can we do this? Can we meet the goals President Obama is set-ting? Can we meet the objective of hav-ing 28 percent of all of our electricity coming from renewables by the year 2030? 
Well, if you hear from the coal indus-
try or you hear from the nuclear indus-try, if you hear from the other fossil fuel industries, they say: Well, that is impossible. You can’t do it. It is abso-lutely just going to be a very small part of the total amount of electricity that we generate in our country. Well, they are just dead wrong. We 
are proving that in 2015 and 2016 be-cause of the fight that is taking place at the State level—the tax breaks for wind and solar that were put on the books largely by Democrats here na-tionally. We are doing it. It is there. We now have over 200,000 people work-ing in the solar industry in the United States. There are only 85,000 people who are in the coal industry. Got that? It is 2015. There are 80,000 people work-ing in the wind industry in our coun-try. 
These are the growth industries. 
These are the Internet corollaries in clean energy. This is where young peo-ple are going. This is where innovation is going. This is where venture capital in America is going. This is where the innovation around our planet is going. We can do this. We can reduce green-house gases dramatically, increase em-ployment simultaneously, and create wealth and health for our planet. 
The President’s plan will reduce by 
90,000 per year the number of asthma attacks in our country. It will reduce by 90 percent the total amount of sul-fur that is sent up into the atmosphere. It will be something that is supported by doctors and nurses and by Presi-dents and Popes. That is what we have. That is what this plan is. It is a beau-tiful plan. It is a plan that spans not just the technological and the political but also the moral imperative that is presented by this problem. 
So yes, the big question that is being 
asked is this: Where is the Republican plan? Well, of course, there is none be-cause they are still in denial that there is a problem, notwithstanding the fact that every single national academy of sciences of every single country in the world says there is a problem. 
This is basically a small cabal of fos-
sil fuel executives still trying to peddle 19th century technologies in the 21st century. It would be as though there were a cabal to stop us from moving from black rotary dial phones to wire-less devices so that people could walk around with the new technologies. Oh, wait. There was a cabal. They fought it for years and years and years and years because they had the monopoly. The black rotary dial phone in the living room was all anyone would ever need. We had to break down those monopo-lies, and we have to break down these as well. 
But here it is more than just having 
a phone in your pocket. Now it is actu-ally saving the planet. It is ensuring we put in place the preventive meas-ures that will reduce greenhouse gases while creating new jobs. 
Senator W
HITEHOUSE and I are part of 
a plan called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative across New England, New York, Delaware, and Maryland. We already have a plan in place that has, in fact, reduced greenhouse gases, which has simultaneously seen dra-matic increases in wealth, creating $1.5 billion in savings for consumers. We can do this. We can do this. The auto industry said we could not 
increase the fuel economy standards of the vehicles that we drive. We just went right past them. The tele-communications industry did not want us to be moving to this wireless revolu-tion. We just went right past them. The coal industry does not want us to act right now. For the sake of the plan-et, for the sake of generations to come, we must go right past them and ensure President Obama’s plan is enacted. 
I thank the Chair, and I now yield to 
the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. S
CHATZ . 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I thank 
the Senator from Massachusetts and Senators W
HITEHOUSE and B OXER for 
their great leadership. I am really ap-preciative of the senior Senator from New York for taking the time to come to the floor to demonstrate his com-mitment to this issue. 
There is an incredible opportunity 
here for American leadership. In Ha-waii, in various places across the State, in 1 month we had 33 record highs—in the month of July. So we all know this is the challenge of our gen-eration, and we all know the next most important step is the full implementa-tion of the President’s Clean Power Plan. 
I wish to make a couple of points 
about the particulars of the plan. The first is that this is really done well. Normally, regulatory functions can be a blunt instrument. They can be a lit-tle less than careful in terms of how they are going to impact the economy. But this is done with great precision, with great care, and with great inter-action with the incumbent utility com-panies and distribution and generation companies. So this is done with enough flexibility to say: Whatever your mix in terms of energies, we are not going to dictate exactly how you do it at a powerplant level, at a county level, at a city level. All we are saying is you have to meet these targets. And if you meet these targets through distributed generation or wind or solar or geo-thermal or hydro, that is not the Fed-eral Government’s concern. 
Our concern is that carbon is a pol-
lutant—and that has been determined by the courts, and it has been deter-mined by scientists—and the Clean Air Act requires that airborne pollutants are regulated. So we are simply going to tell every State: This, like all other pollutants, has to be reduced over time. 
I think the EPA took great pains to 
make sure this was done in a way that wouldn’t cause too much upheaval in the economy. This is legally sound. There is no question that the EPA doesn’t just have the authority and the discretion to move forward with carbon pollution regulations, they are actu-ally required to under the last Supreme Court decision. And it is doable. Hawaii has a 100-percent clean energy goal. The Northeast has its RGGI program.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6275 August 4, 2015 
California has a cap-and-trade pro-
gram. And all of our economies con-tinue to grow. It is not that individuals and companies don’t continue to have their challenges, but it is not because of our leaning forward into clean en-ergy. 
I will make one point about the kind 
of layering of obstruction. The first layer, which I think we have been suc-cessful in the last 6 months at breaking through, is the whole ‘‘I am not sure whether climate change is real.’’ Then they sort of pivoted to ‘‘Well, I am not a scientist.’’ So I don’t think that is going to last for very long. 
I think the next layer of obstruction 
is going to be ‘‘I think climate change is real. I am not sure what percentage of climate change is caused by humans and how much of it is naturally occur-ring.’’ I think we will be able to punch through that opposition. 
The next layer of opposition will be 
this: ‘‘America should wait.’’ They will tell us that America should not lead in this, that we should wait for China, that we should wait for India, that we should wait for Germany, that we should wait for Japan. So let me ask this question: Since when does the United States wait for other countries to lead? This is the challenge of our generation, and it strikes me as prepos-terous that anybody who believes in American leadership would be willing to say ‘‘Let’s see what other countries do about this problem first. Why don’t we give this a few years?’’ We don’t have a few years. This is an incredible opportunity for America to display the leadership it has always displayed in the international community. We fi-nally have the high ground going into the Paris discussions. We are on legally sound ground, we are on morally sound ground, and I think politically we are increasingly on sound ground. 
I am a full supporter of the Presi-
dent’s Clean Power Plan. The one thing that causes me great dismay and I think causes some of the other partici-pants in this colloquy dismay is that we are not even having a debate. 
This is the Democrats asking you to 
come down to the floor and disagree with us. Disagree with the President. Disagree with Gina McCarthy. Tell S
HELDON and me that our bill is a piece 
of garbage and this is what should be done instead. But let’s have the great debate in the world’s greatest delibera-tive body. Right now, it is entirely one- sided. If we are going to display Amer-ican leadership, we need some Repub-lican leadership as well. 
Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will the 
Senator yield for a question? I don’t know if the Senator is aware of this, but I do know Senators W
HITEHOUSE  
and M ARKEY know this since they serve 
with me on the Environment and Pub-lic Works Committee. Tomorrow morn-ing at 10 o’clock, the Republicans on the Environment and Public Works Committee are going to put forward two bills, and they expect to pass them. One would stop the President’s Clean Power Plan in its tracks without 
putting in anything to replace it—as a matter of fact, putting up obstacles, as I understand it, to any other plan. So it would stop it in its tracks and set up huge obstacles for another rule. The other one would say that if you spray pesticides on bodies of water and the pesticides get into the water, that spraying should be exempted from the Clean Water Act. 
I mean, it pains me. It pains me to 
say that this is coming from the envi-ronment committee. Why don’t they just rename it the ‘‘anti-environment committee’’ when they are in charge because every week, every day on the environment they go in the wrong di-rection for our children and our grand-children. I know my friend has young children. I have young grandchildren. 
Isn’t it a shame that at the moment 
in time when the Environment and Public Works Committee—they did a great job—we did a great job, all of us, on transportation. We had a 20-to-0 vote. We are so proud of it. But on the environment, we are split down the middle, with Republicans trying to stop the Clean Power Plan, stop the ad-vances in fighting climate change, stop the ability of regulators to protect the waters from pesticide spraying. Isn’t it just shameful that this will be hap-pening tomorrow? 
Mr. SCHATZ. Through the Chair, I 
understand the time for the colloquy is about to expire. Just to respond to the Senator from California, if there is no objection, I would just say that we really do need Republican leadership here. Prior to about 10 years ago, the Republican Party had a long history and an august history of working with Democrats to protect our air and our water, and we are all sincerely hoping we can get back to that place. 
I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
PRESCRIPTION OPIOID AND HEROIN ABUSE  
Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I rise 
today to talk about a public health issue that is devastating communities and families in New Hampshire and throughout this country; that is, pre-scription opioid and heroin abuse. 
I actually see my colleagues from 
Rhode Island and Massachusetts here. This is an issue where, on a bipartisan basis, we are focused on important leg-islation to address this terrible public health crisis. 
Right now in New Hampshire, her-
oin—sometimes combined with a very powerful synthetic drug called fentanyl—is taking lives, ruining fami-lies, and harming communities. Public safety officials are confronting overdoses every single day. 
My good friend, Manchester police 
chief Nick Willard, said recently: ‘‘I’m up to my eyes in heroin addiction.’’ Unfortunately, the statistics under-score Chief Willard’s statement. In all of 2014, Manchester police seized over 1,300 grams of heroin. As of just last month, Manchester police had seized over 27,000 grams of heroin in 2015. 
That is nearly 26,000 more grams in just 7 months. In 2014, there were over 320 fatal drug-related overdoses in New Hampshire—up from 193 in 2013—and heroin and fentanyl were the primary drivers of nearly 250 of those deaths. In Manchester alone—our largest city— overdose deaths so far have increased 90 percent over 2014 and over 269 per-cent if we go back to 2013. That is the crisis we are facing. That is how many lives are being taken by opioids, by overdosing on prescription drugs and heroin, and it is devastating. 
I worked with law enforcement when 
I was attorney general of New Hamp-shire. I know how hard they are work-ing on this. They are working tire-lessly to get these drugs off the streets. But they will tell you that we simply cannot arrest our way out of this prob-lem. I have actually heard from law en-forcement in New Hampshire that what they believe we need most to confront this public health crisis and to con-front the public safety issues that go with it are more prevention, more treatment options, and more support for individuals in recovery. 
We know that addiction to prescrip-
tion pain medication can often become a gateway to heroin abuse. Unfortu-nately, right now the price of heroin on the streets has gotten so cheap that people are often going from prescrip-tion drug addiction to heroin addiction because of the price and the high and the way they feel. It is so tragic. Ac-cording to a study from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Ad-ministration, approximately 4 out of every 5 new heroin users previously used nonmedical prescription opioids before using heroin. 
I wish to briefly mention two pieces 
of legislation that I believe represent critical steps in the right direction. 
In February I helped reintroduce the 
bipartisan Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. I thank my col-league from Rhode Island, who is in this Chamber, as well for his important work on this legislation. This legisla-tion would expand opioid prevention and education efforts and expand the availability of naloxone to first re-sponders and law enforcement. It would also support additional resources to identify and treat incarcerated individ-uals suffering from substance abuse disorder and encourage prevention by expanding drug take-back sites to pro-mote the safe disposal of unwanted or unused prescription drugs, strength-ening prescription drug monitoring programs, and launching a prescription opioid and heroin treatment and inter-vention program. 
This summer I had the privilege of 
doing a ride-along with the Manchester fire department. Within half an hour of being at the fire department, we were called to a heroin overdose. I watched the first responders give Narcan to a young man who was on the ground who I thought was going to die, and he came right back. But what I noticed

was that in that room in a corner was 
an infant—an infant child whom the firefighter gave to another young woman in the room. Think about the impact of that. What chance does that child have when her father is on the floor, is not getting treatment, and is getting back in this cycle? 
Often what I hear from our first re-
sponders is that when they save some-one’s life using a drug such as Narcan, they see the same people again because they are not getting the treatment they need to get the recovery they need from this horrible addiction they have. 
Earlier this year I also reintroduced 
the Heroin and Prescription Opioid Abuse Prevention, Education, and En-forcement Act with Senator J
OEDON-
NELLY of Indiana. This bipartisan bill 
would reauthorize programs related to prescription drug monitoring programs that are helpful to our physicians so they can get good information when they are prescribing pain medication; grants for local law enforcement; and establishing an interagency task force to develop best practices in prescribing 
pain medication. 
The headlines we are seeing in New 
Hampshire every day in our local news-papers underscore the sad reality of this problem. Here are some we have seen in recent weeks: 
The Union Leader: ‘‘Mom, dad over-
dose on heroin while bathing child.’’ 
The Nashua Telegraph in May: ‘‘Nine 
die from drug overdoses in Nashua so far this year, including three in one weekend.’’ Nashua is where I was born and where I lived. 
The Telegraph on May 14: ‘‘Toddler 
left in care of men, one of whom died of an overdose.’’ 
There was more on that same day: 
‘‘Hampton man on heroin causes 5-car crash.’’ 
May 29: ‘‘Ossipee mom accused of 
selling heroin with 2 kids in the car.’’ 
These news stories mirror the heart-
breaking personal stories of loss I have been hearing about from families in our State. I want to share a couple of these stories. 
Recently, I met with the family of 
Courtney Griffin, a 20-year-old young woman from Newton, NH. Tragically, Courtney lost her life to a heroin over-dose last September. I was very moved by her family’s story. 
Courtney aspired to join the Marine 
Corps and had already attended boot camp. She was a charter member of the Kingston Lions Club. She played the French horn in high school and was a member of the tennis club. 
During high school, Courtney started 
hanging out with a different crowd, and at some point the Griffins’ prescription medication in their cabinet started dis-appearing. After Courtney graduated from high school, her addiction grew worse. She was stealing from her fa-ther’s business and from her family in a desperate attempt to feed her addic-tion. 
Courtney entered drug treatment, 
but she relapsed. When she finally ad-mitted she had a problem, she tried to 
seek treatment but was denied cov-erage because the Griffins’ insurance company said it wasn’t a life-or-death situation. With some help from local law enforcement, Courtney was finally able to find a place to receive treat-ment. Tragically, she died of a heroin overdose about a week before she was set to begin treatment. 
Her father Doug is doing everything 
he can to turn Courtney’s story of trag-edy into a cautionary tale so that he can save other families from what his family has been through. 
Doug and others like him have a per-
spective on this crisis that is impos-sible for anyone who has not personally experienced a loss like this to under-stand. I admire his courage in sharing the story of his family so that he can save other families’ lives. 
Unfortunately, this story is all too 
common. In April, Molly Parks, a wait-ress at Portland Pie Company in Man-chester, lost her life to a heroin over-dose while she was at work. Her father is also speaking out to warn other fam-ilies of the dangers of drug addiction. 
I want to share as a final point one 
story that really moved me on Memo-rial Day. That story came from Keith Howard. He served our country with distinction. I know him personally. When he returned home from his en-listment, he struggled with alcohol and heroin abuse and he became homeless. Unfortunately, we hear too many of these stories about our veterans, what they are carrying with them, the wounds from war, and they become ad-dicted to drugs and alcohol. Keith was one of those individuals who served our country and who became addicted. Today Keith is sober, and he helps run Liberty House in Manchester, NH, which provides sober housing for Amer-ican veterans transitioning out of homelessness and helps our homeless veterans. Keith has dedicated his life to this. 
On Memorial Day—on that important 
day on which we honor those who have sacrificed so much and made the ulti-mate sacrifice for our freedom—he shared stories with us of veterans who have come to Liberty House and turned their lives around, but he also shared stories of others who came but could not overcome their addiction, eventu-ally costing them their homes, their families, and in some cases their lives. 
Keith and Liberty House are doing 
incredibly important work for veterans in Manchester, but he believes there is more to be done. On Memorial Day of this year when we were honoring those servicemembers who gave their lives in service to our country, Keith reminded us of something else when he told a crowd at Veteran’s Park in Man-chester—and you could have heard a pin drop when he said this: ‘‘Let us honor our dead by creating hope for our living.’’ He is absolutely right. 
It is clear to me that we need to 
work together. This is a bipartisan issue. This is a public health crisis. This is about the quality of life in our 
country. This is a problem on which we need to work together at the local, State, and Federal level in partnership to identify effective strategies to help save lives and take back our commu-nities. 
For my part, I will remain com-
mitted to fighting against this public health epidemic and taking it up at its roots to make sure for our children that this addiction and heroin—that we get it off our streets but that we get help for those who are addicted and that they understand they shouldn’t feel the stigma I know many of them do, that we want them to come for-ward, we want to help them, and we un-derstand this is incredibly difficult. We want them to know we stand with them so they can get the help and the treatment they need to lead productive lives. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, 
before the Senator from New Hamp-shire leaves the floor, I wish to thank her for her work on the comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. She has been a very good partner in that effort. I know her home State, like Rhode Is-land, is suffering an extraordinary wave of opioid addiction and opioid fa-talities. I know she is also working hard to make sure we get a hearing in the Judiciary Committee under present leadership. I am getting good signals on that. I hope we can pin that down before too long. I think this is a very important issue for us to get a hearing on, and I think it is one that all of the Presidential candidates are seeing. It is one so many of us see in our home States. 
One of the smallest towns in Rhode 
Island is a little town called Burrillville. It is a beautiful place. It is in the northern rural area of our State. People laugh when I say ‘‘the rural area of Rhode Island,’’ but we really do have them. Burrillville is a very bu-colic area, and there are very wonder-ful people there. 
In the first quarter of this year, in 
little Burrillville, six people lost their lives to overdose. When I went to the Burrillville High School to do an event there about this bill and to listen and get ideas for our legislation, there were three recovering folks who came to talk about their situation. Like so many folks in recovery, they were un-believably inspiring and noble in the way they discussed it. All three of them had gone to Burrillville High School. 
It is a real problem, and I appreciate 
very much the leadership of the Sen-ator from New Hampshire. 
CLIMATE CHANGE  
Mr. President, this is actually the 
time of the week for me to deliver my 109th ‘‘Time to Wake Up’’ speech. I find it a little bit frustrating these days be-cause climate change used to be a bi-partisan issue. Over and over again, we

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6277 August 4, 2015 
had bipartisan, serious climate change 
bills. In fact, the first big climate change bill in the EPW Committee was Warner-Lieberman—John Warner, Re-publican of Virginia, and Joe Lieber-man, Democrat of Connecticut. But then came Citizens United and all that dark money began to flow, all that fos-sil fuel money began to flow, all that Koch brothers money began to flow. Now, even as the evidence of climate change deepens to irrefutability, it is hard to find a Republican in Congress who will do anything. Here is the for-mula: Duck the question, deny the evi-dence, and disparage the scientists. Duck, deny, and disparage. That is some strategy for an issue which so many people take seriously. 
As Congress sleepwalks through his-
tory, the warnings are painfully clear. Carbon pollution piles up in the atmos-phere. Temperatures are rising. Weath-er worsens at the extremes. The oceans rise, warm, and acidify. These are all measurements. This isn’t theory. The measurements confirm what the science has always told us about dump-ing so much excess carbon into oceans and atmosphere. 
So hurray for the President’s Clean 
Power Plan. For the first time, we have a national effort to reduce carbon pol-lution from powerplants, which are the largest source of U.S. carbon emis-sions. This plan is big. This plan is good. And this plan is urgently needed. I congratulate the President, I con-gratulate Administrator McCarthy, and I congratulate the good and public- spirited people of the EPA and other Federal agencies who worked hard to listen and make this plan final. 
Of course, we will still have the usual 
complaining from all of the usual sus-pects. The Senate majority leader, the senior Senator from Kentucky, opposes any serious conversation about climate change. In fact, he is ready to lead his modern version of massive resistance against the Federal Clean Power Plan. The Republican leader has written to Governors urging defiance of the EPA regulations, calling them ‘‘extremely burdensome and costly,’’ which would be a more credible conclusion had he not reached it months before the regu-lations were even finalized. 
Actually, if we want to get into the 
actual world here, a report just out from that famous liberal, Socialist bas-tion Georgia Tech found that the clean power rule could be enacted in a very cost-effective manner and could lower folks’ energy bills in the long term. But let’s not let the facts get in the way when there are fossil fuel interests to be placated. 
As the Washington Post reported, 
folks expect to comply with the Clean Power Plan with relatively little ef-fort, even in Kentucky. ‘‘We can meet it’’ is what Dr. Leonard Peters, Ken-tucky’s energy and environment sec-retary, has to say about the Clean Power Plan. ‘‘We can meet it.’’ In fact, Dr. Peters praised the EPA for working with States like his to build this rule. ‘‘The outreach they’ve done, I think, is 
incredible,’’ he said. EPA had an ‘‘open door policy. You could call them, talk to them, meet with them.’’ The Ken-tucky experience was echoed around the country, as EPA listened closely to the concerns of utilities, regulators, experts, and citizens. They have made big adjustments to accommodate the concerns of stakeholders in the States. 
When the usual complaining comes 
from the usual suspects, please ask them: What is your plan? How would you do a better job of addressing the carbon emissions that are polluting our atmosphere and oceans? What is your alternative? 
Spoiler alert: You will look far and 
wide before finding a Republican plan. Don’t look here. Don’t look in the Sen-ate. Republicans in the Senate have ex-actly zero legislation for addressing carbon pollution in any serious way. None. Zip. Nada. Duck, deny, and dis-parage is all they have. Don’t look at their Presidential candidates. In recent weeks I have used these weekly cli-mate speeches to look at Republican Presidential candidates’ views on cli-mate change. It is pathetic. There is nothing. What are we up to—87 Repub-lican Presidential candidates? And not one has a climate change plan. OK, I was exaggerating about the 87. 
Florida, ground zero for sea level 
rise, two Republican Presidential can-didates, and what do the two of them have? Nothing. Republican mayors from Florida, State universities in Florida, the Army Corps office in Flor-ida—nothing gets through to the can-didates. Duck, deny, disparage is all they have. 
The Wisconsin Presidential candidate 
ignores his own home State university, his own State newspapers, and his own State scientists. But Governor Walker can actually top duck, deny, and dis-parage. His response to climate change? Use your budget to fire the sci-entists at the State environmental pro-tection agency. 
How about our Presidential can-
didate, the junior Senator from Ken-tucky? What do we hear from him? He has said that the EPA rules are illegal, and he has predicted that they will re-sult in power shortages—no lights and no heat. But does he have an alter-native he would prefer? No. He has nothing, and, like all the other got- nothing Republican Presidential can-didates, he is out of step with his own home State. 
Kentucky isn’t just easily able to 
comply with the Clean Power Plan; agencies and officials all across Ken-tucky are working seriously on climate change. 
By the way, here is a look at why 
compliance is easy in Kentucky: Ken-tucky’s fuel mix, which this charts, is a wall of coal. As the song says, the Sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home, but good luck finding any solar in there. You will need a magnifying glass to find this tiny little green line at the top that is barely visible that is solar and wind combined. I mean, real-
ly? Iowa can get to 30 percent wind. Iowa has two Republican Senators. It is not impossible. In Kentucky, they haven’t even tried. 
Kentucky’s cities—Lexington, Louis-
ville, Frankfurt, Bowling Green, and Villa Hills—get it. They have signed 
the U.S. Mayors Climate Protection Agreement in order to—quoting offi-cials from Lexington—‘‘act locally to reduce the impacts of climate change by lowering (manmade) greenhouse gas emissions.’’ 
The hills of Kentucky are some dis-
tance from the shores of Rhode Island and the shores of New Hampshire as well. Living by the sea, I have to worry about climate change and what it is doing to our oceans and coasts. Ken-tucky is landlocked. So imagine my surprise to read the Kentucky Depart-ment of Fish and Wildlife Resources warning about sea level rise. I will quote them. 
With the predicted increases in severity of 
hurricanes and tropical storms, coupled with potential shoreline losses in Florida and 
throughout the eastern seaboard, people may begin migrations inland. If and when these events occur, Kentucky may experience human population growth unprecedented to the Commonwealth. 
So I say to our candidate from Ken-
tucky, the junior Senator, and our ma-jority leader, the senior Senator, with Kentucky, their home State, projecting that people on the coasts will be hit so hard by climate change that we may have to flee inland to landlocked Ken-tucky, I hope the Senators from Ken-tucky will understand my persistence on this issue when their own State thinks that my citizens might have to flee to Kentucky to get away from this threat. 
Kentucky is renowned for its horses. 
So I turned to Horse & Rider magazine and found a great article on ‘‘how cli-mate change might affect our horses’ health.’’ Horse & Rider’s expert was none other than Dr. Craig Carter of the University of Kentucky. He had spe-cific concerns in the article for equine health, but he also offered us this gen-eral reminder: 
It’s not just horses (and people) at risk: 
crops are being affected, as are trees, due to beetle infestations. Climate change affects all forms of life. 
That is from Dr. Carter of the Uni-
versity of Kentucky. 
Kentucky Woodlands Magazine re-
ports that ‘‘the world is changing right before our eyes. . . . [O]ur natural sys-tems are changing as a result of a warming climate.’’ The magazine even warns that ‘‘climate change is hap-pening as you read this article.’’ 
Meanwhile the Senators from Ken-
tucky are not sure why that may be. The junior Senator has said that he is not sure anybody knows exactly why all of this climate change is happening. The majority leader invokes that cli-mate denial classic: I am not a sci-entist. Well—and I say this thank-fully—the scientists are here to help, including Kentucky scientists.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6278 August 4, 2015 
At Kentucky’s universities, the 
science seems pretty clear about ex-actly why all of this climate change is happening. Dr. Paul Vincelli is a pro-fessor at the University of Kentucky Cooperative Extension Service. He says: 
In the scientific community, it is widely 
accepted that the global climate is changing and that human activities which produce 
greenhouse gases are a principal cause. Greenhouse gases have a strong capacity to trap heat in the lower atmosphere, even though they are present at trace concentra-tions. 
Elsewhere, Professor Vincelli and his 
University of Kentucky colleagues write: 
Scientific evidence that our global climate 
is warming is abundant. . . . Practicing sci-entists consider the evidence of human-in-duced global warming to be extremely strong. 
The University of Kentucky is not 
the only place. Eastern Kentucky Uni-versity offers concentrations in envi-ronmental sustainability and steward-ship, including courses on global cli-mate change. Northern Kentucky Uni-versity signed the American College and University Presidents’ Climate Commitment, pledging Northern Ken-tucky University to ‘‘an initiative in pursuit of climate neutrality.’’ 
At the University of Louisville, Pro-
fessor Keith Mountain is the chair of the department of geography and geo-sciences. He has lectured about ‘‘how climate change is a measurable reality and how people have contributed to the trends.’’ 
Despite all of the experts in Ken-
tucky saying that human-caused cli-mate change is real, despite the harms that State and local officials foresee for Kentucky and the rest of the coun-try, and despite the easy steps being taken in Kentucky to comply with the President’s Clean Power Plan, the Sen-ators from Kentucky have no plan— nothing. They are part of the ‘‘duck, deny, and disparage’’ caucus. 
And the Presidential candidates? 
There is almost nothing they won’t make up to try to jam a sick in the wheels of progress—imaginary wars on coal when it is really coal’s war on us, imaginary cost increases that have been completely debunked by actual experience, imaginary reliability fail-ures when the real reliability problem is already happening around us thanks to climate-driven extreme weather. On and on they go. Yet they offer no alter-native. Republicans simply have no plan other than a shrug. 
Why do they have no climate plan? 
Why do they present nothing by way of limits to carbon pollution? Here is a clue: Look where the money comes from. It comes from fossil fuel billion-aires and fossil fuel interests. Look at the beauty pageant hosted this week-end by the Koch brothers in Dana Point, CA, where Republican Presi-dential candidates went to display their wares to the big donors. 
Do you think the Koch brothers want 
to hear about climate change? Here is another clue: Americans for Pros-
perity, part of the Koch brothers’ big- money political organization, has open-ly warned that any client who crosses them on climate change will be ‘‘at a severe disadvantage’’—subtle as a brick from an outfit threatening to spend part of the $889 million total that the Koch brothers have budgeted for this election. And yes, $889 million in one election is big money. ‘‘For that kind of money, you could buy yourself a president,’’ said Mark McKinnon, a Re-publican and former George W. Bush strategist and a good Texan. ‘‘Oh, right,’’ he continued, ‘‘that’s the point.’’ 
Even the Donald called the Repub-
licans out on this one, calling the Koch brothers’ California event a ‘‘beg-a- thon,’’ and saying: ‘‘I wish good luck to all of the Republican candidates that traveled to California to beg for money, etc., from the Koch Brothers.’’ 
What a shame, to be a Presidential 
candidate willing to ignore your home State universities, ignore your home State newspapers, ignore your home State scientists—unless, of course, you are trying to fire them—ignore your own home State farmers, foresters, and fishermen, all so you can prance suc-cessfully at pageants for the big-money fossil fuel interests that today control the Republican party. Duck, deny, and disparage is what gets you through the beauty pageant. So duck, deny, and disparage it is. 
Eventually, the Republican Party is 
going to have to come up with a plan on climate change. The American peo-ple are demanding it, Independent vot-ers, whom they will need in 2016, are demanding it. Even Republican voters demand it, at least if they are young ones. And it really matters that we get this right. It is the responsibility of the United States of America, as a great nation, to set an example for oth-ers to follow and not just sit back and wait for others to act. 
Failing to act on climate change 
would both dim the torch we hold up to the world and give other nations an ex-cuse for delay. Failure, I contend, when the stakes are so high becomes an ar-gument for our enemies against our very model of government. How do we explain the influence of this special in-terest interfering with what must be done? There will be no excuse when a reckoning comes to say: I really needed the political support of those fossil fuel billionaires; so, sorry, world. 
President Abraham Lincoln, a native 
Kentuckian, warned us that ‘‘the dog-mas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present.’’ Before the present gets too stormy, I urge my col-leagues from Kentucky to heed the ex-perts in their home State, heed the local leaders in their home State, and wake up to what needs to be done. 
I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. 
A
YOTTE ). The majority whip. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
came to the floor expecting to hear my friend and colleague talk about the bill 
that we are trying to get on, which is the cyber security bill, but again, I hear him returning to his favorite topic, which is climate change. I know 
he thinks that is the most important subject that we could possibly discuss on the floor of the Senate. 
I will just say—and I certainly don’t 
purport to be the expert he is—that when you look at the President’s pro-posed new rules with regard to elec-tricity generation, it looks to me like it is all pain and no gain. The experts, perhaps that he has referred to, said that CO
2reductions would actually be 
less than one-half of 1 percent, and, of course, energy prices on low-income in-dividuals, seniors, and people on fixed income would go up—people who have already been suffering through flat wages and slow wage growth for a long time. Of course, in this economy, which grew last year at the rate of 2.2 per-cent, it would be a further wet blanket on economic growth and job creation. 
The Senator and I have worked to-
gether closely on a number of issues, and I enjoy his company, his intellect, and his energy, but I would say he is all wrong on this one. It sounds to me like so many of our colleagues sound like Chicken Little: The sky is falling, the sky is falling. Well, I don’t think the facts justify it. 
There are more important things we 
can do today and this week—for exam-ple, to pass a cyber security bill. 
WORK IN THE SENATE  
But first, I want to take a minute to 
consider what we have done this year under the new leadership. I know some like to focus on things that we haven’t done, but I assure my colleague that we are just getting started, and there is a lot of important work that remains to be done. Last November the Amer-ican people elected a new majority in the Senate, and I believe they elected us to represent their interests, to flesh out legislation, and to get this Senate back to work. We were elected to run the government and get things done; that is, of course, in a way that is con-sistent with our principles. 
I even heard some people suggest 
that working with folks on the other side of the aisle in a bipartisan way is wrong, that we shouldn’t do anything with Democrats on the Republican side or that Democrats shouldn’t do any-thing with Republicans. That is a com-pletely warped perspective. 
I think the better perspective is that 
expressed by one of our conservative colleagues whom I asked when I got to the Senate: How is it that you work so productively in an important Senate committee with Senator Teddy Ken-nedy, the liberal lion of the Senate? This question was asked to one of the most conservative Members of the U.S. Senate. How can a conservative Sen-ator and a liberal Senator work to-gether productively to the best inter-ests of their constituents and the American people? And he said: It is easy. It is the 80–20 rule. Let’s find the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6279 August 4, 2015 
80 percent we can agree on, and the 20 
percent we can’t we will leave for an-other fight on another day. I believe we have been applying for the benefit of the American people the 80–20 rule, try-ing to find those things we can agree on, and we have been making substan-tial progress. 
Since January we have delivered real 
results, proving that our back-to-work 
model was not just another empty campaign promise. Early this summer we passed the important trade bill, leg-islation that will help American goods get to global markets. Then we passed the Defense authorization bill, a bill that provides our men and women in uniform the resources and authority they need to keep us safe in an ever more dangerous world. We passed an important education bill, the Every Child Achieves Act, legislation that would actually do what my constitu-ents in Texas want us to do, which is send more of the authority from Wash-ington back into the hands of our par-ents, teachers, and local communities and out of the Department of Edu-cation here in Washington, DC. Just last week we passed the 3-year highway bill. Actually, it is a 6-year highway bill. We were able to come up with funding for the first 3 years and left open for us work to be done to come up with additional funding working with our colleagues in the House. Transpor-tation infrastructure is something that supports our States and local commu-nities and allows them to prepare for the growing infrastructure needs in the future while keeping commerce rolling, public safety protected, and protecting our environment. 
Of course, we all know that we are 
just getting started. We have been here in the new Congress for 7 months. We are now on another important bill re-quiring every Senator’s full and imme-diate attention. The Cyber Security In-formation Sharing Act is legislation that is long overdue. If it sounds famil-iar, it is for a good reason because we actually tried to pass this earlier this summer before it was blocked by our friends on the other side of the aisle. This legislation would provide for greater information sharing by people who have been subjected to hacks and would address the rampant and grow-ing cyber threats facing our country. 
One of the things that is so dan-
gerous now is when a private company or an individual is hacked, they can’t actually share that information through a central portal with other people to protect them if they haven’t yet been hacked themselves. Of course, there are all sorts of concerns about li-ability and the like, but we need to ad-dress this to help the Nation deter fu-ture cyber attacks and to help the pub-lic and private sector act more nimbly and effectively when attacks are de-tected. 
As I said, we had a chance to vote on 
this in June as an amendment to the Defense authorization bill. Unfortu-nately, this was about the time that some on the other side—I think most 
notably the next Democratic leader— announced something they called the filibuster summer. These are not ex-actly encouraging words when it comes to trying to work together to get things done. In spite of the real and frightening threats all around us, our Democratic friends filibustered that cyber security bill in June. We know what happened soon thereafter. The need for real cyber security legislation became even more apparent. 
Many of us recall that in June there 
was an initial disclosure that hackers had accessed sensitive background in-formation used for security clearance purposes at the Office of Personnel Management. The estimate in June was that about 4 million people were affected—their personal information. Then on July 9, after our Democratic friends filibustered the cyber security bill on the Defense authorization bill, there was a second report. This time that report informed us that more than 21 million people’s private, secure in-formation had been accessed. This in-formation, illegally accessed, includes passport information, which would show anywhere and everywhere you have traveled; Social Security num-bers, which are portals to all sorts of 
secure financial information; private information, background details, ex-tensive information from previous places of residence. You can imagine. On a form you fill out in order to get a security clearance, you literally have to give your whole life history. That is the kind of sensitive information that was acquired on 21 million people as announced on July 9. Of course, it also provides the names of contact informa-tion, close friends, and family mem-bers. 
While many of these reports indicate 
that China, one of the worst offenders along with Russia when it comes to malicious cyber attacks—many reports indicate China was responsible. The Obama administration for some reason has been unwilling to acknowledge that or tell us who attacked and accessed 21 million sensitive pieces of information. Of course, they have done nothing to respond to this growing threat of cyber attacks. 
The Office of Personnel Management 
was not the only government agency affected. In early June, it was also re-ported that the Internal Revenue Serv-ice had similar problems and that data from more than 100,000 taxpayers had been stolen—again, the kind of infor-mation that if you were to disclose it about private taxpayers, it would be a felony. It would be a criminal offense. This is sensitive information that has now been stolen for 100,000 taxpayers. This breach included access to past tax returns, sensitive information such as Social Security numbers, addresses, birthdays—all stolen and potentially in the hands of criminals. It is exactly the kind of information that identity thieves want in order to pretend they are somebody they are not in order to steal your money. Clearly, we don’t have time to waste 
when it comes to cyber security legis-lation. I would point out that the Democratic leader himself, someone who is quick to dismiss the earlier vote when we tried to do this in the context of the Defense authorization bill in June, has said that he is committed to getting cyber legislation done. Well, I would ask: If not now, when? 
This bipartisan legislation that 
passed the Intelligence Committee in the Senate by a margin of 14 to 1 pro-vides us another opportunity this week. With cyber threats so clearly in evidence all around us, we should act quickly to implement a solution. I would encourage all of our colleagues to try to find that 80–20 solution on this bill. 
No one is claiming it is perfect. I al-
ready talked to the committee chair-men in the House who say they have some different views, but that is cus-tomary around here. Once the Senate passes the bill, it can be reconciled with the differences in the House bill in a conference committee. 
Surely we all agree that this type of 
legislation and the protection it pro-vides is desperately needed. As the vote in July suggests, this is a bill in and of itself that will be the product of a func-tioning bipartisan Senate. Let’s con-tinue our progress for the American people. 
I would add, by way of closing, that 
more than 70 pieces of legislation have passed the Senate since January 1, and 30 of those have been signed into law. More than 160 bills have been reported out of committee. That is what a func-tioning Senate looks like. 
As I said before and I will say again, 
even our colleagues who are in the mi-nority must enjoy getting to do what they were elected to do, which is to come here and cast a vote on behalf of their constituents on important issues that the Senate is addressing. I hope we can get this legislation passed this week. 
Madam President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

PLANNED PARENTHOOD  
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, yes-
terday Republicans in the Senate put forward legislation to defund Planned Parenthood. Unfortunately, this bill was a clear partisan attack on access to health care for women, and espe-cially women in rural and underserved areas. 
One in five American women have re-
lied on Planned Parenthood health cen-ters at some point in their lifetime. Often, Planned Parenthood is the wom-an’s only option for basic, preventive health care, including prenatal care, physicals, and cancer screenings. 
For example, take Mary, a 20-year- 
old student in my home State of Michi-gan, who went through her campus health center when she found a lump on her breast. They told her it was nothing and not to worry. When she visited Planned Parenthood a year

later for an unrelated matter, the clini-
cian expressed concern that the lump was still there. Through Planned Par-enthood she got referred to a program for low-income women with breast can-cer, and she received the treatment that she needed. Today, Mary is thank-fully cancer free. Planned Parenthood provides upward of a half million breast cancer exams every year and can save the lives of women just like Mary across the Nation. 
Planned Parenthood also provides 
about 400,000 potentially lifesaving cer-vical cancer screenings annually. Katie, another young woman from Michigan, went in for her annual exam at a Michigan Planned Parenthood cen-ter. Her exam revealed that she had cervical cancer, and Planned Parent-hood helped her weigh options to cover the biopsy and subsequent surgery. Today she, too, is thankfully cancer free. 
The doctors and nurses at these fa-
cilities provide affordable, potentially lifesaving health care to 2.7 million people per year. Michigan has 21 Planned Parenthood health centers, 11 of which are located in rural or medi-cally underserved areas. These num-bers mirror national numbers, with over half of their 700 health care cen-ters located in areas with limited ac-cess to medical care. Federal funding for Planned Parenthood supports ac-cess to treatment at these health cen-ters for women like Mary and Katie in States all across this country. 
Let’s be clear. Federal funding for 
Planned Parenthood or any other orga-nization is not used for abortion. Let me say this again because it is a very important fact. Federal funding for Planned Parenthood or any other orga-nization is not used for abortion. This has been settled Federal law for dec-ades. 
Despite this fact, we have seen the 
adoption of extreme measures that re-strict a woman’s fundamental right to make her own decisions about her re-productive health, including in Michi-gan. A woman should have access to re-productive health services and the free-dom to make her own decisions about her health care, and I will fight to pro-tect this right each and every day that I serve here in the U.S. Senate. 
Yesterday evening I voted to stop the 
Senate from moving forward with leg-islation to defund Planned Parenthood. This bill would have jeopardized access to health care for 2.7 million men and women who rely on Planned Parent-hood for their health care needs. While I am pleased that the Senate did not move forward with the bill, it is clear that we have not seen the end of these types of partisan attacks on Planned Parenthood. 
I urge my colleagues to move away 
from efforts to restrict access to health care and, instead, focus on crafting bi-partisan agreements to fund our gov-ernment, provide certainty to Amer-ican employers and workers, support 
small businesses, and grow our middle class.

sence of a quorum.

CLEAN POWER PLAN  
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to join my colleagues in com-mending President Obama for putting forth his Clean Power Plan. 
Theodore Roosevelt said: 
Of all the questions which can come before 
this nation, short of the actual preservation of its existence in a great war, there is none which compares in importance with the great central task of leaving this land even a better land for our descendents than it is for us. 
I think it captured very well the 
challenge we face with carbon pollu-tion and global warming because we are facing that great central task of leaving this land better for our de-scendents than it is for us. 
We are facing a situation in which 
there is an accelerating quantity of carbon dioxide pollution in the atmos-phere, and it is having a profound im-pact on, basically, the temperature of our planet. If we simply look at the carbon pollution itself, scientists have said that we are in trouble if it rises over 350 parts per million. Well, here we are with pollution that last year hit 400 parts per million. So we are above the danger zone. We are going deeper into the danger zone—let me put it that way—and that is not where we need to be. 
Furthermore, we are accelerating the 
rate at which we are polluting the planet with carbon dioxide. It was just a few decades ago that the rate of car-bon pollution was increasing by about 1 part per million per year, and now it is increasing by something closer to 2 parts per million per year. So where we need to be decreasing the overall pollu-tion, bringing it down, we are increas-ing it and increasing the rate at which we are polluting, and that is a very bad 
place for humankind to be on this plan-et. 
There is incontrovertible evidence of 
how quickly the planet is warming. We have, by scientific record—14 of the warmest 15 years in recorded history have occurred in the last 15 years. So 14 of the 15 warmest years over the cen-turies of measurement have all oc-curred in the last 15 years. That is not just one little warm spell on some lit-tle piece of land; that is a global tem-perature. 
As carbon pollution is increasing, we 
see the global temperature increasing, and it is reverberating all across the planet. We see dramatic changes in the Arctic. The rate of warming in the Arc-tic is roughly four times the rate of warming in more moderate latitudes. So we are seeing an incredible decrease in the ice, huge changes that are com-ing so quickly, it is very hard for ani-mals to adapt. Of course, people are well aware of the crisis the polar bears are facing, but that is just one par-ticular visible species as an indicator of the challenges that are going on. 
We are seeing the feedback mecha-
nisms in the polar zone. We are seeing the open waters where ice is not re-flecting the sunlight back up. More water is absorbing more sunlight, and that is creating an accelerated heating impact. We are seeing that as thawing occurs in the permafrost, we have these situations with what are called drunk-en forests, where the trees that all stood straight are now staggering in one direction or the other as they lean slightly, as the ground underneath them that was frozen is melting. As it starts to melt, it will start to release methane gas, which is a very potent global warming gas. So that is another feedback mechanism we should all be concerned about. 
Let’s take my home State of Oregon, 
and I think one could do this type of checkup, if you will, on any State in the Union. In my home State, we had a very severe series of droughts in the Klamath Basin, which is a major agri-cultural basin. We have had the three worst ever droughts in a period of 15 years. It corresponds with the period of the warmest years on planet Earth in recorded history. And that has a huge impact on our farming industry. So if you care about farmers, you should care about global warming. 
Then we had a big challenge with our 
forests because as these summers are becoming dryer and as the types of storms we have are producing more lightning strikes, we are having a lot more forest fires. The fire season is getting longer and more devastating. Far more acres are being burned. Over several decades, the fire season has in-creased by several weeks in length, and the amount of acres burning each sum-mer, on average, is increasing. So if

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6281 August 4, 2015 
you care about timber, if you care 
about forests, then you should care about global warming. 
Another impact of this changing pat-
tern is that we are getting very little snowfall in the Cascades. Just as Gla-cier Park is now becoming the park of disappearing glaciers—you have to look very hard to find any glaciers left in Glacier Park—the Cascades also—a different mountain range—are losing their snowpack. In fact, we have vir-tually no snowpack now feeding the mountain streams that come down. So if you are a fisherman, you are looking at smaller and warmer streams, which is very unhealthy for fish. 
That is not all. Right now we have 
sockeye coming up the Columbia River and getting to the Snake River, and they are dying because the tempera-ture of the river is too warm for them to continue upriver to spawn. Some es-timates that I have seen in the last week are that as many as 80 percent of the sockeye now returning are dying in the Columbia River before they make it to the Snake River. So if you care about fishing, you should care about global warming. 
Then we look at our coastal shellfish 
and we discover that we have a signifi-cant problem with our oysters. Oregon produces a lot of oyster seed. Those are the baby oysters that get distributed to oyster fishermen. There is a similar process going on in Washington State at another hatchery. The challenge for the hatcheries is that the water that is pumped out of the ocean to produce the baby oysters, get them going, is becom-ing too acidic. This also is about global warming because the higher rates of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are being absorbed by the ocean, and that creates carbonic acid. It has been enough that there is a 30-percent in-crease in the acidity of the ocean, and that is causing a big problem with baby oysters as far as forming shells. So if you care about the seafood industry, you should care about global warming. 
When we talk about the issue of glob-
al warming, we are not talking about computer models and things that are 50 years into the future; we are talking about real-life effects seen on the ground right now, things that are hav-ing a big impact on our seafood, a big impact on our fishing, a big impact on our farming, and a big impact on our forestry. If you care about rural Amer-ica’s resource-driven economies across this country, you should care about global warming. 
As a nation, it is incumbent on us to 
take on this challenge. We are the first generation—as has been said by oth-ers—to feel the impact of global warm-ing and the last generation that can do something about it. It is incumbent on us, the Senators in this Chamber, the U.S. Senate, to take on this issue. It is incumbent on the Presidents and the executive teams they put together to take this on in partnership with the rest of the world because this is abso-lutely a tragedy of the commons. Very clearly, if the United States 
takes some action to reduce our carbon dioxide or to reduce our methane pro-duction, it will have a modest impact but not enough. Nations across the planet have to act, and they will act more or less as a community because very few nations are going to say they will act alone knowing they won’t have a big enough impact unless nations join together. So it is up to our leader-ship role in the world that we act ac-tively, aggressively, and reach out with other nations to partner. 
Earlier this year there was an agree-
ment struck with China. China is going to produce as much renewable energy from electricity by 2030 as all the elec-tricity we currently produce in the United States. I am not just talking about our renewable energy. If you take the U.S. renewable energy, our nuclear energy, our energy produced from gas-fired plants, our electricity produced from coal-fired plants, and you add it all together, that is the amount of electricity China is going to produce with just renewable energy be-tween now and 2030. They are taking on a massive commitment to renewable energy. They wouldn’t be doing it if the United States wasn’t also respond-ing aggressively. India is starting to become interested in doing their share, seeing that other nations are stepping up. 
The United States should never be 
sitting on its hands and saying: We will wait for everybody else to act—not when there is an issue that threatens the success of the next generation of humans on this planet and the genera-tion after and the generation after. 
I said earlier that not only are we the 
first generation to feel the impact of global warming, but we are the last generation that can do something about it. What do I mean by that? What I mean is that the further you get into global warming, the further you get into carbon pollution, methane pollution, and more feedback mecha-nisms, the harder it is to stop. There is momentum that builds behind the warming of the planet. It becomes much harder to take it on. That is why we need to act decisively now. 
So the Clean Power Plan the Presi-
dent launched, put forward yesterday, is responding to the moral demand of this generation to take on carbon pol-lution. It is doing so in a most cost-ef-fective fashion, a fashion that will cre-ate jobs in the United States, a fashion that will reduce deaths in the United States. 
Let me give an example of the health 
benefits. It will avoid up to 3,600 pre-mature deaths, lead to 90,000 fewer asthma attacks in children, and pre-vent 300,000 missed workdays and schooldays. That is incredible. It will save the average family nearly $85 in their annual energy bill by the year 2030. So that is powerful. 
In addition, we are going to create 
jobs in this fashion. It has the tremen-dous impact of putting people to work—tens of thousands to work, driv-
ing new investments in cleaner, more modern, and efficient renewable energy technologies. 
I close by turning back to President 
Theodore Roosevelt, who said there is no more important mission than ‘‘leav-ing this land even a better land for our descendants than it is for us.’’ 
There are individuals who will come 
to this floor and they will say: Let’s act someday but not now. Let’s do it when it will not have an impact on jobs. Well, this will actually create jobs right now. Let’s do it when it will cost less. Well, it never costs less if the problem gets bigger. It costs less to in-vest now. Let’s pass it on to the next generation. They will solve it. That is morally irresponsible. 
Every State is feeling the direct im-
pact. Every rural community, timber community, fishing community, shell-fish community, and farming commu-nity is feeling the impact today of our failure to address this yesterday. Our children, our children’s children, and our children’s children’s children are counting on us in the Senate to act ag-gressively, to support a strong plan to take on carbon pollution—a strong Clean Power Plan. So let’s do so. 
I thank the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak as in morning business for 10 minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ENERGY POLICY  
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I 
come from an energy State—Okla-homa. We truly do all of the above. We have coal, oil, gas, wind, solar, hydro, geothermal, and we are just missing nuclear. Quite frankly, we probably would have nuclear if the regulations weren’t so incredibly high and so in-credibly expensive to do. In my State and in my region, we want diverse, in-expensive, healthy, plentiful, and reli-able energy. We don’t think that should be such a high goal that it is only limited to Oklahoma. Quite frank-ly, I think just about every area of the country wants that. 
In fact, that used to be a bipartisan 
goal. It used to be that Democrats also supported ‘‘all of the above’’ energy. At some point, they shifted to the ways of Solyndra and determined if you want to be in that party, you have to com-mit to a certain environmental ortho-doxy. It makes it a tougher conversa-
tion to have about real energy policy based around facts. 
It is another day. It seems to be an-
other day for the EPA to release mas-sive new regulations. People wonder why their paycheck doesn’t go as far nowadays, why food costs more, why products cost more, and why energy costs more. I can tell you why. It is this ever-growing regulation on the basic cost of energy. It changes the cost of everything. 
The EPA stated they are not respon-
sible for determining the benefits of

climate change, just that it would hap-
pen. As they put out their new Clean Power Plan, they said they didn’t have to actually list or abide by the cost. They did determine the cost anyway— $8.4 billion a year to the American con-sumer; $8.4 billion on top of the energy regulations that already exist. 
They also said they weren’t respon-
sible for having to be able to run through the actual effects on climate change, they just said it is happening 
and so we need to do something. In fact, it has been interesting for me to hear so many of my colleagues in the past 24 hours say: Republicans, put out your plan. We are doing something. You need to put out a plan to show you are doing something as well. 
We ran the numbers on it and tried to 
evaluate it through the EPA models and looked for somewhere where some-one who ran the EPA model would note how much change there would be in the environment if this plan is fully imple-mented. The model came back that it would slow the rise of the sea 0.3 milli-meters once this is fully imple-mented—0.3 millimeters of sea change difference. To give an example, the head of this pen is 0.7 millimeters. So half the head of this pen is what we are going to save in sea level change if we fully implement this plan. 
This seems to be about fear—severe 
weather, imminent danger. If you don’t change everything in your life to the way we think you should live your life, the whole Earth is going to fall into chaos and ruin. 
We need to have an energy debate on 
this floor. I completely agree. We even need to have a climate debate on this floor, but it doesn’t need to be out of fear. It needs to be about the facts— what really needs to happen. 
Let’s start with some basic questions 
about energy policy and about energy future: What will it take to have reli-able energy for the United States dur-ing a summer heat wave so we don’t have rolling blackouts and senior adults suffering from heatstroke dur-ing an August afternoon? 
What will it take to protect our grid 
so that doesn’t occur? What will it take to have reliable energy for the hardest nights of winter to make sure Americans are protected in those cold-est nights so their power doesn’t go out because of rolling blackouts? What en-ergy sources are plentiful in the United States and what energy sources leave us vulnerable to international pres-sures? What energy sources do we have that we should export to gain economic benefits and geopolitical power for the United States? What energy sources are economical so we can attract man-ufacturing to the United States to cre-ate more jobs for America? How can we ensure that the energy we use has the least amount of health risks so we can have a healthy nation and a healthy world? How about this question. What is the best way to keep energy diver-sity and distribution to protect our economy from rapid price swings or lo-calized acts of terrorism? That is how you begin to set an en-
ergy policy, which is to ask some gen-eral questions and then start answer-ing some of those and asking, What is the best way to accomplish that? In-stead, our energy policy is being run by environmental policy and fear of what could possibly happen in the future or protecting ourselves from 0.3 millime-ters of sea rise. 
Over the past 10 years, CO
2emissions 
have drastically been reduced. Since 2005, CO
2emissions from electric gen-
eration has been reduced by 364 million metric tons to 2,051 metric tons. The future goal, by the way, in this new Clean Power Plan is to have 788 metric tons of reduction from 2005, but we are already 364 metric tons there because there has already been a pretty dra-matic reduction, much of that from a very slow economy—so 424 more metric tons by 2030. That would mean, even with an ever-increasing population, in-creasing energy needs, and hopefully a recovering economy, we need to cut much more. 
Let me try to set this in context. I 
am going to throw around some num-bers for a while, but I think we as a body can handle it. Let me give some perspective on where things are going on this. 
The last time the United States 
emitted this target amount for CO
2 
that has now been laid out as the tar-geted amount was in 1985, with 237 mil-lion people. If you want a little bit of throwback time, that is when Duran Duran, Huey Lewis, and the Com-modores had all the big hits. That is when there were no personal computers or cell phones or iPads, cloud com-puting had never even been discussed, and there weren’t all the electric de-vices we have now. We had 237 million people at the time. 
The target is to get to that same 
amount of CO
2usage, but we will have 
363 million people at the time. That is the estimate from the Census Bureau. So the plan is to have 126 million more people emit less carbon and use less electricity. That sounds like an inter-esting plan. If you want the real num-ber by percentage, let me break that down for you. In 1985, every 1 million people used 6.86 metric tons of CO
2— 
6.86 metric for every 1 million people. Now, in 2015, every 1 million people use 6.38 metric tons of CO
2. 
That means, in the past 30 years, we 
have reduced for each 1 million people about half a ton of CO
2because of en-
ergy efficiencies, because of the changes in the way we do energy. We do it much cleaner now than we did it in the 1970s and 1980s. Good for us. We achieved a lot in 1985—a lot of changes—but we have half a ton less CO
2per 1 million people. 
What the administration is proposing 
in their plan is that for every 1 million people in the United States in 2030, we would use 4.48 million tons of CO
2. That 
means, in the last 30 years, with the energy efficiency movement, with ev-erything that has been done, with the remarkable shift in renewables, we 
have gained half a ton. The administra-tion wants us now to get 2 tons of addi-tional amount in the next 15 years. 
Do you understand why a lot of peo-
ple say this is just not rational? You can’t get to an acceleration that fast with that big a goal. Here is what hap-pens, though. I look at the facts and the requirements and immediately I am called a Neanderthal who just wants dirty air and dirty water. Actu-ally, I have children, too, and I like clean air and clean water, but facts are very stubborn things. 
A government mandate doesn’t cre-
ate reality. Remember Jimmy Carter in 1979? He declared his policies would create an energy path so that by the year 2000, 20 percent of America’s en-ergy would be produced by solar power—20 percent by the year 2000. How are we doing with that? Less than 2 percent of our energy in 2015 is pro-duced by solar power. 
Mandates don’t create realities. If we 
drastically change all our electric gen-eration to wind, solar, nuclear, and some natural gas, we will hit our an-nual number, but the amount of de-crease per year will amount to approxi-mately what China puts out in 1 month. You see, they are talking about reducing per year about 450-or-some metric tons of CO
2that America would 
put out. China emits 800 metric tons per month. This is why so many people say this is a very expensive goal for America that will have no effect on the global reality. 
Just to add a dose of cold water to 
the reality, it usually takes more than 10 years for a powerplant to even get a permit and start the construction be-cause the Department of Energy, FERC, and EPA restrictions are so high. So this plan that in the next 15 years we are going to have all this roll-out, we can’t even get through the per-mitting time in that time period. 
I haven’t even touched on the legal 
issues of the new mandates of the ad-ministration. They haven’t been in front of the American people or in front of the Congress. The existing law—the Clean Air Act—does not allow EPA to add another layer of regula-tions on top of the existing regula-tions. That is clear in the law. You cannot do that. Even the former Sierra Club general counsel, David Book-binder, found this new proposal is based on what he called a ‘‘legally du-bious ground.’’ 
As a nation, we don’t need more pie- 
in-the-sky energy ideas. We need real solutions and a right direction that will benefit the United States and the world. We lead the world in power and ideas. We should set high goals. But our goals should help us as a nation, not hurt us. Every American pays more at the pump right now because of the increasing regulations in the ethanol mandates. Every American is paying more for gasoline than we should. Every American is paying more for electricity than we should because of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6283 August 4, 2015 
the cost of all these mandates. People 
ask me all the time why their dollars don’t go as far; the regulations are the reason. 
Many people want to talk about our 
energy future—great, so do I. But I also want to talk about our energy present. The goal of a quarter of America’s elec-tricity produced by renewables is a good goal. It is a huge jump. We are just at around 5 percent right now in renewables. But that will still leave us—even if that goal is accomplished— with 75 percent of our energy coming from coal, oil, natural gas, and nuclear. That is base power. It is not effective at night or on hot still days in the summer when the wind doesn’t blow. It 
is base power. 
Solar is more efficient than ever. 
Let’s keep going. It is a good thing. I am glad we are able to harness some of that. It takes a massive amount of acreage. There is a new solar facility that just came into Oklahoma. Great, we are glad to have it. It has 15 acres of solar—15 acres of panels. It powers two neighborhoods—two neighbor-hoods—and it takes 15 acres to get that accomplished. 
Windmills are much more efficient 
right now than they have ever been. In fact, they are efficient enough that we should probably stop subsidizing them. They are not a startup anymore. We started subsidizing utility-grade wind-mills more than 20 years ago, saying someday this thing is going to be effi-cient enough that it is going to work. I think we are already there. In fact, there are more than 48,000 utility-scale wind turbines in the country right now—48,000 windmills in the country right now. To give some perspective, there are 36,000 McDonald’s in the world. We have 48,000 windmills. There are 36,000 McDonald’s in the world. I don’t exactly think the windmill thing is a startup anymore. I think maybe that is fairly well established. So maybe the need for the subsidy is not there. 
Geothermal is a great energy source. 
We have yet to tap the full potential for heating and cooling our homes and businesses. But we still need natural gas, oil, coal, and nuclear to provide power for the foreseeable future. Even the Obama administration lays out over the next 30 years what they an-ticipate energy use will be, and they still anticipate we are going to need gas, coal, oil, basic base power. 
So let’s do it the cleanest way we 
can, the most efficient way we can so the consumer is not punished for using energy. We should keep innovating for the future, but we should make ration-al choices on energy. 
Let me give an example of an irra-
tional choice. Can I do that? Here is an example of an irrational energy choice: the Keystone XL Pipeline. Now, I know everyone is going to say we are going to talk about Keystone again. This is day 2,510 of a permit request to build a pipeline. Today is day 2,510 of a permit request sitting on the President’s desk for a pipeline. Let me give an example. All of these black lines that we see 
here are crude oil pipelines in the United States currently there. This is how many thousands of miles? More than 60,000 miles in the United States of crude oil pipeline—60,000. It is an-other pipeline. Why does it take 2,510 days to be able to make a decision on this? Oh, it is an international pipe-line. That is right. Well, let me add something to it. We have 19 inter-national pipelines currently running— 19 of them. This would be No. 20. This is not something new and radical. We are already buying a significant amount of Canadian oil. That oil is coming from right up here. Look at all of these pipelines already coming from the same spot. Look at that, they cross the border, and it has been safe and re-liable. This has not been a big chal-lenge for us. 
That oil is not just being blocked 
from Canada. Many people think that if we don’t put in a pipeline, it won’t come. Actually, it is coming by rail al-ready. It is already moving into the country. This is just cleaner and more efficient to be able to move it that way. Canada is discussing taking a pipeline and bringing it all the way over here, dropping it off and bringing it to the coast, and bringing it by ship over to the U.S. gulf coast. 
Does someone think that is more effi-
cient than bringing a pipeline in? Now, it is not more efficient by rail. It is not more efficient by this way. If we are going to bring it in and Canada is going to sell it, why don’t we have an inter-national pipeline—that No. 20, right there—and be able to bring it in? 
Now, I have heard multiple people 
say it is because of the aquifer in Ne-braska. Let me try to discuss this be-cause I have heard this over and over: We can’t run pipelines because of the aquifer in Nebraska. 
Here is the aquifer that is being dis-
cussed all in the purple here. Every line that we see is an existing pipeline running through that aquifer. This tiny blue line is the proposed Keystone that is to go right through there as well. 
They make these comments: We 
can’t run it through the aquifer be-cause, oh, my gosh, we can’t run a pipeline there. That is how many we al-ready have in that spot. This is not radical. This is not different. 
In fact, let me give one more image. 
This is the number of pipelines that we have in America right now of all types. This is both natural gas and crude and all kinds of petroleum products that move through the United States all the time—every single one of those lines. This is irrational energy policy that is knee-jerk that is happening. To say that we can’t add one more pipeline be-cause somehow that would go over the top ignores the reality of what we al-ready have in the United States. 
Moving energy by pipeline is clean 
and efficient. It is also a rational way to do it. We have to move from fear- based energy policy to fact-based en-ergy policy—to look not only at our energy future but what may happen in 
the decades to come. I hope my car one day runs on a pinwheel on the hood or-nament. That would be great. But that doesn’t happen right now. My car still runs on gas. So does everyone else’s here. And for every single person here that gets on an airplane every week, it doesn’t run on water. It still runs on energy that we pull out of the ground. 
So for the foreseeable future we need 
to deal with the facts. Stop hurting consumers for some proposed future hope of what may happen. Let’s do it clean. Let’s do it innovative. But let’s not hurt consumers in the process. 
People want to know where their 
money has gone. It is being spent away on regulations. Let’s get to work on an energy plan. 
I am glad to have this conversation, 
but this should not be a conversation in the hallways of the EPA. This should be a conversation in this room to determine where energy policies go.

ECONOMIC GROWTH  
Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I rise 
today to speak about seizing the oppor-tunity to drive real economic growth right now. But first, I wish to give a little context by referencing our great Nation’s desperate fiscal condition. 
Decades of overspending by both par-
ties and mismanagement by both par-ties have led to a crushing $18 trillion of Federal debt. Even more sobering to me is the upcoming over $100 trillion of future unfunded liabilities coming at us like a freight train. We have a fiscal crisis in this country. Everybody can see it. People back home can feel it. As an outsider, my role is to bring a new sense of urgency to Washington to help solve this fiscal crisis. 
While I am encouraged by the work 
my colleagues on the Budget Com-mittee completed this year—we com-pleted a balanced budget for the first time since 2001—it was merely a good first step in the right direction. But we have a lot of heavy lifting to do. We must act right now to get our fiscal house in order before it is too late. 
Yes, we must cut unnecessary spend-
ing. Yes, there are redundant agencies and programs that should be elimi-nated. And yes, we do need to have a national dialogue on how we keep the commitments that were made to our seniors, while saving those important programs for future generations. How-ever, discretionary spending cuts and long-term reforms to mandatory pro-grams alone will not solve this prob-lem. The numbers just simply don’t add up to solve this crisis. Economic growth is really the only answer. 
Economic growth supports good-pay-
ing jobs across the entire country, and economic growth eventually means

more revenue for the Federal Govern-
ment without raising taxes. If we are ever going to get out of the hole that Washington has dug for our country, we are going to have to grow our way out of it economically. One of the big-gest opportunities to infuse energy and investment into our economy right now is before us as I speak, just wait-ing for us to act on it. 
There are approximately $2.1 trillion 
in corporate profits of American multi-
national companies sitting abroad trapped by our archaic tax laws. Imag-ine if we could lure just a portion of that back in terms of capital invest-ment in our economy. The multiplier effect alone would be incredible as it rippled its way throughout our domes-tic economy. 
In recent weeks we have heard a lot 
of talk about how we in Washington can get those overseas earnings repa-triated back into the United States economy. For me, the solution is quite simple. We simply eliminate the bar-rier to repatriation by completely eliminating the tax on repatriation. 
My approach isn’t just based on my 
business career. It is not just based on my desire to give our economy a much- needed shot in the arm. Completely eliminating this tax on repatriation is an absolute necessity for global com-petitiveness and to create a level play-ing field with the rest of the world. 
I rarely compare other countries to 
the United States for simple reasons. No. 1, we have an 18 trillion economy. No. 2, we are the innovator in the world. No. 3, we have the rule of law. No. 4, we have really a very dynamic and diverse economy. Very few coun-tries compare. But this is one time where a comparison is warranted be-cause it is about how we compete for economic development and jobs with the rest of the world. 
A company headquartered in the 
United States not only has to pay taxes in every single country in which it does business, but when it elects to bring back the remaining profits from abroad, that corporation is forced to pay an additional tax—a repatriation tax. This doesn’t happen if the corpora-tion is based in Canada, France, Ger-many, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan or, indeed, the remainder of the 39 OECD countries. In fact, there is only one country on the list of 39 OECD countries that has a repatriation tax— the United States. The United King-dom actually eliminated their repatri-ation tax in 2009, and over the last dec-ade they have reduced their corporate tax rate from 28 percent to 18 percent. 
We continue to see companies leave 
the United States because they can go pretty much anywhere else and benefit from much lower tax rates than here in America. We have seen a rash of those inversions over the last few years, and it is not going to stop until we deal with the underlying problem; that is, our corporate tax rate is not competi-tive with the rest of the world. The re-patriation tax is a derivative of that primary causal problem. What I am talking about today is 
simply the elimination of the repatri-ation tax. But sooner or later, we have to deal with the fact that our corporate tax rate is simply not competitive. The question simply before us is, Do we want multinational companies—in many cases iconic American brands—to continue to call the United States home or not? 
As a former CEO of a large branded 
company that manufactured in dozens of countries and sold in dozens more, I have firsthand experience, and I can tell you that, based on that experience, we are losing our competitive advan-tage with the rest of the world. In fact, I see us now at a growing disadvantage for our American companies to com-pete with companies in other coun-tries. 
The hostile regulatory environment 
the current administration has created is killing American jobs, and our out-dated tax system is forcing them to ex-pand abroad. Executive orders and reg-ulatory mandates have created a puni-tive atmosphere in which to try to grow businesses or start businesses here in the United States. Unfortu-nately, in typical Washington fashion, the dialogue on repatriation is focused on how to get a short-term solution—a short-term Federal tax increase—in-stead of using repatriation as a tool to grow the economy and make us more competitive. In my estimation, this kind of thinking is dead wrong and an-other example of how we got in this mess in the first price. 
We should not be looking at repatri-
ation as a way to pay for the highway trust fund or any other short-term so-lution to Washington’s spending prob-lems, for that matter. That kind of shortsighted thinking will only make our fiscal situation worse. It will only cause more American companies to look for a new home. 
Repatriation is a big idea with a big 
potential impact for our economy. If we encourage repatriation the right way, it means sustained growth for our economy. It means more American jobs and innovation. Ultimately, it means an organic increase in Federal tax rev-enue based on pure economic growth. This growth can allow us to deal with our economic and fiscal priorities and finally develop a long-term plan to begin to pay down our overburdened debt. 
Before I conclude, I have one final 
thought. I hope this thought will com-pel my colleagues to act with a sense of urgency on this issue and others that impact our economy. We actually have fewer people working than at any time in the last 30 years. When I go back home, the number one question that is put before me is: How can I get my hours up? How can I get more work? 
People back home know we have a 
crisis. It is not just bureaucrats in Washington looking for a few more tax dollars so we can make government bigger. This is about putting people back to work—helping us compete against the growing economies of 
China, India, Russia, and other rivals in today’s world. 
The approval rating of Congress 
today is somewhere in the mid-single digits, and that is only because our mothers voted. I believe it is because this town’s priorities are not aligned with those of the people who sent us here for their bidding. Folks back home know that shortsighted, short- term solutions to the big problems are how Washington got in this mess in the first place. 
Today we can continue to argue 
about temporary ways to pay for trust funds that are going bankrupt every few weeks, or we can simply finally get serious about solving this systemic problem before we have to hand it to our children and our children’s chil-dren. I know the American people ex-pect the latter. In fact, they are de-manding it. That can happen, but we must make real tax reforms right now that will set us on a new course for economic growth and opportunity for generations to come. The time for seri-ous debate about repatriation has come. 
We have an opportunity. I implore 
my colleagues in the Senate to debate this earnestly, and let’s move on this right now and put people back to work and make America more competitive for our children and our children’s chil-dren.

ARENA ACT  
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, yester-
day President Obama and his Environ-mental Protection Agency announced their final clean power grab, con-tinuing the economic assault on en-ergy-producing States like West Vir-ginia. 
Yesterday, Alpha Natural Resources, 
one of the Nation’s largest coal pro-ducers, filed for bankruptcy. As of the end of 2014, Alpha had 4,870 employees at 33 active mines and 13 prep plants in West Virginia. Alpha follows Patriot Coal, Jim Walter Resources, and James River mining—all of which have filed bankruptcy since 2014. 
According to the Mine Safety and 
Health Administration, coal mining employment has dropped from 143,437 in 2011 to 98,310 in the first quarter of this year. That represents a 31-percent drop over the last 4 years. 
Earlier this year when Murray En-
ergy announced hundreds of layoffs in northern West Virginia, the Wheeling Intelligencer newspaper reported that the impact would mean almost $62 mil-lion in annual income lost wages for Ohio Valley residents. Other commu-nities have also been hard hit. Nicholas County—a small county in my State— was forced to lay off sheriff’s deputies because they could no longer pay their county commitments because of a de-cline in coal severance revenues. 
Now, 17 coal units in West Virginia 
have retired due, at least in part, to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6285 August 4, 2015 
EPA policies. The electricity produced 
by these units is enough to power 2.7 million homes. Put another way, the units that have already closed in West Virginia would generate enough elec-tricity to power the entire State of Ha-waii. 
These are not the same old talking 
points, as the administrator of the EPA and the President said. These are not stale. This is not motivated by spe-cial interests. These are real Ameri-cans, real jobs, real families, and real communities that have been negatively impacted by this administration’s overreaching regulations. These are people like Tammy Rowan of Coalton, WV, who wrote me a letter: 
My whole family has concerns with the 
regulations that seem to be out of control. EPA, government officials, and the president are putting families out of work. 
Or Patrick Sparks in Warriormine, 
WV, who said: 
I know the EPA has been trying to force 
strict regulations on coal. It’s hurting a lot of people, not just here in West Virginia, but a lot of businesses are suffering from it. 
And Theresa Simmons of Tridelphia, 
WV, whose family has worked in coal mines for generations, wrote: 
My husband was able to provide for our 
family with just his income. We were able to donate money to local charities and help needy families around the holidays. Now that is going to be my family, looking for do-nations. 
Put simply, yesterday’s announce-
ment will make an already bleak situa-tion in our State much worse. Working families across the Nation woke up to the sad news that their jobs just don’t count. Much has been said about the open process that led to this final rule. In fact, West Virginia, which is one of the States most deeply affected by this regulation, was not even visited by the EPA after I and others extended many invitations. Instead, they went to cit-ies like Chicago, Boston, and San Fran-cisco. Talk about special interests. Talk about being bold. 
The administration’s final clean 
power grab will force States away from affordable, reliable energy toward ex-pensive, intermittent power sources, many of which are heavily subsidized by the taxpayer. It proposes bench-marks that are more stringent and less attainable. 
In West Virginia, our emissions rate 
under the proposed rule was to drop 20 percent. On Monday, the final rule re-quires our rate to drop by 37 percent— a drop that is almost twice as severe. There is no way for West Virginia to comply with this rule without signifi-cant cuts to our coal production, coal jobs, and coal use. 
According to the EPA’s own calcula-
tions, the final rule is worse for coal than the proposed rule. Coal’s share of electric generation will go to 27 per-cent by 2030 under this rule—as com-pared to 39 percent, which we currently have or did have in 2014. 
If this misguided final rule is ever 
implemented, pain will be felt by all Americans with fewer job opportuni-
ties, higher power bills, and less reli-able electricity. Studies of the pro-posed rule projected that the Clean Power Plan will increase electricity prices in a State like mine 12 to 16 per-cent. 
What does this mean for American 
jobs? A recent study by the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association found that a 10 percent increase in electricity prices can mean as much as 1.2 million jobs lost. Roughly one-half million of these job losses will be in rural communities like those in West Virginia. Put simply, affordable energy matters. It especially matters to those who the administration incorrectly says will benefit the most from this rule, which is the low and moderate in-come. 
More than half of West Virginia’s 
households take home an average of less than $1,900 per month and already spend 17 percent of their income on en-ergy. These families are especially vul-nerable to the administration’s clean power grab. While States are given ad-ditional time to comply under the final rule, it does not change the fact that the EPA is picking winners and losers in the energy economy. The losers will be the American families who rely on affordable and reliable energy. We can and we should innovate for the future but not with a sledgehammer bearing down on us. Thankfully there are sev-eral legislative options that Congress can pursue to challenge this rule. 
Tomorrow the EPW Committee will 
be taking up my legislation—the ARENA Act. Let me explain that brief-ly. This bipartisan legislation would empower States to protect families and businesses from electric rate increases, reduced electric reliability, and other harmful effects. It will force the EPA to reconsider this misguided rule-making. 
The ARENA Act holds the EPA ac-
countable by requiring the agency to issue State-specific model plans dem-onstrating how each State will meet the required reductions. It gives States the ability to opt out if the plan hinders economic growth. 
For existing powerplants, the 
ARENA Act delays implementation of the Clean Power Plan until the courts determine the legality of the rule. Re-cently, the Supreme Court ruled that EPA had unlawfully failed to consider costs when formulating its MATS regu-lation. Because the rule went forward while it was still being litigated, mil-lions of dollars were spent to comply with a rule that was ultimately deemed illegal. States should not be forced to proceed until the legality of the rule has been determined. I hope that many States will follow Leader M
CCONNELL ’s 
suggestion and delay implementation of this rule until the legal process is completed. 
Mr. President of the United States, 
your clean power grab will devastate already hurting communities in my State. It will cause economic pain for working families across the country. It 
will forever harm our energy land-scape. 
The proposed rule was bad. The final 
rule announced yesterday is even worse, doubling down on the destruc-tion of our economy. There is no ques-tion that we must take steps to protect our environment, but it simply cannot be at the expense of our families. 
We can do better. Let Congress, the 
elected representatives, make these de-cisions. That is the way it should be. I ask my colleagues to join me by sup-porting the ARENA Act and sending these overreaching EPA regulations back to the drawing board.

ator from Oregon. 
WILDFIRES IN THE WEST  
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as the 
Senate prepares for the month of Au-gust in our home States, I want to dis-cuss tonight what I believe to be an ur-gent issue: The West is on fire. There is a really serious prospect that my part of the country is going to get hit by what I call the terrible trifecta— drought, high temperatures, and enor-mous fuel load on the forest floor. When you couple that with a lightning strike—which is not exactly a rarity in my part of the world—all of a sudden you can have on your hands an inferno. The fires are getting bigger, they are lasting longer, and they are doing more damage. 
Senators here on both sides of the 
aisle—Democrats and Republicans— have come to realize that our system for fighting fire is a broken, dysfunc-tional mess. What happens is, histori-cally, prevention gets short shrift. The agencies can’t do enough thinning; they can’t do enough of the preventive work to reduce the fuel load on the for-est floor. Then you have one of those lightning strikes, and all of a sudden there is a huge fire because the fuel buildup is so great on the forest floor. 
The agencies then run out of money 
putting these fires out because they are getting bigger, and they are lasting longer. The problem just keeps getting worse because the agencies then have to rob the prevention fund in order to fight these big fires. In other words, the agencies borrow from the preven-tion fund, and the problem gets worse because by shorting the prevention fund it creates the prospect of still more big fires in the future. 
With the West burning, the Western 
Governor’s Association—a bipartisan group—put out a new update of how big the recent fires are. So far in 2015, nearly 6 million acres have burned. That is an area bigger than the State of New Jersey, scorched in massive fires. 
In my home State, a wildfire in 
Douglas County in southern Oregon has spread to over 16,000 acres, with 1,400 crew members battling a blaze that is threatening more than 300 homes. Ac-cording to recent reports, 20,000 acres were scorched by one single fire in northern California in a matter of only

5 hours. That is 20,000 acres—nearly the 
size of the entire city of Bend, OR— that burned in the time span of an extra-inning baseball game. 
With the Forest Service budget effec-
tively flatlined and the higher cost of fighting fires producing this robbing of other programs that I have described— the fire borrowing—what you have is a vicious, self-defeating circle of fire-fighting and shoddy budgeting, which, in effect, will cause an even bigger cri-sis in the future because you shorted the prevention fund. In 10 years, if this isn’t fixed—what is known as fire bor-rowing—the Forest Service says it will be spending two-thirds of its entire budget on suppressing wildfires, and my constituents say they will be call-ing the Forest Service the Fire Service because that is essentially what they will be. 
This is particularly serious right 
now, which is why I came to the floor tonight to try to drive home the ur-gency of this issue, because it is so dry in the West. This year Governor Brown of my home State has declared drought emergencies in 23 of our 36 counties. All 36 counties are experiencing severe drought, according to the National Drought Center. It is a very dangerous mix of factors, what I have come to call the terrible trifecta of drought and temperatures and fuel load. They all came together and turned the West into a virtual tinderbox. 
To try to fix this, my colleague Sen-
ator C
RAPO and I have worked together 
for quite some time to in effect say that what we ought to do is break this dysfunctional system of fighting fires and go with a different approach. What we would say is that the biggest fires— the 1 or 2 percent of the megafires—we ought to fight them from the disaster fund because they really are disasters. Use the prevention fund for what it is intended, which is prevention, so we can keep from having those megafires. 
The good news is that the Congres-
sional Budget Office—my colleague is new here, but he already knows that the Congressional Budget Office is our official scorekeeper—says that there really aren’t added costs for this ap-proach because while you would spend a bit more money trying to put out those megafires, you would save some money by not cheating the prevention fund and not having so many fires in the first place. 
In effect, it is a lot smarter for the 
agencies to focus on keeping our for-ests healthy and clear of the fuels that go up in flames when lightning strikes. So we do the preventive work and we no longer are shorting it by all the fire borrowing which I have just described. 
Senator C
RAPO and I have been able 
to get well over 250 organizations to go on record in support of our idea. These are groups associated with forestry pol-icy, environmental folks, industry per-sonnel, people across the political spec-trum. More than 250 groups have said they are in support of this. The Under Secretary of Agriculture, Robert Bonnie, noted in a recent letter that 
the proposal Senator C
RAPO and I have 
offered is one that both fixes fire bor-rowing and provides the resources needed to prevent these catastrophic wildfires down the line. Fifteen of our colleagues here in the Senate have sup-ported the bill, and 123 Members in the other body have also supported the bill. The administration is on board. The agencies that battle these fires are waiting for the Congress to act. 
Each day, the reality in the West is 
that immensely brave men and women are on the ground fighting fires, and they risk their lives to keep our homes and communities protected. It is long, long, long past time for the Congress to step up, fix this budgetary mess, and guarantee that the funding is there to fight fires and to prevent them in the first place. 
I filed our bipartisan bill as an 
amendment to the Transportation bill. I filed a wildfire amendment to the budget resolution. I filed the Senate In-terior appropriations wildfire language 
as an amendment to the Transpor-tation bill. And I believe this is the fourth time in recent months I have been on the floor talking about this issue, and that is in addition to talking about it in the budget markup and in several hearings in the natural re-sources committee that I had the honor to chair in the last Congress. 
I see my new colleague in the chair, 
and he has been doing good work on this fire borrowing issue. And even with everything else we are dealing with here in the Senate, I think it is very important that we focus on an ac-tual way to leave with an agreement on how this is actually going to get fixed and get done. In that regard, I have been talking in the last day or so with colleagues in both political par-ties, and I think there is now this sense of urgency because we see it not only on TV, but every time we are home, we go to fire briefings. As the Presiding Officer knows, even fire briefings have changed very dramatically. We used to have a fire briefing in July, and now we have fire briefings—as I did—in the winter because the Forest Service and the folks at BLM often say they are not even sure when one fire season has ended and the next one has begun be-cause these challenges have gotten so great. 
Senator C
RAPO and I, with this bill 
that has gotten more than 250 organi-zations sponsoring it, have talked in just the last few hours. We want to work with all of our colleagues to make sure that we get some sense be-cause our constituents are going to ask about this. They are going to ask about this issue this summer. They are going to ask: How is the Senate actually going to get this done? How is the Sen-ate going to fix this broken, dysfunc-tional system of fighting fires? In ef-fect, year after year—and I gather there will be some new analyses com-ing out—the entire budget for the For-est Service is getting eaten up in fight-ing these counterproductive fires. Senator C
RAPO and I have a proposal 
that received a favorable score from the Budget Committee. I know my col-league in the chair has also done very good work on these issues, as have a number of Senators on both sides of the aisle. Given the good will I have seen among Senators here in the last couple of days as we talked about what this really means, given the urgency and because we are going home and seeing constituents in August, I am convinced we can have an agreement on how this is going to get fixed. That is why I wanted to come to the floor tonight, because there are a lot of top-ics that are still going to be tackled in the next few days before the Senate wraps up. I want it understood that our part of the country is on fire. It is on fire. We have communities burning up, and business as usual is unacceptable. 
Senator C
RAPO and I have offered a 
proposal that we think will turn this around, and other colleagues have very good ideas as well. What is nonnego-tiable is just saying: Oh, you know, maybe we will take care of it at the end of the year or on standard congres-sional time. That is not good enough for the West, which is burning up. 
I invite my colleagues here, as we 
move forward in the last few days be-fore the August recess, to join me, Sen-ator C
RAPO , and colleagues in both po-
litical parties to make sure that people see—as we go home to talk to the peo-ple we have the honor to represent— that this is now going to actually get fixed and that the Senate is coming to-gether to make sure it actually gets done. We are going to turn this around so that we can do more to prevent fires in the rural west, No. 1, and No. 2, fight them in a more cost-effective way. 
With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

forefront of advocating for the inter-
ests of retired Nevadans for more than a decade. Scotty Watts, who was the founding president of NARA, led the organization and played a critical role in its progress and success. Under his steadfast leadership, Scotty helped NARA build a powerful grassroots net-work to support the economic and health programs that are important to 
retirees throughout Nevada. Today, NARA has grown to include more than 19,330 members and 28 chapters, mak-ing it the largest progressive senior citizen organization in the Silver State. 
Prior to becoming the president of 
NARA, Scotty was a leading advocate for retirees and seniors in the Silver State. He served two terms as the president of the Nevada National Coun-cil of Senior Citizens. Through his leadership positions in these organiza-tions, he led the effort in our State to protect and strengthen the benefits seniors have earned under Social Secu-rity and Medicare and has been a fierce advocate for the Affordable Care Act. I am pleased that this month NARA will honor Scotty during the organization’s State convention for his career in dedi-cated service and advocacy. 
I have had the pleasure of meeting 
with Scotty, and I can say without res-ervation that Nevada’s retirees were fortunate to have him in their corner, fighting on their behalf. I commend Scotty for his service to the Silver State, and I wish him the best in his retirement and future endeavors.

traveled to the Dominican Republic and Haiti and am familiar with the his-tory of racial tensions between the population of Haitian migrants and Dominicans of Haitian descent and other citizens of the Dominican Repub-lic. These problems are by no means unique to these two neighboring coun-tries, nor are there easy solutions. In addition to race there is competition for land, social services, and jobs. But while this situation should not be over-simplified, the way the Dominican Government is dealing with it is unfor-tunate. 
In a September 2013 Dominican Con-
stitutional Court ruling the citizenship of more than 200,000 people—mostly Dominicans of Haitian descent—was summarily revoked, and they lost ac-cess to education, health care, and other essential social services, as well as their basic rights. Since that ruling the Dominican Government has threat-ened to enforce strict and prejudicial immigration laws. Many affected resi-dents live under constant fear of depor-tation, and according to the United Na-tions nearly 20,000 have already fled the country in the past month, putting the island on the brink of a mass ref-ugee crisis. 
By threatening to deport Haitian mi-
grants and Dominicans of Haitian de-scent, the Dominican Government is on 
a path that not only disregards funda-mental principles of international hu-manitarian law, but may provoke a re-action that makes the situation worse. Even as we are already seeing the con-sequences of the threat of mass depor-tations, following through with such a policy would likely greatly exacerbate tensions in the Dominican Republic and create a regional diplomatic and humanitarian crisis. Haiti, impover-ished and still recovering from the dev-astating 2010 earthquake, does not have the capacity to handle the sudden ar-rival of thousands of homeless, jobless, Dominicans. 
The United States, with 319 million 
people spread across 50 States is among the most ethnically and racially di-verse countries in the world. The chal-lenges this has posed for our own de-mocracy over the past two centuries are well known. We have not always handled these challenges as we should have. I hope the Dominican Govern-ment will learn from our experience and recognize the need to reverse course and reaffirm the legal status and rights of these people.

NOMINATION OBJECTION 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I in-
tend to object to any unanimous con-sent request at the present time relat-ing to the nomination of David Mal-colm Robinson to be Assistant Sec-retary for Conflict and Stabilization Operations and Coordinator for Recon-struction and Stabilization. 
I will object because the State De-
partment has engaged in unreasonable delay in responding to Judiciary Com-mittee investigations and inquiries. Since June of 2013, the Judiciary Com-mittee has requested a number of docu-ments related to an investigation into Ms. Huma Abedin regarding her pos-sible conflicts of interest created by her simultaneous employment with the State Department and private sector entities. In addition, the Judiciary Committee has inquired about former Secretary Clinton and Ms. Abedin’s questionable email practices that may be in violation of Department policy and Federal law. Furthermore, the committee’s inquiry also centers on the possible interference of Freedom of Information Act requests by State De-partment personnel, including Sec-retary Clinton’s former Chief of Staff, Ms. Cheryl Mills. To this day, the com-mittee has not received a complete re-sponse. Moreover, the committee re-cently acquired information that shows the State Department has been in pos-session of material that would answer some of the Committee’s inquiries. Yet, the requested material is still not forthcoming. 
This willful lack of cooperation is 
made more evident by the example of repeated failures by State Department personnel to respond to emails or re-spond days or weeks later. And in yet another recent committee investiga-tion beginning in June 2015, the State 
Department has still failed to provide any communication, via email or a phone call, to acknowledge or confirm that they have received a committee letter, despite three emails sent by committee staff. 
Not only has the Judiciary Com-
mittee experienced unacceptable delays in receiving information, other entities inside and outside of the gov-ernment have experienced delays as 
well. The Associated Press sued the State Department over the failure to satisfy repeated document requests under the Freedom of Information Act related to these same issues. One of these requests dates back 5 years ago. Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. Dis-trict Court for the District of Colum-bia, the judge responsible for this case, chided the State Department for its failure to produce documents on time, ‘‘Now, any person should be able to re-view that in one day—one day. Even the least ambitious bureaucrat could do this.’’ 
In total, these actions illustrate a 
pattern of conduct that clearly dem-onstrates a lack of cooperation and bad faith in its interaction with Congress. This is unacceptable and cannot con-tinue. 
In order to maintain the proper bal-
ance of separation of powers and in order for Congress to exercise its prop-er oversight function, government agencies must respond to inquiries. The State Department apparently be-lieves that it can simply ignore Con-gress. It is important to note that my objection is not intended to question Mr. Robinson’s credentials in any way. However, withholding consent to sus-pend Senate rules on nominations is one tool a Senator has to incentivize executive agencies to respond to con-gressional inquiries. Frankly, this should not be necessary, and the nomi-nee is an innocent victim of the State Department’s contemptuous failures to respond to congressional inquiries. I urge the State Department to change its ways and if they choose not to, I will be forced to escalate the scope of my intent to object to include unani-mous consent requests relating to For-eign Service officer candidates as well.

TRIBUTE TO GENERAL RAYMOND 
T. ODIERNO, 38TH CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE ARMY 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, on be-
half of myself and my cochair of the Army Caucus, the senior Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. R
EED, I rise today to 
honor GEN Raymond T. Odierno, the 38th Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, and one of our Nation’s finest military officers. General Odierno will retire from Active military duty in August 2015, bringing to a close 39 years of dis-tinguished service to our great Nation. 
In 1976, General Odierno was commis-
sioned as a second lieutenant in the Field Artillery upon graduation from the United States Military Academy at West Point. He commanded units at

every echelon, from platoon to theater, 
with duty in Germany, Albania, Ku-wait, Iraq, and the United States. Gen-eral Odierno deployed in support of Op-erations Desert Shield and Desert Storm; commanded the 4th Infantry Division during Operation Iraqi Free-dom from April 2003 to March 2004; served as the commanding general, Multi-National Corps—Iraq, III Corps, from 2006 to 2008; and later served as the commanding general, Multi-Na-tional Force—Iraq and subsequently United States Forces—Iraq, from 2008 until 2010. General Odierno went on to serve as the commander of U.S. Joint Forces Command from 2010 to 2011, 
where he led the development and inte-gration of joint capabilities in support of combatant command requirements around the world., 
On September 7, 2011, General 
Odierno became the 38th Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army. Since assuming this position, General Odierno’s leadership and commitment to his soldiers, to the Army, and to the Nation have signifi-cantly contributed to the U.S. Army being the most highly trained and pro-fessional land force in the world. 
General Odierno developed and im-
plemented the U.S. Army’s vision es-tablishing a path for the Army of 2025 and beyond. He envisioned how future Army forces would prevent conflict, shape security environments, and win wars. He ensured that we possessed the capability and capacity to provide globally responsive and regionally aligned forces, as well as expeditionary and decisive land-power across the range of military operations in defense of our Nation at home and abroad, both today and against emerging threats. 
But the one thing that remained con-
stant was General Odierno’s tireless commitment to soldiers and their fam-ilies. He built leaders capable of navi-gating the complex challenges of the world we face today and cared for our families by focusing on keeping the total Army—soldiers, families, and ci-vilians alike—healthy, ready, resilient, and total Army strong. General Odierno is an exceptional leader, an American patriot committed to our Army and Nation, but most impor-tantly, General Odierno is a great man of character. It is for GEN Ray Odierno, a soldier, leader, and selfless servant, whom we with profound admi-ration and deep respect pay tribute to for all he has done for the U.S. Army and our Nation. We thank General Odierno, his wife Linda, and his three children, Tony, Katie, and Mike, for their dedication and sacrifice, and we wish them well in the years to come.

RECOGNIZING LARRY AND MARGO 
BEAN 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, on 
September 1, 2015, the Boys & Girls Club of Central Wyoming will be hold-ing their Annual Awards and Recogni-tion Breakfast where they will honor Casper philanthropists, Larry and Margo Bean. The Boys & Girls Club of Central Wy-
oming has been making positive dif-ferences in the lives of our children since 1978. The club provides a sup-portive environment and an extensive array of programs and services to en-hance the development of our youth. Through entertaining activities and with the guidance of volunteer men-
tors, participants learn the important values of independence, community, and belonging. Every year, the Boys & Girls Club plans a breakfast to honor a member or members of the community who make outstanding contributions to both the Boys & Girls Club and the city of Casper. This year’s honorees, Larry and Margo Bean, are incredible champions in the Casper community and worthy of this special recognition. 
Growing up on farms in Iowa, Larry 
and Margo moved to Casper as young adults with a desire to help, encourage, and bring joy to those who crossed their paths, particularly children. Any-one who knows the couple knows that the care and support they show for each other equals their passion for phi-lanthropy and civic engagement. Next year, the couple will celebrate their 50th anniversary. They will celebrate this milestone occasion with their chil-dren Joshua, Amber, Nathan, and Ni-cole, and grandchildren Ella, Xavier, Mia, Mars, Sullivan, Cassius, and Vin-cent—who will be born next month. 
As a couple, they are a powerhouse, 
yet they have significant individual ac-complishments. As an author of four children’s books, Margo’s inspiration to write stories for children came from her father, Max Cronbaugh. Her father was an amazing storyteller who never failed to capture the imagination of children and the excitement of every-day life on the farm. With her experi-ence as an elementary school teacher and growing up on her family’s Iowa farm, Margo’s books reflect her unique experience and the special place chil-dren have always held in her heart. Her continued dedication to educating chil-dren in Wyoming is shown by leader-ship efforts at the St. Anthony Tri- Parish Catholic School, where some of their grandchildren attend school. Ad-ditionally, Margo was chairman of the Wyoming Medical Center board of di-rectors and ran a successful business. 
Larry is a certified public accountant 
and he provides valuable guidance and financial advice. In addition, Larry serves on the board of directors for sev-eral important organizations including the Martin Family Foundation, the Converse County Bank, and the Central Wyoming Counseling Center. As so many folks in Wyoming know, Larry is the ultimate letterwriter. His letters are individual masterpieces. In every letter from Larry, you see his smile and feel his friendship. Larry freely gives encouragement and inspiration— one letter at a time. Over the years, Bobbi and I have looked forward to the Bean’s annual Christmas letter. 
Together, Larry and Margo have 
touched the lives of thousands of chil-dren and families in Wyoming through 
their philanthropic and volunteer work. At Christmastime, their ‘‘Love in Action’’ project collects presents for families in need. They sponsor and co-ordinate youth events in the commu-nity including The American Dream Essay contest, The Uprising, and the Global Leadership Summit. The Beans also support youth faith-based organi-zations such as Child Evangelism Fel-lowship and Youth for Christ. They also have been strong supporters of the Nicolaysen Discovery Center and the Central Wyoming Rescue Mission. 
Their kindness and generosity ex-
pands across the globe. Larry and Margo are diligently working to de-velop faith-based schools in Zambia and Haiti. These neighborhood schools will bring hope and opportunities to these children as well as to these com-munities. 
My wife, Bobbi, joins me in extending 
our congratulations to Larry and Margo Bean and thanking them for their dedication to Wyoming and its youth. All of us privileged to know them are blessed.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY WOM-
EN’S TENNIS TEAM NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP 
∑Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, as 
a fellow Commodore, I would like to congratulate the Vanderbilt University women’s tennis team on winning the NCAA championship, the first national championship for the women’s tennis program, and the third in Commodore history. 
Geoff Macdonald, the head coach of 
this program for 21 years, has done a phenomenal job of training and guiding these exceptional student-athletes. He has worked hard to transform the Vanderbilt’s women’s tennis program into the best in the country. 
Vanderbilt is a very special univer-
sity, one that produces student-ath-letes of exceptional character and in-tegrity, who have pride in themselves and their school. This may be the first national championship for Vanderbilt’s women’s tennis team, but their com-mitment to these ideals ensures that this success will not be the last. 
This achievement would not have 
been possible without the hard work, talent, and teamwork of the following outstanding student-athletes: Payton Robinette, Margaret Leavell, Ellie Yates, Georgina Sellyn, Ashleigh Antal, Marie Casares, Courtney Colton, Frances Altick, Astra Sharma, and Sydney Campbell. 
Of course, these student-athletes 
were trained and mentored by a dedi-cated team of coaches and staff led by Coach Macdonald. They are: Emil Iankov, Christy Hogan, Kerry Wilbar, Lori Alexander, Aleke Tsoubanos, and Catherine Hilley.

CONCORD, NEW HAMPSHIRE 250TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
∑Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I rise 
today in honor of Concord, NH—a city in Merrimack County that is cele-brating the 250th anniversary of its founding. I am proud to join the citi-zens across the Granite State in recog-nizing this special occasion. 
Concord, settled in 1725 by colonists 
from Massachusetts, was incorporated in 1733 as the town of Rumford, and later the parish of Concord where it ex-perienced several border disputes with the neighboring town of Bow. The par-ish of Bow officially became part of Concord in 1765. 
Concord includes the villages of 
Penacook, East Concord, and West Concord. The city’s population has grown to over 40,000 residents with over 6,000 acres of protected land. Concord residents have access to numerous hik-ing and biking trails, and the town’s location on the Merrimack River sig-nificantly adds to its natural beauty. 
In 1808, Concord was established as 
the State capital of New Hampshire. The statehouse is the oldest legislative building in the Nation still in use by the State’s house and senate. The house chamber is also home to the largest State legislative body in the country. 
Concord has produced many innova-
tive businesses, including the Abbot- Downing Company that designed and built the world-famous Concord Coach in 1827, revolutionizing travel through-out the world. 
Today, Concord is a civic, cultural, 
business, and medical hub for the Gran-ite State. It is where New Hampshire’s lone U.S. President, Franklin Pierce had an office, and it is the location of his final resting place. Concord is also home to the McAuliffe-Shepard Dis-covery Center, named after Christa McAuliffe, a Concord educator who bravely volunteered to become the first teacher in space aboard the fatal Chal-lenger space shuttle mission in 1986, and New Hampshire astronaut Alan Shepard. Today, new generations can visit the planetarium to learn about our universe. On Concord’s thriving Main Street, residents and visitors can find an outstanding collection of New Hampshire small businesses that rep-resent the heart of the city. Downtown Concord is full of history and culture— including the Museum of New Hamp-shire History, the Capital Center for the Arts, and the Red River Theater. 
The spirit of community and vol-
unteerism is strong in Concord as evi-denced by the hard work and dedica-tion of all involved with the planning and celebration of this special sestercentennial anniversary. 
Concord, as our State’s capital, has 
greatly contributed to the life and spir-it of New Hampshire. I am pleased to extend my warm regards to the people of Concord as they celebrate the city’s 250th anniversary. ∑ PITTSBURG, NEW HAMPSHIRE 
175TH ANNIVERSARY 
∑Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I 
wish to pay tribute to Pittsburg, NH— a town in Coos County that is cele-brating the 175th anniversary of its founding. I am proud to join citizens across the Granite State in recognizing this historic occasion. 
Pittsburg is nestled deep within New 
Hampshire’s Great North Woods and sits in the shadows of Stub Hill and Magalloway Mountain. It is the largest town by area in the State, and contains all four Connecticut Lakes. Pittsburg is the only town that shares a border with both Maine and Vermont, and contains the only portion of New Hampshire west of the Connecticut River. Pittsburg holds the only New Hampshire crossing into Canada, shar-ing an international border with the Province of Que ´bec. 
The area known as Pittsburg was set-
tled in the early part of the 19th cen-tury, but an unclear boundary line be-tween the United States and Canada al-lowed for the formation of a region known as the Republic of Indian Stream. Shortly thereafter, the town was incorporated in 1840 and named for English Prime Minister William Pitt. 
Pittsburg is home to scenic lakes, 
rivers, streams, and forestland, and has become the perfect venue for all rec-reational outdoor activities. Thousands of off-highway recreational vehicle en-thusiasts visit each season to enjoy the hundreds of miles of snowmobile and ATV trails that have earned Pittsburg the title, ‘‘snowmobile capital of New England.’’ 
On behalf of all Granite Staters, I am 
pleased to offer my congratulations to the residents of Pittsburg on reaching this special milestone, and I thank them for their many contributions to the life and spirit of the State of New Hampshire. ∑

REMEMBERING LOIS HORVITZ 
∑Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in honoring the life of Lois Horvitz, a beloved mother, grandmother, public health advocate, and extraordinary philanthropist who passed away on July 23, 2015. She was 88 years old. 
Lois Horvitz was born April 22, 1927 
in Cleveland, OH. She attended the University of Wisconsin before marrying Harry R. Horvitz, a World War II naval officer and newspaper pub-lisher. 
In 1962, Lois met Dr. Claude S. Beck, 
a renowned cardiac surgeon and pio-neer of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the lifesaving technique more com-monly known as CPR. Inspired by his work, Lois became an early advocate of CPR training, championing a wide spread public awareness campaign and establishing the Resuscitators of America to teach CPR classes. 
Lois’ efforts to promote CPR aware-
ness sparked her lifelong passion for philanthropy, inspiring her to dedicate 
her time and resources to improving lives in her community and country. In addition to serving on the boards of the Eisenhower Medical Center and the Betty Ford Center, Lois established the Harry R. Horvitz Center for Palliative Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic in honor of her late husband of 44 years. An active member of her Indian Wells community, Lois created the Desert Town Hall in 1993, which became an an-nual speaker series featuring world leaders. 
I send my deepest condolences to 
Lois’ children, Michael, Pam, and Peter, and their families. Lois’ legacy of commitment and compassion will continue to inspire others for years to come. ∑

REMEMBERING SERGEANT SCOTT 
LUNGER 
∑Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I 
ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to Sergeant Scott Lunger, an exceptional law enforcement officer, loyal friend, and beloved father who was tragically killed in the line of duty on July 22, 2015. 
Scott Lunger was born on March 13, 
1967 and grew up in Dublin, CA, where he played baseball and football at Dub-lin High School. After graduation, Scott followed his father and older brother’s footsteps and entered the electrical trade, becoming a member of IBEW Local 595. However, a lifelong in-terest in law enforcement prompted Scott to switch career paths, and he began working as a Contra Costa Coun-ty sheriff’s deputy before transferring to the Hayward Police Department in 2001. 
During his 15-year career with the de-
partment, Sergeant Lunger was as-signed to some of the most critical units, including the gang task force, SWAT team, and the special duty unit. Sergeant Lunger also worked as a field training officer and became the head of the field training unit, allowing him to mentor dozens of young officers on the force. Sergeant Lunger’s colleagues re-called admiringly his ability to encour-age his fellow officers to give their best effort, always leading by example. 
Sergeant Lunger dedicated his life to 
his family, his community, and his country. On behalf of the people of California, whom he served so bravely, I extend my gratitude and deepest sym-pathies to his daughters, Ashton and Saralyn; father, Paul; brothers, Mike and Todd; sisters, Michelle and Ciara; nieces and nephews; and entire ex-tended family. His dedicated and cou-
rageous service will never be for-gotten. ∑

Born in 1943, Joey grew up on his 
family’s historic B Ranch in Point Reyes National Seashore, which had 
been purchased by his grandfather in 1919. After attending college at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, Joey returned to Marin County to work in the family business, becoming a third-generation dairyman. 
I first met Joey during my time as a 
Marin County supervisor, and although we did not see eye to eye on every issue, Joey was always willing to work together to try to forge consensus. He never let political differences get in the way of personal relationships, and over the years we formed an unwaver-ing friendship. 
A well-respected and beloved member 
of the Marin community, Joey gave generously of his time and energy to numerous organizations throughout his career, including the Western United Dairymen and the Marin County Farm Bureau. A lifelong farming advocate, Joey worked tirelessly to preserve California’s North Bay agricultural heritage. It is a testament to his life-long passion that his children decided to follow in their father’s footsteps by operating their own ranches, with Joey’s son maintaining the family’s op-eration at B Ranch nearly 100 years after his great-grandfather worked the land. Joey and his family’s legacy will help ensure that ranching and dairy op-erations will be part of the fabric of the Marin community for generations to come. 
With his warm and welcoming na-
ture, Joey remained a leading voice for the ranching community until his final days. I send my deepest condolences to Joey’s wife Linda, his son Jarrod, his daughter Jolynn, his brother Jim, and his grandchildren, Collin, Luke, and Layla, along with his entire extended family. ∑

REMEMBERING OFFICER DAVID 
JOSEPH NELSON 
∑Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in honoring the life of Bakersfield Police Officer David Joseph Nelson, a beloved son, brother, and grandson who was tragically killed in the line of duty on June 26, 2015. 
David Nelson was born on November 
16, 1988 in Burbank, CA. He graduated with top honors from Burbank High School in 2007, where he was a member of the Associated Student Body and the varsity swim and water polo teams. Of-ficer Nelson attended Occidental Col-lege, earning a bachelor’s degree in ec-onomics with a minor in public policy. He was also a member of Occidental’s water polo and basketball teams. 
As a college student, Officer Nelson 
interned with the U.S. Department of the Treasury and was offered a position upon graduation. However, he chose to remain in California to follow his life-long dream of pursuing a career in law enforcement. In 2008, he joined the Bur-bank Police Department as a police cadet and became an officer with the Bakersfield Police Department in 2013. At a memorial service on July 1, 2015, 
Bakersfield Police Sergeant Uriel Pacheco recalled that Officer Nelson was a ‘‘dedicated, trustworthy, coura-geous and respectful’’ member of the department. Others remembered David Nelson as a talented athlete with a great sense of humor and a strong de-sire to help those less fortunate. 
On behalf of the people of California, 
whom Officer Nelson served so bravely, I extend my deepest sympathy to his parents Larry and Mary, brothers Erik and Michael, grandmothers Elsie Nel-son and Josephine Gutierrez, and many uncles, aunts, cousins and friends. 
We are forever indebted to Officer 
David Joseph Nelson for his courage and sacrifice, and he will be deeply missed. ∑

CONGRATULATING LIEUTENANT 
GENERAL BRUCE A. LITCHFIELD 
∑Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today on 
behalf of Senator L ANKFORD and my-
self, we are pleased to congratulate Lt. Gen. Bruce A. Litchfield upon the com-pletion of his career of service in the U.S. Air Force. Throughout his 34-year military career, Lieutenant General Litchfield served with distinction and dedication, ultimately becoming the commander of the Air Force Sustainment Center at Tinker Air Force Base, OK, responsible for pro-viding operational planning and execu-tion of Air Force Supply Chain Man-agement and Depot Maintenance for a wide range of aircraft, engines, mis-siles, and component items in support of Air Force Materiel Command mis-sions. From his command in Okla-homa, he was responsible for oper-ations which spanned 3 air logistics complexes, 3 air base wings, 2 supply chain management wings, and multiple remote operating locations, incor-porating more than 32,000 military and civilian personnel. Finally, he oversaw installation support to more than 75,000 personnel working in 140 asso-ciate units at the 3 sustainment center bases. 
In July 2012, General Litchfield be-
came the first commander of the newly established Air Force Sustainment Center in Oklahoma. During his com-mand, he returned over $1.5 billion back to the Air Force, and ultimately the taxpayer, through comprehensive initiatives like the AFSC Way and Cost Effective Readiness. 
General Litchfield entered the Air 
Force in 1981 as a distinguished grad-uate from the Reserve Officer Training Corps program at Norwich University in Vermont. During his distinguished career, Lieutenant General Litchfield commanded at the squadron and group levels in addition to commanding two wings, and was the director of logistics, Headquarters Pacific Air Forces, Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii. He spent the last 6 years in the great State of Oklahoma at Tinker Air Force Base as commander of the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center, as well as commander of the Air Force 
Sustainment Center. 
General Litchfield earned military 
awards to include the Defense Service Medal, Legion of Merit with two oak leaf clusters, Defense Meritorious Serv-ice Medal, Meritorious Service Medal with four oak leaf clusters, the Air Force Commendation Medal, and the Air Force Achievement Medal as well as other service awards. 
Under General Litchfield’s command, 
the Air Force Sustainment Center earned two of the prestigious Depart-ment of Defense Maintenance Effec-tiveness Awards, as well as the Out-standing Unit Award. 
General Litchfield led the successful 
reorganization and standup of the Air Force Sustainment Center, placing command and control of depot mainte-nance, supply chain and associate air base wing support under one command chain of command at Tinker Air Force Base, OK. His proactive leadership in-corporated a revolutionary leadership model and governance process that drove rapid culture change and is cur-rently under review by multiple uni-versities as the example of success for government and industry. 
General Litchfield, his wife Linda, 
and children Matthew and Jennifer have made many sacrifices during his Air Force career, and we appreciate their contributions of conscientious service to our country. His family and his fellow airmen can be proud of his service. 
As he departs the Air Force to start 
the next part of his journey, I call upon my colleagues to wish Bruce and his family every success. It is our pleasure to recognize him at the conclusion of a distinguished career of service to the Air Force and to the United States of America. ∑

wake of the recent tragedy in Lafay-ette, I wish to recognize Red Arrow Workshop as Small Business of the Week in memory of co-owner Jillian Johnson, who lost her life in the July 23, 2015, shooting at The Grand 16 Movie Theater in Lafayette, LA. 
Jillian Johnson and her husband 
Jason Brown spent years ‘‘planning, plotting, and scheming’’ before opening Red Arrow Workshop in August 2012. Jillian was well-known for her cre-ativity, kindness, and generosity, which translated directly into the suc-cess of her family-owned small busi-ness. Red Arrow Workshop is a locally owned-and-operated gift, apparel, ac-cessories, and toy shop showcasing a variety of products unavailable any-where else in Acadiana. The shop also showcases the local, specialty t-shirt line Parish Ink—of which Jillian was a creative partner. After 2 successful years in Lafayette, she and Jason ex-panded their thriving business, opening a second shop on Magazine Street in New Orleans, LA. 
Beloved by locals and cited by many 
as an artistic staple in the community, Red Arrow Workshop hosts a thought-fully curated, ever-changing collection of American-made, fair-trade, hand-made, and eco-friendly items—includ-ing products of several talented south Louisiana artists. The shop’s Lou-isiana-themed items are some of their most popular, with artistic representa-tions of the Mississippi River and State silhouettes covering a collection of prints, paintings, stickers, and home goods. Red Arrow also sells a collection of quirky books, fabrics, and paper goods. It is my honor to designate Red 
Arrow Workshop as Small Business of the Week. Small businesses are created by entrepreneurs who not only have love for their companies, but also have love for their community members. Jillian and Jason have contributed to the Lafayette community with their earnest and enthusiastic entrepre-neurial spirit. Together we are all ‘‘La-fayette Strong.’’ ∑

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and were referred or ordered to lie on the table as indicated: 
POM–74. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the General Assembly of the State of Ohio urging the United States Congress to provide an adequate budget for the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commis-sion to establish rules relative to environ-mentally friendly energy; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. 
AMENDED HOUSE CONCURRENT 
RESOLUTION NUMBER 9 
Whereas, Ohio has many finite natural en-
ergy resources; and 
Whereas, World energy demand and usage 
are expected to increase; and 
Whereas, It is vital to the country’s energy 
future to provide abundant base-load power and peaking energy-on-demand power affordably; and 
Whereas, Extending Ohio’s current energy 
boom will rest in creating a long-term en-ergy plan and developing clean and afford-able energy technologies such as liquid core molten salt reactors and small modular reac-tors; and 
Whereas, America possesses a nearly inex-
haustible supply of thorium and uranium (more than a billion years) that dramati-cally exceeds all known potential energy re-serves; and 
Whereas, The elements thorium and ura-
nium have the practical potential to provide unlimited energy resources for Ohioans and Americans on demand in the near future and to provide many other tangible benefits; and 
Whereas, Better utilization of thorium and 
uranium in specially designed reactors such as molten salt reactors, including liquid flu-oride thorium reactors, can provide energy security from other nations by utilizing Ohio coal and a reactor’s nuclear heat energy to produce an abundance of synthetic liquid transportation fuels. These synthetic fuels can be produced for many future generations of Ohioans in a safe, affordable, and in a most environmentally friendly manner; and 
Whereas, The efficient use of thorium or 
uranium in a specially designed molten salt reactor allows for greatly increased environ-mentally friendly energy production that improves the economics of many recycling technologies and raises the standard of liv-ing; and 
Whereas, It is incumbent upon Ohio legis-
lators to be forward-thinking in addressing the future energy challenges for the next generation of Ohioans; and 
Whereas, Ohio is uniquely capable to com-
mercialize small modular reactors, liquid core molten salt reactors, and integral fast reactors with its research and development assets of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Plum Brook (Sandusky, Ohio), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration John H. Glenn Research Cen-
ter (Cleveland, Ohio area), the Wright-Pat-terson Air Force Base (Dayton, Ohio), USEC’s uranium-enrichment facility (Piketon, Ohio), The Ohio State University’s nuclear-research-and-development facilities (Columbus, Ohio), and other private compa-nies and nonprofit organizations that spe-cialize in nuclear-technology development in Ohio; and 
Whereas, The academic, scientific, manu-
facturing, and business communities in Ohio have some of the best talent and research and development records in the world. Devel-opment of this groundbreaking and economic game-changing technology would serve Ohio’s and America’s economy better than current federal efforts to develop this tech-nology in partnership with China; and 
Whereas, Advanced technology using tho-
rium and uranium can affordably provide medical isotopes of materials for medical uses such as treating cancer and HIV/AIDS, diagnostic procedures, and improved health care; and 
Whereas, S.99, the ‘‘American Medical Iso-
topes Production Act of 2011,’’ was signed into law by President Barack Obama on Jan-uary 2, 2013, and mandates a reliable domes-tic supply of molybdenum–99 for medical im-aging and diagnostics; and 
Whereas, Molybdenum-99 is used in more 
than sixteen million medical procedures an-nually in the United States; and 
Whereas, No domestic supply of molyb-
denum–99 currently exists, and present sup-pliers use old reactors that result in frequent supply disruptions; and 
Whereas, The Nuclear Regulatory Commis-
sion, charged with licensing nuclear reac-tors, is not well-funded for establishing pro-cedures for new, advanced reactor designs based on different architectures from today’s fleet of light water reactors; and 
Whereas, Small modular reactors and liq-
uid core molten salt reactors represent a business opportunity that Ohio’s manufac-turing base is well-suited to exploit. This could potentially result in creating forty thousand manufacturing jobs in total within Ohio, because these jobs have the ability to complement Ohio’s coal industry, oil indus-try, and natural gas hydraulic fracturing in-dustry by increasing jobs in those industries: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved , That we, the members of the 131st 
General Assembly of the State of Ohio, make the following recommendation for solutions to energy and medical-isotopes production; and be it further 
Resolved , That the State of Ohio shall cre-
ate a long-term energy plan that addresses the long-term energy needs of the country; and be it further 
Resolved , That the State of Ohio shall en-
courage the research and development of liq-uid-core-molten-salt-reactors and small- modular-reactors technologies as a long- term solution to Ohio’s energy needs; and be it further 
Resolved , That the State of Ohio shall ad-
vocate that the Congress of the United States mandate, and provide an adequate budget for, the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to es-tablish rules for manufacturing, siting, and licensing of small modular reactors and liq-uid core molten salt reactors to be built and operated in the United States by private in-dustry for the production of energy and med-ical isotopes; and be it further 
Resolved , That the State of Ohio shall in-
vest in, seek to acquire grants for, imple-ment programs for, encourage its institu-tions of higher learning to conduct research into, and attract companies for the develop-ment of future technologies that will provide greater energy resources more affordably, abundantly, and in a more environmentally 
friendly manner than is being done at present; and be it further 
Resolved , That the Clerk of the House of 
Representatives transmit duly authenticated copies of this resolution to the President of the United States, the Secretary of the United States Department of Energy, the Commissioners of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Speaker and Clerk of the United States House of Representatives, the President Pro Tempore and Secretary of the United States Senate, each member of the Ohio Congressional delegation, and the news media of Ohio. 
POM–75. A petition by a citizen from the 
State of Texas urging the United States Con-gress to propose an amendment to the United States Constitution relative to estab-lishing a procedure by which the President of the United States could be removed from of-fice by means of a nationwide recall election; to the Committee on the Judiciary.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. 
COATS , Mr. L ANKFORD , and Mr. 
BLUNT ): 
S. 1922. A bill to amend titles II and 
XVI of the Social Security Act to pro-vide for quality reviews of benefit deci-sions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance. 
Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to 
speak once again on the Social Secu-rity Disability Insurance—or DI—Pro-gram. As everyone in this Chamber should know, the DI trust fund is pro-jected to be exhausted next year. That means, absent any change in law, we will be seeing across-the-board benefit cuts of close to 20 percent for DI bene-ficiaries. Over the last several months, I have come to the floor on a handful of occasions to talk about this program and the imminent depreciation of its trust fund. 
I have called on my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to work with me to address these issues. I will repeat that call today. 
In addition, today I have introduced 
three separate bills that are designed to help update and improve the admin-istration of the DI program. As we talk about solutions to address the deple-tion of the DI trust fund, we should also be talking about ways to update the DI program, ways to make it easier for beneficiaries who can and who de-sire to return to work to be able to ex-plore those opportunities and ways to improve efforts to deter and prevent waste and fraud. 
The first bill I introduced today 
would update and expand the Social Se-curity Administration’s tools to deter and punish fraudsters who cheat the system. The second bill would author-ize the Commissioner of SSA to provide denied DI applicants with information about employment support services that are provided by both public agen-cies and private nonprofit organiza-tions.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6298 August 4, 2015 
That information will help denied ap-
plicants find opportunities to reenter the workforce, instead of continually cycling through the DI application process. The third bill would require SSA to review hearing decisions by ad-ministrative law judges to ensure that they are following the law as well as Social Security regulations and policy. All three of these bills are designed to improve the administration of this dis-ability program and make it work bet-ter for beneficiaries and taxpayers. They will not, by themselves, solve all of the program’s fiscal problems, but they will improve the DI system. 
More work will need to go into this 
effort, and as chairman of the com-mittee with jurisdiction over the DI program, I am committed to solving these problems and preventing the massive benefit cuts we will see under current law. I would like to point out three things about my stated approach to dealing with the DI program. 
First, you will note I have not used 
the word ‘‘crisis’’ to describe what is happening with the DI trust fund. Sec-ond, you would be hard-pressed to find any proposal I have submitted that could credibly be characterized as ‘‘slashing’’ DI benefits. Third, nothing I have put forward either today or in the past could conceivably be thought of as ‘‘privatizing’’ disability insur-ance. 
I have to point this out because a 
number of people, including some of my friends on the other side of the aisle, have described the Republican ef-forts to address the DI trust fund de-pletion using some of those very same words. 
These individuals are currently more 
interested in turning this issue and the coming benefit cuts into a political football than in actually solving the problem. My question is, What good will that do for the DI program or its beneficiaries? It is not just the DI pro-gram that has problems. Social Secu-rity, in general, faces a number of sig-nificant fiscal and policy challenges. 
In their most recent report, the So-
cial Security board of trustees, which includes several members of President Obama’s Cabinet, recommended ‘‘that lawmakers address the projected trust fund shortfalls in a timely way in order to phase in necessary changes gradu-ally and give workers and beneficiaries time to adjust to them.’’ 
That says to me the sooner we act to 
put Social Security on a sustainable fiscal path the better it is for Ameri-cans and their security. It clearly does not mean we should ignore the finan-cial problems facing Social Security or kick the can down the road, hoping some future Congress will get its act together and solve the problems. 
Of course, providing financial sus-
tainability to Social Security is easier said than done. There are reasonable disagreements over how best to address Social Security’s fiscal shortfalls, in-cluding different views on payroll tax revenues that fund the program and how quickly promised benefits will 
grow in the future. Yet we should not limit the discussion to taxes and out-lays. 
We also should look at how the pro-
gram can be improved and brought up- to-date. For example, the vocational grids and medical guidelines that SSA uses in the disability program are woe-fully out of date, and much of the ex-isting structure of Social Security’s re-tirement program was developed long ago, when labor markets and work pat-terns were much different than they are today. 
We should be working to address all 
of these challenges, both the fiscal and policy challenges now, instead of put-ting them off for later days. With re-spect to the DI program in particular, I have been working for some time now to obtain input from experts and stake-holders across the spectrum to figure out how we can make the program work better. Joined by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman R
YANand 
Social Security Subcommittee Chair-man J
OHNSON , I have solicited input 
from stakeholders in various venues and continue to welcome ideas or pro-posals from anyone who wants to sub-mit them. 
The bills I have dropped today are 
just the latest in a series of bills I have introduced to help jump-start the dis-cussion of DI reforms. We should not sit idly by and wait for another financ-ing cliff to appear around the end of next year. As the Social Security trustees made clear, the sooner Con-gress acts to address these short-comings, the better. Neither DI bene-ficiaries nor taxpayers benefit from lingering uncertainty about how the impending trust fund depletion will be resolved. 
As I have said many times, I am 
ready and willing to have this con-versation. Sadly, up to now, I have heard nothing in response from the Obama administration and very little from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Anyone familiar with the current state of the DI trust fund would likely acknowledge that we are going to have to reallocate resources into the fund if we are going to prevent the impending benefit cuts from hap-pening next year. 
Most proposals I have seen, including 
those from the President’s budget, in-volve a shuffling of money from Social Security’s retirement fund to the DI trust fund, but even if we have to re-allocate resources to shore up the DI program, we should not delay con-fronting the obvious need for reform. On this point, I will once again quote the most recent report from the Social Security trustees, which says, ‘‘Re-allocation of resources in the absence of substantive relief might serve to delay DI reforms and much-needed cor-rections for Social Security as a whole.’’ 
It is true that as many of my col-
leagues have noted, there have been bi-partisan agreements to reallocate re-sources within Social Security in the 
past. However, in virtually every case, the reallocations were accompanied by substantive policy changes. This time should be no different. The last time we reallocated resources from the re-tirement to the DI trust fund, DI awards were increasing unexpectedly and Congress needed to examine the reasons for this increase before acting to change the way the DI system worked. 
At the time, most people agreed that 
reforms were necessary and that the reallocation would buy the time Con-gress needed to come up with those re-forms, get them enacted, and put the trust fund on sound fiscal footing. That was more than 20 years ago. Sadly, though not surprisingly, Congress did not follow through with the reforms, and we now face another reserve deple-tion in the trust fund. 
Needless to say, doubling down on 
the same strategy, a strategy that has already failed to produce the needed policy changes, is not a prudent course of action. In my view, any resource re-allocation that gets enacted must be accompanied by changes in the DI pro-gram. However, the President does not seem to share this view. The adminis-tration has called for a stand-alone re-allocation of payroll tax receipts away from the retirement and survivor’s trust fund and into the DI trust fund. 
This proposal would, depending on 
the estimate, extend the life of the DI program to the early 2030s, at which point both Social Security trust funds, disability and retirement, will be ex-hausted at the same time, triggering massive benefit cuts for all bene-ficiaries. In fact, there are those who would argue that the Social Security retirement fund is already exhausted and deeply in debt. 
That is their idea of a responsible ap-
proach to a widely acknowledged fiscal problem. Outside of the stand-alone re-allocation scheme, the President’s budget offers precious little in the way of reforms to the DI program or Social Security in general. In other words, the Obama administration’s entire answer to all of Social Security’s many fiscal problems is literally to just let future Congress’s and administrations deal with those problems. 
This, to me, would be the height of 
irresponsibility. While it may not be possible, absent some kind of resource allocation, to keep the DI program’s current promises between now and the end of the year, we can and should take meaningful steps now to improve the program. That is my goal. I hope enough of my colleagues share this goal to make it a reality. 
If we are going to get there, it is 
going to require bipartisan cooperation on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. In other words, we are going to need to see more from the administration than we have seen thus far. It is already Au-gust. Despite my repeated requests to the administration and my friends on the other side of the aisle to engage

with me to work on this issue, I have 
yet to hear a meaningful response. I hope that will change. 
There is no harm in discussing op-
tions. I am willing to discuss any and all options to fix these problems. There is, on the other hand, a great deal of potential harm to DI beneficiaries if we continue to ignore the problem while waiting for a financial cliff to force people’s hands. Once again, I urge my friends on both sides of the aisle to en-gage on this issue now, and do not wait until it is too late to take meaningful action.

This title may be cited as the ‘‘The Law 
Enforcement Access to Data Stored Abroad Act’’.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S6308 August 4, 2015 
SEC. 202. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The Electronic Communications Pri-
vacy Act of 1986 (Public Law 99–508; 100 Stat. 1848) (referred to in this section as ‘‘ECPA’’) was intended to protect the privacy of elec-tronic communications stored with providers of electronic communications services and remote computing services, while balancing the legitimate needs of law enforcement to access records stored by such providers. 
(2) To strike this balance, ECPA author-
ized governmental entities to obtain certain categories of communications data from pro-viders using established, pre-existing forms of process—warrants and subpoenas. It also created a new form of court order, in section 2703(d) of title 18, United States Code, that governmental entities could use to obtain additional types of communications data. 
(3) It has been well established that courts 
in the United States lack the power to issue warrants authorizing extraterritorial searches and seizures, and neither ECPA nor subsequent amendments extended the war-rant power of courts in the United States be-yond the territorial reach of the United States. 
(4) Nevertheless, Congress also recognizes 
the legitimate needs of law enforcement agencies in the United States to obtain, through lawful process, electronic commu-nications relevant to criminal investigations related to United States persons wherever that content may be stored. Therefore, this title authorizes the use of search warrants extraterritorially only where the Govern-ment seeks to obtain the contents of elec-tronic communications belonging to a United States person. 
SEC. 203. SCOPE AND CLARIFICATION OF WAR-
RANT REQUIREMENT. 
(a) I NGENERAL .—Chapter 121 of title 18, 
United States Code, is amended—

graph (3) to read as follows: 
‘‘(3) a provider of remote computing serv-
ice or electronic communication service to the public shall not knowingly divulge to any governmental entity the contents of any communication described in section 2703(a), or any record or other information per-taining to a subscriber or customer of such service.’’;

Subject to subsection (b), a warrant issued pursuant to this subsection may be used to require the disclosure of contents of a wire or electronic communication that are in the provider’s electronic storage within the United States or otherwise stored, held, or maintained within the United States by the provider. 
‘‘(b) W
ARRANT REQUIREMENTS .—A warrant 
issued under subsection (a) may require the disclosure of the contents of a wire or elec-tronic communication, regardless of where such contents may be in electronic storage or otherwise stored, held, or maintained by the provider, if the account-holder whose contents are sought by the warrant is a United States person. A court issuing a war-rant pursuant to this subsection, on a mo-tion made promptly by the service provider, 
shall modify or vacate such warrant if the court finds that the warrant would require the provider of an electronic communica-tions or remote computing service to violate the laws of a foreign country.’’; 
(B) in subsection (d), in the first sentence— (i) by striking ‘‘(b) or’’; (ii) by striking ‘‘the contents of a wire or

(B) in subsection (b), in the matter pre-
ceding paragraph (1), by striking ‘‘under sec-tion 2703(b)(1)’’; and

SEC. lll . SMALL BUSINESS CYBER SECURITY 
OPERATIONS CENTER. 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress finds the fol-
lowing: 
(1) The Federal Government has been hit 
by a barrage of high-profile cyber assaults over the past year, including the attacks on the Office of Personnel Management and the Department of State. 
(2) These attacks exposed the most sen-
sitive personal information of millions of Federal employees and their families. 
(3) The President has instituted emergency 
procedures to immediately deploy so-called indicators, or tell-tale signs of cybercrime operations, into agency anti-malware tools. 
(4) According to the Federal Bureau of In-
vestigation, small business concerns have lost more than $1,000,000,000 during the pe-riod beginning October 2013 and ending June 2015 as a result of cyber corporate account takeover and business email fraud. 
(5) The Federal Government leverages the 
creative genius of small business concerns across the country to accomplish its mis-sions. (6) The Federal Acquisition Regulations 
dictates that a percentage of all Federal Government acquisition be set aside for small business concerns. 
(7) Over 90 percent of small business con-
cerns use the Internet through the course of their activities to conduct business. 
(8) Small business concerns tend to have 
weaker online security and do not have nec-essary funding for high-end encryption tech-nology or staff expertise. 
(9) Industry reports indicate that 30 per-
cent of cyber attacks target small business concerns and of those businesses that are at-tacked, 59 percent have no contingency plan, while according to a First Data report, the average cost for a data breach at a small business concern is $36,000 and rising annu-ally. 
(10) A 2012 Verizon study shows that in 855 
data breaches examined, 71 percent occurred in businesses with fewer than 100 employees. 
(11) Small business concerns are increas-
ingly attacked with data breaches and ransomware, where an attacker encrypts the businesses data until a ransom is paid to the attacker. 
(12) It is imperative that small business 
concerns are provided improved secured guidance to limit negative impacts on the economy of the United States. 
(13) There is a vast cyber threat facing the 
business sector of the United States, which poses a direct threat against the national se-curity of the United States, the Department of Defense, private industry, and critical in-frastructure components. 
(14) The current layer of protection from 
cyber threats does not exist for small busi-ness concerns.

HONORING MARY NELSON ADAMS 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, August 4, 2015 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Ms. Mary Nelson Adams and her many years of dedicated service as a USO volunteer. 
Ms. Adams, 79, of Isle of Hope, has been 
a familiar face to the troops working and serv-ing at Hunter Army Airfield’s Truscott Air Ter-minal. Ms. Adams has been present for every deployment for the last 11 years, and she has either seen off or welcomed back more than 300,000 troops. 
On July 31, 2015, Ms. Adams stood waving 
to the C–17 planes as they left carrying 22 soldiers bound for Iraq off from Hunter Army Airfield. However, this was the last time Ms. Adams would send off troops as a USO volun-teer, as she has decided to step down after many years of service. On this day, a surprise ceremony was held in her honor. Col. Townley Hedrick, the commander at Fort Stewart, pre-sented Ms. Adams with a pin and plaque de-claring her a ‘‘Marne Rock Star.’’ 
Ms. Adams has been the recipient of addi-
tional honors throughout her years of service. In 2006, President George W. Bush gave her a pin to honor her service for soldiers. In 2008, the USO’s World Headquarters named her ‘‘Volunteer of the Year,’’ which she was the first ever to receive that recognition. The president of the USO of Georgia said Ms Adams was ‘‘the epitome’’ of the organiza-tion’s mission. 
Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to honor and 
recognize Ms. Mary Nelson Adams for her pa-triotism and service to over 300,000 soldiers.

HONORING GARY KIEPER OF 
ANTIGO, WI, 2015 ‘‘PAUL BUNYAN SERVICE ABOVE SELF’’ RECIPI-ENT 
HON. SEAN P. DUFFY 
OF WISCONSIN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, August 4, 2015 
Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, it is with great 
pride that I rise today to recognize Mr. Gary Kieper of Antigo, Wisconsin for going above and beyond to serve our community. 
Mr. Kieper has earned the 7th Congres-
sional District’s ‘‘2015 Paul Bunyan Service Above Self Award,’’ which annually recognizes a constituent who takes a ‘‘larger than life’’ ap-proach to serving our community. 
Mr. Kieper is the Vice President of his local 
Habitat for Humanity chapter and has helped raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for the organization. Those who work closely with him say that money has not only allowed them to build six new homes in the community, but has also given them the ability to expand their affiliate and repair existing homes for the resi-
dents. 
Mr. Kieper’s involvement in our community 
reaches beyond Habitat for Humanity. He has taken on a large role with the ‘‘Never Forgot-ten Honor Flight,’’ which serves twelve coun-ties around northern Wisconsin. Additionally, he just recently retired from the Antigo Unified School District after twenty-four years of distin-guished service, including twelve as President. He continues to volunteer with his community fire department and is an active member of Peace Lutheran Church and the FFA. 
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the 7th District of 
Wisconsin and this body, it is my proud honor to recognize Mr. Gary Kieper for his out-standing service to our community.

SARAH STROUD WYNN 
HON. KATHY CASTOR 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, August 4, 2015 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate a true public servant, Sarah Stroud Wynn in honor of her 100th birthday. Her remarkable career in public service has had a tremendous impact on the Tampa Bay community and is worthy of recognition by all. 
Born in Rock Hill, South Carolina, Ms. Wynn 
moved to Florida at a young age. She grad-uated from Florida A&M College and the Uni-versity of South Florida. Her diligent, caring nature and passion for service made Ms. Wynn an effective advocate for education. During her nearly 40 years of public service, Ms. Wynn taught elementary school students as well as served as a junior high school li-brarian. Through her tireless work, she has impacted a countless number of students’ lives. 
Ms. Wynn’s outstanding service did not end 
with her work in education. She used her tre-mendous talent and vision for the good of Florida families by volunteering as a tax pre-parer for those needing assistance. She is also active in church as a supporter of Sunday school, White Robe Choir member, and sec-retary of the Trustee Board. 
Ms. Wynn has always been an engaged 
community leader. She serves as a member of the Greater Tampa Urban League, the Re-tired Teachers Association, and the Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority. Her engagement and tireless work has created a legacy for her fam-ily and the Tampa Bay community at large. 
Ms. Wynn has embodied servant leadership 
throughout her life. The education of the chil-dren of the Tampa Bay community is forever bettered thanks to her everlasting service. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of a grateful Tampa Bay community, I am proud to recognize Sarah Stroud Wynn for her lifelong service to the State of Florida and wish her a happy birth-day.

HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, August 4, 2015 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today along 
with my colleagues Mr. B ECERRA , Mrs. D AVIS, 
Mr. F ARR, Ms. R OYBAL -ALLARD , Mr. R OYCE , 
Ms. S PEIER , Mr. T HOMPSON and Ms. W ATERS  
to recognize our good friend, The Honorable Michael ‘‘Mike’’ Roos, for his outstanding ca-reer, and to congratulate him on the special milestone that is his 70th birthday. 
Mike was born on August 6, 1945, in Mem-
phis, Tennessee. He went on to attend Chris-tian Brothers High School and Tulane Univer-sity in New Orleans before ultimately accept-ing a National Institute of Child Health Fellow-ship at the University of Southern California, where he graduated with a master’s degree in public administration. 
During the late 1970’s Mike began his legis-
lative career, serving in the California State Assembly for over 14 years. In his second leg-islative term, he was chosen as Majority Floor leader by his caucus, and he served in this position for six years until he was elected Speaker Pro Tempore of the California State Assembly. 
Some of Mike’s landmark legislative 
achievements include the passage of the Roberti-Roos Weapons Control Act of 1989, which banned assault weapons, as well as the Mello Roos Community Facilities Act of 1982, which afforded local government an innova-tive, alternate method of financing public facili-ties. In 1985 Mike authored the first and strict-est laws to date that protect the confidentiality of HIV test results, and he also authored the law that established the pioneer Alternative Test Sites Program, where individuals could receive free anonymous testing for the AIDS antibody. 
Following his career in the State Assembly, 
Mike became the founder and Chief-consultant of Mike Roos and Company, a public affairs and management company that specializes in government relations, corporate issues, media relations, and ballot measure campaigns. 
Apart from his successful career as a legis-
lator and political strategist, Mike’s long-standing philanthropic service is also notable. As President and CEO of LEARN—a coalition of civic leaders and representatives—Mike worked to help implement systematic reform and restructuring of the Los Angeles Unified School District. Mike has served as Chairman of the Fraternity of Friends of the Music Cen-ter, the President of the Los Angeles Recre-ation and Parks Commission, and the Cam-paign Director for California Children and Families Initiative—an initiative that would go on to become the successful ballot measure known as Prop 10. 
Because of his experience and contribu-
tions, Mike is often asked to speak about edu-cation reform and his knowledge of California

Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today with my colleagues Representative R
ONKIND, Representative R OBERT J. W ITT-
MAN, and Representative F RANK LOBIONDO to 
recognize Cynthia Martinez upon her appoint-ment as Chief of the National Wildlife Refuge System. Cynthia is a twenty-one-year veteran of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and a dedicated advocate of the agency’s mission to conserve, protect, and enhance wildlife and habitats for the benefit of the American peo-ple. Ms. Martinez is also notably the first woman and first Latina to serve as the Chief of the National Wildlife Refuge System, a tes-tament to her leadership and passion for pro-tecting our nation’s wildlife and most treasured natural habitats. 
Over the past twenty-one years, Ms. Mar-
tinez has been a dedicated public servant within the Fish and Wildlife Service. Her first experience with the Fish and Wildlife Service as a student trainee in the Arizona State Of-fice soon grew into an impressive career that includes managing the Desert National Wildlife Refuge Complex in Nevada and serving as the Deputy Chief of the Refuge System. Her long career of service to the Refuge System demonstrates her devotion to enhancing and protecting the habitats and recreational oppor-tunities that we all enjoy. 
While serving as the Chief of the Refuge 
System Division of Visitor Services and Com-munications, Cynthia developed the Con-serving the Future vision document, which out-lines the agency’s strategic plan for a robust and resilient Refuge System. This forward- thinking vision, predicated on sound, science- based planning and monitoring, illustrates that the future of the Refuge System is bright under Cynthia’s leadership. Ms. Martinez also spearheaded the Urban Wildlife Conservation Program, an initiative to engage and educate residents on the wildlife that share our urban spaces and to connect them with nearby ref-uges to promote stewardship and provide an opportunity to reconnect with nature. 
Mr. Speaker, it is fitting and proper that we 
honor Cynthia Martinez at this time. Her com-mitment and leadership of the National Wildlife Refuge System will ensure that our nation’s pristine wildlife habitats and unparalleled rec-reational opportunities are preserved for years to come. THE LOW ENRICHED URANIUM 
(LEU) FUEL BANK AND KAZAKHSTAN 
HON. ED WHITFIELD 
OF KENTUCKY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, August 4, 2015 
Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Kazakhstan and its commitment to nuclear nonproliferation. As the Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Energy and Power, I recognize the complex-ities of nuclear power and would like to com-mend Kazakhstan for its leadership helping to prevent the spread of nuclear materials and to advance the responsible, peaceful use of ex-isting civilian nuclear energy. 
When it declared independence in 1991, 
Kazakhstan possessed the fourth largest arse-nal of nuclear weapons in the world. By 1993, Kazakhstan had dismantled and secured its entire arsenal and chose to become an inter-national partner in nuclear non-proliferation ef-forts. 
On July 21, 2015, I had the opportunity to 
meet with His Excellency Kairat Umarov, the Ambassador of Kazakhstan. During the meet-ing we discussed Kazakhstan’s ongoing com-mitment to these issues. On August 27th, Kazakhstan will partner with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to establish the world’s first international fuel bank. This un-precedented facility, planned for nearly a dec-ade, will help prevent the spread of nuclear materials and support the appropriate com-mercial use of nuclear energy. The fuel bank, controlled by the IAEA and operated in north-ern Kazakhstan, will maintain a reliable supply of low enriched uranium available to countries if they lose access to fuel supplies for their nu-clear power plants. 
The LEU Bank will provide a secure, guar-
anteed supply of nuclear fuel, paving the way for nations to pursue peaceful nuclear power under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) without the need for their own enrich-ment programs. Given the current global secu-rity environment and the recent focus on Iran’s nuclear program, the establishment of the LEU Bank could also alleviate concerns that a country’s peaceful energy program could be altered to produce weapons grade enriched uranium. As the world continues to explore the potential of nuclear power, we need a solution that removes the threat of enrichment from the peaceful development of nuclear energy. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating Kazakhstan on this im-portant announcement that will empower na-tions to unlock the power of nuclear energy, while eliminating the need for domestic enrich-ment programs that put our safety at risk.

HONORING CLARE WEBER OF HUD-
SON, WI, 2015 YOUTH ‘‘PAUL BUNYAN SERVICE ABOVE SELF’’ RECIPIENT 
HON. SEAN P. DUFFY 
OF WISCONSIN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, August 4, 2015 
Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
stand before you today to recognize Miss Clare Weber of Hudson, Wisconsin for her un-
paralleled dedication to serving our commu-nity. 
Miss Weber is the youth recipient of the 7th 
District’s 2015 ‘‘Paul Bunyan Service Above Self Award,’’ which recognizes a constituent who takes volunteering to new heights. I am proud to honor this young woman for her larg-
er than life dedication to serving our commu-nity. 
At just 17 years old, Miss Weber has al-
ready spent more than 1,000 hours volun-teering with Youth Action Hudson, a local non- profit: during that time she has played a big role in helping feed the hungry through both the Empty Bowl project and Hudson Backpack Program. 
However, Miss Weber has also made it a 
priority to find new ways to give back. She re-cently organized an Operation Christmas Child project that collected dozens of gifts for chil-dren in Rwanda and Trinidad and Tobago and helped raise hundreds of dollars for the Amer-ican Cancer Society. 
From her nominator: ‘‘Since the first time I 
met her, I have continually been impressed and inspired by her dedication to service and I am certain that Clare will continue to be a catalyst for change in her school, church, and community.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, please join me today to recog-
nize Miss Weber for answering the call to self-lessly serve our community.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 95TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF WOMEN’S EQUAL-ITY DAY ON AUGUST 26, 2015 
HON. LOUISE McINTOSH SLAUGHTER 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, August 4, 2015 
Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to speak in recognition of the 95th anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, granting voting rights for women. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in marking August 26, known as Women’s Equality Day, a significant landmark in American history as we acknowledge, honor and celebrate the vast and vital contributions that women have made to our country. 
Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott and 
other dedicated supporters for women’s equal-ity convened the First Women’s Rights Con-vention in July 1848 in Seneca Falls, New York. They advocated for the right to own property, protection from domestic violence, and other social reforms that promoted equal-ity, including voting, and never wavered in that pursuit. Stanton wrote a Declaration of Senti-ments that called for ‘‘all men and women’’ to be recognized as created equal under the law, thus beginning the 72-year struggle for suf-frage that ended in 1920. 
2015 is the Bicentennial year for Elizabeth 
Cady Stanton who was born November 12, 1815 in Johnstown, New York. Celebrations of her extraordinary life are taking place through-out the year. Stanton met Susan B. Anthony in 1851 and they began a 50-year partnership advocating for suffrage and women’s equality; however both women did not live to see the passage of the 19th Amendment. As the mother of seven children, Mrs. Stanton can be proud of the legacy she left to her descend-ants, one of whom is today spearheading a

committee tasked with placing a new statue of 
these two amazing leaders in New York. They gave a voice to millions of women and changed history forever following Anthony’s vow that ‘‘failure is impossible.’’ 
A unique crossroad of history resides at 
77th and Central Park West in New York City with statues of two U.S. Presidents, Theodore Roosevelt astride a horse outside the Amer-ican Museum of Natural History and Abraham Lincoln who stands on the steps of the New- York Historical Society. Near Lincoln is a stat-ue of abolitionist Frederick Douglass symboli-cally carrying books at a building that safe-guards history. I am pleased to announce that permission was granted in May 2015 for a suf-fragist statue to be installed at the West 77th Street entrance to Central Park. It will be the very first statue of a woman in this park’s 160- year history. 
New York City Park Commissioner Mitchell 
J. Silver awarded this site for a statue of Eliza-beth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, pioneering leaders of the women’s suffrage movement. Included in the sculpture design are the names of many remarkable women in-strumental in the fight toward winning the vote. Its installation in September 2017 will coincide with New York State’s Centennial of women’s voting rights. The New-York Historical Society announced that in the transformation of its fourth floor there would be a new Center for the Study of Women’s History that will present special exhibitions, as well as public and scholarly programs. 
Over 50 million visitors each year are wel-
comed to New York City, with over half report-ing they spend time in Central Park. Placing the Stanton and Anthony statue at this highly visible locale that resonates social justice will undoubtedly draw local residents and visitors of all nations to history lessons that include the story of the equal rights and suffrage movements in America. 
I ask, Mr. Speaker, that we give tribute on 
August 26, 2015, the 95th anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment, to the early suffragists who were steadfast in their pursuit of equality for all citizens, which is a sacred 
trust that we must continue to support today.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF 
AMBASSADOR NUNO BRITO 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  
Tuesday, August 4, 2015 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today along 
with my colleagues Mr. C ICILLINE , Mr. H ONDA , 
Mr. K ENNEDY , Mr. L ANGEVIN , Mr. M CGOVERN , 
Mr. N UNES and Mr. V ALADAO to recognize the 
service of our good friend Nuno Brito, the Am-bassador of Portugal to the United States. After four years of hard work, Ambassador Brito deserves to be commended for all of his tireless efforts to strengthen the special bond between Portugal and the United States. 
Born in Angola, Brito earned his degree in 
law from the University of Lisbon and joined the Portuguese diplomatic service shortly thereafter. He began his career with Portugal’s Diplomatic Service in 1984 as part of the Americas Department. Brito first served at the Portuguese Embassy in Washington, DC, from 1987 to 1993. This time in Washington, DC, laid the foundation for his continued career as an effective statesman for the people of Por-tugal. Brito then served as Deputy Alternate Representative to the Security Council at the United Nations during Portugal’s term as a non-permanent member for 1997/1998. Fol-lowing a stint as Deputy Permanent Rep-resentative of Portugal to the United Nations, Brito also served as Political Director of Por-tugal and co-chair of the Portuguese-U.S. Standing Bilateral Commission. 
On February 23, 2011, Brito presented his 
credentials to President Barack Obama and expressed his desire to focus on expanding the U.S.-Portugal relationship beyond political and military cooperation to science, tech-nology, and energy initiatives. He pursued these goals by actively engaging with the Con-gressional Portuguese Caucus, especially on 
subjects that benefitted from Portuguese ex-pertise such as issues with Africa, the Amer-icas, and across the Atlantic. Furthermore, Brito’s experiences from the United Nations, U.S.-Portuguese Standing Bilateral Commis-sion, Luso-Spanish Commission for Trans-bor-der Cooperation, and other roles within Por-tugal’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs gave him an edge for practicing diplomacy and advocacy in the United States. This especially showed dur-ing Brito’s work to bring understanding and co-operation to NATO maneuvers and to the op-eration of Lajes Field in the Azores. 
Brito led numerous initiatives to support and 
engage Portuguese-American communities throughout the United States. Earlier this year, Brito invited Portuguese-American federal, state, and local elected officials to celebrate Dı´a de Portugal in Washington, DC. The full 
day of events was a wonderful representation of not only the special relationship between our countries, but of Brito’s innate ability to bring people together and raise awareness of Portuguese culture and values. 
Another example of Brito’s leadership on 
behalf of Portugal is bringing IBERIAN SUITE: global arts remix to the John F. Kennedy Cen-ter for the Performing Arts. The IBERIAN SUITE featured dozens of performances from Portuguese- and Spanish-speaking commu-nities over a three-week period. It was an un-precedented opportunity to explore the con-tributions of Portuguese and Spanish cultures to the development of the arts around the world. 
Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect that Mr. 
C
ICILLINE , Mr. H ONDA , Mr. K ENNEDY , Mr. L AN-
GEVIN , Mr. M CGOVERN , Mr. N UNES , Mr. 
VALADAO , and I ask our colleagues in the U.S. 
House of Representatives to recognize Am-bassador Nuno Brito and his many contribu-tions to the U.S.-Portugal relationship. His dedication to fostering cooperation between American and Portuguese society is sur-passed by none. It is an honor to call him a friend and we wish him the best of luck in his next position.
