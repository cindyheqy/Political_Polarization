PRAYER Reverend Andrew Walton, Trinity Presbyterian Church, Clearwater, Flor-ida, offered the following prayer: Eternal presence known by many names and served through many tradi-tions, as servants and sages have done for millennia, we all come to Your well of truth with leaking buckets. Our prayer today is for Your winds of wisdom, compassion, and love that blow throughout creation, to sweep through these Chambers of governance, crossing aisles and permeating ideologies of separation, inspiring those who work here toward conversa-tions and decisions that yield peace, justice, and equity for the common good and dignity of all people. As so many in this city and around our country prepare for days of recess, rest, relaxation, and recreation, may we remember the multitudes of people who have no resources in their lives for recreation, relaxation, or rest. In re-membering them, may we be moved with compassion for them and be in-spired toward acts of peace, justice, and love for all people. Amen. THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to section 5(a) of House Resolution 908, the Journal of the last day’s pro-ceedings is approved. f

I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f

AMBASSADOR FAITH WHITTLESEY 
HON. DONALD NORCROSS 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 25, 2018 Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the legacy of the late Ambassador Faith Whittlesey, a distinguished public serv-ant and a native of New Jersey. I have also been asked to express the condolences of my colleagues Congressmen D
ONBEYER , JOA-
QUIN CASTRO , CHARLIE CRIST, BILLHUIZENGA  and A
LEXMOONEY as well as Senator B AR-
RASSO , whose lives have all been touched by the work of Ambassador Whittlesey. Ambassador Whittlesey was the U.S. Am-bassador to Switzerland for nearly five years during both 1981–1983 and 1985–1988, and during the Reagan Administration she served as the Director of the Office of Public Liaison. Her many roles in public life included time as the Chairwoman and President of the American Swiss Foundation in New York, and her service as a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. During her influential career, Ambassador Whittlesey was a pivotal figure in building and developing Swiss and American relations, both domestically and abroad. Ambassador Whittlesey was a graduate of Wells College and received her Law Degree from the University of Pennsylvania, earned a Ford Foundation Grant to attend the Academy of International Law in The Hague, The Neth-erlands. During her career, she received honors such as the Reagan Revolution Medal of Honor, the Congress of Racial Equality Public Service Award, the Christian Freedom Inter-national Freedom Award, the Stratton Prize, and the William Tell Award. A book written by Thomas Carty centered on her career, entitled ‘‘Backwards, in High Heels: Faith Whittlesey, Ronald Reagan’s ‘Madam Ambassador’ in Switzerland and the West Wing’’. Lastly, the Ambassador had the ‘‘Faith Whittlesey rose’’ named in her legacy. These awards are a mere testament to Am-bassador Whittlesey’s commendable dedica-tion and leadership on behalf of our nation and the Swiss-United States relationship. Mr. Speaker, we have lost an extraordinary, devoted person in Ambassador Faith Whittlesey. I invite you to join me in thanking her for many contributions to our country.

OF COLORADO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 25, 2018 Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and applaud Philip Saharchuk for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth award. Philip Saharchuk is a student at Two Roads Charter School and received this award be-cause his determination and hard work have allowed him to overcome adversities. The dedication demonstrated by Philip Saharchuk is exemplary of the type of achievement that can be attained with hard work and perseverance. It is essential stu-dents at all levels strive to make the most of their education and develop a work ethic which will guide them for the rest of their lives. I extend my deepest congratulations to Phil-ip Saharchuk for winning the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth award. I have no doubt he will exhibit the same dedi-cation and character in all of his future accom-plishments. f 
RETIREMENT OF JUDGE JULIA JENT 
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 25, 2018 Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect and admiration that I take this time to honor Judge Julia Jent and to wish her well upon her retirement. For her lifetime of service, and truly inspiring career, Judge Jent is worthy of the highest praise. Among her nu-merous contributions to the community of Northwest Indiana, most impressive is her compassionate and unwavering commitment to our veterans. The Judge will oversee her final Veterans Treatment Court graduation on May 30, 2018, at Woodland Park in Portage, Indiana. Judge Julia Jent was born in Germany and came to the United States in 1957 when she was adopted by a military family from Texas. At the age of eighteen, she joined the United States Army. It was during her time in the service that she met her husband, Jack Jent, a fellow servicemember. Following their time in the military, the couple eventually moved to Northwest Indiana where they raised four chil-dren. After years of working a few different jobs, Julia decided to continue her education. In 1979, she received a Bachelor’s degree from Indiana University Northwest, and in 1982, she earned a law degree from Valparaiso University. Judge Jent worked thir-teen years in private practice law, before she was appointed by former Governor Evan Bayh as Judge of the Porter Superior Court to fill the remainder of the term vacated by Judge Mary Harper, in 1997. She was then elected to a six-year term in 1998, and has presided over Porter Superior Court III for the past twenty-one years. In addition to her remark-able career, the Judge gives much of her time and efforts to numerous charitable and civic organizations, and for that she is to be com-mended. Presiding as a Superior Court Judge, values such as respect for others, loyalty, and patriot-ism, instilled during her military service, as well as her concern for the veterans appearing before her bench, served as the motivation for Judge Jent to establish a Veterans Treatment Court in Porter County. Recognizing many of our veterans struggle with addiction, mental health, and other issues after their time in the service of our nation, Judge Jent knew a more effective solution to address the nonviolent criminal charges veterans faced as defendants was to create a framework based on partner-ships to focus on the root problem, rather than incarceration, and the Veterans Treatment Court was established in 2011. This court sys-tem allows defendants to participate in pro-grams, including treatment and mentoring, that will meet their individual needs and take one to two years to complete before their record is expunged. The numerous graduates of this program attest to its success, and to it saving their lives, thanks to the dedicated profes-sionals who share Judge Jent’s vision and her compassion and who work together to improve the lives of those in their community. Personally, I have been blessed by the depth of Marge’s kindness. I first met the Judge in early 1983 when I was an unem-ployed lawyer beginning to seek my way in the world. From the first time I met her and Jack, I was enveloped in their friendship and constant assistance. I could not have been successful without it. But my story is not unique, but only one of innumerable instances of Judge Julia Jent’s empathy and kindness. I am honored to call Julia Jent a friend. More importantly, Marge has been a friend to all, and the epitome of a public servant. Hers is a life we should all seek to emulate. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other colleagues join me in honoring Judge Julia Jent for her outstanding service to the people of Northwest Indiana and to wish her well upon her retirement. Judge Jent’s impact on the region will be witnessed by generations to come, and for her many contributions, she is worthy of our gratitude and admiration.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 25, 2018 Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to cele-brate the life of a distinguished World War II veteran, Mr. John Baber, of Bath County, Ken-tucky. As a young man, Mr. Baber answered the call and served in the United States Navy from 1944 to 1946. He was stationed in the South Pacific on the USS Clermont. Mr. Baber re-turned home after helping the Allies achieve victory. Upon his return, he finished school. Mr. Baber married Rene Hornbeck on July 23, 1949. He moved to Platte City, Missouri to work at Texas Eastern. After a long career, he retired in 1986. Mr. Baber went on to become a member of the Gideons in 1986. He has always been an

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 25, 2018 Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I am not re-corded for roll call votes on Thursday, May 24, 2018 because I was unavoidably detained. Had I been present, I would have voted Aye on final passage of H.R. 5515, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. This legislation provides our men and women in uniform with the resources they need to protect our freedom at home and abroad, and fully funds the highest pay raise for our troops in the last nine years.

CONGRATULATING DR. THOMAS A. KAZEE 
HON. LARRY BUCSHON 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 25, 2018 Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Dr. Thomas. A. Kazee upon his retirement as the 23rd president of the Univer-sity of Evansville. A political scientist by preparation, this Ohio native became the face of UE. While reaffirm-ing its decades-old tradition of world-renowned higher education, Dr. Kazee championed the role of the modern university and wisely rec-ognized that it must continue to evolve and re-spond to contemporary challenges. As creator of the ‘‘UE Guarantee,’’ Dr. Kazee boldly defined UE’s commitment to its students with emphasis on substantial finan-cial aid, internships, international study, and graduation in four years. He prompted the Uni-versity to reexamine its career development strategy even after graduation. He led a col-laboration with the Indiana University School of Medicine and its crosstown neighbor, the University of Southern Indiana, in a trans-formational Center for Health Sciences in downtown Evansville. He orchestrated a mas-ter plan that led to construction of student townhouses, renovations of key academic buildings, and positioned the stately Lincoln Avenue campus for decades to come. With profound gratitude for Dr. Kazee’s ca-reer as an academician, community leader, and outstanding steward of a great university, I join all Hoosiers in extending my best wishes in his retirement. f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF WOODY PETTUS 
HON. BOB GOODLATTE 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 25, 2018 Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, Woodrow ‘‘Woody’’ Pettus was a true Virginia gen-tleman. For 58 years, he worked at The Homestead, a historic resort nestled in the mountains of beautiful Bath County, Virginia. He was an institution there, known for his knack for remembering faces and names and always greeting guests and friends with a smile. Woody left this earthly life for his heavenly home on May 16, 2018, at the age of 77. He is survived by his wife of 55 years, Ruby Alloway Pettus, as well as two children, Wood-row Houston Pettus and wife Helen, and Lisa Pettus Aguilar, and many grandchildren, great grandchildren, and special family members. My prayers for peace and comfort are with them as they reflect on their loss and remem-ber the memories they shared with Woody, af-fectionately known as ‘‘Pa’’ to some. Woody was born on March 28, 1941, to the late Walter Woodrow Pettus and Nellie Moats Pettus in Warm Springs, Virginia. He started caddying at The Homestead as a teenager, and instantly made an impression on guests and co-workers alike. While he loved the game of golf, he wanted something with more history and decided to move to the stables and work with his father who was one of the senior Livery Drivers. Woody eventually moved on to the Dining Room where he served in a variety of roles, including his most recent position of Maıˆtre d’. In 2003, Golfstyles magazine recognized him as the Maı ˆtre d’Hotel of the Year. Last September, Historic Hotels of America honored him as Ambas-sador of the Year, which is presented to an in-dividual who has dedicated his or her career to a historic hotel for at least 25 years and has shown exemplary hospitality and service to the hotel and its guests. Woody was one of five generations of Pettuses who have worked at The Homestead. He was also a member of Mt. Pisgah Baptist Church in Warm Springs, where he was baptized as a youth. The Homestead is a special place for me and my family. Woody was a dear friend and always greeted my family warmly. He and I enjoyed catching up frequently over the years I know this is a sentiment widely shared as evidenced by the outpouring of support for him when his cancer diagnosis was announced and now in his passing. For many guests, the staff at The Homestead has become an ex-tended family. The weekend of June 1st, his family, friends, and his beloved ‘‘Homestead family’’ will gather to celebrate his life and pay tribute to his long and vibrant legacy—rich with kind-ness and a dedication to serving others. It is only fitting that he be celebrated at the place that he loved so dearly by the people he built relationships with over the past six decades. Woody’s presence will be dearly missed in the hallways and dining room of The Home-stead, but certainly not forgotten. I know that I will long remember his kind smile and gentle demeanor, just like many others he met over the years. Woody was one in a million, and we are all better for having known him. He sums it up best himself. When asked what he loves most about what he does, Woody said, ‘‘When I can look down the hall leading to the dining room and see some of my guests coming toward me, guests that I’ve known for years, coming back. That’s when I know that my life has not been in vain.’’

HONORING MASTER CHIEF PETTY OFFICER BRITT SLABINSKI 
HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN 
OF MASSACHUSETTS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 25, 2018 Mr. M
CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride and respect that I rise to honor Master Chief Petty Officer Britt Slabinski, a na-tive of Northampton, Massachusetts. Yesterday, Mr. Slabinski was awarded the Medal of Honor, our nation’s highest award for members of the Armed Forces of the United States. Authorized by and awarded in the name of Congress, the Medal of Honor acknowledges those service members who display unparal-leled bravery and a willingness to risk their own lives which clearly and conspicuously dis-tinguishes them above their comrades. Mr. Slabinski is only the 12th living servicemember to be awarded the Medal of Honor for bravery displayed in Afghanistan. In the early morning hours of March 4th, 2002, during the mountaintop battle of Takur Ghar, Mr. Slabinski led a reconnaissance team in support of a major coalition offensive against Al-Qaida forces in the valley below. According to the United States Navy, after enemy fire brought down one of his team’s helicopters, ‘‘without hesitation, then-Senior Chief Slabinski made the selfless and heroic decision to lead the remainder of his element on an immediate and daring rescue back to the mountaintop.’’ The Navy notes that Mr. Slabinski, ‘‘with bullets piercing his clothing, repeatedly charged into deadly fire to personally engage the enemy bunker’’ before the situation be-came untenable.

It reminds each of us of our sacred obli-gation to look after those who serve our coun-try and defend our freedom. Britt Slabinski put his life on the line not only for the sake of his fellow soldiers, but for all of us. On behalf of his hometown of Northampton, and the entire United States Congress, I offer him my most sincere and heartful thanks and gratitude for his service to our nation.

HONORING DR. SUSAN WILLIAMS 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 25, 2018 Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Susan Williams, a world re-nowned marine ecologist who died last month in a tragic car accident. Dr. Williams’ scientific research on coastal ecology and her activism surrounding the expansion of marine sanc-tuaries have left an indelible impact on the world. Born in 1951, Dr. Susan Williams earned a bachelor’s of science in biology, a master’s degree in biological oceanography, and a doctoral degree in botany and marine biology. After finishing her doctoral program in 1981, she conducted research at major marine laboratories across the world for three years. By 1986, after serving as the science director for the National Oceanographic and Atmos-pheric Administration’s National Undersea Re-search Program, Dr. Williams started teaching at universities while continuing her research. She became the director of the Coastal and Marine Institute at San Diego State University in 1990, and the director of the Bodega Ma-rine Laboratory at the University of California Davis in 2000. Dr. Williams stepped down from that role in 2010, and became a full-time professor and researcher at the University of California, Davis, until her death in 2018. Throughout her career, Dr. Williams’ re-search underlined the connection between the health of oceans and the communities sur-rounding them. Her work on the ecology of nearshore marine ecosystems, seagrass, coral reefs, and invasive species helped illustrate the impact of warming oceans on coastal envi-ronments and yielded strategies for mitigating those impacts. Her work was heralded by the international scientific community, and pro-vided the foundation for critical changes to state and federal policies addressing the man-agement of coastal environments. As an edu-cator and mentor, she had an immense im-pact: she supported students around the world, encouraged women in science, bridged international divides in her collaborations, and empowered others to be leaders in the field. During Dr. Williams’ ten-year tenure as the director of the Bodega Marine Laboratory, she brought scientists from around the world to conduct research at the laboratory, while at the same time working with local schools and the community in adopting conservation prac-tices based on the latest scientific discoveries. Through this work and her ongoing research, Dr. Williams became a valued advisor for state and federal officials seeking to protect the California coast. Nowhere was this more ap-parent than through her work in significantly expanding two national marine sanctuaries off the coast of Northern California: the Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary, and the Gulf of the Farallones, now known as the Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary. Both sanctuary boundary expansions were pro-posed in legislation in 2005, and were ulti-mately expanded to more than twice their original size by the Obama administration in 2015. Throughout that ten-year process, Dr. Williams was the driving force that propelled the policy forward. Mr. Speaker, Dr. Susan Williams’ lifelong pursuit of knowledge has left a positive legacy across our country and the world. It is there-fore appropriate that we pay tribute to her today, and honor the memory of a scientist who believed that no problem was insurmount-able.

ARCHBISHOP NAUMANN SPEAKS TRUTH TO NATION 
HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 25, 2018 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, yesterday Kansas City Archbishop Joseph F. Naumann was the keynote speaker at the 14th annual National Catholic Prayer Break-fast here in Washington, D.C. Archbishop Naumann’s incisive remarks were extraordinarily inspiring, hope filled, up-lifting, yet challenging. Like a modern-day Jeremiah, he spoke truth to the nation. After detailing some of the ‘‘threats to the well-being of our nation,’’ Archbishop Naumann said ‘‘However, the most serious crisis for our country is none of the above, but rather a God-crisis—a crisis of Faith....  He said, ‘‘We have no permanent enemies, but only confused brothers and sisters who have yet to encounter the Lord of Life and to experience His unconditional love and amaz-ing grace....  I t  i s  our task to reclaim our culture one mind, one heart, one soul at a time.’’ I respectfully ask my colleagues in both the House and Senate and on both sides of the aisle to take a few minutes to read the Arch-bishop’s remarkable words. NATIONAL CATHOLIC PRAYER BREAKFAST  Washington, D.C., May 24, 2018 
I. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  It is a great honor to be with you this morning and to address this distinguished gathering. As we assemble as a people of Faith to pray for our nation, we must first give thanks for our many blessings. We enjoy religious liberty, freedom of speech and ex-pression, the right to assemble—to name only a few of the freedoms for which our Founders fought and subsequent generations sacrificed heroically to preserve. Despite our economic challenges, middle class Americans enjoy creature comforts that were unavail-able to kings of earlier ages. For all this and so much more, we must give thanks to God from whom all blessings flow. At the same time, there are certainly many challenges facing our nation. Within the past week we had another deadly school shooting. There are several tense inter-national situations, e.g. the Holy Land, Iran, Syria and Korea. Many Christians through-out the world experience brutal religious persecution. Racial tensions remain high in many cities. One third of American children are being raised in homes without their bio-logical fathers. The legal status of more than a million young people who were brought to this country as children remains in limbo. In Massachusetts, Illinois and the District of Columbia Catholic Charities is no longer able to place children for adoption. Our na-tion continues to give legal protection to doctors and organizations that profit from the killing of more than one million inno-cent unborn children. There are efforts in the courts and some states legislatures to coerce Catholic Hospitals to perform abor-tions. Unfortunately, this is by no means an ex-haustive list of the serious threats to the well-being of our nation. However, the most serious crisis for our country is none of the above, but rather a God-crisis—a crisis of Faith. 
II. IS GOD DEAD ? Is God Dead? This was the title cover story for the April 8, 1966 edition of Time Maga-zine, when I was a junior in High School and Time was the most influential periodical in the United States. The 1966 article began with these words: ‘‘Is God dead? It is a question that tanta-lizes, both believers, who perhaps secretly fear that he is, and atheists, who possibly suspect the answer is No. ‘‘Is God dead? The three words represent a summons to reflect on the meaning of exist-ence. No longer is the question the taunting jest of skeptics for whom unbelief is the test of wisdom and for whom Nietzsche is the prophet who gave the right answer a century ago. . . .’’ At the time, the subject was considered shocking and provocative. I was reminded of this article while reading the 2017 book, The Benedict Option, by Rod Dreher who makes the case that we need a new St. Benedict to form vibrant Christian communities to pre-serve the truth of the Gospels during a new Dark Age of unbelief. Dreher notes the decline in church attend-ance, the large number of Millennials who profess atheism or even more commonly

identify themselves as spiritual, but not reli-gious. This non-religious spiritualism is a new paganism, where God is not the God of revelation who makes Himself known to us, but a god or gods that are fashioned in our own image to re-enforce our own desires. Dreher gives his assessment of the status of Faith in America: ‘‘. . . God may not be quite dead, but he is in hospice care and con-fined to bed.’’ 
III. A CRISIS OF FAITH  Our culture is indeed experiencing a crisis of Faith that leads to a denial of truth. Once the relationship between man and God is sev-ered, man becomes just a highly developed organism. Human life becomes just another thing in a world of things. Materialism reigns and breeds utilitarianism—our value is determined by our usefulness. We no longer possess inalienable rights that are God-given and from which no human being can deprive us. The pursuit of pleasure becomes the high-est goal. This hedonism is a futile seeking of greater and more intense pleasures that in the end leave us more and more empty. Suf-fering and death become the great enemies that we strive futilely to eliminate or at least impede It is this loss of a sense of God that also leaves us vulnerable to lose sight of the in-nate value of each and every human being. We consider those who are profoundly dis-abled as more vegetable than human. We ex-perience their care as a burden rather than an opportunity for the expression of the no-blest form of love. We begin to see human life at its earliest stages as something too tiny to have rights, but something very useful to destroy in order to exploit its components in the hope of healing or restoring youth to those al-ready born. This loss of a sense of God also leaves us helpless to find meaning in suf-fering. Suffering becomes the other real evil and thus to be avoided at all costs. If it is impossible or perhaps difficult to eliminate the suffering, then it becomes acceptable to eliminate the one suffering. 
IV. THE ESSENCE : AN ENCOUNTER WITH A  
PERSON  Pope Emeritus Benedict, in his writings and speeches reflecting on the essence of what it means to be Catholic declared it is not our dogma and doctrine. Obviously, it is not that he thought these to be unimportant, after all he had been the Prefect for the Con-gregation of the Doctrine of the Faith—he was the architect of the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Yet, important as they are, they are not the essence of Catholicism. Similarly Pope Benedict maintained that living an ethical life is not the heart of what it means to be Catholic. Again, he was not claiming this is insignificant, but it is the fruit of our Faith, not its essence. Pope Benedict asserts the essence of Ca-tholicism is an encounter with the person of Jesus Christ. Without that personal encoun-ter, our dogma and doctrine makes no sense. Without this encounter we will not have the capacity to persevere in living a virtuous life. 
V. JESUS , THE MAN WHO LIVES  Malcolm Muggeridge—the late BBC tele-vision personality, while an agnostic, filmed a documentary on Mother Teresa of Calcutta entitled Something Beautiful for God. Muggeridge made Mother Theresa a house-hold name in the English speaking world. Muggeridge’s experience of Mother Theresa’s selfless love changed the trajectory of his life. The BBC subsequently assigned Muggeridge to do a documentary on Jesus. In Bethlehem at the Church of the Nativity while observing the prayerfulness of Chris-tian pilgrims venerating the spot commemo-rated as the birth place of Jesus, Muggeridge was inspired to name his documentary— Jesus, the Man Who Lives. Muggeridge real-ized Jesus was not just another historical figure, but he was still alive and animating the lives of his disciples like Mother Teresa and millions of other saints canonized and uncanonized for the past 2,000 years. It is this same Jesus we encounter every time we open our hearts to His presence in prayer. It is this Jesus, the Lord of Lords and King of Kings, who conquered death and is alive, whom we receive in the Eucharist. It is this Jesus who transformed Peter from the coward of Good Friday to the mar-tyr in Rome, who changed Paul from a perse-cutor of His disciples to the greatest Chris-tian missionary, who inspired Francis of As-sisi to abandon a frivolous life of comfort and through simplicity and poverty to awak-en the world to the Gospel. It is this same Jesus who motivated Thomas More to resign as Chancellor of England and die a Martyr’s death rather than betray his conscience, who emboldened the North American Martyrs to make the perilous crossing of the Atlantic to evangelize Native Americans well aware that they would meet violent deaths, who led St. Damien to provide pastoral care for the lep-ers of Molokai knowing the probability that eventually he would succumb to the dreaded disease, and who gave Blessed Stanley Rother, a farm boy from Oklahoma the cour-age to stay with his flock in Guatemala de-spite being a target of the death squads. This is to name only a tiny fraction of some of the more well-known disciples who found abundant and eternal life in losing their lives following Jesus, the Man Who Lives. VI. A GOD WHO DIED BUT IS NOT DEAD  The Original Sin was the decision by our first parents to push God out of their garden in order to become their own gods. This is the archetype of every sin. God’s response to humanity’s rebellion is mercy. God does not abandon us to dwell in the darkness created by our rejection of His love. Instead, God comes to rescue us just as he saved Israel from the slavery of Egypt. Sin masquerades as freedom but in reality enslaves us to dis-ordered cravings. Jesus came to liberate us from the bondage of sin and to vanquish death destroying its power to rob life of its meaning and render it absurd. The method of this rescue was not to use His almighty power to force us into submis-sion to His will, but it was through His in-carnation to become one with us in all things but sin. Like a special operations sol-dier dropped behind enemy lines, Jesus en-tered fully into our humanity, enduring un-speakable suffering because of our sin. Jesus defeats humanity’s twin enemies, sin and death, by walking through death to eter-nal life. We believe in a God who died but is far from dead. The triumphant, risen Lord is still animating the lives of those who open their hearts to encounter His love. Thus for the Christian, we are never without hope. In recent years, I have been drawn to read the memoirs of former atheists who have be-come Catholic. Two of my favorites in this genre are Jennifer Fulwiler’s Something Other Than God and Sally Read’s Night’s Bright Darkness. Both of their conversions illustrate, if we just open a crack in our hearts, God’s amazing grace will come rush-ing in. 
VII. A NEW GREAT AWAKENING  In our prayer this morning, let us pray for a religious revival in our nation, another great awakening. For those of us who have encountered the Risen Jesus we have a re-sponsibility to bring His love and mercy to others, especially as Pope Francis so often reminds us to those on the peripheries. We are called to be Missionary Disciples, com-municating the love of Jesus to others and bringing others to encounter the Risen Lord. We have no permanent enemies, but only confused brothers and sisters who have yet to encounter the Lord of Life and to experi-ence His unconditional love and amazing grace. We are called to renew our nation, not primarily by enacting laws, but by announc-ing the Joy and Hope of the Gospel of Jesus to individuals in desperate need of its good news. It is our task to reclaim our culture one mind, one heart, one soul at a time. f RECOGNIZING THE INSPIRING LIFE OF EVA SCHLOSS 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 25, 2018 Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Eva Geiringer Schloss, who lives such an inspiring life as a Holocaust survivor of Auschwitz. Ms. Schloss is the stepsister and good friend of Anne Frank. Ms. Eva Geiringer Schloss was born in 1938 shortly after the annexation of Austria by Germany. She studied art history at the Uni-versity of Amsterdam and went on to become an accomplished author detailing the experi-ences of her family. Mrs. Schloss is also the co-founder of the Anne Frank Trust UK, and recorded virtual reality answers to numerous questions for museums everywhere in the world ensuring we never forget those tragic events. Ms. Schloss is an inspiration to all of us in remembering the Holocaust and hon-oring the lives of those lost. It is because of dedicated women such as Ms. Eva Schloss that I am especially proud to serve in Congress. Mr. Speaker, I would like to again formally honor Ms. Eva Schloss today as an inspiration to us all.

has vaulted this still-young state university to a heightened stature. She raised the profile of its academic offerings, particularly in nursing and engineering, and expanded its reach through statewide involvements, community service, and online programming. During her nine-year tenure, USI experienced dynamic growth and diversity in its student population, attracted top-flight faculty, and became a high-er-education destination throughout Indiana and across the globe. The campus, itself, took on a signature personality with new structures that helped define an enduring physical char-acter. A highly regarded civic leader, Dr. Bennett has lent her talents to countless organizations and civic causes, and she has been widely recognized for her thoughtful contributions, many, of which, were conducted outside the public eye. I am grateful for Dr. Bennett’s legacy of stewardship in guiding USI’s development, and join all Hoosiers in extending my best wishes in her retirement.

CONGRATULATING THE CITY OF ASTANA 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 25, 2018 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the city of Astana on its 20th an-niversary. In this short time, the capital city of Kazakhstan has hosted high-level political and diplomatic events, including several inter-national forums for a nuclear weapons-free world. Most recently, Astana hosted the successful EXPO 2017, which focused on the future of energy. Kazakhstan has shown promise not only as an important economic partner of the United States in the energy sector, but also as a strong proponent of clean energy. It joined the Paris Agreement and many other inter-national efforts to curb climate change and im-prove our environment. In its 20-year history, Astana has become one of the most modern cities in Central Asia. It continues to serve as a hub for the region and link between the East and the West. I look forward to a long partnership between Washington and Astana. A partnership that will include productive cooperation on shared economic and security priorities, as well as ef-forts to advance the development of an inde-pendent, stable, and politically free Kazakhstan. With these advances, Astana would become a model for other nations and a central partner on so many shared objec-tives.

SUPPORTING THE PHILADELPHIA SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA’S HIS-TORIC EUROPE AND ISRAEL TOUR 
HON. DWIGHT EVANS 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 25, 2018 Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise with great honor to salute the Philadelphia Orches-tra on its upcoming historic tour through Eu-rope and Israel. I have had the privilege of working to support them over the years during my time in the Pennsylvania Legislature, and now here in Congress. I can’t think of a better cultural ambassador for our country, the Com-monwealth, and our great city, than the finely- tuned Philadelphia Orchestra. With support from Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf’s Department of Community and Economic Development and State Department diplomats, and more than 150 Pennsylvania musicians, non-profits, and business leaders, this historic journey starts in Brussels, Bel-gium, and will wind its way through Luxem-bourg, France, Germany, and Austria. These historic countries are iconic in their musical backgrounds, having given birth to such artists such as Beethoven, Brahms, Poulenc, Wag-ner, and Mozart. I take special pride in the Philadelphia Or-chestra’s visit to Israel, in partnership with the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia. This visit not only confirms and solidifies the distinct. and unique cultural, political, and hu-manitarian bond amongst the City of Philadel-phia, the Jewish community, and the State of Israel. Israel and its people have been contin-ually under siege for ages from the time of Judea to Sumeria, and by recognizing their dignity, honor, and courage, the Orchestra’s visit serves to underscore how important Israel to the Middle East writ large, and to America. And let me add that the Philadelphia Orches-tra should be noted for the diversity of its mu-sicians and staff orchestra’s diversity com-plements. I would like to give special recognition to the Philadelphia Orchestra’s director, Yannick Nezet-Seguin, the chairman, Richard Worley, and the woman at the top who has helped forge ties both near and far, Philadelphia Or-chestra Interim Co-Presidents Ryan Fleur and Matthew Loden. And I also wish to salute Naomi Adler, CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia and Director of Govern-ment Affairs, Robin Schatz for their leadership, and special role in informing us on the unwav-ering dignity and humanity of Israel. I am proud to represent a city that boasts some of the most iconic music heard around the world. I salute our well-traveled Philadel-phia Orchestra and look forward to my next symphony. f

Mr. Fagan shares his birthday with his twin sister, Phyllis. They both reside in Adair, Iowa. Our world has changed a great deal during Philip’s life.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF JUDGE CLARE JUPITER 
HON. CEDRIC L. RICHMOND 
OF LOUISIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 25, 2018 Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and legacy of Judge Clare Jupi-ter of Orleans Parish Civil District Court, who died on May 18, 2018 at the age of 65. Born in Chicago, Illinois where her father was attending art school, Judge Jupiter came to New Orleans as a toddler and spent the rest of her childhood in the city. She was the second-oldest of 12 children. She graduated from St. Joseph Academy in New Orleans and earned a B.A. degree from Yale University in 1974 before returning to New Orleans to work as a reporter for the States-Item, the city’s afternoon paper, she was known as a gifted writer who took the time to understand the topic at hand. Judge Jupiter left journalism to attend law school, graduating in 1978 from Duke Univer-sity School of Law, and then returned to New Orleans to practice law. She was admitted to the Louisiana State Bar in 1979. She became part of the firm Jefferson Bryan and Gray, which later became Bryan and Jupiter. Judge Jupiter worked as outside general counsel for the Orleans Parish School Board and supported causes such as WWOZ Radio, the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, Covenant House, and New Life Ministry.

firm’s top writer, reviewing and improving oth-ers’ briefs. Judge Jupiter was elected to Civil Court’s Division E seat in 2011 and re-elected in 2014. She suffered a health setback in 2015 but returned to the bench. Judge Jupiter loved the city and the people of New Orleans. Her legacy will forever be a part of the city and her dedication to commu-nity embodies the spirit of New Orleans. We cannot match the sacrifices made by Judge Jupiter, but surely we can try to match her sense of service. We cannot match her cour-age, but we can strive to match her devotion. Judge Jupiter’s survivors include her hus-band, Pat Bryant; brother, New Orleans Traffic Court Judge Steven Jupiter; a son, Kwame Bryant of New Orleans; a daughter, Ms. Nia Bryant of New Orleans; six brothers, Eric, Danny and Jerome Jupiter, all of New Orle-ans, David Jupiter of Albuquerque, New Mex-ico, Carl Jupiter of Houston and Omodare Ju-piter of St. Croix; four sisters, Gayle Jupiter of Albuquerque, Ann Jupiter-Mitchll of Wash-ington, Jill Jupiter-Jones of Silver Spring, Maryland, and Jane Bell of New Orleans; her mother, Romona Felton Jupiter of New Orle-ans; and two grandchildren.

HONORING THE CAREER OF THE CHARLOTTE 49ERS DIRECTOR OF ATHLETICS JUDY ROSE 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 25, 2018 Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the career of Judy Rose and her service as the Director of Athletics for UNC Charlotte. I’ve known Judy for many years, and watched her succeed at every opportunity she was given. As only the third female Division I Athletic Director in NCAA history, a role she has held for 28 years, Judy has made a tre-mendous impact on my alma mater and the entire Charlotte community. She helped build an athletic program that empowers student- athletes with tools to be successful and pro-vides our community teams to be proud of. Over the years, she has taken our athletic department higher than anyone ever envi-sioned. And most importantly, she did so with the highest ethical standards. I am proud we have not had one hint of scandal during Judy Rose’s tenure. In my opinion, she is one of the most influential figures in UNC Charlotte history. I still remember back in the 90’s when I was Student Body President—there were plenty of people who didn’t share her vision for putting the basketball arena in the middle of campus, or didn’t believe a Division I football team would ever be a reality. Nevertheless, Judy al-ways saw the big picture and always knew what a powerhouse UNC Charlotte athletics could become. She saw the potential, and she’s a huge reason why UNC Charlotte now has thriving alumni engagement and why the student population has boomed the last 20 years. I am proud, on behalf of the UNC Charlotte family that is Niner Nation, to say thank you, Judy Rose. Your extraordinary leadership will be missed. We wish you and Ken all the best in this next chapter of your lives. Mr. Speaker, please join me today in com-memorating the outstanding career of Judy Rose. f

Ian Kuehl pinned his last opponent of the season in 3 minutes and 25 seconds to claim his title as state champion, and I would like to recognize Ian for his tremendous accomplish-ment. Ian’s dedication and passion for his sport meant that he was determined to win gold and cap off his season of 47 wins and only 1 loss. As a former athlete, I understand the amount of hard work and commitment to be awarded such a title. Ian is an example of the importance of dedication and a strong work ethic. I am proud there is such young tal-ent in our community, and to see him rep-resent Stockton throughout the state. Mr. Speaker, I would like to again formally congratulate Ian Kuehl on his state title, and I join the rest of the community in wishing him every success in the future.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 25, 2018 Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Elsie Heidenreich, who lived an inspir-ing life as one of the first women to serve as a Red Cross nurse in World War I. Ms. Heidenreich was born into a family of nine in Woodbine Township in 1893. She put herself through nursing school, and at age 25 completed the nursing program at the Pres-byterian School of Nursing in Chicago. After enlisting in the military, she sailed overseas on assignment to France and worked tirelessly with the sick and wounded. Ms. Heidenreich returned to the United States after the Armi-stice was signed and served as a Red Cross nurse until 1921, when she left the service to become a missionary in China. It is because of dedicated women such as Ms. Elsie Heidenreich that I am especially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional Dis-trict. Mr. Speaker, I would like to again for-mally honor Ms. Elsie Heidenreich’s life and her service to this great country.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the fifth anniversary of the Colorado Freedom Memorial, its President and Founder, Rick Crandall, and his wife, and its cofounder, Diane Crandall. This monument to our fallen heroes, located in Aurora, Colorado, provides all Coloradans the opportunity to come and pay their respects for the greatest sacrifice that our men and women in uniform can give. The Colorado Freedom Memorial, which holds over 6,000 names, first opened in 2013 and is the first memorial in the United States that pays respect to members of the military who have served in any of America’s wars from the State of Colorado. For this year’s fifth anniversary, the memorial will be dedicating a new flag pole, holding a tribute for the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, and un-veiling a new exhibit which contains soil from eight American cemeteries overseas where Coloradans lie who never made it home. The anniversary of the memorial is espe-cially fitting as we observe Memorial Day and pay homage to the men and women who have sacrificed their lives on behalf of our nation. I am proud to have this memorial located in my district and would like to recognize cofounders Rick and Diane Crandall. Their leadership and dedication to our veterans is truly admirable, and I thank them for all of their work.

RECOGNITION OF AZERBAIJAN’S CENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ROBERT B. ADERHOLT 
OF ALABAMA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 25, 2018 Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-ognize the 100th anniversary of the founding of Azerbaijan, known as Republic Day. On May 28, 1918, the National Assembly of Azerbaijan adopted a Declaration of Independ-ence, and formed the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, the first secular parliamentary de-mocracy in the Muslim world. For over 50 years (1920–1971), Azerbaijan suffered under the weight of the Soviet re-gime. As they rebuilt from the wreckage of the failed communist empire, Azerbaijan grew into a strong and reliable ally of the United States. Today, the Republic of Azerbaijan is not only a valuable partner of the United States, but also plays a critical role in the Caucasus and Central Asia. Azerbaijan was one of the first countries to render unconditional assist-ance to the United States after the terror at-tacks of September 11, 2001. It also has a strong friendship and partnership with Israel, one of the closest allies of the United States. Azerbaijan continues to play a key role in energy security and diversification for U.S. al-lies in Europe and Israel, including leadership on the Southern Gas Corridor. On this 100th anniversary of the founding of Azerbaijan, the United States remains grateful for the strategic relationship and abiding friendship between our two countries. HONORING MISSISSIPPI NAVY WWII VETERAN, PAUL SONNIER HON. STEVEN M. PALAZZO 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 25, 2018 Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Paul Sonnier, a resident in my dis-trict and a United States Navy WWII Veteran. Paul Sonnier was born on January 13th, 1926, in Delcambre, Louisiana, near Lafayette. As the fifth oldest of ten children, Paul’s ability to serve as a role model and leader has been evident throughout his life. Sonnier’s father died when he was young, and Paul felt it was his duty to help his mother provide and care for his younger siblings. On December 7th, 1941, the bombing of Pearl Harbor sparked a fire inside of Paul, and he knew ‘‘joining up’’ would help provide for his family as well as honor his country. Paul enlisted in the U.S. Navy, in January of 1944, and served our country until May of 1946, when he was honorably discharged. In the Navy, he served aboard the USS LCI (G) 458 and was found worthy of membership in The Ancient and Sacred Order of the Gold-en Dragon as well as the Solemn Mysteries of the Ancient Order of the Deep. He received two battle stars as well as a Presidential Unit Citation. After his military service Paul worked for Freeport Sulphur Company in Port Sulphur, Louisiana, and later became a tugboat cap-tain, until he retired. Paul was married and has six children and fifteen grandchildren. He moved from Lou-isiana to Mississippi after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and has lived in the fourth Congres-sional District ever since. World War II veteran, Paul Sonnier, lives his life with honor and bravery, leaving behind a legacy that must be remembered as one of America’s Greatest Generation. On April 23rd, the Phi Mu Women’s Frater-nity at the University of Southern Mississippi honored Mr. Sonnier by granting one of his last wishes—dancing with a beautiful woman. That he did, several times over. He said that it was wonderful to see that today’s young people remember those who fought in World War II and would be kind enough to shower him with love on that day. I am honored to recognize Mr. Paul Sonnier today, and express the gratitude of our district to him for his service and dedication to our country by answering the call and serving hon-orably and bravely in World War II.

HONORING 30 YEARS OF KUBOTA MANUFACTURING IN THE UNITED STATES 
HON. DOUG COLLINS 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 25, 2018 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Kubota Manufac-turing’s 30-year presence in the United States. Planting its roots in my hometown of Gaines-ville, this company specializes in tractor manu-facturing. In the past few decades, several inter-national companies like Kubota have made Northeast Georgia their home. For Kubota, what began as a 60,000 square foot plant with 44 team members in 1988 grew to the 2.5 mil-lion square foot plant with 2,600 team mem-bers that we see today. Instead of settling for one plant’s success, Kubota chose to open additional manufac-turing plants in Kansas and Texas, and, in 2005, the company founded the Kubota Indus-trial Equipment Corporation based in nearby Jefferson, Georgia. To celebrate its 30-year anniversary, Kubota Manufacturing donated $1 million to the Lanier Technical College Foundation. This gift will help finance Lanier Technical College’s new Hall County Campus, which is scheduled to open in the spring of next year. Whether it’s a student at Lanier Technical College or one of the company’s employees, Kubota demonstrates the importance of invest-ing in our nation’s workforce—preparing men and women for the jobs our modern world re-quires. Mr. Speaker, I thank Kubota Manufacturing for using its success to support the commu-nities in my corner of Georgia. I look forward to seeing this company’s presence continue to grow over the next 30 years.

RECOGNIZING THE INSPIRING LIFE OF RIA BAUMGARTNER FRANCOMB 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 25, 2018 Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Rita Baumgartner Francomb, who lived an inspiring life as the first women to enlist in any of the women’s military organizations dur-ing World War II from Elizabeth, Illinois. Ms. Francomb trained at Hunter College in New York City and was sworn into the Wom-en’s Auxiliary Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES) for the Navy in Chicago, Illinois in 1943. She was a chief secretary of cor-respondence at the Naval Supply Depot in Oakland, California, attaining the rank of Yeo-man First Class. After her Naval career, she resumed her position as assistant cashier at Elizabeth Bank. It is because of dedicated women such as Ms. Rita Baumgartner Francomb that I am es-pecially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Congres-sional District. Mr. Speaker, I would like to again formally honor Ms. Rita Baumgartner Francomb’s life and her service to this great country. f 
TRIBUTE TO CENTENNIAL MIDDLE SCHOOL’S MATHCOUNTS TEAM 
HON. JOHN R. CURTIS 
OF UTAH  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 25, 2018 Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, I stand before you today to honor Centennial Middle School’s MATHCOUNTS team, which won the Utah State MATHCOUNTS contest this year and sent multiple students to represent Utah at the 2018 Raytheon MATHCOUNTS National Com-petition, where they placed in the top ten. The MATHCOUNTS Foundation is a non- profit organization that helps middle school students nurture and enhance their abilities in mathematics. The foundation was created in 1983 and has since helped countless middle school students overcome their fear of and de-velop a love for mathematics. The MATHCOUNTS Foundation hosts the annual Raytheon MATHCOUNTS National Competition, which brings in Mathletes from all 50 States to compete. These Mathletes com-pete head-to-head with other teams to solve difficult math problems in timed exams. Since the competition was first held in 1984, it has grown to become the most prestigious middle school mathematics competition in the nation. Centennial Middle School, located in Provo, Utah, has participated in the MATHCOUNTS program for many years. To prepare for the statewide competition in March, participating students spent many afterschool hours train-ing, practicing, and expanding their mathe-matics skills. The Centennial Middle School MATHCOUNTS team won the Utah statewide competition and had the honor of sending mul-tiple students and their coach to represent Utah at the national contest. The Utah team placed ninth in the nation, making it the first time Utah has placed in the top ten and also took home the award for most improved team. These prestigious and hard-earned awards demonstrate the significant efforts of parents, teachers, and the team’s coach, Ryan Camacho, in cultivating a love of mathematics among students at Centennial Middle School. Centennial Middle School’s accomplish-ments indicate a promising future for mathe-matics achievement in Utah. As students in Utah and across the country continue to par-ticipate in competitions like MATHCOUNTS, they will be better prepared to succeed in emerging careers in mathematics. Mr. Speak-er, please join me in congratulating this out-standing accomplishment. CONGRATULATING SIGNATURE SCHOOL IN EVANSVILLE, INDIANA HON. LARRY BUCSHON

Founded in 1992, Signature School became Indiana’s first public charter school in 2002. Located on Main Street in downtown Evans-ville, Signature School has offered an ad-vanced education for students all over South-west Indiana for over 25 years. The education young Hoosiers receive at Signature School not only helps them prepare for college, but also for success in life. Signature School stu-dents routinely out perform national SAT and ACT averages, are recognized as National Merit Finalists, achieve a 100 percent gradua-tion rate, and are offered millions of dollars in college scholarships. Ensuring all Hoosiers have access to a quality education is of the utmost importance because today’s youth are tomorrow’s leaders. I am grateful for Signature School’s commit-ment to educating young Hoosiers and con-gratulate them on receiving this outstanding distinction.

County, Iowa. The 100th anniversary is a tes-tament to the great work that is performed every day by the staff at the Fremont County Extension. Established 100 years ago in 1918, the Fre-mont County Extension hired its first extension agent that year after the Iowa State Legisla-ture passed the Extension Act. The Extension agency provides needed research-based infor-mation to Fremont County. The services in-clude 4–H youth programs, agriculture and natural resources research and assistance, human sciences, and community economic development. Mandy Maher, Program Coordi-nator for the Iowa State University Extension and Outreach-Fremont County said, ‘‘One hundred years ago, Fremont County Extension was organized, and the mission then was and is similar to what it is today, to provide edu-cation and build partnerships designed to solve today’s issues and prepare for the fu-ture.’’ Mr. Speaker, I commend the Fremont Coun-ty Extension and its staff for providing dedi-cated, committed, and crucial services to fami-lies and individuals every day.

It demonstrates a commitment to crime prevention and campus policing, as well as successfully aligns with the university’s educational mission and prides itself on its student-centered approach. On behalf of New York’s 21st district, I would like to congratulate the Plattsburgh State University Police Department on an ex-ceptional 50 years and thank the officers for their dedicated service and commitment to keeping SUNY Plattsburgh safe and secure.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 25, 2018 Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Flowery Branch High School boys’ tennis team on winning the state title—the first championship in the pro-gram’s history. The Falcons persevered through a difficult season, enduring illnesses, short-handed line-ups, and an exhausting postseason. Despite these challenges, the team continued to ex-hibit their best effort and earned a spot in the championship against Buford High School. With only two starting seniors, this young team had never advanced past the second round of playoffs. After a four-hour match, Jack Thomas—one of the team’s freshmen players—overcame an opponent who had defeated him twice before and helped his team clench the victory. Mr. Speaker, this group of young men re-mind Northeast Georgians that hard work paves the road to success. I am honored to highlight the Falcons’ achievement and con-gratulate the team on their outstanding sea-son. f

HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 25, 2018 Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the town of Cambridge, Illinois on its 175th Anniversary. The community was named by Judge Joseph Tillson in 1843, and has been thriving ever since. Cambridge, Illinois has a rich history and is an integral part of Henry County. After its founding in 1843, it was incorporated a dec-ade later when J.S. Hinman served as the first village president. Cambridge is an unusual county seat built around two public squares in-stead of one, which includes Court Square and College Square Park. The first house in the village was built by blacksmith Lord John Russell near the southeast corner of College Square and the courthouse was the heart of the community. It is because of villages like Cambridge, Illi-nois that I am especially proud to serve Illi-nois’ 17th Congressional District. Mr. Speaker, I would like to again formally congratulate the village of Cambridge, Illinois on its 175th Anni-versary. f

She founded the Mountainside Middle School Helping Hands Club, a school service club that provided assistance each month to organizations and/or people in need in the local community, and she ran that club for nearly 14 years. Like so many of our nation’s educators, Sal-lie continued to support students after school hours and tutored a number of them in math, going on to create a successful tutoring pro-gram that positively impacted many young people in middle school and high school. She has been a mentor to numerous students, and has always been willing to give her personal time to help them succeed. Her compassion, patience, and strong belief in her students have had lasting impacts long after they leave her classroom. Sallie has dedicated her professional career to helping students learn and achieve excel-lence.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF DR. BILLY CANNON 
HON. CEDRIC L. RICHMOND 
OF LOUISIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 25, 2018 Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a Louisiana legend, Dr. Billy Cannon. Billy Cannon is an icon. He led LSU to a na-tional championship, won the Heisman trophy and became the first professional football play-er to earn $100,000. His career is summed up by his famous Halloween night punt return against Ole Miss that is replayed countless times in the hearts and minds of LSU fans, and every year on TV the week of the LSU- Ole Miss game. To me, however, his exploits on the football field as a young man, impressive though they are, are the least impressive parts of Dr. Can-non’s life. Like many, life after the glory fades was not easy for Dr. Cannon. He made a major mis-take, wound up involved in the criminal justice system, and served his time. After paying his debt and returning to society, he still found it difficult to make a living, something that hap-pens far too often across the country. Eventually he became the dentist at the Louisiana State Penitentiary, Angola, where he turned the dental office around and truly cared for the needs of the prisoners. He re-mained as dentist at Angola for more than two decades, treating teeth with care and men with empathy. In appreciation for his service, the men at Angola hand forged the casket where he now rests. He once said that the people of Louisiana are quick to love and quick to forgive. We should not be quick to forget the care and dedication he showed to those society prefers to ignore. We should remember all his life as vividly as we remember The Return. Mr. Speaker, I celebrate the whole life of Dr. Billy Cannon, a great All-American. f

Maverick McPeek defeated his opponent 3– 2 to claim his title as state champion, and I would like to recognize Maverick for his tre-mendous accomplishment. Maverick’s dedica-tion and passion for his sport meant that he was determined to win gold and cap off his season of 40 wins and 2 losses. As a former athlete, I understand the amount of hard work and commitment to be awarded such a title. Ian is an example of the importance of dedica-tion and a strong work ethic. I am proud there is such young talent in our community, and to see him represent Dakota, Illinois throughout the state. Mr. Speaker, I would like to again formally congratulate Maverick McPeek on his state title, and I join the rest of the community in wishing him every success in the future.

We have fought in wars over-seas, seen the rise and fall of Soviet com-munism and witnessed the birth of new de-mocracies. Lola has lived through eighteen United States Presidents and twenty-two Gov-ernors of Iowa. In her lifetime, the population of the United States has more than tripled. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to represent Lola in the United States Congress and it is my pleasure to wish her a very happy 100th birth-day.
