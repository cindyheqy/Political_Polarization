HONORING THE SERVICE OF BRIAN COOPER, CHIEF CLERK TO THE PARLIAMENTARIAN 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 26, 2017 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Brian Cooper, Chief Clerk to the Parliamentarian, who is retiring after more than three decades of service to our country. Brian Cooper has dedicated his career to ensure the good management and orderly function of the U.S. House of Representatives. As Chief Clerk to the Parliamentarian, much of his work has gone unnoticed. But it has not gone unappreciated. From time-keeping to processing bills to preparing for joint sessions of Congress, Brian Cooper has played an integral role in main-taining the integrity of the House of Rep-resentatives. After more than three decades of service, this public servant has more than earned his wings of retirement. Brian Cooper made the House work better and he will be missed by his many friends and colleagues, whom I join in wishing him well as he embarks on a new chapter in his life of service to others.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF FALL-EN MISSISSIPPI SOLDIER ARMY STAFF SERGEANT (SSG) KEN-NETH RAY BRADLEY 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 26, 2017 Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of Army Staff Sergeant (SSG) Kenneth Ray Bradley who paid the ulti-mate sacrifice while defending our nation on May 28, 2003, during Operation Iraqi Free-dom. SSG Bradley died of a heart attack while serving in Baqubah, Iraq. SSG Bradley was assigned to Company B 588th Engineer Battalion, Fort Hood, Texas. The Utica native was a 19-year Army veteran. According to the Associated Press, SSG Bradley enjoyed music. Cleveland Wash-ington, SSG Bradley’s first cousin, said he liked musical instruments. ‘‘He was left-handed,’’ Washington said. ‘‘He blew the trumpet and played the guitar. He al-ways liked music and was in a band.’’ People who grew up with SSG Bradley and served with him in the Army memorialized him on the ‘‘Fallen Heroes of Operation Iraqi Free-dom’’ website. Sergeant First Class (SFC) Lee of Wash-ington said he was a great leader. ‘‘I remem-ber that he was a great NCO and a great leader,’’ SFC Lee said. ‘‘He is a true hero and will never be forgotten. God bless his family, friends, and brothers-in-arms.’’ Sergeant First Class (SFC) Frye of Fort Benning, Georgia, said SSG Bradley would not be forgotten. ‘‘You are never forgotten, brother, and your passing caused me so much grief. Your words touched my heart,’’ SFC Frye said. ‘‘I remember those days you talked of spending time with your family prior to being ordered to go to Iraq. The fact that your life was cut short, and we’re all robbed of your love, hurts me to this day. I only pray your family has found peace in your memories and what a great man you were.’’ Melvin Waters of Woodbridge, Virginia, of-fered his condolences to the family. ‘‘I would like to convey my sincerest sympathy to Clau-dia, Brian, and Sandra,’’ Waters said. ‘‘Kenney is truly missed by many and he will always live in our thoughts and good deeds.’’ Specialist (SPC) George Sanchez served with SSG Bradley. ‘‘I am currently attending St. Mary’s University as a disabled veteran,’’ SPC Sanchez said. ‘‘The days I feel like quit-ting, I think of SSG Bradley, and my other fall-en brothers-in-arms. Then I pick myself up and keep going for them. I dedicate my edu-cation to their memory. Your sacrifice is not in vain, my friend.’’ SSG Bradley bravely fought to protect the freedoms we all enjoy. His service to our na-tion will not be forgotten. f 
STEM OPPORTUNITIES ACT OF 2017 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 26, 2017 Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be introducing the STEM Opportunities Act of 2017. A very simi-lar bill passed the House as part of the Amer-ica Competes Act of 2010, but unfortunately didn’t make it into the enacted law. As a re-sult, every Congress since then, I have worked hard to keep the legislation updated and to convince my colleagues of the urgency of the challenges this bill addresses. Today I am reintroducing this bill with 20 cosponsors. And my colleague Senator H
IRONO is intro- ducing a Senate companion bill. The goal of our legislation is to develop and implement evidence-based policies to promote the progress of women and minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) studies and research careers. The need for full engagement in STEM by women and underrepresented minorities goes beyond enabling individuals to fulfill their dreams of becoming a scientist. Our economic future relies on what we do now to nurture the STEM talent that will be necessary to meet the demands of an increasingly technological and knowledge-based economy. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that STEM employ-ment is the fastest growing sector, with com-puter science and engineering jobs among the fastest growing STEM occupations. If things continue as they are now, however, I fear we will be ill equipped to fill these jobs. We are seventeen years into the 21st century and the demographics of the STEM workforce do not reflect the diversity of the nation. In 2015, women earned only 19 percent of bach-elor’s degrees in engineering and 18 percent in computer science. Black and Hispanic stu-dents are similarly underrepresented in these fields at the undergraduate level, and the problem is even more pronounced in STEM faculty. Women hold only 23 percent of all tenured and tenure-track positions, while Black and Hispanic faculty combined hold a dismal 6.4 percent of these positions. We need to le-verage all of our human capital if we are to achieve the necessary capacity to innovate and to discover. The STEM Opportunities Act is focused on addressing the leaky pipeline for those who have already chosen a STEM path. First, so that we better understand the nature and scope of the challenges, the STEM Opportuni-ties Act requires more comprehensive demo-graphic data collection on the recipients of federal research awards and on STEM faculty at U.S. universities. These data would be available to researchers to study the participa-tion and trajectories of women and underrep-resented minorities in STEM so that policy makers can design more effective policies and practices to reduce barriers. Next, this bill requires the development of consistent federal policies, such as no-cost award extensions, for recipients of federal re-search awards who have caregiving respon-sibilities, including care for a newborn or newly adopted child and care for an immediate fam-ily member who is sick. The bill also requires consistent federal guidance to grant reviewers and program officers on best practices to mini-mize the effects of implicit bias in the review of federal research grants. It requires NSF to provide guidance to universities and OSTP to provide guidance to Federal laboratories to aid them in identifying any cultural and institutional barriers limiting the recruitment, retention, and achievement of women and minorities in aca-demic and government STEM research ca-reers and developing and implementing cur-rent best practices for reducing such barriers. Finally, the legislation authorizes NSF to award grants to universities to implement or expand research-based practices targeted specifically at increasing the recruitment and retention of minority students and faculty. Mr. Speaker, in developing this legislation, we solicited extensive input from governmental and non-governmental stakeholders to ensure that the guidance and requirements reflect to-day’s needs and opportunities without unduly burdening our research universities. The result is a bill that attempts to systematically address the full suite of issues facing both female and minority STEM researchers, from work-life bal-ance policies, to campus climate, to better data collection, to recruitment and retention practices. This bill proposes concrete and evi-dence-based solutions to the indisputable re-ality that our nation continues to fall well short of engaging our entire talent pool in STEM ca-reers. That disparity in our STEM workforce

will continue to have real and increasing con-sequences to our social, economic, and na-tional security if we do not begin to implement scalable solutions soon. I want to thank Senator H
IRONO for joining me in introducing a Senate companion bill, and all of the Members of the House and Sen-ate who have already cosponsored this legis-lation. I urge the rest of my colleagues to join us and to help us move this legislation forward into law.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF FALL-EN MISSISSIPPI ARMY NA-TIONAL GUARD SERGEANT (SGT) DANIEL RYAN VARNADO 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 26, 2017 Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of Mississippi Army Na-tional Guard Sergeant (SGT) Daniel Ryan Varnado who paid the ultimate sacrifice while defending our great nation on May 23, 2005, during Operation Iraqi Freedom. SGT Varnado was killed when his military vehicle was struck by an improvised explosive device in Haswa, Iraq. Also killed were Specialist (SPC) Bryan Edward Barron, Sergeant (SGT) Audrey Daron Lunsford, and Sergeant First Class (SFC) Saburant Parker. SGT Varnado was assigned to C Company, 1st Battalion, 1–155th Infantry Regiment, Mis-sissippi Army National Guard, Biloxi, Mis-sissippi. SGT Varnado, a Saucier resident, joined the Mississippi Army National Guard in November 2000. According to a website created in his mem-ory, SGT Varnado played baseball growing up for Harrison Central High School in Lyman until he graduated in 1999. He also played baseball for Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College while pursuing a degree in education. SGT Varnado wanted to be a baseball coach. The website’s author describes SGT Varnado as the perfect husband, father, son, and friend. He is also described as a person with faith and a love for the Lord which kept him strong in times of war. Additionally, the author says he will be deeply missed. The Army National Guard Readiness Center in Gulfport has been named in honor of SGT Varnado. Mississippi Army National Guard Brigadier General (BG) John Rhodes was the 1–155th infantry battalion commander in 2005. BG Rhodes recently said SGT Varnado will al-ways be remembered along with those who died with him. ‘‘SGT Daniel Ryan Varnado, SPC Bryan Ed-ward Barron, SGT Audrey Daron Lunsford, and SFC Saburant Parker are remembered in many ways, but we knew them as warriors who represented something larger than them-selves,’’ BG Rhodes said. ‘‘They operated in a hostile environment and faced the dangers of combat on a regular basis. Yet, if given the choice, they would not have wanted it any other way. They sacrificed their lives trying to provide a better life for people who they did not even know. This is who they were and what they represented. They exemplified the modern day Mississippi Riflemen. Stand Fast, Mississippians! Stand Fast!’’ During Operation Iraqi Freedom, Lieutenant Colonel (LTC) Andrew Robertson served as company commander of Charlie Company, 1– 155th Infantry Regiment, MS Army National Guard, Biloxi, Mississippi, serving operational control under 2–11 Armed Cavalry Regiment (ACR), U.S. Army. He says there were no greater people than the Charlie Company sol-diers who endured being in the most dan-gerous and highest casualty area of operation as part of OIF III under Task Force 155 Heavy Brigade Combat Team. ‘‘In 2005, there were no greater Americans than our fallen patriots, Charlie Company In-fantrymen and their families. None greater. This, I believe, America needs to know,’’ LTC Robertson said. SGT Varnado is survived by his wife, Shar-on Shavers, and son, Kannon Varnado. SGT Varnado’s sacrifice to protect our free-doms will always be remembered.

IN RECOGNITION OF REV. JOHN BEATTY KAHL’S 25 YEARS OF SERVICE 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 26, 2017 Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Reverend John Beatty Kahl for his 25 years of dedicated service to our commu-nity as an ordained minister. Rev. Kahl attended Lenoir Rhyne College where he graduated magna cum laude with a triple major in math, physics, and chemistry. As a driven scholar, he received the American Institutes of Chemistry Award his senior year of college and became a member of multiple academic honor societies. While in college, he enlisted in the Navy and went on to Officer Candidate School where he was commis-sioned as an officer. After graduation, Rev. Kahl served his coun-try for four and a half years as an officer in the United States Navy. During his service as a Submariner on the USS Key West, he felt God pulling on his heart to pursue another career. This calling led Rev. Kahl to attend Lutheran Theological Southern Seminary, where he graduated cum laude. He was ordained as a minister on May 29, 1992 at Lenoir Rhyne College. Now, he is not only the head pastor at New Life Lutheran Church, but also the principal at Christ the King Christian Academy. He and his wife, Cindy, have two children, Joshua and Lisa. Rev. Kahl has shown immense commitment to God and his country over the years. He is a man of principled values and strong faith who continues to embody the true meaning of public service. It is my hope that he will re-main an active leader in the community for years to come. Mr. Speaker, please join me today in hon-oring Rev. John Beatty Kahl for his 25 years of service to his community. RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF FALL-EN MISSISSIPPI ARMY NA-TIONAL GUARD SERGEANT FIRST CLASS (SFC) SABURANT PARKER HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 26, 2017 Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of Mississippi Army Na-tional Guard Sergeant First Class (SFC) Saburant Parker, known to his friends as ‘‘Sabot’’ (sab-oh), who paid the ultimate sac-rifice while defending our great nation on May 23, 2005, during Operation Iraqi Freedom. SFC Parker was killed when his military vehi-cle was struck by an improvised explosive de-vice in Haswa, Iraq. Also killed were Specialist (SPC) Bryan Edward Barron, Sergeant (SGT) Audrey Daron Lunsford, and Sergeant (SGT) Daniel Ryan Varnado. SFC Parker, a Foxworth native, was as-signed to C Company, 1st Battalion, 1–155th Infantry Regiment, Mississippi Army National Guard, Biloxi, Mississippi. SFC Parker served in the Mississippi Army National Guard for 16 years and served with the 155th Separate Ar-mored Brigade in Bosnia. SFC Parker was also employed as a loader operator at Angie Lumber Company in Angie, Louisiana, and wrestled on the weekends for Southern Cham-pionship Wrestling. He was the 2004 cham-pion of the cruiser weight division. Major General (MG) Harold A. Cross, Mis-sissippi Army National Guard Adjutant Gen-eral, posthumously awarded SFC Parker the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star and the Mis-sissippi Medal of Valor during a memorial service held at Hurricane Creek Baptist Church in Hattiesburg. He spoke to the audi-ence during the service and was quoted in an Associated Press article. ‘‘Once again we come together in a small community to honor a soldier,’’ MG Cross said. ‘‘It comes to mind that over 1.2 million people have paid the ultimate sacrifice in our 228-year history that we might be free.’’ Mississippi Army National Guard Brigadier General (BG) John Rhodes served as the 1– 155th infantry battalion commander in 2005. BG Rhodes recently said SFC Parker will be remembered along with those who died with him. ‘‘SFC Parker, SPC Bryan Edward Barron, SGT Audrey Daron Lunsford, and SGT Daniel Ryan Varnado are remembered in many ways, but we knew them as warriors who rep-resented something larger than themselves,’’ BG Rhodes said. ‘‘They operated in a hostile environment and faced the dangers of combat on a regular basis.

SFC Parker’s daughter, Sheliah Parker, shared that her father’s service made the fam-ily proud. ‘‘I’m very proud,’’ Sheliah said. ‘‘He is the reason why I pushed myself so hard to become the first college graduate in the fam-ily. He is the reason I wanted to succeed. I think about him every day.’’ SFC Parker is survived by his wife, Kitza, daughters, Merissa and Sheliah, stepson, Ramsey Cumpton, mother, Ora Lee Hayes, brother, Mark Parker, and sister, Sable Parker. SFC Parker’s sacrifice to protect our nation will always be remembered.

LUBIN WALTER HUNTER 
HON. LEE M. ZELDIN 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 26, 2017 Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Lubin Walter Hunter on his 100th birthday, and to thank him for his years of dedicated service to our community, state and nation. Lubin Walter Hunter, the oldest living mem-ber of the Shinnecock Indian Nation and old-est living veteran in the Town of Southampton, was born and raised on the Shinnecock Indian Reservation in Southampton, NY.

HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 26, 2017 Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of Mississippi Army Na-tional Guard Specialist (SPC) Bryan Edward Barron who paid the ultimate sacrifice while defending our great nation on May 23, 2005, when his military vehicle was struck by an im-provised explosive device in Haswa, Iraq. Also killed were Sergeant (SGT) Audrey Daron Lunsford, Sergeant First Class (SFC) Saburant Parker, and Sergeant (SGT) Daniel Ryan Varnado. SPC Barron was assigned to C Company, 1st Battalion, 1–155th Infantry Regiment, Mis-sissippi Army National Guard, Biloxi, Mis-sissippi. SPC Barron, a Biloxi native, was hoping to be home from Iraq in time for his daughter’s first birthday when he was killed. A relative told the Associated Press that SPC Barron left behind two daughters. ‘‘I can say this. He died a hero,’’ his brother- in-law, Ken Daniels, said in 2005. ‘‘He was a true American. He found it worthwhile. He found it worth the risk to put his life in dan-ger.’’ SPC Barron was memorialized with the naming of the Natchez Army National Guard Readiness Center in his honor. Many family members, soldiers, and friends were on hand for the dedication of the building. Mississippi Army National Guard Brigadier General (BG) John Rhodes served as the 1– 155th infantry battalion commander in 2005. BG Rhodes recently said SPC Barron will be remembered along with the others who died with him. ‘‘SPC Bryan Edward Barron, SGT Audrey Daron Lunsford, SFC Saburant Parker, and SGT Daniel Ryan Varnado are remembered in many ways, but we knew them as warriors who represented something larger than them-selves,’’ BG Rhodes said. ‘‘They operated in a hostile environment and faced the dangers of combat on a regular basis.

SPC Barron’s daughter, Hayley Barron, shared how proud she is of her father’s serv-ice. ‘‘I am tremendously proud,’’ Hayley said. ‘‘What he has done, laid the foundation for my sister and me for years to come. He went to Iraq for a very good purpose.’’ SPC Barron is survived by his wife, Aman-da, daughters, Hayley Barron, Jaden Barron, mother, Cynthia Barron, sisters, Sandy Barron, Jodie Barron, Susie Barron, and brother, Cory Barron. SPC Barron’s sacrifice to protect the free-doms we all enjoy will not be forgotten. CELEBRATING THE LONG CAREER AND RETIREMENT OF BEVERLY ROWE HON. JASON SMITH 
OF MISSOURI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 26, 2017 Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Beverly Rowe of Rolla, Missouri, as she retires after more than forty- nine years of public service. Her longstanding career at Fort Leonard Wood was dedicated to assisting military service members and their families in many capacities. Ms. Rowe began her career on October 30, 1967, as a military personnel clerk, preparing reassignment orders for prior-service and medically evacuated soldiers returning to ac-tive duty, and soldiers assigned to the Special Processing Detachment. She managed the Hometown Recruiting Assistance Program, Junior Enlisted Travel, and United States Mili-tary Academy Preparatory School candidates. She also served as the basic training assign-ment lead clerk and with the AG Trainee/Stu-dent Personnel Section. Beverly was promoted to the position of su-pervisory travel assistant with the Central Port Call Office in February 1984. In September 1993, Ms. Rowe began work-ing in the Retirement Services Office as a contact representative, a survivor benefit counselor, and processed enlisted and officer retirement applications. She was later selected as the Retirement Services Officer. Most recently, Ms. Rowe became the Tran-sition Services Manager in June 2012, working with the Soldier for Life Transition Assistance Program. Ms. Rowe completed college courses at Central Texas College, Drury University, and the University of Colorado-Denver while work-ing at Fort Leonard Wood. Upon retirement, she plans to continue living in Rolla and volun-teering at Leach Theater. She has a lifetime of service at Fort Leon-ard Wood, providing expertise, stability, con-tinuity of operations, and critical support on a daily basis. I celebrate with Beverly Rowe as she enters retirement after more than forty- nine years.

Marine Corps for four years. After working in wireless data communications, Sgt Lambert reenlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in Novem-ber 2000. A proud Eagle Scout, Sgt Lambert was in-spired to join the Marines by his uncle, Carroll Brown, who served in the U.S. Marine Corps in Vietnam. He liked to listen to his stories. Shortly before his death, Sgt Lambert wrote an article that appeared on Memorial Day in his hometown newspaper, The Banner-Inde-pendent. ‘‘I am a Marine,’’ he wrote. ‘‘It has al-ways been a dream for me to be in the Ma-rines. I love the challenge. I continuously work and sweat for it. I feel that I need to give back to my nation what so many have gave before me.’’ Sgt Lambert left behind a wife, Betty Oswalt Lambert, and daughter, Kinsey Jade Lambert, of Rienzi. Though he died the day before her second birthday, Kinsley Jade recently said how much she enjoys hearing the stories about her father. She is proud of his service. ‘‘I’m proud of him for being in the military,’’ Kinsley Jade said. ‘‘I respect that. He did it for our country.’’ ‘‘I have always been proud. He was my hero,’’ Mrs. Lambert said. ‘‘He was the one who was going to keep the evil from coming to America. He was loved.’’ In 2013, Sgt Lambert was memorialized with the renaming of a portion of Highway 4 in Prentiss County in his honor.

WHY RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND HUMAN RIGHTS ARE CRITICAL TO U.S. NATIONAL INTERESTS 
HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 26, 2017 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, over the past forty-two years, much has changed in Vietnam. The Vietnamese people are a little richer, but still have few rights. The Vietnamese Communist Party has opened up a bit to the outside world, but re-mains closed to democratic reforms and the rule of law. U.S.-Vietnamese relations have warmed be-cause Vietnam fears China’s increasing eco-nomic power and its incursions in the South China Sea, but we see few human rights im-provements emerge from better relations. Over the past two years, Human Rights Watch has used the words ‘‘dismal’’ and ‘‘abysmal’’ to describe Vietnam’s human rights record. Vietnam scored a 7, the lowest score, on Freedom House’s ‘‘Freedom in the World’’ index. From sex and labor trafficking to the censor-ship of the press and Internet; from restrictions on independent labor unions to severe repres-sion of faith communities, the Vietnamese Government and Communist Party is one of the world’s worst abusers of human rights. For too long Vietnam has gotten a free pass on human rights. Diplomats are so focused on the fact that Vietnam is ‘‘not China’’ that this oppressive police state is granted trade and security benefits without condition. There is a silent human rights crisis going on in Vietnam that must be addressed. Human rights should be a top talking point when President Trump meets next week with Vietnam’s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc. Doing so will advance U.S. economic and se-curity interests and it will be warmly welcomed by the Vietnamese people. The President has a real opportunity to bring about tangible reforms in Vietnam if he links better U.S.-Vietnam relations to tangible human rights improvements. I have been to Vietnam. I have met with its rights advocates and young activists for dec-ades now, like imprisoned rights activist Nguyen Van Dai. I know there is a younger generation in Vietnam—66% of Vietnam is under the age of 40—that looks to the U.S. as a land of opportunity and freedom. They want the same liberties enjoyed by their relatives in California, Texas, Virginia, Louisiana and so many other places where former Vietnamese refugees have flourished. The Vietnamese people want the U.S. to be a voice for freedom—because their voice is si-lenced. No government that represses its own peo-ple or restricts fundamental freedoms can be a trusted ally of the United States. No govern-ment that censors the Internet, tortures and jails dissidents, and crushes civil society should be given generous trade or security benefits without conditions. The President will face pressure from his advisors and the business community to look at Vietnam through the lens of trade deals and the containment of China. Hopefully, he will be able to see the situation more clearly than past Administrations. Failing to press for real and concrete human rights improvements underestimates U.S. le-verage and will disappoint the young genera-tion in Vietnam who are that country’s dy-namic future. It should be clear by now that Vietnam needs the U.S. markets and security commit-ments much more than the U.S. needs Viet-nam’s markets and security cooperation. If history is any guide, the President’s, championing of individual rights will meet with some success. If his interest in human rights is sustained, those successes could be tan-gible and far-reaching. The Vietnamese government has responded to concerns expressed by the last two Admin-istrations when they linked human rights im-provements to better U.S.-Vietnam relations. Whether to gain entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Trans-Pacific Part-nership (TPP) or to address U.S. concerns over religious freedom abuses, the Viet-namese government took steps toward reform when pressed by past American Presidents. It is when the U.S. loses interest in human rights that conditions regress. The Communist leaders in Hanoi take our trade benefits and security commitments and continue repressing those seeking political re-form and universal freedoms. The business of the Communist Party is staying in power and repressing those they believe will challenge their power. They will not embrace human rights improvements or the rule of law unless it is a firm condition of better relations with the U.S. I am circulating a letter for the signatures of other Members of Congress detailing the stra-tegic opportunities available for the United States and the Vietnamese people if the Presi-dent pursues a robust human rights agenda. The letter urges the President to pursue Internet freedom, religious freedom, inde-pendent labor unions, and the release of pris-oners of conscience—as a condition of U.S. assistance. These fundamental freedoms are directly re-lated to U.S. interests in a better business cli-mate, less corruption, investor confidence, ex-pansion of economic freedom, and civil society development. I also wrote to Secretary Rex Tillerson to urge more robust human rights diplomacy in Vietnam, particularly on the issue of religious freedom. I urged the Secretary to use the authorities given him by the Frank Wolf International Reli-gious Freedom Act and the Global Magnitsky Act, legislation I introduced, that was passed into law last year to hold individual govern-ment officials accountable for human rights abuses and restrictions on religious freedom. The U.S. Commission on International Reli-gious Freedom (USCIRF) recommended that Vietnam be designated as a ‘‘Country of Par-ticular Concern’’ for severe and egregious reli-gious freedom restrictions. That report pro-vides compelling evidence of egregious and ongoing religious freedom violations in Viet-nam. The President should follow USCIRF’s rec-ommendation and immediately designate Viet-nam as a CPC for its religious freedom viola-tions. This designation carries with it potential sanctions and visa denials for Vietnamese government officials complicit in religious free-dom abuses. No Vietnamese government official who tor-tures political dissidents or restrictions the ac-tivities of religious communities should profit from access to the U.S. or our financial sys-tem. Let me say that the violence and intimida-tion faced by Hmong and Montagard Chris-tians, by Khmer Krom Buddhists, by the inde-pendent Hoa Hao and Cao Dai groups is out-rageous. The torture faced by Ms. Tran Thi Hong is shocking. She was on her way to meet religious freedom Ambassador David Saperstein to advocate for the release of her husband Pastor Nguyen Cong Chinh. If there are religious prisoners, if forced re-nunciations of faith are happening, if pagodas and churches and places of worship are forc-ibly closed—how does Vietnam not meet the criteria for CPC? We know it does. Politics should not play a part in designations. I will be working closely with the State De-partment to make sure international religious freedom is a diplomatic priority. This funda-mental freedom is not merely a humanitarian issue with little strategic value—it is critical to our security and prosperity.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE739 May 26, 2017 
Research shows that countries that em-brace and protect religious freedom are more economically successful, protect women’s rights, and experience less terrorism and polit-ical instability. There is not a single country that respects religious freedom that poses a security threat to the U.S. In fact, just the op-posite is true—countries who are the worst violators of religious freedom are often those who seek to do Americans the most harm and seek to tear down democratic values and insti-tutions. These facts alone should give us pause in expanding relations with Vietnam. President Trump should not prop up Viet-nam’s Communist old guard because they are not Vietnam’s future. That future lies with Nguyen Van Dai and the many bloggers and advocates of political reform and human rights who seek our freedoms more than our trade. U.S. policy must send the unmistakable message to the Government of Vietnam that human rights improvements are fundamental to better relations, critically linked to our mu-tual economic and security interests, and will not be ignored or bargained away.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF FALL-EN MISSISSIPPI ARMY NA-TIONAL GUARD SERGEANT (SGT) AUDREY DARON LUNSFORD 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 26, 2017 Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of Mississippi Army Na-tional Guard Sergeant (SGT) Audrey Daron Lunsford who paid the ultimate sacrifice while defending our great nation on May 23, 2005, during Operation Iraqi Freedom. SGT Lunsford was killed when his military vehicle was struck by an improvised explosive device in Haswa, Iraq. Also killed were Specialist (SPC) Bryan Edward Barron, Sergeant First Class (SFC) Saburant Parker, and Sergeant (SGT) Daniel Ryan Varnado. SGT Lunsford, a Sardis native, was as-signed to Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 1st Battalion, 1–155th Infantry Regiment, Mississippi Army National Guard, McComb Mississippi. SGT Lunsford enlisted in the Army after he graduated from high school in 1993. He served as a U.S. Army Ranger. After com-pleting four years of service in the Army, SGT Lunsford became an officer with the Sardis Police Department and a firefighter for the Tunica Fire Department. In January 2005, SGT Lunsford enlisted in the Mississippi Army National Guard. His wife, Vangi, says he reenlisted because he wanted to provide for his family, including his daugh-ter, Paris Audrey, should something happen to him. Vangi says her husband was committed to fighting for freedom. ‘‘Daron wanted to fight for our family’s free-dom,’’ Vangi said. ‘‘He also wanted to fight for others who couldn’t go to the battlefront.’’ Brigadier General (BG) John Rhodes served as the 1–155th infantry battalion commander in 2005. He recently praised SGT Lunsford and the soldiers who died with him on that day. ‘‘SGT Audrey Daron Lunsford, SPC Bryan Edward Barron, SFC Saburant Parker, and SGT Daniel Ryan Varnado are remembered in many ways, but we knew them as warriors who represented something larger than them-selves,’’ BG Rhodes said.. ‘‘They operated in a hostile environment and faced the dangers of combat on a regular basis. Yet, if given the choice, they would not have wanted it any other way. They sacrificed their lives trying to provide a better life for people who they did not know. This is who they were and what they represented. They exemplified the mod-ern day Mississippi Riflemen. Stand Fast, Mis-sissippians! Stand Fast!’’ During Operation Iraqi Freedom, Lieutenant Colonel (LTC) Andrew Robertson served as company commander of Charlie Company, 1– 155th Infantry Regiment, MS Army National Guard, Biloxi, Mississippi, serving operational control under 2–11 Armed Cavalry Regiment (ACR), U.S. Army. He says there were no greater people than the Charlie Company sol-diers who endured being in the most dan-gerous and highest casualty area of operation as part of OIF III under Task Force 155 Heavy Brigade Combat Team. ‘‘In 2005, there were no greater Americans than our fallen patriots, Charlie Company in-fantrymen and their families. None greater. This, I believe, America needs to know,’’ LTC Robertson said. SGT Daron is survived by his wife Vangi, daughter, Paris Audrey, mother Martha Sue Lunsford, and siblings; Donna Miller, Danny Lunsford, David Lunsford, Kim Lunsford Diffree, Michael Lunsford, and Alton Lunsford. SGT Lunsford’s devotion to America and the sacrifice he made will not be forgotten.

RECOGNIZING PROFESSOR JEFFREY FAHRENWALD 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 26, 2017 Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Professor Jeffrey Fahrenwald who is retiring from Rockford University. Professor Fahrenwald has become a pillar in the Rock-ford community, and he will be greatly missed. Professor Fahrenwald is the Director of the MBA program at Rockford University, where he has taught in areas of human relations, management, leadership and international studies. He has enriched our community through his leadership in small business de-velopment, in addition to serving on numerous not-for-profit boards. Professor Fahrenwald’s contributions to our community have not gone unnoticed, and he was named one of our re-gion’s ‘‘People You Should Know’’ in 2011, and ‘‘Citizen of the Year’’ in 2014 by the Rock-ford Chamber of Commerce for all his tireless work to empower those living in the Rockford community. It is because of dedicated and selfless lead-ers such as Professor Fahrenwald that I am especially proud to serve Illinois l7th Congres-sional District. Mr. Speaker, I would like to again formally congratulate Professor Jeffrey Fahrenwald on his well-earned retirement and thank him for all of his contributions and serv-ice to our community. RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF FALL-EN SOLDIER ARMY STAFF SER-GEANT (SSG) DAVID DWAYNE SELF HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 26, 2017 Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of fallen soldier Army Staff Sergeant (SSG) David Dwayne Self who paid the ultimate sacrifice while defending our nation on May 16, 2011, during Operation En-during Freedom. SSG Self died from wounds sustained after his unit was attacked with an improvised explosive device in Spin Ghbarga, Zabul province, Afghanistan, during his fourth tour of duty. SSG Self was one of four Amer-ican soldiers killed in the insurgent attack. SSG Self was assigned to the Fires Squad-ron, 2nd Stryker Calvary Regiment, Vilseck, Germany. SSG Self graduated from Pearl High School in 2000 before enlisting in the U.S. Army. According to an article written by Nate Rawlings, SSG Self was a, ‘‘quiet, steady non-commissioned officer who knew his job well.’’ Rawlings also shared, ‘‘we never heard him complain about anything’’ and praised SSG Self’s ability to work calmly under pressure. As an example of SSG Self’s calmness under pressure, Rawlings said SSG Self once evacuated his wounded gunner after an artillery shell exploded underneath their ve-hicle. He is survived by his father and step moth-er, Eddie F. Self and Kathleen Self; his moth-er, Linda Rhodes; his sister, Kimela Shull; and his step sisters, Lorene Thomas and Sherry Wilmouth. The sacrifice of this brave soldier will always be remembered.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. PRAMILA JAYAPAL 
OF WASHINGTON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 26, 2017 Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I strongly be-lieve that crimes against children are particu-larly egregious. It is our duty as members of Congress to do everything we can to prevent these crimes and hold offenders accountable. However, I felt compelled to vote against H.R. 1842, H.R. 1862, and H.R. 1761, as each of these flawed bills would increase the applica-tion of mandatory minimum sentences in the U.S. criminal justice system. Judges already have the ability to impose harsh sentences in these cases as they see fit. Mandatory min-imum sentences make it impossible for judges to take context or circumstance into consider-ation, which eliminates judicial discretion and compromises the futures of those at the hands of our justice system. Mandatory minimums create a glaring disproportionality between crime and according punishment and subse-quently expand prison populations, strain re-sources and structures of support, and dis-proportionately impact communities of color. Because of my stance on this issue and my steadfast resolve to fight any expansion of mandatory minimum sentences, I have voted against each of these bills. I remain committed

OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 26, 2017 Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of Marine Private First Class (PFC) Stephen Phillip Baldwyn who paid the ultimate sacrifice while defending our great nation on May 5, 2005. PFC Baldwyn was killed in an explosion, while he was con-ducting combat operations in Nasser Wa Sa-laam, Iraq.

During his military service, he received the Purple Heart, Combat Action Ribbon, National Defense Service Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Navy Sea Service Deployment, and Navy and Ma-rine Corps Overseas Service Ribbon. He was also awarded the Rifle Marksman badge. PFC Baldwyn was born on May 7, 1986, in Saltillo, MS. He earned his Eagle Scout badge before graduating from high school in 2004 and leaving for boot camp. He was 19 years old at the time of his death. PFC Baldwyn is survived by his parents, Danny and Stephanie Baldwyn. The sacrifice of this brave Marine will al-ways be remembered.

RECOGNIZING GREG GARRISON 
HON. TODD ROKITA 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 26, 2017 Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and salute the distinguished ‘‘Voice of the Heartland’’, Greg Garrison, who has an-nounced that he will retire from his radio pro-gram on June 9, 2017. I wish to express my admiration and appreciation for Mr. Garrison and his constant dedication to his conservative Hoosier values. Greg’s commitment to the rule of law and justice began before he took to the airwaves, serving the community through his law firm Garrison Law, which focuses on personal in-jury, business, and commercial law. It was through his diligent work in his practice that he gained fame during the high profile prosecu-tion of boxer Mike Tyson in 1992. That case lead to opportunities to offer legal analysis na-tionwide for major trials such as O.J. Simpson and Timothy McVeigh, and on various media platforms such as 60 Minutes, the Today Show, 48 Hours, the FOX News Channel, Ri-vera Live and ESPN. Greg became a Hoosier treasure through his radio program that began twenty years ago. His program, Garrison, became an insti-tution of measured thought and Hoosier val-ues. He connected with his listeners through his warm demeanor that sounded more like a friend than a commentator. He was a positive influence on the lives of the countless Hoo-siers that spent their mornings listening to him. I have known Greg for almost as long as he has been on the air. As Secretary of State, I was a guest on his show on several occa-sions, speaking about the need to improve election integrity with the adoption of the state’s photo ID law. We also discussed inves-tigations into voter fraud and redistricting re-form. As a member of Congress, my appear-ances were more frequent as a regular on his program until he cut back his hours and moved to a later timeslot. I will always remem-ber he asked tough, but fair questions teeming with Hoosier common sense. While it will be sad to not hear his voice over Indianapolis’ airwaves every day, he will not be disappearing from the scene com-pletely. He plans to be on the radio every now and again and he plans to stay active in his law practice. But his daily presence will be missed. Congratulations to Greg on twenty years of service to the Hoosier state and a happy and well-deserved retirement. RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF FALL-EN SOLDIER ARMY SERGEANT (SGT) MARK ALLEN MAIDA HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, May 26, 2017 Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of fallen soldier Army Sergeant (SGT) Mark Allen Maida who paid the ultimate sacrifice while defending our na-tion on May 27, 2005, during Operation Iraqi Freedom. SGT Maida died of wounds he suf-fered when an improvised explosive device detonated near his vehicle in Diyarah, Iraq. SGT Maida was assigned to the 2nd Squad-ron, 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, attached to Mississippi’s 155th Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force, Fort Irwin, California. SGT Maid chose to join the Army shortly after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. He joined the Army on October 31, 2001, and was assigned to Fort Irwin, Cali-fornia, where he assisted in training soldiers in preparation for deployment to Iraq. Fallen He-roes Project writes that SGT Maida was origi-nally scheduled for discharge in October of 2004, and he was planning to attend Madison Area Technical College. Instead, his service was extended, and he was deployed to Iraq in January of 2005. SGT Maida was born in Madison, Wisconsin on November 15, 1982 to parents Ray and Diane Maida. He graduated from Memorial High School in 2001. According to Fallen He-roes Project, Chris Maida, a veteran, at-tempted to talk his brother out of enlisting. Chris said, ‘‘He just laughed. He loved life and he wasn’t afraid of anything.’’ The Chicago Tribune writes that SGT Maida was ‘‘known for a great sense of humor and loved hunting, fishing and the outdoors; but most of all he loved his family and friends.’’ SGT Maida’s survivors include his parents, Ray and Diane Maida; a sister, Juliann Mutch; two brothers, Aaron Maida and Christopher Maida; one grandmother, Olga Herman; two nieces and two nephews. The sacrifice of this brave soldier will always be remembered.
