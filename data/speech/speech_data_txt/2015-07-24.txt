The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. M CCONNELL. Madam President, 
the hard work to pass a bipartisan, fis-cally responsible, multiyear highway bill that doesn’t raise taxes or increase the deficit continues. It hasn’t been easy. We always knew obstacles would lie ahead at every turn, and they sure have, but our country needs a multiyear highway bill, and we will get there if we just continue to stick to-gether. 
Perhaps the most challenging issue 
now relates to amendments. Sup-porters of the Ex-Im Bank are demand-ing a vote to reauthorize it, and they have made it clear they are ready to stop all other amendments if denied that opportunity. They have already proven they have the votes to back up the threat as well. This presents a challenge for the Senate and to oppo-nents of the Ex-Im Bank, like myself in particular, but I believe we can still move forward, and I believe the more equitable and more balanced proposal I just offered will allow us to do so. 
So let me explain. It provides for 
votes on two long-sought, nongermane amendments. First, it allows a vote on an amendment to reauthorize the Ex- Im Bank, something nearly every Dem-ocrat wants. Second, it allows a vote on an amendment that would repeal ObamaCare, something nearly every Republican wants and something we will continue to fight for. 
Ex-Im shouldn’t be the only vote we 
take on this bill, and under the com-promise I just filed, it will not be. That is a much fairer way forward. 
I would urge my colleagues to join 
me in voting against Ex-Im, and I urge every Senator to take this important opportunity to join me in voting to fi-nally give the American people the fresh start they deserve on health care. 
I know we will engage in a robust de-
bate on all of these issues—we should— and then we will take a vote. While the clock demands that we file cloture given that the highway trust fund will expire at the end of next week, I hope we still have a robust amendment proc-ess on this critical bill. 
So I would encourage every one of 
my colleagues to work with the bill managers on their germane amend-ments. 
Senators should also note this: Yes-
terday, I circulated bill language to both sides of the aisle that I intended to use to modify my amendment No. 2266. That language contained tech-nical and conforming edits as well as 
the removal of a provision related to fugitive felons that was not needed to fully offset the bill. 
I wanted to let my colleagues know 
the amendment I just offered contains one additional modification. It re-moves provisions that would have ter-minated the $1.7 billion Hardest Hit Fund mortgage program. Several Sen-ators on both sides of the aisle—and in particular Senator P
ORTMAN on our 
side of the aisle has been a real cham-pion on this issue—expressed their op-position to its termination. So we have reduced spending levels in the bill to accommodate this change, while ensur-ing the bill remains fully paid for, for 3 years. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER  
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
Mr. REID. Madam President, I am 
just trying to focus. Did I just hear the legislative tree being filled? I can an-swer that question. 
TRAGEDY IN LAFAYETTE , LOUISIANA  
Madam President, this morning, 
Americans are waking to another news account of a tragic and senseless shoot-ing. This one occurred in Lafayette, LA. The details are emerging, but at least two were murdered and about a dozen others were wounded. 
We focus, as we should, on the inno-
cent people watching the movie who were murdered, but we also need to focus on the other dozen. How many of those people will be paraplegics, quadriplegics or have injuries that will follow them for the rest of their lives? Time will only tell. 
I know I speak for every Member of 
the Senate when I say our thoughts are with the victims, their families, and the many brave first responders who were at the scene. 
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT  
Madam President, once again the ma-
jority leader has cynically filed an-other repeal of the Obama health care legislation—it was legislation; it is now the law. I hope the Senate doesn’t try to catch up with the House as to how many times they are going to try to repeal it. 
It is a fact that the critics are stub-
bornly ignoring reality. That reality is that the bill passed many years ago. It has been reviewed in detail by various courts in the land and the highest courts in the land have upheld this law, including the Supreme Court, on two separate occasions. 
We passed the Affordable Care Act. It 
has been signed into law. The Supreme Court has upheld it on two separate oc-casions. It is time for the Republicans to move on and join us in trying to im-prove the health care delivery system we have in America today. It is time to move on to something else because now we are approaching 20 million people who benefit from the law that is now in existence. 
Madam President, 85 percent of these 
10.2 million consumers who have cov-erage in these exchanges have tax cred-its to help them afford that coverage.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5673 July 24, 2015 
These credits effectively cap premiums 
at a percent of income for those indi-viduals, defraying the impact of any premium increases. 
Without going into more numbers, 
with rare exceptions, the fact is every time I go home I have people come to me and say that we are so grateful for this law because my daughter can now get health insurance. We are not talk-ing about a bunch of teenagers; we are talking about people who were unable for all of their childhood and their adult life to get insurance until now. 
We need to move on. This is not pro-
ductive. I hope everyone will recognize that the health care delivery system is not perfect, but we are willing to work with the Republicans in trying to im-prove it, but let’s do it constructively. 
SEQUESTRATION  
Madam President, finally, unless we 
act, in 3 months the Federal Govern-ment shuts down. I appreciate that this is not just me speaking out that some-thing has to be done. The senior Sen-ator from Arizona has said over the last week or so how important it is for the defense of this country to get rid of sequestration. If sequestration kicks in, the funding for defense and non-defense will be exactly the same. The only way that can be changed is if we pass a law in the Senate. Frankly, I 
would think that is going to be hard to do. 
We believe we want to do everything 
we can to help the defense of this coun-try, our fighting men and women, but we are also concerned about nondefense programs which are in need of repair. 
It would be untoward to think we are 
going to do sequestration at the Na-tional Institutes of Health, as an exam-ple. Lifesaving, scientific research is being done there every day. The last sequestration knocked their pins out. I have talked to the head of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Francis Col-lins. For example, they were so close to coming up with a universal flu vaccine. They had to drop it. They lost almost $2 billion as a result of the first seques-tration. I am sorry to say another one that is staring them in the face will only be more hurtful to that great in-stitution. 
APPROPRIATIONS  
Madam President, I was terribly dis-
appointed yesterday to hear that my friend the Speaker of the House intends to give up on doing his job. He intends to abandon the appropriations process. He told a press conference yesterday: ‘‘It’s pretty clear given the number of days we’re going to be here in Sep-tember that we’re going to have to do a (continuing resolution) of some sort.’’ 
By relying on a continuing resolution 
that underfunds critical priorities for working men and women in America— especially our families—Republicans are neglecting their responsibilities and giving up on the middle class. In-stead of working together with Demo-crats to negotiate a long-term funding package, Republicans are calling it quits. A continuing resolution should be a 
last-ditch, eleventh-hour option, not an excuse 3 months before the deadline ap-proaches to just say we give up. 
I hope the Speaker of the House will 
change course and recommit his party to working with us. Three months, surely my Republican friends must re-alize, is more than enough time for us to do our jobs. 
Madam President, finally, there are a 
lot of complaints people can have about the legislation before the body, but I do want to commend the Repub-lican leader for having this amendment before us dealing with the Ex-Im Bank. It is very important that this legisla-tion move on, and I hope the House will pass it as soon as they get it. 
Right now, we have—let me just 
count them. I will not take the time here, but there are about 45 different countries that have working export-im-port banks that help their businesses and workers compete globally. They are really hurting our exports because our exporters are going to these other companies trying to get some help so they can continue exporting. So I truly do appreciate this being part of this legislation. It is an important piece of legislation. I am so glad the majority leader put that in as something we are going to work on over the next few days. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, today 
is a sad day for this institution. 
The Senate operates based on trust. 
Whether we are Democrats or Repub-licans, these 100 Senators have to be able to trust that when a Senator says something, he or she will do it, even if we disagree on substance—that we don’t lie to each other. 
What we just witnessed this morning 
is profoundly disappointing. I want to describe the context of two preceding discussions. 
A number of weeks ago, when this 
Senate was considering trade pro-motion authority, a group of Senators gathered on this floor and blocked TPA for many minutes because they were pressing for the Export-Import Bank. They huddled on this floor and nego-tiated a deal in front of C–SPAN and in front of the world. Then, when they had their deal, TPA had the votes to pass. 
Shortly thereafter, we had a Senate 
Republican lunch, where I stood and asked the majority leader, very di-rectly: What is the deal that was just cut on TPA and was there a deal for the Export-Import Bank? It was a di-rect question I asked the majority leader in front of all of the Republican Senators. The majority leader was visi-bly angry with me that I would ask 
such a question, and the majority lead-er looked at me and said: There is no deal. There is no deal. There is no deal. 
Like Saint Peter, he repeated it three times. 
He said: The only thing I told the 
proponents of the Export-Import Bank is, like any other Senator in this body, they could offer any amendment they liked on any amendable vehicle, but I gave them nothing. There is no deal. I gave them nothing. He was emphatic and he was repeated. 
Following that public discussion, 
Senator M
IKELEEand I approached the 
majority leader afterward, in which he emphasized: There is no deal. I will do nothing. I oppose the Export-Import Bank. All I said is they can offer an amendment like any Senator can to any bill. 
I went back to my office and I sat 
down and I had a long discussion with my staff. My staff told me that after-noon: He is lying to you. That is what my staff said. We have been around the Senate a long time. He is not telling you the truth. 
What I told my staff that afternoon, 
I said: Well, I don’t know if that is the case or not, but I don’t see how, when the majority leader looks me in the eyes and makes an explicit promise— and by the way, looks into the eyes of every other Republican Senator and says that to every other Republican Senator—I don’t see how I cannot take him at his word when he makes an ex-plicit promise. 
As a result, I cast my vote in May in 
support of TPA because I support free trade, and I felt I had no choice but to assume that when the majority leader spoke to 54 Republican Senators and made an explicit promise, he wasn’t lying to us. Well, as TPA moved on and it went to the House, it became abun-dantly clear there was a deal. There was a deal in the House for the Export- Import Bank. So the second time TPA came up, I voted no because of that corrupt deal. 
Now, I will note to the public that 
the majority leader and the Speaker of the House had repeatedly said: There was no corrupt deal. There was no cor-rupt deal. We made no deal. We made no deal. That is one element of the background context. 
Let me tell you a second element of 
the background context. A number of weeks ago, when we were debating the Corker-Cardin bill, the Iran review act, there were a number of amendments that Senators had filed. I filed an amendment that would actually put teeth in the Iran review act by requir-ing affirmative congressional approval before sanctions on Iran could be lifted. Other Senators filed very good amend-ments. Senator M
ARCO RUBIO filed an 
amendment calling for Iran to recog-nize Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish State before sanctions could be lifted. Our friends on the Democratic side of the aisle did not want to vote on that amendment, and in response, the ma-jority leader cut off all amendments.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5674 July 24, 2015 
Now, I sat in the majority leader’s of-
fice, and I urged the majority leader: Invoke cloture on Senator R
UBIO’s 
amendment. Invoke cloture on Senator R
UBIO’s amendment calling on Iran to 
recognize Israel’s right to exist and setting that as a precondition of any lifting of sanctions. I argued vocifer-ously with the majority leader that if 
the Democrats were so opposed to vot-ing on that amendment, that was all the more reason, because it was impor-tant substantively. The majority lead-er said no, he would not do so, that in-voking cloture on an amendment was an extraordinary step, and he would not do so. So he cut off every amend-ment. He filled the tree. 
It was striking a minute ago seeing 
the Democratic leader, Senator H
ARRY  
REID, calling out the majority leader 
for filling the tree, for engaging in the same procedural abuse that H
ARRY  
REIDdid over and over and over again 
in this body. Now the Republican lead-er is behaving like the senior Senator from Nevada. 
What we just saw was not, Madam 
President, what the majority leader told you and me and every other Re-publican Senator. What we just saw was not that the proponents of the Ex-port-Import Bank, like anyone else, could stand up and offer whatever amendment they like on any issue. What the majority leader did is, No. 1, he called up that amendment. He called it up himself. Why does that matter? Because, as the majority lead-er, he has priority of recognition. When he calls up an amendment, no one can stop him. He didn’t just call it up; he filled the tree. Just like H
ARRY REID, 
he filled the tree, blocking everyone else’s amendment. And, by the way, I agree with Senator R
EIDwhen he says 
the ObamaCare amendment is a cyn-ical amendment. Of course it is. It is empty showmanship. 
We will have a vote on repealing 
ObamaCare. The Republicans will all vote yes, and the Democrats will all vote no. It will be at a 60-vote thresh-old. It will be an exercise in meaning-less political theater. Mind you, when we had a fight in October of 2013 to ac-tually stop ObamaCare and defund it, the majority leader, then the minority leader, was opposed to doing something with real teeth in it to stop ObamaCare. But an empty show vote— that is a good way of distracting from what is going on. 
You know, there is a profound dis-
appointment among the American peo-ple because we keep winning elections and then we keep getting leaders who don’t do anything they promise. The American people were told: If only we have a Republican majority in the House, things will be different. Well, in 2010, the American people showed up in enormous numbers, and we got a Re-publican majority in the House, and very little changed. Then the American people were told, you know, the prob-lem is the Senate. If only we get a Re-publican majority in the Senate and re-tire H
ARRY REIDas majority leader, 
then things will be different. Well, in 2014, the American people rose up in enormous numbers and voted to do ex-actly that. We have had a Republican majority in both Houses of Congress now for about 6 months. 
What has that majority done? The first thing we did in December is 
we came back and passed a trillion dol-lar CRomnibus plan filled with pork 
and corporate welfare. That was the very first thing we did. Then this Re-publican majority voted to fund ObamaCare, voted to fund President Obama’s unconstitutional Executive amnesty. Then leadership rammed through the confirmation of Loretta Lynch as Attorney General. Which of those decisions would be one iota dif-ferent if H
ARRY REIDwere still major-
ity leader? Not a one. Not a one. This Senate operates exactly the same—the same priorities. Let me tell you why. It is not that this majority doesn’t get things done. It does get things done. But it listens to one and only one voice; that is the voice of the Wash-ington cartel—the lobbyists on K Street, the big money and big corpora-tions. 
If you go to the American people and 
ask if reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank is a priority for you, the standard re-sponse for most of them would be this: The what? They don’t even know what this is. Let me tell you what it is. It is an egregious example of corporate wel-fare. It is the American taxpayer being on the dime for hundreds of billions of dollars in loan guarantees given out to a handful of giant corporations. It is a classic example of cronyism and cor-porate welfare. By the way, among oth-ers, do you know what person had the clarity of thought on that? Then-Sen-ator Barack Obama, who described it as a classic example of corporate wel-fare. That was when he was in the Sen-ate. Now that he is in the White House, corporate welfare sounds pretty good. Now, just about all of the Democrats are supporting the corporate welfare with the exception of B
ERNIE SANDERS . 
I will give credit to Senator S ANDERS  
for standing up against corporate wel-fare. But as to every Democrat who rails against big money and the corrup-tion of Washington, as to every Demo-crat who styles himself or herself a populist, their actions on this matter speak far louder than their words. When it comes to Republicans, Repub-licans also are listening to K Street and the lobbyists. Why? It is not com-plicated. The giant corporations that are getting special favors from the tax-payers hire an army of lobbyists who write campaign checks after campaign checks. And, by the way, these checks go to both Democrats and Republicans. It is career politicians in both parties who are kept in office by looting the taxpayer to benefit wealthy powerful corporations. 
The single largest recipient of loan 
guarantees from the Ex-Im Bank is the Boeing corporation. The Boeing cor-poration just had an earnings call 
where their CEO said—and I am para-phrasing: We’ll be just fine without the Ex-Im Bank. It is not impacting us. There are plenty of private loan alter-natives out there. But even though the market could provide, it is a lot easier to have compliant lawmakers rob from the public fist to enrich giant corpora-tions. 
Do you know who doesn’t have lobby-
ists? A single mom waiting tables. Do you know who doesn’t have lobbyists? A teenage immigrant like my father, washing dishes, making 50 cents an hour, struggling to achieve the Amer-ican dream. Do you know who doesn’t have lobbyists? A factory worker who just wants to work and provide for his or her children. They don’t have lobby-ists, and so what happens? Career poli-ticians in both parties gang up with giant corporations to loot their taxes to make it harder for people who are struggling to achieve the American dream. 
Coal miners, Madam President, in 
your State don’t have lobbyists who are representing them here—the indi-vidual miners—while the majority leader teams up with the Democratic leader to take from their paychecks to fund giant corporations. It is wrong and it is corrupt. 
It saddens me to say this. I sat in my 
office. I told my staff: The majority leader looked me in the eye and looked 54 Republicans in the eye. I cannot be-lieve he would tell a flatout lie, and I voted based on those assurances that he made to each and every one of us. What we just saw today was an abso-lute demonstration that not only what he told every Republican Senator but what he told the press over and over and over again was a simple lie. 
This institution should not operate 
at the beck and call of lobbyists in Washington. This institution, the ma-jority and minority leaders arm in arm again, should not team up against the American taxpayers. It is why our chil-dren are going bankrupt. 
Now we are facing an enormous 
threat with this Iran deal. A nuclear Iran poses the greatest national secu-rity threat to this country. Yet the majority leader refused to do what he just did for the Export-Import Bank on Iran. He refused to invoke cloture. That was an extraordinary step. If he was telling us the truth when he said there was no deal, why would he do what he just did? Well, we now know that when the majority leader looks us in the eyes and makes an explicit com-mitment, he is willing to say things that he knows are false. That has con-sequences for how this body operates. If you or I cannot trust what the ma-jority leader tells us, that will have consequences on other legislation as well, on how this institution operates. 
There are a host of amendments that 
the American people have focused on— issues such as defunding Planned Par-enthood after the gruesome video. The majority leader doesn’t want to vote

on that. That is actually something 
the American people are focused on. He brought up his ObamaCare amendment as a smokescreen, because it is in-tended to fail. But you know, what he didn’t bring up was my amendment to end the congressional exemption from ObamaCare—the corrupt deal that H
ARRY REIDcut with President Obama 
to exempt Members of Congress. We ought to live under the same rules as everybody else. The majority leader doesn’t want to vote on that because he doesn’t want to end the cronyism for Members of Congress any more than end the cronyism for giant corpora-tions that enrich themselves at the ex-pense of the American people. 
There are a host of priorities for the 
voters who elected you and me. Madam President, I would ask you to think about when you were running for the Senate not too long ago. Do you recall any of your constituents ever saying: We want the Export-Import Bank. No, they want other things. They have other priorities, but those are not the priorities of the Republican leadership. 
Sadly, today we have government of 
the lobbyists, by the lobbyists, and for the lobbyists. That is not how the Sen-ate is supposed to operate. A far more important amendment than bringing back this corporate welfare and cro-nyism is my amendment that provides that sanctions on Iran cannot be lifted unless and until Iran does two things: No. 1, it recognizes Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish State, and No. 2, it re-leases the four American hostages lan-guishing in Iranian prisons. That is a far more important issue than enrich-ing some more lobbyists on K Street and getting a few more campaign con-tributions. That is what we should be voting on. 
Accordingly, Madam President, I call 
up my amendment No. 2301 to the McConnell amendment No. 2266, as modified. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
amendment is not in order to be of-fered, as it is inconsistent with the Senate’s precedents with respect to the offering of amendments, their number, degree, and kind.

peal is debatable.

Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I

one dissenting vote to move forward with a 6-year reauthorization of our highway and transit programs. 
People say: How did the committee 
do it? You are so split on other issues. 
It is because we recognize—all of us, 
whether we are liberal, progressive, moderate, conservative, very conserv-ative—that it is essential for our great Nation to have an infrastructure that works. Last week, a bridge collapsed in California. It was a miracle no one was killed. That bridge carries people from California to Arizona. That means commerce goes over that bridge. That means passenger cars go over it. 
This is what happened. This is what 
it is about. It is not about what com-mittees got in a room. It is not about Senator C
RUZ’s ideological issues. It is 
not about any lobbyist. It is about the hard, cold fact that more than 60,000 of our bridges are structurally deficient. It is very hard to go to bed at night knowing we have not done anything about this except just do these short- term extensions of the highway trust fund where States are simply not un-dertaking the kinds of projects they need to undertake, which are inspect-ing those bridges and moving forward with repairing and strengthening them. 
The reason I have this here—to me, it 
is the poster child of why, on a bipar-tisan basis, we need to continue to move forward. Forget about the naysayers on the Democratic side. For-get about the naysayers on the Repub-lican side. Let’s have those of us who see this as the issue, not the process, you know, not the sequester which we have to solve—it is not part of this. 
We have two bad problems facing us: 
the highway trust fund that funds the transit and highway system and se-quester is another problem. If we can solve this problem now, let’s solve this problem now. 
We have a coming together, a very 
odd coalition here of Republicans and Democrats, despite the fact, I venture to say, that not one person loves this bill. There are always going to be things in a bill you don’t like. We stripped some of the pay-fors that were hurting our cities. Thanks to Senators P
ORTMAN , STABENOW , and P ETERS , that 
was done. That is good. We have a bill that is fully paid for, for 3 years—the first time in 10 years. 
We can always find problems. We can 
always say: Why are we doing this and not doing that? Well, the reason we are doing this is—if my numbers are right—we are single digits away from the highway trust fund going bust. It goes bust on July 31. Imagine. And we are fighting about this? We ought to be moving this faster. Oh, no, we have a filibuster; we have to be in this week-end. But it is worth it. I asked my staff to figure it out. Over the 3-year period, it is 2 million jobs—2 million jobs. That is a quarter of the jobs that were lost in the great recession. The fact is, those families are suffering still—over 500,000 construction workers out of work. I want to say this. When people say 
‘‘Well, the lobbyists are winning here,’’ who are the people who are pushing us for a bill? 
I would ask the American people— 
make your decision. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the International Union of Operating Engineers, the Laborers’ International Union of North America, the AAA, the U.S. Conference of May-ors, the United Brotherhood of Car-penters, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Of-ficials, Mothers Against Drunk Driv-ing, American Council of Engineering Companies—I would just say to folks that this is a rare coming together of America. The Presiding Officer has been around here for a while. It is hard to find the U.S. Chamber on the same page as the Laborers’ International and on the same page as Mothers Against Drunk Driving and the Conference of Mayors and engineering companies. 
Let’s continue looking at this list: 
the American Highway Users Alliance, the American Public Transportation Association, the American Road & Transportation Builders Association, the Society of Civil Engineers, the American truckers, the Associated Equipment Distributors, the general contractors, the equipment manufac-turers, the Association of Metropolitan Planning Organizations, the National Asphalt Pavement Association. 
Labor has come together with busi-
ness. Cities have come together with States. The users of the roads, the AAA—remember how we call them when our car breaks down, sometimes because it falls into a pothole and gets all messed up? The AAA wants this done. 
I am saying that this is an oppor-
tunity. There are naysayers on every-thing. It is rare that we can come to-gether and get anything done. This is one of those moments. 
I want to share the fact that, on av-
erage, Federal funds provide 52 percent of every State’s outlays for highways and bridges—52 percent, the average. There are some States that rely on the Federal Government more. I will tell you which States they are: Montana, 87 percent reliance on the Federal Gov-ernment; Idaho, 68 percent reliance; Or-egon, 54 percent reliance; Colorado, 64 percent—in other words, these States are counting on us—New Mexico, 70 percent; Minnesota, 64 percent; Mis-souri, 65 percent; Oklahoma, 63 per-cent; Mississippi, 65 percent; Alabama, 68 percent; Georgia, 62 percent; South Carolina, 79 percent; New Hampshire 57 percent; Vermont, 86 percent—I am sorry, New Hampshire is 68 percent— Maine, 57 percent; Rhode Island counts on it for everything, almost 100 per-cent; Connecticut, 71 percent; DC, 52 percent; Alaska, 93 percent; Hawaii, 79 percent; West Virginia—I thought my friend would be interested—61 percent reliance. 
So what I am trying to say is that if 
we do not succeed on this and we give it a patch again, our States will shut

down. Seven States have already shut 
down their programs. They cannot sign contracts to fix any bridge. If seven States have already shut down and we do another extension, we are talking about hundreds of thousands of jobs bleeding—bleeding. We will spin back into a bad situation. 
I see the Senator from Montana is 
here. I was just going through the list and showing that our States do rely on this highway program, and Montana relies on it for 87 percent of their spending. The average in the country is 52 percent, but a lot of our Western States that have so many miles rely on us more. My own State is 49 percent, but I have to say, we have 40 million people, and if we are not getting 49 per-cent of what we are used to getting, we are shutting down a lot of programs. 
I say all the time, if you want to get 
a house and you go to the bank and it says: Oh, you are cleared. You get a mortgage for 5 months. Well, you are not going to buy the house. You are not going to buy the house. You are going to say: Well, thank you for noth-ing. And that is the place we are. 
I know my colleague would like to 
have the floor, and I don’t need to say anything else except we have been working so hard across the aisle, Sen-ator D
URBIN and I, with Senator 
MCCONNELL and Senator I NHOFE . It has 
been a collaboration and it has been difficult. We come to the table with different ideologies and different ideas. We have hammered it out, and we have hammered it out because none of us, whether we are a Republican or Demo-crat, moderate or conservative or lib-eral, wants to see this happen again anywhere, but it is going to happen again. 
I can’t tell you how shocked I was. 
Imagine, anyone going to Arizona now has to go 400 miles out of their way. What does that do to commerce? What does that do to the truck drivers trying to deliver goods? What does it do to our tourist industry? How many people go back and forth? They are going to make a fix to this, but it is going to be a little tough because they are going to take one span and shut it down while they fix it and the other will be a one- way this way and that way. So it could be more dangerous. 
I just say thank you to my Repub-
lican friends, to my Democratic friends. We have two amendments, one is the Ex-IM Bank. We will vote on it on Sunday. Hopefully, that will pass and be attached to this bill. It is an im-portant jobs bill. 
The other one is a Republican amend-
ment to repeal ObamaCare. I will not go into it today, but I have to say the House has voted 55 times on this issue. The Supreme Court said it is fine. We are reaching 20 million Americans who now have health care. Why, as my friend the Democratic leader asked, don’t we just get together and make ObamaCare better? 
I have met so many people who are 
thrilled to have insurance, but there are ways we can make it better. But to 
talk about repealing something that is already in law, and it will be there—we can make it better. Let’s not keep this repealing ObamaCare idea out there be-cause it would hurt too many people and would create chaos. 
I hope we will vote against that and 
vote for Ex-Im. But much more impor-tant is that we are going to see Sen-ator C
RUZand others who want to dis-
rupt this, who will offer a lot of irrele-vant amendments—amendments on Iran, amendments on a woman’s right to choose. That is what is going to hap-pen. The Chair is going to rule in ac-cordance with precedent, and we are going to have to support the ruling of the Chair. It is going to be a tough and messy process. 
Someone said to me: Now that you 
are in the middle of this, is it true that passing a law is like making sausage? I said: Well, that would be an insult to sausage. That is how tough it is. It is tough. Last night, at 11:30, 20 minutes to 12, I thought the deal was off. It has been tough, but we managed to come together. 
We don’t want this to happen. We 
want to give certainty to the States, and I hope we will stick together, as strange as the coalition is—because it is an odd one of Republicans and Demo-crats, though it is the way the Senate used to work—and get this done. 
Again, I thank all Members, even the 
ones who have opposed me strongly and opposed Senator M
CCONNELL strongly. 
Thank you for being here, and I hope you will be here Sunday because we have a couple of very important votes. 
I thank the Chair, and I yield the 
floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. DAINES. Madam President, some 
in my home State of Montana like to say we have two seasons: winter and construction season. 
In fact, I grew up in the construction 
business. You learn in Montana there is a famous line when you are paving and putting in infrastructure. It is called 40 degrees and rising. In other words, if the temperature is not at least 40 degrees and rising, you are not supposed to pave. What that means is that we don’t have a real long con-struction season in Montana to build our highways. 
I also know how important it is to 
have certainty before you can break ground, before you can plan a project. With long winters and short summers, Montana construction workers know what it is like to wait for 40 degrees and rising before putting down the as-phalt. Unfortunately, they have also learned to wait a long time for a long- term highway bill that provides the certainty needed to make the long- term investments in infrastructure. 
Congress has passed 33—let me say 
that again, 33—short-term extensions in an attempt to keep the highway trust fund solvent. Those are 33 too many short-term extensions. As some-body who has spent 28 years in the pri-
vate sector, I think it is ridiculous as I watch the way the Federal Government operates to try to manage in this spurt-driven, short-term-driven envi-ronment of Washington, DC—and I would argue crisis-driven environment. 
This uncertainty, coupled with rigid 
programs that make planning and exe-cuting projects very difficult, is pro-hibitive to progress and strengthening the infrastructure in our country. These short-term extensions, these short construction seasons for those who live in the Northern part of our country, along with these rigid regula-tions, leave States such as Montana with their hands tied and hard-working Montana construction workers with their pockets empty. 
Montana’s short construction season 
is already well underway, and it is crit-ical that Congress approves a multiyear solution that provides Mon-tana and the rest of our country with the certainty needed to make long- term infrastructure investments. 
Montana’s extensive transportation 
is a pillar of our economy. It allows visitors, our tourists, to come to our State and enjoy our national parks. It allows our residents, including our farmers and our ranchers, the ability to traverse the State and to get their goods to market. In any final transpor-tation bill, it is critical to maintain Montana’s share of Federal highway, transit, and safety programs. 
Congress needs to maintain support 
for the rural as well as the metropoli-tan areas. In fact, vehicle miles trav-eled increased in Montana by 43 per-cent from 1990 to 2012—to nearly 12 bil-lion vehicle miles traveled. This is esti-mated to increase another 30 percent by 2030. 
Because Montana is a bridge State, 
we play a vital role in national connectivity. For example, Interstate 90 connects the east coast to the west coast. It runs from Boston to Seattle. I–15 connects our northern-to-southern borders. Now, I–90 is 3,000 miles long. Nearly 600 miles pass through the State of Montana. In fact, you add up the number of miles of interstate high-way we have in Montana alone, it is over 1,000 miles. How far is 1,000 miles? To put that in DC terms, it is like going from Washington, DC, to Kansas City. In fact, the I–15 stretch that runs north-south in Montana is the second longest section of I–15. It is only 4 miles shorter than the entire north- south direction of the State of Utah. 
In fact, studies by the research group 
TRIP have shown the two largest transportation challenges facing Mon-tana are I–90 and I–15. There is inad-equate capacity, there is deterioration of the pavement, and we need bridges replaced because these inadequacies will have a national impact. TRIP esti-mates $7.4 billion is needed to address Montana’s top 20 list of challenges. However, there is only $1.2 billion cur-rently available. That leaves a nearly $6 billion backlog.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5677 July 24, 2015 
What we need is to support a long- 
term highway bill. It creates construc-tion jobs—union jobs. That is what is sitting on the table right now and what we will be debating this week in the Senate. These new jobs, created by in-creased access and infrastructure ca-pacity, are being left unrealized. 
Specifically, in these times of con-
strained funding, it is critical to allow our States to have the flexibility to di-rect funds to their top needs and their most effective projects. The bill we are now debating will create a multiyear highway authorization and provide time to plan important long-term projects around the country and pro-vide 3 years of guaranteed funding for the highway trust fund. 
I am an engineer by degree. In fact, I 
am the only chemical engineer who serves in Congress. When you are in en-gineering, you take a look at a problem and you find a solution. When you are an engineer, you lay out project plans. We need to put certainty in place so we can plan to improve the infrastructure of this country—to rebuild our high-ways, rebuild our bridges that are so much in need of repair at the moment. 
If we pass a multiyear highway bill, 
it will reverse Congress’s trend of short-term, temporary bandaid fixes to fund the Nation’s transportation net-work. Across the country and in Mon-tana these patches have left States and localities without the certainty they need to plan and build long-term infra-structure projects. 
In the Senate committee on com-
merce, I have been working to ensure we have some of these needed reforms, and I want to thank Senator J
OHN 
THUNE for his efforts in leading the 
committee. I look forward to a robust amendment process and debate on this much needed legislation. 
The bottom line: I am looking for-
ward to passing a long-term, multiyear highway bill that provides certainty, that improves the infrastructure of our country and most importantly creates jobs. 
Madam President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I 
rise to express my deep appreciation to my colleagues Senators S
TABENOW and 
BROWN and to the majority leader for 
the bipartisan work that was done to remove a harmful and economically costly financing provision from the bill that is currently before this body. I had significant concerns with a provi-sion in the pending highway bill which could have impaired the economic re-covery in my home State of Michigan and in States across our country. 
I am a strong supporter of program-
ming to invest in our Nation’s infra-structure, and much of the substance of this bill is absolutely essential. I ap-plaud the work that has been done on a bipartisan basis to achieve a com-promise, something that happens too little in Washington. While I believe Congress must make smart invest-ments in our Nation’s roads, bridges, 
and infrastructure, I also believe we must do so in a responsible way that does not hamper the economic recovery occurring in our States. 
There are numerous financing policy 
alternatives available to lawmakers to fund infrastructure investments, but the drafters of this legislation origi-nally chose to pay for infrastructure investments, in part, by asking some of the hardest hit communities in our Na-tion and in my State to bear the bur-den in order to help pay for the infra-structure investments contained in this bill. I am talking about a provi-sion in the original bill and in the sub-stitute which would have eliminated an important economic recovery program called the Hardest Hit Fund. 
The Hardest Hit Fund has success-
fully supported efforts by local lenders to promote economic revitalization and renewal after the deepest and most painful housing and financial crisis in modern history. The Hardest Hit Fund helps States and municipalities invest in their citizens and in their commu-nities. According to the most recent data reported by the State of Michigan, the Hardest Hit Fund has assisted more than 25,000 of my constituents in pre-serving their piece of the American Dream—their family home. 
Not only are these funds being used 
to keep eligible families in their homes, but these dollars have also been put to work improving neighborhoods that have been devastated by urban blight resulting from America’s most recent economic challenge. 
In Michigan, we know the impact 
abandoned properties can have on eco-nomic renewal. Blight is not just ugly, creating eyesores and dragging down surrounding property values, empty homes and buildings also serve as way stations for criminals and drug dealers and further discourages outside inves-tors and homeowners from taking a chance on a neighborhood that has been affected by blight. 
That is why local leaders have been 
working with the nonprofit and private sectors to identify and eradicate blight in our communities. Several thousand blighted properties have been demol-ished or removed thanks to Michigan’s partnership with the Hardest Hit Fund, and thousands more are in the pipeline to be addressed in the near term. 
Thanks to the work done to address 
blight, homeowners are investing again in neighborhoods. Urban farming and greening and beautification efforts are well underway with businesses, non-profits, and local schoolchildren trans-forming their communities one block at a time. Some of the impacted cities have already made investments in this area in anticipation of reimbursement from the Hardest Hit Fund. It would have been an unfair and inappropriate breach of our agreement to pull the rug out from under these cities at this stage in the game. That is why I worked with Senators D
EBBIE STABE -
NOW and S HERROD BROWN to offer an amendment to strike this provision in 
the highway bill that would have re-scinded the remaining Hardest Hit Fund money from communities that most desperately need it. 
Congress must come together and 
pass a multiyear transportation bill that makes smart investments to up-grade our country’s crumbling infra-structure, but it would have been unac-ceptable to fund this plan at the ex-pense of the communities in Michigan and other States that rely on the Hard-est Hit Fund to eliminate blight and improve their local neighborhoods. This proposal not only risked future blight-removal funds, it could have left cities across Michigan on the hook for millions of dollars already outlaid for blight-removal projects. 
As legislators, it is important that 
we first do no harm when making pol-icy. In considering this highway bill, it is important for us not to harm the very communities we are aiming to help by advancing infrastructure poli-cies. 
It was important for us to act to 
avoid impairing the economic renewal that is underway in places such as De-troit, Flint, Grand Rapids, Saginaw, Pontiac, and other communities across my great State. Elimination of Hardest Hit funding would have been harmful to entire communities that are relying on public-private partnerships to trans-form their communities. 
For these reasons, I was prepared to 
oppose the legislation we are consid-ering today because I believed these changes would do damage to the eco-nomic recovery in my State. I could not in good conscience support this leg-islation under those conditions. But thanks to the unwavering dedication of my colleague, the senior Senator from Michigan, Ms. S
TABENOW , and the co-
operation of the majority leader, we were able to find a way forward that avoids disruption to this important program and avoids devastating eco-nomic outcomes in cities across my State. 
This is what the legislative process 
should be all about here in the Senate. We were able to come from a point of major disagreement, and through in-tense and respectful discussion, we were able to agree on a workable solu-tion. This process has demonstrated that colleagues on both sides of the aisle can work together to prioritize the needs of their constituents while also advancing the economic interests of our country. 
I look forward to further consider-
ation of this important legislation. 
SBA’S7 (a) LOAN PROGRAM  
Madam President, I wish to take a 
moment to express my gratitude to my colleagues in the Senate for prioritizing the needs of our Nation’s small businesses. 
Last night the Senate passed a crit-
ical and timely reform of the Small Business Administration’s flagship lending program, the 7(a) Loan Guar-anty Program. 
VerDate Sep 11 2014 04:07 Jul 25, 2015 Jkt 049060 PO 00000 Frm 00113 Fmt 0637 Sfmt 0634 E:\CR\FM\G24JY6.024 S24JYPT1SSpencer on DSK4SPTVN1PROD with SENATE
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5678 July 24, 2015 
Because of a growing economy and 
increased demand for small business loans, the SBA’s 7(a) lending authority for this fiscal year may have been jeop-ardized absent the actions we took last night. This bill increased the 7(a) loan program authority from $18.75 billion to $23.5 billion. It also tightened the standards on lenders’ determinations of borrower eligibility in order to target the SBA guaranty to promote loans to those who truly need it, and it included robust SBA reporting requirements that will keep Congress updated on the pace of lending going forward. 
I am glad we were able to act in a bi-
partisan fashion to address this issue to continue to put the wind at the back of our country’s entrepreneurs. We must make sure small businesses con-tinue to receive the resources they need to survive, to compete, and to succeed. 
I thank Senators V
ITTER , SHAHEEN , 
and R ISCH for their leadership on this 
matter. I have been working with them since the spring to increase the lending authority, and I am proud to say we ac-complished that for the rest of this fis-cal year. 
Small businesses need to access the 
capital they need in order to continue growing and creating jobs. The 7(a) program is a true success story that provides small businesses and startups with a versatile financing tool that can be used to support a wide range of busi-ness development activities. 
It is also a promising sign for our 
economy that demand for the 7(a) loan program is increasing at a faster rate than anticipated just last December when the previous authorization level was set. 
In last week’s semiannual ‘‘Monetary 
Policy Report’’ to Congress, the Fed-eral Reserve indicated that financing conditions for America’s small busi-nesses were continuing to improve. 
In recent months, SBA’s 7(a) program 
has experienced unprecedented de-mand, approving over 45,000 loans this year totalling more than $16.5 billion— a 25-percent increase over this same pe-riod last year. 
According to a Pepperdine University 
and Dun & Bradstreet study published this summer, America’s small busi-nesses are seeing rises in revenue, with 48 percent of surveyed small firms re-porting revenue increases—4 percent growth from 3 years ago. Demand for small business loans increased by 9 per-cent over the first quarter’s study. 
These are positive signs. We have 
more work to do, but they are very positive. If these trends continue, we 
will need to ensure that next year’s lending authorization level reflects the still-recovering economy and the growth of small business loan demand so that we will not be up against the cap again next year. 
The reporting improvements in the 
bill passed last night will also help Congress perform better oversight and monitor the developments in the 7(a) lending program in a more timely man-ner. The 7(a) program is a critical tool in 
the small business policy toolkit be-cause it helps our economy at no cost to the taxpayer. Let me repeat. This is a no-subsidy program, so this increased authorization comes at no cost to tax-payers. 
Small businesses are the backbone of 
our economy, and helping them grow and compete should be a bipartisan pri-ority. As a member of the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to explore other small business policy changes in the months and years ahead. Our Nation’s small businesses create jobs and help support our local tax bases, which in turn feed edu-cation, public safety, and health care priorities. 
It is not a stretch to say that if small 
businesses succeed, all of our commu-nities succeed. That is why I was proud to work with Senator R
ISCH as the lead 
cosponsor on the Small Business Lend-ing Reauthorization Act of 2015 earlier this year, and I was proud to work with the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship to pass this legisla-tion to deliver needed results last night. 
Madam President, I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NUCLEAR AGREEMENT WITH IRAN  
Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I 
rise today to join many of my col-leagues in the Senate to express grave concerns with the currently proposed Iran deal from the administration. This deal is fundamentally at odds with the goals that these negotiations set out to achieve in the first place, which were to prevent a nuclear Iran. In fact, this deal does the opposite. It provides a pa-tient pathway to the nation of Iran. 
With this deal, the administration 
has granted international blessing to a full-scale Iranian nuclear program in 15 years. With this deal, we let Iran keep its most prized nuclear assets, such as advanced centrifuges and to convert but not dismantle its nuclear reactors at Arak and Fordow. With this deal, the anytime, anyplace access to all of Iran’s nuclear facilities became man-aged access. With this deal, inspectors need 24-day permission from Tehran to access their military facilities such as Parchin, which we know were used for nuclear weaponization work in the past. 
With this deal, our economic lever-
age in Iran through the sanctions re-gime that was painstakingly built over a number of years will be completely squandered. With this deal, Iran will rebuild its economy and add economic resilience against future sanctions 
through $100 to $150 billion in economic relief and lifting the sanctions. 
With this deal, the arms embargo on 
Iran will be lifted in a mere 5 years, al-lowing the regime to double down on its terrorism activities, including its support for Hezbollah, Hamas, and the murderous Assad regime in Syria. 
With this deal, the ballistic missile 
embargo will be ended in 8 years. The ballistic missile embargo against Iran will be lifted in 8 years, directly endan-gering Israel and further down the line, the U.S. homeland. As with many as-pects of this agreement, hard-nosed verification gives way to Iran’s wishes. 
According to the new U.N. Security 
Council resolution, Iran is ‘‘called upon not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be ca-pable of delivering nuclear weapons.’’ That is the U.N. Security Council reso-lution. 
What if Iran ignores the call of the 
international community, as it has done through decades of deception and violations of U.N. Security Council res-olutions? 
There is no other way to describe 
this deal other than as a massive win for the Iranian regime at the expense of the national security of the United States and our closest allies. 
The leaders of the nation of Israel, 
the nation which Iran has threatened to ‘‘wipe off the face of the earth’’ have agreed. Has the President listened to our military and the intelligence com-munity before concluding this terrible deal? The 2014 Quadrennial Defense Re-view said: 
Even as Iran pledges not to pursue nuclear 
weapons, Iran’s other destabilizing activities will continue to pose a threat to the Middle East, especially to the security of our allies and partners in the region and around the world. 
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, General Martin Dempsey, testi-fied that ‘‘under no circumstances should we relieve pressure on Iran rel-ative to ballistic missile capabilities and arms trafficking.’’ 
Defense Secretary Ash Carter said: 
‘‘We want [Iran] to continue to be iso-lated as a military and limited in terms of the kinds of equipment and material they are able to procure.’’ 
Yet we have the conventional arms 
embargo lifted in 5 years and the bal-listic missile embargo in 8 years under this deal. The deal achieves none of those goals, but instead lets Iran off the hook to pursue arms exports and ballistic missile activities in only a few short years. 
Yesterday I had the opportunity to 
engage Secretary Kerry, Secretary Moniz, and Secretary Lew at the Sen-ate Foreign Relations Committee. I was left confounded and stunned by their responses. 
I questioned Secretary Lew about 
several of the top nuclear figures who will be given sanctions relief under this deal. These are individuals who are given sanctions relief under this deal:

Mohsen Fakhrizadeh-Mahabadi, known 
as the father of the Iranian nuclear program; Mr. Abbasi, whom the United Nations blacklisted in 2009 for being a close aide to Mr. Fakhrizadeh and working on nuclear programs in Iran and their very own ballistic missile program; and Gerhard Wisser, a Ger-man engineer who in 2007 was con-victed and sentenced to 18 years in prison by a South African court for his role in supplying centrifuge compo-nents to the A.Q. Khan black market network of nuclear proliferation. They received sanctions relief under this deal. 
When I asked Secretary Lew what 
message these delistings will send to proliferators around the world, his re-sponse was: 
I think that the message is if you violate 
the rules and develop nuclear weapons and we and the world take action against you— it will have significant consequence. But if you reach an agreement and you unwind your nuclear program that also will have consequence. 
The moral of the story, according to 
testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is if you cheat long enough on a large enough scale, the United States will negotiate to give you complete amnesty from the consequences. It is a simply stunning outcome. 
When I asked Secretary Kerry wheth-
er lifting the ballistic missile embargo will make Israel safer, his response was this: ‘‘absolutely no question whatso-ever that Israel is safer.’’ 
On the question of whether to lift the 
ballistic missile embargo against Iran, the Secretary of State believes that it will put Israel in a safer position to give the Iranians ballistic missiles by lifting the embargo. 
In fact, the Prime Minister has said 
in response to lifting a variety of sanc-tions, not including the ballistic mis-sile embargo: ‘‘I think to give Iran these capabilities is a grave mistake.’’ 
Yet Secretary Kerry believes that by 
lifting the embargo—the ballistic mis-sile embargo against Iran—there is ab-solutely no question whatsoever that it makes Israel safer. 
My guess is Prime Minister 
Netanyahu would certainly disagree with that statement. As he has already said, it would be a grave mistake. 
It is not just Prime Minister 
Netanyahu who believes it would be a grave mistake. It is the leaders on both the left and the right in Israel, who be-lieve that lifting these provisions is a grave mistake. To Secretary Moniz, I quoted a top former IAEA official—an agency that was brought up before throughout the committee hearing, an agency that has done this time and again and that we rely on, respect, and trust to carry out the elements of this deal. Former IAEA official Olli Heinonen said of this inspection re-gime: ‘‘A 24-day adjudicated timeline reduces detection probabilities exactly where the system is weakest: detecting undeclared facilities and materials.’’ This deal gives 24-day notice, not 
anytime, anywhere inspections—24-day notice. It is not anytime, anywhere, 24- day notice, which will allow them to hide and to be able to present facilities and materials in an undetected and undeclared manner. 
Secretary Moniz responded to this 
question: ‘‘We have to know where to look, and that’s the traditional role of intelligence—ours and those of our al-lies and friends.’’ 
If we are relying on intelligence to 
know where to look, what access did we actually gain from the deal with Iran? 
Finally, I asked the Secretaries how 
many imprisoned Americans will be freed as part of the deal. We all know the answer is none. Yet the father of Iran’s nuclear program will receive sanctions relief. 
Deal or no deal, four Americans, in-
cluding Pastor Abedini will continue to languish in Iranian jails. Deal or no deal, we will know nothing more about the whereabouts of Bob Levinson. Deal or no deal, this administration con-tinues to leave American citizens as prisoners to Iran. These American citi-zens being held captive are but one more reminder of the regime we are dealing with and why they are not an equal and should not be treated as an equal negotiating partner. Let us never forget the nature of the regime that was on the other side of the bargaining table. On October 23, 1983, a terrorist attack on the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, killed 241 American service men and women. Hezbollah, the wholly owned subsidiary of Iran, is widely believed to have been behind the attack. 
Last week, Gen. Joseph Dunford, the 
President’s nominee to lead the Joint Chiefs of Staff was asked about Ameri-cans killed in Iraq and Afghanistan by Iranian-supported militants. General Dunford said: ‘‘I know the total num-ber of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Ma-rines that were killed by Iranian ac-tivities and the number has been re-cently quoted as about 500.’’ 
So can a regime that has killed at 
least 700 American soldiers be relied upon to implement this deal in good faith and in a constructive atmosphere based on mutual respect as stated in the text of the agreement? Does the Iranian regime deserve mutual respect from the United States? It does not and it should not. President Obama insists that the only alternative to this deal is war with Iran. That is a false choice and should be rejected. 
The alternative to this deal is what 
the administration said it would achieve; that is, a good deal based on continued economic pressure and a genuine dismantling of Iranian nuclear programs verified by what was said would happen all along, anytime, any-where inspections, as promised by the administration. 
The President has gone to the United 
Nations to approve this deal without giving Congress or the American people a chance to consider the consequences 
of this agreement. I urge my colleagues to reject this Iranian nuclear gambit that endangers U.S. national security, the safety of our friends and allies around the world, and empowers the largest State sponsor of terrorism in the world. 
I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

RELIGIOUS FREEDOM  
Mr. HATCH. Madam President, in 
January 1941, President Franklin Roo-sevelt delivered his State of the Union Address as World War II was underway in Europe. Even in that dark time, President Roosevelt reminded us all of what he called ‘‘the simple, basic things that must never be lost sight of in the turmoil and unbelievable com-plexity of our modern world.’’ Reli-gious freedom was one of the four es-sential freedoms President Roosevelt outlined in that speech. 
President Roosevelt’s counsel applies 
today as the pace and degree of social and cultural change increase. Last month, for example, the Supreme Court held that laws defining marriage as it had been defined at all times and in all societies are now unconstitu-tional. A bill has just been introduced in this body that would prohibit dis-crimination on the basis of sexual ori-entation or gender identity in areas such as employment, public accom-modations, housing, and education. Some are even calling for punitive measures, such as revocation of tax-ex-empt status, for religious institutions that do not accept such social and cul-tural changes. 
Debates about these issues continue 
in all three branches of government, and I might say, branches of both Fed-eral and State governments among commentators and experts across the media and institutions, both religious and secular, and among our fellow citi-zens. President Roosevelt’s words ‘‘tur-moil and unbelievable complexity’’ seem to describe the situation today. 
Yet these debates are not occurring 
on a blank slate. Some advocates of the social and cultural changes now under-way ignore or perhaps never under-stood the history, importance, and value of religious freedom. They seem to treat religious freedom as optional and are willing to cast it aside as a cas-ualty of achieving certain political ob-jectives. That would be a grave error. 
I wish to describe to my colleagues 
the backdrop for considering or imple-menting these recent social and cul-tural changes. The religious freedom Americans enjoy has been nearly 400 years in the making. Almost two cen-turies before American independence, one religious community after another came to these shores seeking freedom to practice their faith. Professor Mi-chael McConnell, perhaps America’s foremost scholar of religious liberty, writes that by the time the First Amendment was ratified, ‘‘the Amer-ican states had already experienced 150

years of a higher degree of religious di-
versity than had existed anywhere else in the world.’’ 
The first individual right in the Bill 
of Rights is the free exercise of reli-gion. The choice of words is significant. The First Amendment does not protect only some exercises of religion or reli-gious exercise only by some people but the free exercise of religion itself. This term, the free exercise of religion, had appeared in American legal documents 
at least as early as 1648 and was a de-liberate choice by those drafting the new Constitution. 
In 1776, the Virginia legislature con-
sidered a constitution for the Common-wealth. George Mason proposed this language, ‘‘that all men should enjoy the fullest toleration in the exercise of religion.’’ James Madison thought this implied that the right to practice reli-gion was a governmental favor rather than an inalienable right. He proposed this language instead, ‘‘All men are equally entitled to the full and free ex-ercise of [religion], according to the dictates of conscience.’’ America’s Founders saw religious freedom as an inalienable right that government must respect rather than something the government can decide whether to tolerate. In fact, as Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg has written, America’s Founders saw religious free-dom as preeminent among fundamental rights. 
Religious freedom in America has 
two general features. It is universal in that it is a natural right shared by all people and a constitutional and civil right protected by law. Religious free-dom in America is also robust in that it has three dimensions—it is freedom not only of belief but also of behavior, it is freedom that may be exercised publicly as well as privately, and it is freedom to act both individually and collectively. These two basic features of religious liberty, that is both uni-versal and robust, can be seen not only in American history and heritage but also in the commitments that we, as a nation, continue to make. 
I will give three examples. In 1948, 
the United States joined 47 other na-tions in approving the Universal Dec-laration of Human Rights. Article 18 of that declaration states that every per-son has a fundamental right to reli-gious freedom, including ‘‘freedom, ei-ther alone or in community with oth-ers and in public or private, to mani-fest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.’’ There you see both the universal and robust nature of religious freedom. 
The United States reaffirmed this 
view of religious freedom by ratifying the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Article 18 repeats the principle that everyone has the freedom ‘‘either individually or in com-munity with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or be-lief in worship, observance, practice and teaching.’’ 
In 1998, Congress enacted the Inter-
national Religious Freedom Act, which passed by a voice vote in the House and 
by a vote of 98 to 0 in this body. This law States that religious freedom ‘‘ungirds the very origin and existence of the United States.’’ Congress has de-clared religious liberty to be a funda-mental right, a pillar of our Nation, a universal human right, and a funda-mental freedom. So 32 Senators serving today—18 Republicans and 14 Demo-crats—voted for that position either here or when they served in the House. 
In addition to Congress, Presidents 
have issued an annual proclamation designating January 16 as Religious Freedom Day. On that day in 1786, the Virginia legislature adopted the Stat-ute for Religious Freedom. In his proc-lamation—and I will refer to the chart—President Clinton proclaimed in his proclamation on religious freedom to be a fundamental human right, es-sential to our dignity as human beings, one of the most sacred of human rights, one of the core values of our de-mocracy. 
President George W. Bush said in his 
proclamation on his Religious Freedom Day that religious freedom is the foun-dation of a healthy and hopeful soci-ety, the birthright of every man, woman, and child throughout the world, one of our Nation’s most cher-ished values, one of our fundamental freedoms, and a cornerstone of our Re-public. 
President Obama has said in his proc-
lamations that religious freedom is one of our country’s fundamental liberties, the right of every person to practice their faith, how they choose, a critical foundation of our Nation’s liberty, a universal human right, an essential part of human dignity, a natural right of all humanity. 
The Supreme Court has held many 
times that religious freedom is a funda-mental right, and as it did in 1981, has held that the First Amendment ‘‘by its terms, gives special protection to the exercise of religion.’’ 
There is no getting around the fact 
that universal and robust religious freedom is the foundation of this Na-tion and an integral part of our na-tional identity and character. It is a preeminent right recognized by all three branches as fundamental. That is an important word. This is our herit-age, and it is the backdrop for our de-bates occurring today over social and cultural changes. 
Some advocates of these changes are 
spinning a fictional tale about reli-gious freedom in America. They may feel this narrative serves their political agenda, but that does not make their narrative true. 
As I described earlier, religious free-
dom in America is both universal and robust. It includes both belief and be-havior in public and in private, individ-ually and collectively. The advocates I have described want instead to make 
religious freedom selective rather than universal and reduce it to nothing more than an individual private belief. 
One of my Senate colleagues, for ex-
ample, said in an interview shortly after the Supreme Court’s decision 
that the First Amendment protects the freedom of ‘‘institutions of faith . . . to observe deeply held religious beliefs. But I don’t think it extends far beyond that.’’ 
This is more than rhetorical spin in 
the service of a political agenda; this is simply wrong. From its very origin, the concept of religious freedom in America has always been an individual right. From the earliest laws of the 17th century, to the founding of Amer-ica in the 18th century, to the laws, treaties, and proclamations of the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries, religious free-dom is first and foremost an individual right. 
The Supreme Court’s very first case 
involving the free exercise of religion in 1878 involved an individual. Adell Sherbert in the 1960s and Paula Hobbie in the 1980s—both Seventh-day Advent-ists—went to the Supreme Court after being fired for refusing to work on their Sabbath. Perhaps the most noto-rious free exercise case, Employment Division v. Smith, was brought by an individual. Whether these individuals won or lost, never did the courts say the right to religious exercise was not theirs. 
The argument by some that institu-
tions but not individuals exercise reli-gious freedom is mystifying for an-other reason. Congress enacted the Re-ligious Freedom Restoration Act—an act I had a lot to do with—in 1993 to make it difficult for government to interfere with the free exercise of reli-gion. We saw it coming and we passed that bill 97 to 3, and it passed unani-mously in the House. 
When a company went to court argu-
ing that a Federal mandate burdened its religious exercise, liberals objected because, they said, only individuals may exercise religion. But now they say that only churches exercise reli-gion. Think about that. They argued at one time that only individuals may ex-ercise religion, and now they are say-ing only churches can. Which is it— churches, individuals, or, as some would have it, none of the above? 
The Supreme Court also contributed 
to this false narrative in its recent marriage decision by saying that the First Amendment protects religious or-ganizations and persons, as they advo-cate or teach principles that are impor-tant to them. But that is not what the First Amendment says, nor does that describe its full meaning. Advocating or teaching would be protected under the First Amendment’s free speech clause. The First Amendment sepa-rately protects the free exercise of reli-gion, which includes much more. 
The current debates over social and 
cultural changes, including same-sex marriage and prohibiting discrimina-tion based on sexual orientation and gender identity, must take proper ac-count of the history, importance, and value of religious freedom. This is not a new concern. The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, for example, had a

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5681 July 24, 2015 
conference on this topic 10 years ago. 
Scholars on both sides of the same-sex marriage issue agreed that legislating same-sex marriage without robust reli-gious accommodations would create widespread legal conflict. In 2009, a group of leading scholars wrote the New Jersey Legislature, which was considering a bill to legalize same-sex 
marriage, outlining such conflicts for both individuals and organizations. 
I believe the best way forward is 
clear. Religious freedom should be properly accommodated rather than ig-nored, disparaged, or distorted, as some would do. Those acting on their reli-gious beliefs about marriage, for exam-ple, should not face government retal-iation or discrimination. And statutes prohibiting discrimination should in-clude robust religious exemptions. Doing so expands rights and protec-tions on one side without diminishing or eliminating them on the other. I supported the Employment Non-Dis-crimination Act last Congress, for ex-ample, because it took this balanced approach. And my State of Utah simi-larly enacted a law that both protects against discrimination and protects the exercise of religion. 
Government should not be in the 
business of retaliating against people because of their religious beliefs. This is true when individuals worship pri-vately as well as when they gather to-gether in religious organizations or as-sociations. When government retali-ates against a person or a group for acting in accordance with deeply held religious beliefs, it undermines reli-gious freedom and sends the message that the opinions of government offi-cials trump rights of conscience. It tells worshippers that their right to re-ligious exercise—far from being funda-mental—exists at the pleasure of the State. That is precisely the view that James Madison, the primary author of the Bill of Rights, rejected. 
Government retaliation further tells 
the believer that he or she is disfavored; the believer’s views are out of bounds; they have no place in our modern, advanced age. This view of government as the supreme arbiter of faith and morality is contrary to the vision of our Founders. It is contrary to the First Amendment. It is contrary to the line of cases that culminated in the Supreme Court’s recent marriage decision. Religion-based restrictions on intimate conduct, the Court said, must be struck down because moral dis-approval cannot form the basis of law. How ironic it would be if the very prin-ciple that underlay the victory over traditional marriage were suddenly cast aside in the effort to enforce the new morality. 
When government tells religious be-
lievers that they must conform to cur-rent State creeds or lose out on con-tracts, licenses, accreditation, funding, and other benefits, it puts them in an extremely difficult and indeed some-times impossible position—either vio-late your beliefs or forgo something which others have ready access to and 
which you may need to carry out your mission. 
Government should not be in the 
business of coercing citizens to con-done conduct their sincerely held reli-gious beliefs forbid; rather, govern-ment should allow space for the free exercise of religion. Surely we can work to end discrimination without re-taliating against religious groups and schools for following practices they all agree are rooted in sincere religious be-lief. Surely there is space in anti-discrimination laws, such as the one recently introduced here in the Senate, for religious exemptions for religiously affiliated groups, schools, and organi-zations. 
My point today is that religious free-
dom is not optional. It is a funda-mental human right that is central to our existence and identity as a nation, and it is the backdrop against which the current debates about social and cultural changes must proceed. 
Finally, I wish to ask my colleagues 
what principles would attract the sup-port of the following: Republican and Democratic Presidents; the chairman of People for the American Way; the president of Focus on the Family; the chairman of the U.S. Chamber of Com-merce; the president of the AFL–CIO; leaders of the faith communities, in-cluding Jews, Catholics, Mormons, Muslims, Baptists, Seventh-day Ad-ventists, and Buddhists; and the chair-men of both the Democratic and Re-publican National Committees? Can anyone think of anything that can bring all of those people together? What could they possibly agree on that would really mean anything? These and many more leaders of government, academia, faith communities, business, law, and minority groups all signed the Williamsburg Charter. This document was first presented to the Nation on June 25, 1988, on the 200th anniversary of Virginia’s call for a Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution. 
The charter presents certain first 
principles that are in the shared inter-est of all Americans. These include that religious freedom is a precious, fundamental right and an inalienable right founded on the inviolable dignity of the person. These are the Williams-burg Charter’s principles about reli-gious freedom—a precious, funda-mental, and inalienable right founded on the inviolable dignity of the person; that it is our Nation’s first liberty and undergirds all other rights and free-doms secured by the Bill of Rights; and that it allows citizens to shape their lives, whether private or public, on the basis of their beliefs. If these leaders who differ in so many ways and dis-agree on so many issues could agree on these principles, we should certainly be able to incorporate them into current debates. 
The signers of the Williamsburg 
Charter said that ‘‘the ignorance and contention now surrounding the [Con-stitution’s religion] clauses are a re-minder that their advocacy and defense 
is a task for each succeeding genera-tion.’’ I could not agree more. 
President Reagan said it best: 
Freedom is never more than one genera-
tion away from extinction. We didn’t pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same. 
I personally believe we can rise to 
that challenge. I think we must rise to that challenge. 
Religious freedom is the first men-
tioned freedom in the Bill of Rights. Frankly, it is time to get back to the constitutional principles that have made this country the greatest country in the world, and we can do it without violating other people’s rights. 
Some desire to reduce religious 
rights in favor of other people’s rights. Well, we don’t have to hurt other peo-ple’s rights by acknowledging and ac-cepting the fact that religious freedom is an absolute necessity for a great so-ciety such as ours and has been an un-dergirding principle that has helped make this country the greatest coun-try in the world.

carried forward by the brave men and 
women of our Capitol Police force. May they continue to do so, and may that bring some measure of comfort to every American mourning the loss of these brave officers again today. 
Mr. REID. Mr. President, there are a 
select few men and women who come to work every day with one primary job: to protect those of us who work in the United States Capitol and all who come here from all corners of our country to see the heart of our democracy. 
In 1998, two of those brave police offi-
cers gave their lives while protecting the Capitol. They were Special Agent John Gibson and Officer Jacob Chest-nut. 
Mr. President, 16 years ago today, a 
man entered the House side of the Cap-itol Building with a gun and shot Offi-cer Chestnut at point-blank range. Agent Gibson warned tourists and staff to take cover and then confronted the gunman. Although Agent Gibson was also shot, he prevented anyone else from being killed. 
Both officers died that day. They 
served a combined 36 years on the force protecting the Capitol. 
I knew Agent Gibson. Years before 
the shooting, my wife and I attended a Senate retreat in southern Virginia. My wife became ill. Agent Gibson ran to her side. I can still remember how he was sweating from running so fast to come to my wife’s aid. I have fond memories of these officers. 
Agent Gibson, who was from Massa-
chusetts, would race to the back of the sports section each morning to find the box score for his beloved Boston Red Sox. He was a generous neighbor and a 
loving father to his daughter and two sons. 
Officer Chestnut—everyone called 
him ‘‘J.J.’’—was a father of five who loved his job and loved his country. He served in the Air Force for 20 years and fought in Vietnam. At the time of the shooting, he was just weeks away from retiring. 
Gibson and Chestnut were laid in 
honor in the Capitol Rotunda, just steps from where they were murdered— a distinction Congress has conferred upon only a handful of Americans, in-cluding Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy, and our unknown soldiers. Jacob Chestnut was the first African- American ever to be so honored in our Capitol Rotunda. 
On this solemn anniversary, we pause 
to appreciate not just the bravery of two men who saved so many others but each and every Capitol Police officer who does his or her job so valiantly every single day of the year. On behalf of the entire United States Senate and everyone who works and visits here, thank you.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING PRATT & WHITNEY 
90TH ANNIVERSARY 
∑Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I would 
like to congratulate Pratt & Whitney for 90 years of success in the aviation 
industry. While there have been many important innovators in aviation over 
the past 90 years, Pratt & Whitney’s work on the jet engine deserves special recognition. 
Pratt & Whitney began operations in 
Hartford, CT, in August 1925. With a staff of 24 men and 2 women, the com-pany began work in the old Pope-Hart-ford auto plant. Under the direction of aviation engineer Fredrick Rentschler, this small team set out to build a new and improved aircraft engine. Despite limited funding and resources, Pratt & Whitney Aircraft succeeded in modern-ized the jet engine with revolutionary advancements like a powerful and de-pendable air-cooled radial engine. 
Through the many changes of the 
last 90 years, Pratt & Whitney’s en-gines have consistently powered the most advanced modern aircraft. The F135 engine, for example, designed by Pratt & Whitney, meets the exacting requirements of the F–35 Lightning II, which is one of the most techno-logically advanced military jets ever made. 
The jobs that Pratt & Whitney has 
created over the years have enriched Connecticut communities, and I am proud to honor Pratt & Whitney’s 90 years of incredible achievement. I wish them the best of luck in their next 90 years. ∑

TITLE LXII—MARKETPLACE FAIRNESS 
ACT 
SECTION 62001. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Market-
place Fairness Act of 2015’’. SEC. 62002. AUTHORIZATION TO REQUIRE COL-

Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement is authorized to require all sellers not quali-fying for the small seller exception described in subsection (c) to collect and remit sales and use taxes with respect to remote sales sourced to that Member State pursuant to the provisions of the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, but only if any changes to the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agree-ment made after the date of the enactment of this Act are not in conflict with the min-imum simplification requirements in sub-section (b)(2). Subject to section 62003(h), a State may exercise authority under this title beginning 180 days after the State publishes notice of the State’s intent to exercise the authority under this title, but no earlier than the first day of the calendar quarter that is at least 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act. 
(b) A
LTERNATIVE .—A State that is not a 
Member State under the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement is authorized not-withstanding any other provision of law to require all sellers not qualifying for the small seller exception described in sub-section (c) to collect and remit sales and use taxes with respect to remote sales sourced to that State, but only if the State adopts and implements the minimum simplification re-quirements in paragraph (2). Subject to sec-tion 62003(h), such authority shall commence beginning no earlier than the first day of the calendar quarter that is at least 6 months 
after the date that the State— 
(1) enacts legislation to exercise the au-
thority granted by this title— 
(A) specifying the tax or taxes to which 
such authority and the minimum simplifica-tion requirements in paragraph (2) shall apply; and 
(B) specifying the products and services 
otherwise subject to the tax or taxes identi-fied by the State under subparagraph (A) to which the authority of this title shall not apply; and 
(2) implements each of the following min-
imum simplification requirements:

sible for all State and local sales and use tax administration, return processing, and au-dits for remote sales sourced to the State; 
(ii) a single audit of a remote seller for all 
State and local taxing jurisdictions within that State; and 
(iii) a single sales and use tax return to be 
used by remote sellers to be filed with the single entity responsible for tax administra-tion. A State may not require a remote seller to file sales and use tax returns any more fre-quently than returns are required for non-remote sellers or impose requirements on re-mote sellers that the State does not impose on nonremote sellers with respect to the col-lection of sales and use taxes under this title. No local jurisdiction may require a re-mote seller to submit a sales and use tax re-turn or to collect sales and use taxes other than as provided by this paragraph. 
(B) Provide a uniform sales and use tax 
base among the State and the local taxing jurisdictions within the State pursuant to paragraph (1). 
(C) Source all remote sales in compliance 
with the sourcing definition set forth in sec-tion 62004(7). 
(D) Provide— (i) information indicating the taxability of 
products and services along with any product and service exemptions from sales and use tax in the State and a rates and boundary database; (ii) software free of charge for remote sell-
ers that calculates sales and use taxes due on each transaction at the time the transaction is completed, that files sales and use tax re-turns, and that is updated to reflect rate changes as described in subparagraph (H); and 
(iii) certification procedures for persons to 
be approved as certified software providers. For purposes of clause (iii), the software pro-vided by certified software providers shall be capable of calculating and filing sales and use taxes in all States qualified under this title. 
(E) Relieve remote sellers from liability to 
the State or locality for the incorrect collec-tion, remittance, or noncollection of sales and use taxes, including any penalties or in-terest, if the liability is the result of an error or omission made by a certified soft-ware provider. 
(F) Relieve certified software providers 
from liability to the State or locality for the incorrect collection, remittance, or non-collection of sales and use taxes, including any penalties or interest, if the liability is the result of misleading or inaccurate infor-mation provided by a remote seller. 
(G) Relieve remote sellers and certified 
software providers from liability to the State or locality for incorrect collection, re-mittance, or noncollection of sales and use taxes, including any penalties or interest, if the liability is the result of incorrect infor-mation or software provided by the State. 
(H) Provide remote sellers and certified 
software providers with 90 days notice of a rate change by the State or any locality in the State and update the information de-scribed in subparagraph (D)(i) accordingly and relieve any remote seller or certified software provider from liability for col-lecting sales and use taxes at the imme-diately preceding effective rate during the 90-day notice period if the required notice is not provided. 
(c) S
MALL SELLER EXCEPTION .—A State is 
authorized to require a remote seller to col-lect sales and use taxes under this title only if the remote seller has gross annual receipts in total remote sales in the United States in the preceding calendar year exceeding $1,000,000. For purposes of determining whether the threshold in this section is met, the gross annual receipts from remote sales of 2 or more persons shall be aggregated if— 
(1) such persons are related to the remote 
seller within the meaning of subsections (b) and (c) of section 267 or section 707(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or 
(2) such persons have 1 or more ownership 
relationships and such relationships were de-signed with a principal purpose of avoiding the application of these rules.

AND PROCESS. 
(a) R EVISED DEFINITION .—A revision to or 
guidance on a regulatory definition of the term ‘‘navigable waters’’ or ‘‘waters of the United States’’ promulgated or issued pursu-ant to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) after February 4, 2015, shall have no force or effect— 
(1) unless the revision adheres to the prin-
ciples under subsection (b); and 
(2) until after the Secretary and the Ad-
ministrator carry out each action described in subsection (c). 
(b) P
RINCIPLES .—In promulgating a revised 
regulatory definition pursuant to this sub-section, the Secretary and the Administrator shall adhere to the following principles: 
(1) The term ‘‘waters of the United States’’ 
under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) should identify bodies of water subject to Federal jurisdic-tion, and should include— 
(A) traditional navigable waters and inter-
state waters; 
(B) tributaries of navigable waters that are 
streams that contribute flow in a normal year through a surface hydrologic connec-tion to a traditional navigable water of suffi-cient volume, duration, and frequency that pollutants in the reach of the tributary would degrade the water quality of the tradi-tional navigable water, based on quantifiable and statistically valid measure of flow for the geographic area; and 
(C) wetlands situated next to a water of 
the United States that, in a normal year, protect the water quality of a navigable water by preventing the movement of pollut-ants to a navigable water. 
(2) The term ‘‘waters of the United States’’ 
under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) should not in-clude— 
(A) water that is located below the surface 
of the land, including soil water, permafrost, and groundwater; 
(B) water that is not located within navi-
gable water, interstate water, a territorial sea, a river, a stream, a lake, a pond, or a wetland; 
(C) a stream that does not contribute flow 
to navigable water, as described in paragraph (1)(B); 
(D) an isolated pond, whether natural or 
manmade, including a farm pond, fish pond, livestock watering pond, quarry, mine pit, ornamental pond, swimming pool, construc-tion pit, fire control pond, sediment pond, manure lagoon, and any other isolated facil-ity or system that holds water; 
(E) a lawfully constructed and operated 
water management system, other than a sys-tem component that is a traditional navi-
gable water; 
(F) waste treatment systems; and (G) prior-converted cropland (as defined in 
section 12.2(a) of title 7, Code of Federal Reg-ulations (as in effect on the date of enact-ment of this Act)). 
(3) In promulgating a revised definition of 
waters of the United States, the Secretary and the Administrator shall take into con-sideration that— 
(A) the use of a body of water by an orga-
nism, including a migratory bird, does not provide a basis for establishing Federal juris-diction under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.); 
(B) the dispersal of plant seeds and insect 
eggs through ingestion and excretion by birds and mammals does not provide a basis for establishing Federal jurisdiction under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.); 
(C) the supply of water to a groundwater 
aquifer and the storage of water in an iso-lated body of water are issues that— 
(i) pertain to the use of water resources 
that shall not be superseded, abrogated, or otherwise impaired by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) pursuant to sections 101(g) and 510(2) of that Act (33 U.S.C. 1251(g), 1370(2)); and 
(ii) do not provide a basis for establishing 
Federal jurisdiction under that Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.); and 
(D) evaporation, transpiration, condensa-
tion, precipitation, the overland flow of water, and the movement of water in an aq-uifer are all part of the water cycle and may connect all water over sufficiently long peri-ods of time and distances, but do not provide a basis for establishing Federal jurisdiction under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.). 
(4) Waters that are waters of the United 
States should be identified on maps provided by the Secretary and the Administrator to promote certainty and transparency in juris-dictional determinations.
