TRIBUTE TO JEANETTE AND JOE LEINEN 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 2, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Jeanette and Joe Leinen of Council Bluffs, Iowa on the very special occasion of their 60th wedding anniversary. They celebrated their anniversary on November 28, 2017. Jeanette and Joe’s lifelong commitment to each other and their family truly embodies Iowa values. As they reflect on their 60th anni-versary may their commitment grow even stronger, as they continue to love, cherish, and honor one another for many years to come. Mr. Speaker, I commend this great couple on their 60th year together and I wish them many more. I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating them on this momentous occasion.

RECOGNIZING THERESA CHIMEL FOR RAISING AWARENESS FOR PROPER PALLIATIVE CARE OP-TIONS IN NORTHWEST FLORIDA 
HON. MATT GAETZ 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 2, 2018 Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the continuous efforts of Theresa Chimel, Executive Director of Escambia Coun-ty Healthy Start Coalition, where she advo-cates for infants born exposed to drug use. Additionally, having lost a child of her own, she has dedicated her life to bring proper at-tention to the scarce availability of palliative care available in Northwest Florida. On August 18, 2013, Theresa’s son Asher died at the age of 12 having lived a life riddled with medical complexities. Asher, full of life, brought happiness to every person privileged to meet him. Due to limited palliative care op-tions, the Chimel family had to make the best experience from a limited amount of re-sources. Mrs. Chimel has since made it her mission to assist other children that suffer from such conditions, by providing resources and opportunities for their families. Her efforts have been noticed world-wide, and has taken her, along with her family, to London, England to speak at the Transforming End of Life Care for Children and Young People event where on this day she will be addressing members of Parliament. After her firsthand experience, Theresa pro-poses with high optimism that the care a child receives at the end of their life must be vastly improved. Families should not be burdened by such responsibility, but rather be allowed to build these precious moments in happiness and peace. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the United States Congress, I am profoundly grateful and privi-leged to congratulate Theresa Chimel on her efforts to better the experience of life for chil-dren from the beginning to the conclusion of their time here on Earth. f 
RECOGNIZING OSWEGO HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS VOLLEYBALL TEAM 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 2, 2018 Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Oswego Buccaneers Girls Volleyball Team on their well-deserved Sec-tion III Class A Championship. On November 4 at Fayetteville-Manlius High School, the Oswego Girls Volleyball Team fought hard to build a solid lead and then pull away from Jamesville-Dewitt High School. In the fifth set, the Buccaneers won the Class A Sectional title 3 to 2, maintaining a narrow four point lead during the remainder of the match. This is their fifth title in six years, an amazing accomplishment. The Buccaneers finished their season with a 10–0 in League Record, and a 14–2 Overall Record, due to the hard work of seniors Laurin Furlong, Samantha Gardner, Brianna Guentner, Kennedy Shurtleff, and Adeline Benjamin; and juniors Michaela Bradshaw, Maddie Armet, Willow-Su Knapp, Reagan Thompson, Lauren DeVinny, McKinley Thomp-son, Sarah Casaletta, Sofia Proano, Alexa Quesnell, and Lisa Klunker. The team was coached by Ronald Ahart, an exceptional leader with an accomplished volleyball re-sume. The Buccaneers played with heart and dedi-cation throughout the entire season. I com-mend the hard work, commitment, and team-work displayed by these young women. Excel-lence on the field translates to excellence off the field and the practice of sacrificing for the common goal builds character in our children. I could not be more proud to congratulate these young women on their tremendous sea-son.

PROCLAMATION OF LIBERTY AND VIRTUE ON BEHALF OF HOME-MAKERS FOR AMERICA 
HON. DIANE BLACK 
OF TENNESSEE  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 2, 2018 Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I would like to in-clude the following into the R
ECORD . 
DECLARATION OF MOTHERS : A P ROCLAMATION  
AND A PLEDGE FOR THE PRESERVATION OF  L
IBERTY & VIRTUE  As the mothers and primary Makers of the Homes of America—the molders the future of our nation—we declare that the liberty and freedom of all people begin in the home and that a nation is but a magnified home. The values and virtues taught within the family will determine the values and virtues of the nation as a whole. We recognize the sacred role of mother as the heart of the home and home as the heart of society. The liberty of each individual be-gins in the home and parents are, first and foremost the primary teachers and protec-tors of their children in a free society. Prop-erly constructed social, religious, and gov-ernmental institutions are designed to sup-port and strengthen the family unit not re-place it or regulate it. No association or gov-ernment organization can replace the family no matter how well-intentioned or well-de-signed it may be. The privilege of living as a free people in a free society is dependent on being a people of faith, virtue and patriotism—the three pil-lars of liberty—and these attributes are best developed and nurtured in the home. Each generation has a responsibility to instill a love of liberty and virtue in the heads of the next generation. We affirm that ‘‘All men and women are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights and to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, [re-ceiving] their just powers from the consent of the governed.’’ To secure the blessings of liberty, the Founding Fathers of the United States of America created a written constitution under the inspiration of Almighty God. The preservation of this sacred document and trust is dependent upon each generation, who bears the stewardship of safeguarding the constitution and teaching their children the rights and responsibilities associated with the noble cause of liberty and keeping the Republic. Every individual is born with intrinsic dig-nity that is inherent to each member of the human race. All men and women have the right to liberty, self-determination and self- governance. The individual’s responsibility of work, education, and industry are crucial elements of self-governance in society and the preservation of human dignity. The rights of a free people are protected and preserved through honorable, virtuous, leadership which invokes the nobility inher-ent in all men and women. Successful leaders in the home and family govern by correct principles, teach by example and stand for self-evident truths and liberty sustaining principles. As the lessons of history clearly dem-onstrate, we recognize that freedom is frag-ile. It is a rare and prized possession and re-quires constant care and vigilance for its preservation. Living as a free people does not come instinctively; principles of freedom must be studied and applied. Home and fami-lies with mothers who nurture and teach these principles produce leaders who honor and hold sacred the intrinsic dignity of the individual and inalienable rights endowed to all people. To safeguard the liberty and enhance the future of our children and grandchildren, we affirm our commitment to ‘‘stand fast in that liberty wherewith God has made us free’’ that ‘‘government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from the earth.’’

TRIBUTE TO NICHOLAS MITCHELL 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 2, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Nicholas Mitchell, of Clive, Iowa and a member of Boy Scout Troop 182 for attaining the rank of Eagle Scout. To earn the Eagle Scout rank, a Boy Scout is obligated to demonstrate how they live out the Scout Spirit in their life, to serve as a lead-er in their troop, earn a total of 21 merit badges, and, finally, to complete an Eagle Scout Project to benefit the community. For his project, Nicholas raised the necessary funds and materials needed to build a storage shed for the Waukee post of the VFW. The work ethic Cole has shown in his Eagle Scout Project and throughout his scouting career speaks volumes about his commitment to serving a cause greater than himself and bettering his community. Mr. Speaker, the example set by this young man and his supportive family and community demonstrates the rewards of hard work, dedi-cation, and perseverance. I am honored to represent Nicholas and his family in the United States Congress. I ask that all of my col-leagues in the United States House of Rep-resentatives to join me in congratulating him on obtaining the Eagle Scout ranking and in wishing him nothing but continued success in his future education and career.

2018 BLACK HISTORY MONTH 
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY 
OF INDIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 2, 2018 Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect that I take this time to recognize Black History Month and its 2018 theme, Afri-can Americans in Times of War. This year’s theme reflects on the crucial role of African Americans in the military. Throughout our his-tory, millions of African American men and women have bravely served our country, and their contributions to the betterment of our na-tion are to be revered. We applaud those who continue to work so diligently to improve and expand upon military opportunities for African American men and women, but we must al-ways acknowledge that there is more progress to be made. We take this time to honor and reflect on the struggles and triumphs of African Amer-ican people throughout America’s history. Afri-can Americans have played a major role in every war, from the Revolutionary War to the Civil War. However, for a large majority of those wars, these brave individuals failed to receive ample recognition for their achieve-ments. Let us take the time this month to re-count and praise the African American men and women who served our country during wartime, and to commend those who serve in the military today. The First Congressional District of Indiana, which I proudly serve, has a rich history steeped in military service. The late Quentin Smith, of Gary, Indiana, serves as a perfect example of what this year’s theme means to the community of Northwest Indiana and the entire country. Quentin Smith was a member of the Tuskegee Airmen, the renowned African American World War II air corps. This group escorted and protected bombers as they flew missions over Europe, and they seldom lost a plane. For his bravery, courage, and heroism, Quentin Smith, along with his fellow Airmen, was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. Following his military career, Mr. Smith contin-ued to serve his community, especially the youth, through teaching and serving as the first principal of Gary West Side High School. A committed public servant, Mr. Smith was also involved in local government as a mem-ber of the Gary City Council, among many other exemplary accomplishments. Mr. Smith passed away in 2013 at the age of 94, but his legacy will live on for generations to come. For his truly honorable military career and his dedication to his community, Quentin Smith is held in our highest esteem. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other colleagues join me in celebrating Black History Month and honoring the African American men and women who served in the past while com-mending those who serve today. We are for-ever indebted for their contributions to pro-tecting our great nation, and we thank them for their perseverance, sacrifice, and struggle. f 
A THREAT TO LABOR UNIONS 
SPEECH OF  
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, January 29, 2018 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman S
COTT for yielding and for an-choring this very important Special Order on the value of the labor unions, and the pending case of Janus v. AFSCME, Council 31, No. 16–1466, which is scheduled to be heard and decided by the Supreme Court this term. Mr. Speaker, it is my strong hope and ex-pectation that the Supreme Court will uphold the position advanced by Respondent AFSCME, Council 31. All workers should chip in their fair share to cover the cost of representing them. That is because unions work because all employees benefit from the terms and condi-tions of employment negotiated by unions. Fair share fees provide public service work-ers with the power in numbers they need to negotiate better wages, benefits and protec-tions that improve work conditions and set standards for everyone. The corporate special interests supporting this attack on labor unions want to weaken the ability of unions to build strength in numbers. That is why they want the Supreme Court to rule that workers can receive all the benefits of a union contract without contributing any-thing in return. I know it is fashionable today to disparage, downplay, or minimize the importance of orga-nized labor to our country. That is easy to do but it would be wrong. Those who would destroy or further limit the rights of organized labor—those who would cripple collective bargaining or prevent organi-zation of the unorganized—do a disservice to the cause of democracy. Fifty years or so ago the American Labor Movement was little more than a group of dreamers, and look at it now. From coast to coast, in factories, stores, warehouse and business establishments of all kinds, industrial democracy is at work. Employees, represented by free and demo-cratic trade unions of their own choosing, par-ticipate actively in determining their wages, hours and working conditions. Their living standards are the highest in the world. Their job rights are protected by collective bargaining agreements, and they enjoy bene-fits that were unheard of less than a genera-tion ago. Our labor unions are not narrow, self-seek-ing groups. They have raised wages, shortened hours and provided supplemental benefits. Through collective bargaining and grievance procedures, they have brought justice and de-mocracy to the shop floor. But their work goes beyond their own jobs, and even beyond our borders. Our unions have fought for aid to education, for better housing, for development of our na-tional resources, and for saving the family- sized farms. They have spoken, not for narrow self-inter-est, but for the public interest and for the peo-ple. Unions are as important as they ever were—because corporations are just as dedi-cated to their bottom line, regardless of the consequences for workers. Employers are trying to shed responsibil-ities—for providing health insurance, good pension coverage, reasonable work hours and job safety protections. The simple truth is that no one is forced to join a union and no one is forced to pay any fees that go to politics or political candidates. Rather, each public service worker chooses whether or not to join a union, but the union is still required by law to represent and nego-tiate on behalf of all public service workers— members and non-members alike. All employees receive the wage increases, benefits and workplace rights negotiated through the union. All workers should chip in their fair share to cover the cost of representing them. When working people have the freedom and opportunity to speak up together through unions, we make progress together that bene-fits everyone. Working people need a voice at work to keep employers from making our jobs look like they did 100 years ago, with sweatshop condi-tions, unlivable wages and 70-hour work-weeks. And lest we forget, it was the men and women of organized labor who rushed into the burning World Trade Center Towers when oth-ers were rushing out. The men and women of organized labor put their lives on the line for their fellow Ameri-cans everyday. They do not ask for much. All they ask is to be treated with respect and dignity. They want what we all want: to do their jobs and to make a better life for their families. The least we in the Congress can do is to go on record in support of our working men

HONORING THE LIFE OF JAMES MATTHEW EVANS 
HON. RODNEY P. FRELINGHUYSEN 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 2, 2018 Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Mr. James Matthew Evans, the late Landscape Architect of the United States Capitol. Matthew was an essential fixture in Wash-ington on Capitol Hill during his prestigious tenure from 1995 to 2011 as Landscape Archi-tect for the United States Capitol Building and Grounds. He was well regarded by his col-leagues, friends and many Members of Con-gress, alike, for both his friendly disposition and admirable work ethic. Matthew was dedi-cated to ensuring that the Capitol was well maintained, and made countless contributions to the aesthetics and design of its gardens and grounds. Prior to his work for the United States Capitol, Matthew honed his skills by working as a landscape designer in the private sector. While serving as Landscape Architect of the Capitol, Matthew worked to maintain hundreds of trees, shrubs, and millions of plants and an-nuals, and preserved perennial plantings around the 290 acre Capitol Complex, and oversaw the dedication of commemorative trees for many notable figures. In addition, Matthew was directly responsible for the de-sign and upkeep of Bartholdi Park, located be-tween the Rayburn House Office Building and United States Botanic Garden. Matthew was also the author of a book titled The Landscape Architecture of Washington D.C., a studied compilation of notable sites and places around the District of Columbia. He was a real student of history. Matthew is remembered by his wife Ruth Ann, whom he was married to for over thirty four years, and by his two daughters Kathy and Heidi. All of us take this moment to recog-nize and appreciate those, like Matthew Evans, who worked behind the scenes to keep our nation’s Capitol and grounds beautiful for decades. Mr. Speaker, I now ask that you and our colleagues join me in honoring the life of James Matthew Evans, retired Landscape Ar-chitect of the Capitol.

HONORING ALBERT J. GOMEZ 
HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON 
OF IDAHO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 2, 2018 Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Lieutenant Colonel Albert J. Gomez on his outstanding career as he retires from serv-ing as the West Point Field Force State Coor-dinator. LTC Gomez, Al, has set a standard of ex-cellence in Idaho, leaving a lasting, positive impression in the lives of many. For nearly 20 years he has been an invaluable asset to our offices. In 2000, the Idaho Congressional Del-egation began to hold an annual Service Academy Day. Service Academy Day is an opportunity to provide information to Idaho’s best and brightest young men and women who are interested in attending our nation’s service academies. Al has been instrumental in setting up Service Academy Day from the beginning while juggling deployment and other commitments. He has assisted numerous Idaho students with obtaining an exceptional educational and service opportunities available at the United States Military Academy at West Point. He is responsible for incorporating the principle method into the delegation’s nomina-tion process, which has made a significant dif-ference in the number of Idaho appointees to West Point. In fact, he is considered the ‘‘se-cret weapon’’ in our delegation responsible for the high success rate of Idaho students re-ceiving appointments to West Point. For LTC Gomez, his remarkable work has always been about his love for West Point and our country. He is known for his extraordinary mentorship of youth, and candidates are frequently told to listen to Al if they want to be successful. As a West Point alumni, Al has clear insight into what it takes to succeed at a service academy and what it means to serve our na-tion. He earned his Regular Army commission in 1979, and started his career in 1980 as a Lance Missile Platoon Leader serving in Ger-many. His assignments took him and his fam-ily to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and Neckarsulm, Germany, which included command of a Per-shing II missile nuclear capable firing battery. He served in deployments in support of Oper-ations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. He was selected to represent the U.S. Army and provide testimony to the Presidential Commis-sion on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces in November 1992. Al contin-ued his military education with a 1994 gradua-tion from the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He served as a State Inspector General for both the Idaho and Guam National Guard for nearly a decade before his retirement from the U.S. Army in 2006. As a civilian, he worked for the Idaho National Guard as a special security of-ficer for the Supervisor Human Resource Of-fice before his current position, as the State Equal Employment Manager. His strong work ethic and dedication have not only given him a reputation among the del-egation of being a go-to-guy when something needs to be done right and quickly, but have also contributed to him being recognized with many honors for his service to our country. These include the Legion of Merit; Bronze Star Medal; Meritorious Service Medal, 4th Award; Army Commendation Medal, 3rd Award, Army Achievement Medal; National Defense Service Medal, 2nd Award; and many other recogni-tions. A TRIBUTE TO KOLBY SHACKELFORD HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 2, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Kolby Shackelford. Kolby was named the Iowa PGA Junior Tour Player of the Year in the 14–15 year old age group. He is the son of Kurt and Gayle Shackelford of Panora, Iowa. As a freshman, Kolby placed 13th in the state of Iowa in the Class 2A state golf tour-nament. He was also a member of the 3rd place Panorama golf team. It was through his hours of practice and commitment to his craft that Kolby was able to achieve such an out-standing recognition. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize Kolby for receiving this outstanding award and I am proud to represent him in the United States Congress. I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating Kolby and in wishing him nothing but continued success.

HONORING STATE REPRESENTA-TIVE NICK L. SALAZAR 
HON. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM 
OF NEW MEXICO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 2, 2018 Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor State Representative Nick L. Salazar who is retiring at the end of the 2018 legislative ses-sion after 46 years of outstanding and selfless service to New Mexico. Representative Salazar was born on April 18, 1924 in Chamita, New Mexico. After grad-uating from high school, he enlisted in the United States Air Force where he attained the rank of sergeant. Representative Salazar at-tended the University of New Mexico and the University of California-Santa Barbara. He and his wife, Mari Ana Abeyta, have three wonder-ful children, Yvonne, Earl, and Gregory, as well as three grandchildren and five great- grandchildren. Representative Salazar started his long and storied political career as a commissioner for Rio Arriba County. In June 1967 while com-missioner, he was held hostage by Reies Lopez Tijerina in the infamous courthouse raid in Tierra Amarilla. Representative Salazar also worked at Los Alamos national laboratory as a fusion and thermonuclear researcher where he continues to serve as a member of the lab’s board. In 1972, Representative Salazar was first elected to New Mexico House of Representa-tives for District 40 where he has served dili-gently and with distinction ever since. Throughout his career, Representative Salazar has proven a staunch advocate for Native American issues and constantly traveled throughout the State to visit tribal commu-nities. Additionally, Representative Salazar championed senior issues throughout his ca-reer. For years, he has set aside funds in the annual budget to increase support services for New Mexican seniors.

has also been one of the strongest advocates to increase funding for New Mexico’s colleges and universities, especially for Northern New Mexico College. Mr. Speaker, the New Mexico House of Representatives will not be the same without Representative Salazar who has been a fix-ture and an institution for over 4 decades. He is the longest-serving legislator in New Mexi-co’s history and one of the ten longest-serving members of any legislature throughout the country. It amazes me to think about just how many lives Representative Salazar touched and improved throughout his decades of pub-lic service, and I am certain that his numerous accomplishments will be felt for generations to come. Representative Salazar’s service to our state is unmatched, his integrity is second to none, and he will be sorely missed by his col-leagues, constituents, and friends.

A THREAT TO LABOR UNIONS 
SPEECH OF  
HON. JOYCE BEATTY 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, January 29, 2018 Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my colleagues this evening to recognize the great importance of unions and speak to the danger to middle-class, working families if the Su-preme Court undercuts public-sector unions in the pending Janus v. AFSCME case. Mr. Speaker, we cannot forget that the story of unions is the story of America’s middle class. I know this story firsthand, because my dad was a union worker. I was able to go to col-lege because of union support, and I’m proud of it. We all know that union jobs continue to offer higher salaries to workers and provide quality health care, pensions for a secure re-tirement, and benefits that give families peace of mind, along with the ability to send their children to college or trade schools. This is the American Dream, and unions have helped ensure that more Americans have a chance to live it. Through collective bargaining, members of strong unions are scoring victories that help entire communities. Collective bargaining has given workers— even those who aren’t represented by a union—more access to paid holidays, paid sick leave, life insurance, medical and retire-ment benefits, and higher pay. That power has closed the wage gap be-tween women and men in the workplace. The wage gap between women and men in unions is about 9 cents, while most non-union women still earn only 78 cents for every dollar their male counterparts make. African-American women in unions earn almost $22 per hour, while non-union women earn only $17. African-American union members today earn 14.7 percent more than their non-union counterparts and Latino union workers earn 21.8 percent more. In other words, unions are the best way to fix an economy rigged in favor of the wealthy and powerful against working people. Despite all these benefits, the Supreme Court case, Janus v. AFSCME, may limit the opportunity for working people to join together to speak up for themselves, their families, and their communities. Let’s not be naı¨ve to the fact that the special interests behind this case simply do not be-lieve that hardworking people, like my father, should have the same freedoms and opportu-nities as they do: to negotiate a fair wage for their work so that they can provide for them-selves and their families. It is fitting that we are talking about public- sector unions right now, with the 50th anniver-sary of the start of the Memphis sanitation workers strike falling just two weeks from today, on February 12. The sanitation workers strike was Martin Luther King, Jr.’s last cam-paign and what brought him to Memphis where he was assassinated. It was there that Dr. King said, ‘‘Let it be known everywhere, that along with wages and all of the other se-curities that you are struggling for, you are also struggling for the right to organize and be recognized.’’ It is also fitting that we recognize Rev. Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker, Dr. King’s chief of staff who died last week at the age of 88. He, too, was a tireless civil rights champion and de-fender of unions because he knew that there is power and recognition in numbers. Mr. Speaker, Dr. King fought for public unions 50 years ago, and I am calling on all people, including our community and national leaders, to join me in taking up his call to work to protect our unions and their ability to nego-tiate for better wages and conditions of work.

RECOGNIZING EDWIN HAWKINS ON HIS PASSING 
HON. ERIC SWALWELL 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 2, 2018 Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Pleasanton resident Edwin Hawkins on the occasion of his passing on January 15, 2018. Edwin was born and raised in Oakland, California, and began his musical perform-ances early in life, performing on the keyboard in local church groups. In 1967, he helped co- found the Northern California State Youth Choir with his friend Betty Watson. In 1968, as part of a fundraising effort for the Youth Choir to attend a competition in Southern California, Edwin composed, and led the Edwin Hawkins Singers in recording, Let Us Go into the House of the Lord, the album that included his first musical hit, ‘‘Oh, Happy Day.’’ That song won a Grammy for Best Soul Gospel Performance in 1970, having reached a top-5 spot on both the Billboard pop and R&B charts the year before, and helped launch Edwin’s national career. Edwin would continue to compose and record gospel music, often pushing the limits of the genre by incorporating elements of other styles, including rap, into his music. ‘‘To My Father’s House,’’ ‘‘Give Me a Star,’’ and the Grammy-winning hits ‘‘Every Man Wants to Be Free’’ and ‘‘Wonderful!’’ are among his many later works. Edwin also toured around the world, including with his late brother Wayne Hawkins, and he was voted into the Christian Music Hall of Fame in 2007. Many artists would come to reference Edwin and his works as inspiration for their own per-formances. ‘‘Oh, Happy Day’’ was recorded by numerous singers, including Aretha Franklin, Elvis Presley, and Johnny Mathis, and George Harrison said it was the inspiration for his work ‘‘My Sweet Lord.’’ Edwin also sponsored the Edwin Hawkins Music and Arts Seminar to teach music business practices to new artists. Services in celebration of his life will be held on February 6 and 7 at the Harbor Light Church in Fremont, California. In keeping with Edwin’s altruistic legacy, the Hawkins family has asked that donations be made to the Music and Arts Seminar in lieu of flowers. Edwin’s contribution to the musical world was truly extraordinary. I want to acknowledge him for his remarkable work and pass along my condolences to his family and friends. f 
INTERNATIONAL HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 2, 2018 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this past Saturday, January 27, 2018, we observed International Holocaust Remembrance Day, a day in which we take time from our busy lives to remember and mourn the millions of souls lost in the Holocaust, the worst example of man’s inhumanity to man in human history. Nearly 73 years have passed since the end of World War II but for those who survived, and the descendants and relatives of those who perished, the Holocaust is not ancient history but a reminder of the evil that can be unleased when humans give into their worst instincts and appetites. The Holocaust’s magnitude of destruction numbered more than 12 million deaths, includ-ing 6 million Jews and 1.5 million children (more than 
2⁄3of European Jewry). A haunting quote in the United States Holo-caust Memorial Museum refers to the story of Cain and Abel: 
‘‘The Lord said, ‘What have you done? Lis-ten! Your brother’s blood cries out to me from the ground (Genesis 4:11).’’’ 
The Holocaust forces us to confront uncom-fortable questions such as the responsibilities of citizenship and the consequences of indif-ference and inaction, and the importance of education and awareness. The Holocaust is a testament to the fragility of democracy. We must resolve to resist prejudice and in-tolerance in any form. It fills me with grief to know that the leaders of nations can destroy their own, as did the Nazi regime; yet I hope that we can continue to strengthen the means by which we can pur-sue justice. And I am saddened, outraged, and embar-rassed that the current President of the United States could think it proper to characterize, as he did on August 15, 2017, as ‘‘very fine peo-ple,’’ persons who adhere to the ideology of the Nazi regime and deny the existence of the defining crime of the 20th Century, the murder of 6 million persons for no reason other than they were Jews. Before that date, never before in history had a President of the United States, the nation that led the alliance that defeated Nazism and fascism in the greatest conflict in world history,

ever publicly defended or tried to normalize neo-Nazis or White Supremacists. But the vast majority of American do not share the current President’s view and reject the suggestion that there is a moral equiva-lence between those who advocate racial sep-aration and white supremacy and those, like the Anti-Defamation League and the NAACP, who are unalterably opposed to that evil, racist ideology and are united in this prayer and promise: Never Again.

IN MEMORY OF DOROTHY ‘‘DOTTIE’’ JEANETTE SHEA 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 2, 2018 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the late Dorothy ‘‘Dottie’’ Jeanette Shea, an active member of our com-munity and a devoted mother and grand-mother who passed away at the age of 82. A native of Hopland, California, Dottie grad-uated from Analy High School in Sebastopol and attended Santa Rosa Junior College. While working as a legal secretary in Santa Rosa, Dottie met her husband, local attorney John ‘‘Jack’’ Shea, in 1964. Dottie cared deeply about Sonoma County and spent her life dedicated to community service. She was not only active in local poli-tics, but she also hosted countless gatherings in her home to discuss local issues, charity ef-forts and community needs. From these di-verse gatherings came many of the innovative ideas that helped Santa Rosa grow from a rural, agrarian community into the large city it is today. Dottie was also an enthusiastic member of the Bodega Bay Fisherman’s Festival, which celebrates the start of the Salmon fishing sea-son. And, she enjoyed sharing with her grand-children and her community all things that Sonoma County had to offer. Mr. Speaker, Dottie Shea was my friend, a loving mother, a proud native Californian and emblematic of community service. Therefore, it is fitting and proper that we honor her and ex-tend our condolences to her family. f

HONORING MRS. HELEN SHIPP 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 2, 2018 Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take some time today to honor one of my con-stituents, Mrs. Helen Shipp, for her dedicated service to the community of Orange County. Mrs. Shipp passed away at the age of 82 on January 25, 2018, but her life and legacy will continue to vibrantly live on. Mrs. Shipp found-ed and organized Orange County’s first Black History Parade and Cultural Faire in 1980. Mrs. Shipp dreamed of a gathering where the history, accomplishments, and culture of the African-American community would be remem-bered and celebrated. This quickly became Orange County’s premier event for Black His-tory Month, and Mrs. Shipp’s dream was real-ized. Her commitment and diligence in orga-nizing the Black History Parade has inspired many members of the community, within and outside Orange County. Mrs. Shipp thought of the event as a gath-ering of old friends, where a community of neighbors and friends could better understand each other. This event also brought together many new friends. Mrs. Shipp’s passion led to many prominent figures serving as grand mar-shals in the parade, and continually attracted crowds from diverse backgrounds. This year, the parade will be entering its 38th anniver-sary—this longevity is a testament to Mrs. Shipp’s selfless dedication to the community. Mrs. Shipp enjoyed a career of giving, from her parade organizing to her service working for the Head Start program, where she pro-vided early-education for children from low-in-come families. Her life shows us the capa-bility, within all members of the community, to create something that enriches the lives of their fellow Americans. Mrs. Shipp’s legacy will be continued by her children, her neighbors, her friends, and all who are inspired by her life. Mr. Speaker and colleagues, I would be honored to recognize and remember Mrs. Helen Shipp for her dedication to connecting and uniting people in the community. I thank her for her generosity and example. I extend my deepest condolences to her children, and the rest of her family. May God bless her soul and her family. f

Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize Colonel Riley for this outstanding achieve-ment, and for providing leadership so faithfully in our country’s military. I am proud to rep-resent her in the United States Congress. I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in congratu-lating Colonel Riley and in wishing her nothing but continued success.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AT 1: FAILING OUR NATION IN DIS-ASTER RECOVERY 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 2, 2018 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on the need for prompt and effective disaster recovery for the United States. I consider it a high priority to maintain the efficacy of our country’s disaster recovery pro-cedures, to help ensure the safety of the American people. In 2017, this nation saw a very anemic re-sponse to disaster recovery from this Adminis-tration. Four months ago, Hurricane Maria, a Cat-egory 4 hurricane, devastated the island of Puerto Rico, destroying infrastructure and leaving the island without power. Puerto Rico, which produces more pharma-ceuticals by dollar value for the nation than any of the 50 states or any foreign country, has been key to the supply of these intra-venous (IV) saline bags and solution routinely used in hospitals and clinics. Hurricane Maria halted production at Baxter International Inc., a pharmaceutical manufac-turing plant that produces 43 percent of IV sa-line fluids for U.S. hospitals. This year’s flu season has been uncharacteristically aggressive, which makes the shortage of medical supplies caused by Hurricane Maria all the more problematic. The American Hospital Association has urged the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to take ‘‘any and all steps possible’’ to resolve worsening shortages of small-volume saline solutions—sterile suspensions of drugs and lifesaving nutrients administered intra-venously. The FDA has responded by relaxing regula-tions on the importation of medical saline solu-tions from other nations. Saline solutions are fundamental to patient care in hospitals, as over 200 million IVs are administered annually in the United States. Critical small-volume saline solutions in-clude: (1) Sodium Chloride 0.9 percent a solu-tion that is used to absorb and transport nutri-ents, maintain electrolyte balance, and main-tain blood pressure, and (2) Dextrose 5 per-cent, a form of glucose injected into a vein through an IV to treat low blood sugar, insulin shock, and dehydration. Had it not been for our allies allowing IV sa-line to be sent to the U.S., we could have been in the midst of a public health crisis. The lack of response by this Administration to Hurricane Maria is another example of how this Administration is failing the American peo-ple. Another example of the shameful disaster recovery response of this Administration is the handling of the Hurricane Harvey, which dev-astated the nine-county, 9,444 square mile Texas Gulf Coast. The effects of Hurricane Harvey have long outlasted the storm itself. This Administration has not risen to the task of producing an effective recovery plan for the largest housing disaster to strike the U.S. in our nation’s history. Hurricane Harvey damaged at least 203,000 homes, of which 12,700 were irreparably de-stroyed. There are 18,000 families who were im-pacted by Hurricane Harvey still living in ho-tels and motels six months after the crisis, with no resolution in sight. A staggering 889,425 people, post Hurri-cane Harvey, have registered for assistance with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The first tranche of emergency funding ap-proved by Congress has yet to be distributed to Texas by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development because the agency has not published in the Federal Register the rules governing how housing funds made available may be allocated between state and local entities. Each of this President’s immediate prede-cessors has had to navigate our nation through many disasters. President Bush had September 11th and Hurricane Katrina. President Obama inherited the near-total collapse of our nation’s financial system, but thanks to his exceptional leadership, the Dow Jones is consistently breaking records, the economy continues to expand, and our Amer-ican families are more financially stable. Mr. Speaker, a prerequisite of leadership is the ability to solve problems and make critical decisions. President Trump lacks the ability to inspire the nation and the fortitude to overcome ad-versity. As we consider the President’s assessment of the State of the Union, one fact has be-come abundantly clear: this Administration cannot handle disaster recovery. This Administration’s failure to effectively im-plement proper disaster recovery has left thou-sands of Americans with no clear path to re-claiming their lives. f

There is no greater privilege than to watch a child grow and develop into the best version of themselves. Big Brothers Big Sisters of North-west Florida provides the necessary opportuni-ties to allow this development to be achieved through mentor relationships. I would like to extend my gratitude to all the Bigs who have taken upon themselves to mentor a Little and to exhibit endless oppor-tunity and compassion. I am deeply motivated by these individuals. I would also like to thank the staff and volunteers who work many hours to pair these individuals with the best possible match.

SUPPORTING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF CATHOLIC SCHOOLS

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 2, 2018 Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of National Catholic Schools Week, and in rec-ognition of the outstanding contributions that Catholic schools make to our educational sys-tem and our country. I am a proud graduate of St. Symphorosa Grammar School and St. Ignatius College Prep in Chicago, and have been a lifelong supporter of Catholic edu-cation. Earlier this month, I introduced H. Res. 692 honoring January 28th through February 3rd as National Catholic Schools Week. I would like to thank the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. S
MITH for working with me on this resolu-tion, along with 29 additional cosponsors. This year marks the 44th anniversary of Catholic Schools Week, which, since 1974, has celebrated the important role these institu-tions play in America. They provide both a strong academic education, with a graduation rate of 99 percent, and strong moral ground-ing, while also teaching community responsi-bility and outreach. This year’s theme— ‘‘Catholic Schools: Learn. Serve. Lead. Suc-ceed.’’—highlights the values that are the cen-terpiece of a Catholic school education. I urge my colleagues to take time this week to recognize the Catholic schools in your dis-tricts. IN RECOGNITION OF THE BENEVO-LENT AND PROTECTIVE ORDER OF ELKS’ 150TH ANNIVERSARY HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 2, 2018 Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks (B.P.O.E.) upon its one-hundred and fif-tieth anniversary. Founded in 1868, the B.P.O.E. is a nation-wide fraternal order comprised of nearly one million men and women who promote service, justice and fraternity through activities and charities supported by local Elks Lodges. Of the order’s numerous lodges, which provide a place for neighbors to come together, the state of California houses the largest number. The B.P.O.E. is one of the premier charitable and patriotic organizations in the United States, raising billions of dollars in donations, which allow Elks to invest in their commu-nities. The California-Hawaii Elks Association (CHEA) is best known for its support of chil-dren with disabilities. The fundraising arm of the association allows the Elks to hire thera-pists and preschool vision screeners to pro-vide disabled children with the care they need. In addition to its remarkable work with chil-dren, CHEA also donates to organizations that assist with recovery efforts for natural disas-ters like the recent hurricanes, fires and floods. Another hallmark of the order is patriotism, as evident in CHEA’s involvement in raising funds for the National World War II Memorial, as well as its emphasis on honoring the Amer-ican Flag. A main focus of B.P.O.E. is to as-sist veterans, whether by adopting Veteran’s Villages, performing at the United Service Or-ganizations (U.S.O.), or building monuments to honor fallen heroes. Through programs such as the Americanism Essay Contest, Hoop Shoot, Scholarship Pro-grams, the Dictionary Project and Scouting, CHEA encourages our youth to exemplify leadership, patriotism and compassion. The Elks also promote a drug-free environment for our youth by working with the Drug Enforce-ment Agency to provide scientific-based pre-vention programs and drug awareness infor-mation. The time, effort, and care that the Elks have given to the community is outstanding, and the residents of the San Gabriel Valley have ben-efited greatly from their dedicated work. At this time, I ask all members to join with me in commending the Benevolent and Pro-tective Order of Elks for one-hundred and fifty years of committed service to the San Gabriel Valley.

CELEBRATING THE SARATOGA COUNTY CHAMBER OF COM-MERCE’S CENTENNIAL YEAR 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 2, 2018 Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join the Saratoga County Chamber of Com-merce in celebrating its 100th anniversary. The Saratoga County Chamber of Com-merce was founded by local business leaders in 1918 and has been making Saratoga Coun-ty a great place to live, work, and play ever since. Comprised of over 2,700 businesses, the Chamber has experienced great success in fulfilling its mission of initiating and pro-viding programs and services in support of its members and Saratoga County as a whole. The Chamber celebrated its centennial year at its annual dinner on January 25, 2018, where nearly 1,000 members and supporters attended. At the event, the 2017 Chair of the Board, David Collins, was thanked for his year of volunteer leadership and the incredible con-tributions he has made that have fostered growth in Saratoga County. For its 100th year, the Chamber also began a new tradition of presenting the Joe Dalton Community Service Award, named after a longtime leader of the Chamber. The award was presented to Steve ‘‘Sully’’ Sullivan, owner of The Olde Bryan Inn and Longfellows Inn & Conference Center, for his extensive efforts in assisting those in need in the community. On behalf of New York’s 21st Congressional District, I would like to congratulate the Sara-toga County Chamber of Commerce and its dedicated leaders and members as they cele-brate their 100th anniversary. I would also like to thank them for their years of hard work. I look forward to hearing about the Chamber’s successes in Saratoga County in the years to come. f

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE130 February 2, 2018 
The Northeast Tarrant Chamber works dili-gently to connect area business leaders, local city administrators, Tarrant County representa-tives, elected government officials and area non-profits to aid the growth and advancement of economic development in Northeast Tarrant County. Established in 1957 as the Haltom Richland Chamber, this organization has enjoyed sig-nificant growth in the span of its service. The Northeast Tarrant Chamber of Commerce has a rich legacy of dedication to its members. In fact, eight of its members have been a part of the Chamber for more than 50 years. Just last month, it reached a milestone of 1,000 mem-bers. Over the last 60 years, the Northeast Tarrant Chamber of Commerce has achieved a long list of accomplishments. For example, the Chamber has honored more than 500 local Hometown Heroes from area non-profit and community organizations who give their time and efforts to serve their Northeast Tarrant County neighbors. Additionally, it has awarded more than 200 annual scholarships to area high school seniors totaling over $200,000 in scholarship money distributed to deserving students, and has educated and graduated over 500 Leadership Northeast par-ticipants. There is no doubt that the Northeast Tarrant Chamber of Commerce leaders and members have made meaningful contributions to their communities and the North Texas region, and I am grateful for their steadfast service.

RECOGNIZING THE FULTON FIRE DEPARTMENT 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 2, 2018 Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the brave and selfless actions of members of the Fulton, New York Fire Depart-ment. On December 17, 2017, Fulton Firefighters Terry Recore, Allan Baker, and Assistant Chief Shane Laws responded to an incident at the Oswego River in which two individuals had be-come trapped when attempting to save a dog that had fallen through the ice and into the river. A man and woman saw a dog drowning, and acted immediately. Both the man and woman entered the water and hoisted the dog into a kayak. However, the pair was then un-able to return to shore. Wearing ice suits, Fire-fighters Terry Recore and Allan Baker helped get the woman and dog out of the freezing water. Assistant Chief Shane Laws threw a rope to the man who in the water and returned the group to shore. I have the utmost respect for our fire fight-ers and first responders. I thank them for the long hours, for charging into danger, and for putting their lives on the line to keep us safe each and every day. They guard our cities, protect our towns, and make our communities better. A TRIBUTE TO LORETTA DERBY HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 2, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Loretta Derby of Council Bluffs, Iowa for her induction into the Iowa School for the Deaf Hall of Fame. Loretta is a 1955 graduate of the Iowa School for the Deaf in Council Bluffs. Loretta graduated in 1994 from the College of St. Mary in Omaha, Nebraska with a degree in Business Administration. She has had an impressive career working for Northwestern Bell where she assisted deaf customers with TTY calls and helped co-workers understand the needs of deaf customers. Loretta ad-vanced to a computer analyst in marketing at US West and she presented programs to em-ployees on deaf awareness. She retired from US West in 1999, but continued to work for Communication Services for the Deaf as an equipment distribution manager. Loretta has been a leader in the Deaf com-munity; she helped organize the Birthday Gals, a social club for deaf women, chaired the Iowa Association for the Deaf Conference, and was Vice-President of the Iowa Associa-tion of the Deaf. She helped reorganize the Council Bluffs Silent Club, helped keep Beth-lehem Lutheran Church for the Deaf open and founded the Council Bluffs Deaf Seniors in 2015. Loretta also volunteers her time at the Iowa School of the Deaf Museum, which pre-serves the School’s history. Mr. Speaker, I applaud and congratulate Lo-retta on her induction into the Hall of Fame at Iowa School for the Deaf. I am proud to rep-resent her in the United States Congress and I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in congratu-lating Loretta on this outstanding accomplish-ment and in wishing her nothing but the best.

HONORING JAY MILLER 
HON. RODNEY P. FRELINGHUYSEN 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 2, 2018 Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, on the occasion of his retirement from Federal serv-ice we rise to thank Jay S. Miller for 28 years of outstanding dedicated service. Most recently Mr. Miller served as the Chief Financial Officer for the United States Capitol Police (USCP). Mr. Miller joined the USCP in 2011 bringing with him extensive experience in tax reporting, financial statement prepara-tion, strategic planning and internal controls which proved to be invaluable to the USCP. Mr. Miller’s ability to motivate and lead those that worked around him, often times through an infectious sense of humor, was instru-mental in creating positive change. This type of impactful leadership set a tone within the department that will be felt for many years. Mr. Miller provided outstanding assistance to the Committee on Appropriations and set a stand-ard that will be hard to replicate. Prior to joining the United States Capitol, Mr. Miller served in a variety of roles at the Li-brary of Congress and the U.S. Agency for International Development. On behalf of the U.S. House of Representatives we congratu-late Jay on a job well done and nothing but success and happiness in his future endeav-ors. f 
A THREAT TO LABOR UNIONS 
SPEECH OF  
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, January 29, 2018 Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. S
COTT and the Congressional Black Caucus for hosting the special order. The Janus case is critically important to public employees—many of whom are people of color—as well as to the millions of Ameri-cans who rely on the services these workers provide. This is a case originating in my state of Illi-nois, Janus v AFSCME Council 31, an out-standing union that fights relentlessly for work-ing families. The case was originally brought by Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner, who was found to have no legal standing to bring suit, and who then scrambled to find another plain-tiff. Before becoming Governor, Rauner was chairman of a private equity firm, where he put profits ahead of working families’ paychecks. As Governor, he has made it his number one priority to attack unions, including the wages, benefits and well-being of his hardworking AFSCME employees. Janus is about freedom—not the freedom of Mr. Janus to get the benefits of union rep-resentation as a free rider—but the freedom of workers to join together to bargain for a better deal for their families: better wages, better benefits and a better future.

COMMEMORATING BLACK HISTORY MONTH 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 2, 2018 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this Feb-ruary we recognize and celebrate the 40th commemoration of Black History Month. This month we celebrate the contributions of African Americans to the history of our great nation, and pay tribute to trailblazers, pio-neers, heroes, and leaders like the 44th Presi-dent of the United States, Barack Obama; Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall; U.S. Senator Blanche Kelso Bruce; U.S. Congresswoman Barbara Jordan; U.S. Congressman Mickey Leland; Astronauts Dr. Guion Stewart Bluford, Jr. and Mae C. Jemison; activists, intellec-tuals, authors, and artists like Frederick Doug-lass, Booker T. Washington, James Baldwin, Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, Maya Angelou, Toni Morrison, and Gwendolyn Brooks just to name a few of the countless number of well- known and unsung heroes whose contribu-tions have helped our nation become a more perfect union. The history of the United States has been marked by the great contributions of African American activists, leaders, writers, and art-ists.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE131 February 2, 2018 
As a member of Congress, I know that I stand on the shoulders of giants whose strug-gles and triumphs made it possible for me to stand here today and continue the fight for equality, justice, and progress for all, regard-less of race, religion, gender or sexual orienta-tion. The greatest of these giants to me are Mrs. Ivalita ‘‘Ivy’’ Jackson, a vocational nurse, and Mr. Ezra A. Jackson, one of the first African- Americans to succeed in the comic book pub-lishing business. They were my beloved parents and they taught me the value of education, hard work, discipline, perseverance, and caring for others. And I am continually inspired by Dr. Elwyn Lee, my husband and the first tenured African American law professor at the University of Houston. Mr. Speaker, I particularly wish to acknowl-edge the contributions of African American veterans in defending from foreign aggressors and who by their courageous examples helped transform our nation from a segregated soci-ety to a nation committed to the never ending challenge of perfecting our union. A few years ago about this time, I was hon-ored to join my colleagues, Congressmen J
OHN LEWIS and Congressman Charles Ran-gel, a Korean War veteran, in paying tribute to surviving members of the Tuskegee Airmen and the 555th Parachute Infantry, the famed ‘‘Triple Nickels’’ at a moving ceremony spon-sored by the U.S. Army commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The success of the Tuskegee Airmen in es-corting bombers during World War II—achiev-ing one of the lowest loss records of all the escort fighter groups, and being in constant demand for their services by the allied bomber units—is a record unmatched by any other fighter group. So impressive and astounding were the feats of the Tuskegee Airmen that in 1948, it helped persuade President Harry Truman to issue his famous Executive Order No. 9981, which directed equality of treatment and op-portunity in all of the United States Armed Forces and led to the end of racial segrega-tion in the U.S. military forces. It is a source of enormous and enduring pride that my father-in-law, Phillip Ferguson Lee, was one of the Tuskegee Airmen. Clearly, what began as an experiment to de-termine whether ‘‘colored’’ soldiers’ were ca-pable of operating expensive and complex combat aircraft ended as an unqualified suc-cess based on the experience of the Tuskegee Airmen, whose record included 261 aircraft destroyed, 148 aircraft damaged, 15,553 combat sorties and 1,578 missions over Italy and North Africa. They also destroyed or damaged over 950 units of ground transportation and escorted more than 200 bombing missions. They proved that ‘‘the antidote to racism is excellence in performance,’’ as retired Lt. Col. Herbert Carter once remarked. Mr. Speaker, Black History Month is also a time to remember many pioneering women like U.S. Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm; activists Harriet Tubman and Rosa Parks; as-tronaut Mae C. Jemison; mathematicians like Katherine G. Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson; authors Maya Angelou, Toni Morrison, and Gwendolyn Brooks; all of whom have each in their own way, whether through courageous activism, cultural or intellectual contributions, or artistic creativity, forged social and political change, and forever changed our great Nation for the better. It is also fitting, Mr. Speaker, that in addition to those national leaders whose contributions have made our nation better, we honor also those who have and are making a difference in their local communities. In my home city of Houston, there are nu-merous men and women who are great be-cause they have heeded the counsel of Dr. King who said: 
‘‘Everybody can be great because anybody can serve. You only need a heart full of grace. A soul generated by love.’’ 
By that measure, I wish to pay tribute to some of the great men and women of Hous-ton: 1. Rev. F.N. Williams, Sr. 2. Rev. Dr. S.J. Gilbert, Sr. 3. Rev. Crawford W. Kimble 4. Rev. Eldridge Stanley Branch 5. Rev. William A. Lawson 6. Rev. Johnnie Jeffery ‘‘J.J.’’ Robeson 7. Mr. John Brand 8. Ms. Ruby Moseley 9. Ms. Dorothy Hubbard 10. Ms. Doris Hubbard 11. Ms. Willie Bell Boone 12. Ms. Holly HogoBrooks 13. Mr. Deloyd Parker 14. Ms. Lenora ‘‘Doll’’ Carter As we celebrate Black History Month, let us pay tribute to those who have come before us, and pay forward to future generations by ad-dressing what is the number one issue for Af-rican American families, and all American fam-ilies today: preserving the American promise of economic opportunity for all. Our immediate focus must be job creation, and enacting legislation that will foster and lay the foundation for today’s and tomorrow’s gen-eration of groundbreaking activists, leaders, scientists, writers and artists to continue con-tributing to the greatness of America. We must continue to preserve the American Dream for all. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand here in celebration of the heroic and historic acts of African Americans and their indispensable contributions to this great Nation. It is through our work in creating possibilities for today and future generations that we best honor the accomplishments and legacy of our predecessors. f 
A TRIBUTE TO JIM TYLER 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, February 2, 2018 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Jim Tyler of Atlantic, Iowa, for receiving the Iowa Gro-cery Industry Association Lifetime Achieve-ment Award. Jim is the Executive Chairman of the Board and former CEO of the Atlantic Coca-Cola Bottling Company. Jim received this award for his years of commitment and contributions to the Iowa gro-cery industry.

He has been devoted to community serv-ice and has served on the boards of the Asso-ciation of Business and Industry, Iowa Manu-facturers Association, and the Iowa Board of Regents. Mr. Speaker, I commend and congratulate Jim for his commitment, dedication, and lead-ership to his community and the State of Iowa. I am proud to represent him in the United States Congress and I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating Jim and in wishing him nothing but the best in all his future en-deavors.
