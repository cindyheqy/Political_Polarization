PAUSE AND REFLECT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. L
ANCE ) for 5 minutes. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as we approach the somber anni-versary of the attacks of September 11, 2001, to honor the memory of the inno-cent people who perished on that ter-rible day and extend our continued prayers and sympathy to their loved ones. For 15 years, I have stood at firehouses and schools, churches and veterans halls, and heard the stories of bravery and heroism from that morn-ing that forever changed America. New Jersey lost more than 700 residents in the attacks, 81 of them from commu-nities I represent here in Congress. Each personal story is remarkable in its own way, offering a different mem-ory or perspective on the events of Sep-tember 11. In hearing stories from that day, Americans relive that morning, recalling where they were when they heard the news of the planes that struck the World Trade Center, the sickening realization that our Nation was under attack, and the tremendous heroism and self-sacrifice of so many in New York, at the Pentagon, and on a plane over Shanksville, Pennsyl-vania. Many of these stories are not new but need to be retold as a younger genera-tion comes of age, that their neigh-bors—innocent people in their commu-nities—were targeted in an act of war upon this Nation, and from such hei-nous acts came brave first responders, courageously initiating rescues, know-ing their lives were in great danger, friends and coworkers helping each other to safety, and many young Amer-icans who then answered a call to serv-ice to protect and defend the United States. It is our duty to instill in the genera-tions that follow respect and honor for the lives lost that terrible day and the lives lost in defense of our Nation in the years that have followed. It is our duty here in Congress to protect this Nation, to provide for the common de-fense, and vividly to recall the pain of a wounded Nation so that we be aware always of what it takes to keep this Nation safe and free. The lives lost in the ensuing battles abroad have continued to try the foun-dation of our will. We have proven steadfast in the commitment to our values. Our freedom and liberty have been protected by brave men and women who selflessly answered the call of service by volunteering for military service. No matter the challenges we face, we must remember that our Nation is truly blessed. I ask all Americans today to pause and reflect on the trag-edy of September 11, 2001. Please pray for the victims and honor their mem-ory. Please pay tribute to the men and women who serve and defend us today against the dangers we still face. May God bless them, and may God continue to bless the United States of America. f 
CROWN POINT, INDIANA, GUN SHOW The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Q
UIGLEY ) for 5 minutes. Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, ‘‘Gun to the right, no gun to the left’’ was the greeting I heard as I entered the Indus-trial Arts Building in Crown Point, In-diana. On this particular sunny Sunday afternoon in July, the enormous build-ing was playing host to the Central In-diana Gun and Knife Show. The building, which sits on the Lake County Fairgrounds, plays host to gar-den shows, home improvement and craft vendors; but on this date, the 90- year-old brick building was featuring products that were of an altogether dif-ferent nature. As they enter the gun show, visitors carrying weapons had to demonstrate to security that their guns were not loaded, while those not carrying could enter without screening. I paid my $5 entry and was asked if I resided in Indi-ana. Being an Illinois resident, I an-swered no and received a hand stamp depicting me as out of State. At first glance, I saw kids hanging around vendors, munching on hot dogs. There were several hundred people in attendance by lunchtime, mostly White, middle-aged men, but a few women as well. Judging by the license plates in the parking lot, there were a healthy number of gun enthusiasts from my home State of Illinois in at-tendance.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH5166 September 8, 2016 
At most tables, you could hear the hagglers looking for a better deal or discussing options for their purchase. They would ask: Chrome-lined or stain-less steel barrel? What about a free- float rail? The possibilities seemed endless, as people wandered among doz-ens of tables. Sellers were offering everything from high-volume magazines and sophisti-cated scope systems to attachable bi-pods and customized stocks. Prices for assault weapons typically ranged from $600 to $2,500, including a bipod and two drum magazines, each capable of hold-ing 100 rounds. One dealer explained that the wide variation in pricing de-pended on the bells and whistles and the markup. Not every weapon was particularly pricey. One vendor, who seemed eager to reduce inventory, marked down one of his assault rifles to under $400. There were tables upon tables of handguns for sale, as well as a folding single-shot, .22-caliber rifle, small enough to fit in a backpack, for under $200. Still other vendors offered to help customize your purchase on the spot. You could choose from dozens of barrel lengths and styles to go with your choice in stocks and other components. There was plenty of ammo to go with any weapon you might purchase. De-pending on the caliber and ammunition type, prices started as low as $10 for a box of 50. Boxes of ammunition with a similar number of rounds for many as-sault rifles cost as little as $20. An-other dealer offered high-capacity, 50- round magazines for a gun show special of one for $20 or three for $55. There was a lot of gear aimed toward women as well, with pink, single-shot rifles, body armor tailored for women, and purses designed for concealed carry. Even local charities got on the scene, with an AR–15 being auctioned off to benefit the Marine Corps League. All you had to do to be included was buy a $1 raffle ticket and give your first name and phone number. It was a surreal atmosphere within the midst of recent tragedies. It made me wonder if those in attendance were either oblivious or all too aware of those heartbreaking headlines. The gun show returns this month to Crown Point, but given the number of deadly weapons already on the streets of my hometown of Chicago, I think I will wait for the next home improvement show before making a return trip.

KILLING THE INNOCENTS IN SYRIA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. K
INZINGER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. KINZINGER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I want to tell you a story. There was a little boy named Ali Daqneesh, age 10, and his little brother is Omran. That is the boy you see in the photo here that was shared across the Internet, worldwide, 2 weeks ago. Ali was a really good big brother. He loved to play outside, and he was still at that age when kids really get to dream big and imagine their future. I can only imagine the life that Ali looked forward to. Maybe he wanted to be a police officer; maybe he wanted to be a teacher or a doctor. I really can’t say for certain because, tragically, his life was cut short by an airstrike. Ali’s death is an all-too-common fate for many of Syria’s men, women, and children. These are the people who have lost their chance at life from the brutality of Bashar al-Assad and Vladi-mir Putin. Of the over 500,000 dead Syrians, more than 50,000 are Syrian children who have been killed since the evil dic-tator Bashar al-Assad turned against his own people in 2011. Yet, even as the world continues to be outraged over these atrocities and pictures of dazed and bloody Syrian children like Ali’s brother Omran, Assad and Russia and their Iranian backers are still barrel- bombing and launching chemical weap-ons against civilian targets. On a daily basis, we hear that Syrian and Russian fighter planes have launched attacks on medical facilities and hospitals across the country. When these facilities are bombed, it is the children who suffer. In fact, the re-gime’s belief is don’t target, nec-essarily, military assets because, when you target innocent civilians, you in-flict more collective pain on the popu-lation of Syria; and in Assad’s esti-mation, that brings the war closer to an end. At the end of July, a maternity hos-pital in Idlib was bombed. A recent story in The New Yorker highlighted the horror that comes with these bombings. In Aleppo, newborns in incu-bators suffocated to death because a Syrian or Russian airstrike cut off power to a hospital. Who is doing this? And why? Bashar al-Assad continued the legacy of brutality against his people from his father—his father, who had one goal, and that was to keep power. Power is a crazy motivator for some people. The people of Syria, in 2011, decided they wanted some freedom, as is humanity’s right, and they stood up and protested peacefully against Assad. What did Assad do? Did he respond by saying: Well, let’s talk and maybe find a way to have an outlet for your inter-ests or your concerns? No. Assad rolled the tanks. Assad said he would kill his opposition. And what ensued after that was the incubation of a group we know today as ISIS, the opening of a civil war in Syria that is now spreading all over the Middle East, a massive ref-ugee crisis around the world. I hear some people in political con-versations today express admiration for Vladimir Putin. They express admi-ration for Vladimir Putin’s strength, as if oppressing and killing people is something to be proud of. That doesn’t show strength. That shows weakness. Mr. Speaker, Vladimir Putin and Russia are tearing Europe apart. Vladi-mir Putin and Russia are delivering bombs on medical facilities and on children in Syria. They are no ally of ours. Sometimes the enemy of our enemy is still our enemy. Mr. Speaker, I hear people sometimes say that dictatorships work in the Mid-dle East. Sometimes they say that this introduction of freedom has somehow been terrible for people who just aren’t ready for it. I agree. The introduction of freedom to a society that is not used to it can sometimes be very messy, and sometimes in the course of looking back over 20 years of history we see the success. That happened in our own founding. We went through the Civil War. We went through a bloody Revo-lution. We went through a time where we kept an entire race in chains. But, Mr. Speaker, when people say that dic-tatorships work, no, they don’t. This kid, I always wonder what is going through his mind. Probably not much because he was stunned at the bomb that landed on his house and killed his brother. f 
b1015 FUND THE ZIKA EMERGENCY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. P
RICE) for 5 min-utes. Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, we often hear from constitu-ents who are frustrated by Congress’ failure to act on many of the most pressing issues facing our country. Seven weeks ago, as if we were deter-mined to confirm this indictment, Con-gress adjourned for summer recess with a long list of critical unfinished busi-ness. We came nowhere near finishing our appropriations bills, leaving open the question of whether we can even keep the government open past Sep-tember 30. We failed to pass the most rudimentary gun violence measures, leaving the tragedies of San Bernardino and Orlando unaddressed. And then there was Zika, perhaps the most incredible failure of all. With an epidemic bearing down on us—an epi-demic with disastrous human con-sequences, but with a prescribed course of action that could do much to pre-vent and mitigate the catastrophe— still, Congress refused to act. Now we are back in session, facing daily headlines about the dangers posed by Zika. The number of Zika travel-related cases in the continental U.S. is increasing, the number of preg-nant women infected is growing, and the number of babies being born—or worse, lost—with microcephaly or other Zika-related complications is ris-ing. Increasing numbers of mosquito- borne cases have been reported in Puer-to Rico and south Florida. I learned this week that five service members and retirees from Fort Bragg in North Carolina are being treated for Zika. It has been more than 6 months since the President requested an emergency supplemental appropriation of $1.9 bil-lion from Congress to fund Zika pre-paredness, response, and prevention, as

well as critical research. The request was carefully and comprehensively documented and justified. In the meantime, our local, State, and Federal public health agencies and authorities have continued to shift funds and reorder priorities in an at-tempt to get a handle on this public health emergency. Indeed, our own uni-versities and other research centers have been shifting money around for months, as I learned at a conference I helped organize in North Carolina on June 7. Researchers testified there as to the great promise of the work they are doing, but also as to the great efforts they have been required to make, in the face of inadequate and uncertain funding, to ensure that the work con-tinues. I left that conference impressed and encouraged by the work that was going on. But I also left chagrined and angered at the way Congress, under Re-publican leadership, with no serious at-tempt at bipartisan cooperation, is let-ting these dedicated researchers and the entire country down. The House and Senate Republican conference report contains only $1.1 billion of the requested funds, but the larger problem is that it robs other critical public health priorities—nota-bly, Ebola, but also disaster prepared-ness—in order to satisfy Republican budget ideologues. Adding insult to injury, the Repub-lican conference report also includes several misguided and dangerous policy riders. These poison pills would se-verely limit access to contraceptives in Puerto Rico, where thousands of cases of Zika have been recorded. It would take yet another shot at Planned Par-enthood and would roll back certain clean water regulations, ostensibly to allow for the increased spraying of pes-ticides. I recently met with Director An-thony S. Fauci of the National Insti-tute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who explained the incredible lengths to which NIH and CDC have gone in order to protect the health of the American people. They have desperately cobbled together a budget, most recently tak-ing money even from vital research into cancer, Alzheimer’s, heart disease, and other diseases. Despite such ex-traordinary efforts, the CDC and NIH will run out of money after October 1. Mr. Speaker, it is imperative that we honor the President’s request of $1.9 billion in a bill free of destructive off-sets and ideological riders. It is crucial that Congress take action for the preg-nant women in their first trimesters who are scared to leave their homes; for the children born with a range of disabilities, of which microcephaly is only the worst; for the service men and women stationed across the globe who are at particular risk; and for the 25 percent of Puerto Rico’s population who will potentially contract this dis-ease. We can and we must as a country do better than this. Let’s do the right thing for our constituents, our coun-try, and for the rest of the world by fi-nally funding this public health emer-gency. We have long since run out of excuses. We can wait no longer.

OBAMA ADMINISTRATION’S WAR ON POLICE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. B
ROOKS ) for 5 minutes. Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-er, never has an American President been so willing to shoot first and ask questions later when a police officer uses deadly force in self-defense or to protect innocent lives. Never in Amer-ican history has a President’s legacy been a consistent disregard for the rule of law. Time after time, after police shoot-ings of African Americans, the Obama administration’s knee-jerk, racially di-visive strategy has been to paint a dis-turbingly false image of racial bias in police shootings that conflicts with a recent 2016 Harvard University study that found that police are 24 percent less likely to fire upon African Ameri-cans than Caucasian Americans. For emphasis, let me repeat that. A 2016 Harvard University study by Afri-can American Professor Roland Fryer, Jr., found that police fire upon African Americans 24 percent less often than police fire upon Caucasian Americans. On July 7, well before the facts of two police shootings of African Ameri-cans were known, President Obama, again, stoked racial prejudice flames by claiming that ‘‘Black folks are more vulnerable to these kinds of incidents.’’ President Obama even defended subse-quent, sometimes violent, protests as rather benign ‘‘expressions of outrage.’’ Shortly after the Obama administra-tion attacked the motives of America’s law enforcement officers and, perhaps, helped inspire even more violence against police, a Dallas sniper gunned down five police officers and injured many others during a Black Lives Mat-ter protest. The shooter justified his murders by stating he was upset by po-lice shootings, referenced Black Lives Matter, and stated that he wanted to kill White people, especially White po-lice officers. Three days later, after these horrific murders of police officers, President Obama reiterated his politically moti-vated, racial division narrative by blaming the attacks, in part, on a ra-cial prejudice problem that police must fix because ‘‘that is what’s going to ul-timately help make the job of being a cop a lot safer.’’ Showing great hutzpah at the Dallas memorial ceremony for the slain offi-cers, Obama, again, publicly blamed police racial bias as a contributing cause of police assassinations. Mr. Speaker, when tearful Americans seek solace and unification, the Obama administration dishes out racism and antipolice profiling that helps inspire even more violence against police. The result of the Obama administra-tion’s politics of racial division and ha-tred? So far this year, as of September 2, firearms-related deaths of American law enforcement officers are up 56 per-cent. The Obama administration’s rela-tionship with police has deteriorated so badly that William Johnson, the execu-tive director of the National Associa-tion of Police Organizations, accuses Barack Obama of engaging in a ‘‘war on police,’’ adding that the Obama ad-ministration’s ‘‘continued appease-ments at the Federal level with the De-partment of Justice, their appeasement of violent criminals, their refusal to condemn movements like Black Lives Matter actively calling for the death of police officers, that type of thing, all the while blaming police for the prob-lems in this country, has led directly to the climate that has made Dallas possible.’’ Mr. Speaker, no one condones illegal shootings by police. Police who ille-gally use excessive force should be, and are, prosecuted criminally and civilly to the fullest extent of the law. But the Obama administration repeatedly pours gasoline on an open fire, rushing to antipolice judgment before the facts are known, and justice had, thereby helping to incite murders and assas-sinations of American police who dedi-cate their lives to our protection. The solution, Mr. Speaker, is gener-ating more respect for law and order and those who enforce it. That solution is absent in Obama administration pro-nouncements. Mr. Speaker, I want the public to know that I stand with the rule of law. I stand with America’s brave police of-ficers who protect the rights and lives of all Americans. And I here and now publicly thank America’s law enforce-ment officers for risking their lives to protect law-abiding Americans from crime and anarchy.

STUDENT LOAN DEBT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. B
ONAMICI ) for 5 minutes. Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, when I traveled around northwest Oregon last month, from town hall meetings to the grocery store, I spoke with Oregonians about the challenges they are facing and what keeps them up at night. Time after time, the conversation turned to the cost of higher education. It is likely we have all spoken with parents trying to make ends meet who can’t save for their young children’s education and recent graduates who are worried about finding jobs that will cover their looming student loan pay-ments. But we also hear from too many people who are trying to balance their current student loan debt with child care, housing, and other expenses. Many are getting by, but 1 month of unexpected unemployment or illness

could set them back years. Unfortu-nately, for too many, the threat of de-fault is already a reality. Currently, more than 8 million stu-dent loan borrowers are in default on their educational debt, and the number is growing. These are hardworking Americans—mothers, fathers, veterans, nurses, teachers, and young people— who are trying to improve their lives, but have been pulled into financial tur-moil. The 8 million people in default—a group, roughly, twice the size of Or-egon—are at risk of financial ruin. Their tax refunds and Social Security benefits may be withheld. Their wages can be garnished and they can face legal action. And with damaged credit, borrowing for a home, car, or business, or even renting an apartment can be an impossible task. What can Congress do for those who are struggling to make their student loan payments? The answer is SIMPLE. Today I am pleased to introduce leg-islation with my friend and colleague from Pennsylvania, Congressman R
YAN C
OSTELLO . Our bill, the Streamlining Income-Driven Manageable Payments on Loans for Education, or SIMPLE Act, makes it easier for millions of at- risk student loan borrowers to access protections that are already available under the law. Income-driven repayment plans allow borrowers to make loan payments that are based on how much they earn. So, in other words, what they can afford. As a result, they are much less likely than other borrowers to default on their debt. That is good for the bor-rower, their families, and local econo-mies. Unfortunately, too many at-risk bor-rowers don’t know about these plans or they are unable to navigate the com-plicated application for enrolling, so they don’t receive the benefit of lower payments. In fact, 70 percent of bor-rowers in default from the govern-ment’s largest student loan program, the Direct Loan program, would have qualified for lower payments. Even if borrowers enroll in income- driven repayment, they must complete a burdensome process to update infor-mation. In one study, more than half of the borrowers did not recertify their income on time. When this happens, a borrower’s payments can spike and suddenly push the borrower toward de-linquency and default. In short, the government makes it unnecessarily difficult for people who are weighed down by student debt to get the help the law already affords them. Our bipartisan SIMPLE Act stream-lines the process and removes barriers that prevent borrowers from benefiting from income-driven repayment. The bill uses borrowers’ existing income data to automatically provide at-risk borrowers on the verge of default with lower loan payments. The bill provides for automatic updates of borrowers’ in-come information each year, so they continue to pay what they can afford. As college costs continue to rise and more students leave school with in-creasing levels of debt, it is clear that this House needs to act to make higher education more affordable for every-one. The SIMPLE Act is part of that broader effort. It works by reaching at- risk borrowers, simplifying the process to get them into a plan with repay-ment based on income and helping them keep their payments affordable and avoid default. I thank Mr. COSTELLO for his partner-ship on this bill and urge all of my col-leagues to join us in supporting this legislation.

b1030 HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF DALLAS KNOX The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. J
OLLY ) for 5 minutes. Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life and legacy of an American patriot, a patriot who served his country with honor and distinction before passing away last month in a boating accident at only 35 years old. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Chief Warrant Officer Dallas Knox of Treasure Island, Florida. Chief Knox faithfully served his country as a Black Hawk Medevac helicopter pilot in the U.S. Army and the Army Reserve. Chief Knox had multiple deployments, including tours in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Kosovo. Chief Knox also served as a Black Hawk instructor pilot. Having attended his memorial serv-ice, his colleagues each spoke that Dal-las was one of the most gifted pilots they ever served with, a man of brav-ery, valor, always thoughtful, and al-ways giving to others. The medals Knox earned for his serv-ice speak volumes about his dedication and his commitment to the country he so loved. Knox was awarded the Meri-torious Service Medal, the Army Com-mendation Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal with Bronze Service Star, the Iraq Campaign Medal with Bronze Service Star, and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, among so many other awards. Described by his family as selfless, compassionate, loving, and full of life, Chief Knox is survived by his mother, Carol, his father, Richard, sister, Kirsten, as well as loving nieces and nephews. May God bless Chief Warrant Officer Dallas Knox, his family, and his friends; and may God bless the country Chief Knox so proudly fought for, the United States of America.

DISAPPOINTED BUT NOT DEFEATED The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. K
ELLY ) for 5 minutes. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, on July 14, I stood in this very spot to express my disappointment that my Republican colleagues and leadership showed both cowardice and callousness by failing to call up a single common-sense gun violence prevention measure before leaving town for 53 days. I rise today not just disappointed. In-stead, I am ashamed; I am appalled. Republicans adjourned for a historic 7- week recess from D.C. without ful-filling their duty to the American peo-ple, and, once again, our most vulner-able communities paid the price. I am disappointed, but I am not de-feated. So I rise today to remind my colleagues of what 7 weeks of Repub-lican inaction looks like. In my district in Chicago, gun vio-lence claimed the lives of 90 people and injured 375 more in August alone. This Labor Day weekend, Chicago passed 500 homicides for the year, the first time we have crossed this threshold in two decades. Outside of my district, 7 weeks of congressional inaction meant that more than 4,100 families lost a loved one to gun violence. In 2016, gun vio-lence has taken the lives of almost 10,000 and wounded more than 20,000; 10,000 people killed by guns in less than 9 months—10,000. When will this number be high enough for us to take action? Who has to die for us to have the courage to pass commonsense gun legislation? Why does Democrats sitting in protest outrage Republicans, but 10,000 deaths merits no response? We have heard the majority threaten to admonish Democrats for speaking the truth, but 10,000 lives lost to guns gets nothing—no votes, and 7 weeks of inaction. In this D.C. bubble, it is easy to for-get that 10,000 isn’t just a number. They are 10,000 mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters. Behind each gun death is a family who once celebrated a life, but now mourns the loss of a loved one. Behind each gun death, there is a fearful mother now too afraid to let her children play outside. Behind each gun death, another small-business owner debates closing up shop for good. While it is no secret that gun vio-lence affects all communities across our Nation, it is our most underserved neighborhoods that are the most dev-astated. Congressional inaction allows the most vulnerable in our Nation to continue to suffer. So I urge my colleagues, let’s use this time in September wisely. Let’s work together and pass legislation that will reduce gun violence in our commu-nities. I am not just talking about a need to pass commonsense measures that keeps guns out of the hands of those seeking to do harm. I am talking about a com-prehensive approach that addresses the root causes of this gun violence epi-demic. Too often we boil down this complex problem to talking points about com-prehensive background checks, closing

loopholes, and improving mental health services when, in reality, it is also about economic opportunity, building trust between the community and law enforcement, as well as passing these commonsense gun violence pre-vention measures. In April, I launched the Urban Progress, or UP, Initiative to address these root causes of gun violence. UP partners with local community leaders, activists, business leaders, and elected officials to promote economic oppor-tunity, improve community policing, and build on commonsense gun vio-lence prevention strategies. With the input from the UP Initia-tive partners and many of my col-leagues here in the House, I introduced the Urban Progress Act, a bill that would ensure that the Federal Govern-ment remains committed to reducing the gun violence ravaging our commu-nities. My bill would reinvest in our eco-nomically underserved communities, take steps to restore the vital trust be-tween law enforcement officers and the community, and would keep guns out of the hands of those seeking to do harm. Mr. Speaker, let’s talk about these issues in my bill. Let’s debate them. Let’s vote on them. I urge my col-leagues to listen to the American peo-ple. Lastly, I am outraged that anyone would accuse the President of starting any type of racial issue. The President has spoken about gun violence preven-tion and preventing cops from getting killed and preventing innocent people from getting killed also, so I am out-raged to hear these statements.

SUICIDE PREVENTION MONTH The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. M
URPHY ) for 5 min-utes. Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, since September 1, the first day of National Suicide Prevention Month, 944 Americans have died by sui-cide, including 160 veterans. Since the passage of H.R. 2646, the mental health reform act, in the House of Representatives in July, 7,552 Ameri-cans have died from suicide, including 1,280 veterans. I had the honor of meeting the par-ents of Sergeant Daniel Somers, who served bravely in Operation Iraqi Free-dom. On June 13, 2013, Daniel took his own life after suffering from PTSD and traumatic brain injury. His family is heartbroken. He left a letter for his family before he took his own life, and I would like to share his words. He wrote: 
I am sorry that it has come to this. The fact is, for as long as I can remember, my motivation for getting up every day has been so that you would not have to bury me. As things have continued to get worse, it has become clear that this alone is not a suffi-cient reason to carry on. The fact is I am not getting better, I am not going to get any better, and I will most certainly deteriorate further as time goes on. From a logical standpoint, it is better to simply end things quickly and let any reper-cussions from that play out in the short term than to drag things out into the long term. I really have been trying to hang on for more than a decade now. Each day has been a testament to the extent to which I cared, suffering unspeakable horror as quietly as possible so that you could feel as though I was still here for you. In truth, I was nothing more than a prop, filling space so that my absence would not be noted. In truth, I have already been absent for a long, long time. My body has become nothing but a cage, a source of pain and constant problems . . . It is nothing short of torture. My mind is a wasteland, filled with visions of incredible horror, unceasing depression, and crippling anxiety. Is it any wonder then that the latest fig-ures show 22 veterans killing themselves each day? That is more veterans than chil-dren who were killed at Sandy Hook every single day. Where are the huge policy initia-tives? Well, Mr. Speaker, this is a letter that did not have to be written. I can’t even imagine the grief of the parents of Daniel, but I also know that they want to spare other parents the same kind of grief. I continue to practice psychology at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center at Bethesda. I work with vet-erans who, like Daniel, suffer from de-pression and PTSD and traumatic brain injury. I have seen firsthand that, with treatment, these soldiers can and do get better. When our brave men and women come home, they and their families de-serve better care. Yet we do not have enough crisis psychiatric hospital beds. Half the counties in America have no psychiatrists or no psychologists. And for every 1,000 people with an addiction disorder, only 6—only 6—get evidence- based care, and families are blocked from helping by a massive bureauc-racy. So we can read more sad letters like Daniel’s, or we can act. The House an-swered that call on July 6, 2016, when we passed, by a near-unanimous vote, H.R. 2646, the Helping Families in Men-tal Health Crisis Act. But it only works and it only gives help if it is signed into law. I don’t want any more moments of si-lence for Daniel or the thousands of other veterans or citizens who have died by suicide. We don’t need more moments of silence. We need times of action. Those moments of silence are a slap in the face to the mothers and fa-thers who struggle to get help for their sons and daughters. So I ask: How can the Senate even contemplate the talk of going home be-fore this is passed with this death toll climbing, even when they have the so-lution in their hands? Indecision and politics are overruling compassion and common sense. What about veterans like Daniel, for whom help never came? On behalf of those silenced voices, I call upon the Senate to take action and pass H.R. 2646 before they go home at the end of September. We must have treatment before tragedy. We must provide mental health support. After all, 90 percent of suicide deaths have a co-occurring mental illness. Otherwise, what will we tell those family members who find the next suicide note, that when there was a chance to act, Con-gress went home? These veterans will never go home. These thousands of other people who commit suicide, nonveterans, will never go home again, and the Senate should not go home again in September without passing H.R. 2646. Remember, where there is help, there is hope. f 
NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION MONTH The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. B
LUMENAUER ) for 5 min-utes. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to follow my good friend, Dr. M
URPHY , on the floor. I ap-preciate his tireless efforts in terms of mental health and of suicide preven-tion. I was pleased this week to intro-duce with him legislation to recognize September as National Suicide Preven-tion Month. We have this ritual of designating certain days, weeks, and months in honor of issues that can be momentous and sometimes arcane, but this one is existential. We are looking at a time of great di-vision not just in Congress but in American society. Suicide prevention ought to be a great unifier. We lose five lives every hour to a cause that is usu-ally treatable and often preventable. The nature of the suicide epidemic, which has been increasing every year for the last decade, has the power to unite and bring people together to make a difference. I applaud him for his work on the mental health legislation. I hope that we are all encouraged and emboldened, particularly as relates to our veterans, and his work there is commendable. We are losing a veteran almost every hour to suicide. It is also the second leading cause of death among young people ages 10 to 34, yet people who commit suicide almost always show symptoms that could be diagnosed and treated. In addition to the tragic disruption on individuals and families, it is esti-mated that suicide results in $44 billion in combined economic and work costs. It is a national crisis and a tragedy that has touched almost every family I know. The area of suicide prevention is one of shared passions that can contribute to solutions. For mental health profes-sionals, it is rich with possibilities. If you are concerned about gun violence, this is an area of opportunity. Those who attempt suicide with a firearm are successful about 85 percent of the time.

Drug and alcohol abuse is a factor in many cases. Due to the underlying sub-stance abuse or issues, individual ac-tions can be clouded by the influence of drug or alcohol when suicide is at-tempted. There is a role for each and every one of us to play as advocates, as individ-uals, for treatment and suicide preven-tion counseling, recovery, and to sup-port the grief of the family members left behind. I am excited about the network of or-ganizations across the country, often with major volunteer input, who are making a difference. I visited one re-cently in my community, Lines for Life, that has volunteers manning 24- hour phone lines to help people in a time of crisis. b1045 It is overseen by licensed clinicians. This one volunteer-driven organization handles nearly 55,000 calls per year, of-fering immediate assistance to people who want to overcome substance abuse, prevent suicide, and find treat-ment for happier, more productive lives. Mr. Speaker, I am hopeful that we will, in fact, designate September as Suicide Prevention Month, but that every month will be Suicide Preven-tion Month and that we will all rededi-cate ourselves to combating this epi-demic that touches lives in every one of our communities.

THE SIMPLE ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. C
OSTELLO ) for 5 min-utes. Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Streamlining Income-Driven, Manage-able Payments on Loans for Education Act or, more simply, the SIMPLE Act. I first want to thank Congresswoman S
UZANNE BONAMICI for her leadership and hard work on this bill, which I am proud to introduce with her today. Education is an area where we should be focused on bipartisan solutions be-cause every Pennsylvanian—indeed, every American—deserves the oppor-tunity to succeed, and that path to suc-cess starts with an education. Many of my constituents have ex-pressed concerns about the cost of a college education, including making payments on their student loans after they graduate. The challenge of how to responsibly manage student debt makes this bill so important. The SIMPLE Act would assist mil-lions of Americans who carry student loan debt. For many young people, stu-dent loan debt is the first type of debt they incur, but it can leave them un-able to invest in their future, despite being employed and working hard. Consider that borrowers who miss payments may face lifelong ramifica-tions that make it more expensive and, in some cases, prohibitive to rent an apartment or purchase a home or a car. Our bill would assist borrowers on the verge of default by notifying them of more affordable repayment plans. ‘‘The SIMPLE Act establishes proc-esses to automatically enroll severely delinquent borrowers in income-driven repayment plans with low monthly payments. The legislation also automates the annual process for up-dating income information while en-rolled in these plans, ensuring that borrowers continue to make affordable payments.’’ ‘‘This measure uses the information borrowers already have on file at the Internal Revenue Service to eliminate the obstacles to enrolling in an afford-able repayment plan and lets borrowers benefit from lower monthly pay-ments.’’ But even those enrolled in af-fordable repayment plans face the pa-perwork hassle of a complicated proc-ess of having to annually recertify their income to keep their low pay-ment. Failure to promptly recertify can, as I mentioned, result in substan-tial economic detriment. That is, again, why our legislation will respon-sibly relieve some of that burden by automatically updating a borrower’s income. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. It will assist borrowers in getting back on track and, in turn, reduce the negative impact of a missed loan pay-ment. RECOGNIZING 95 YEARS OF EXEMPLARY SERVICE  
OF THE LIMERICK FIRE COMPANY  
Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 95 years of exemplary service to the 14,000 residents of Limerick Township, Mont-gomery County, by the Limerick Township Fire Company. Organized in 1921 and chartered in 1927, its now 250 members and 35 active firefighters are doing a tremendous job in keeping Limerick Township safe, dedicating thousands of hours every year. I want to thank the company presi-dent, Tom Walters, and all the mem-bers of the Limerick Township Fire De-partment for the great work that they do. I wish them the very best for the next 95 years of service to the Limerick Township Fire Company and beyond.

JULY’S VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. S
PEIER ) for 5 minutes. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, the minor-ity has for many months now begged and pleaded to have a bill come to this floor for a vote on gun violence preven-tion. We have even had a sit-in. But all that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are willing to do is have mo-ments of silence and then be silent. The only moments of silence are for those names that are in the headlines. That is not good enough. All of the deaths matter, and all of the deaths from mass shootings in the month of July deserve to be recognized by all of us. So as I have done each month since the beginning of this year, I will now read the names of all those who were killed in mass shootings in the month of July: Alex Freeman, 28, and Marcus Cal, also 28, were killed on July 4 in Chat-tanooga. Armando Cardona, 45, and Naome Innis, 35, were killed on July 4 in Phoe-nix. Charles Jackson, 28, Jamal Dataunte Dixon-Lackey, 26, and Daquarius Tuck-er, 19, were killed at a Fourth of July block party in Houston, Texas. Daquarius’ brother was also shot and killed this summer. Police said both brothers were innocent bystanders. Demetrius Grant, 39, was killed at a party on July 5 in LA. Jeffrey Adams, 52, was killed by his neighbor on July 5 in Hiram, Georgia. Jennifer Rooney, 44, was killed by a mass shooter while driving on July 7 in Bristol, Tennessee. Five Dallas police officers—Brent Thompson, Patrick Zamarripa, Mi-chael Krol, Michael Smith, and Lorne Aherns—were killed in the line of duty on July 7 in Dallas, Texas. Domingo Rodriguez Rhines, 40, was killed in Shreveport, Louisiana. Joseph Zangaro, 61, and Ron Kienzle, 60, both court bailiffs, were killed by an escaping suspect on July 11 in St. Joseph, Michigan. Jacara Sproaps, 38, and Maurice Partlow, 40, were killed by Jacara’s ex- boyfriend on July 13 in St. Louis, Mis-souri. Jacara was an elementary school principal beloved by the community. Eric Gaiter, 22, was killed July 14 in Akron, Ohio, while at a vigil for an-other gun violence victim. Three unidentified people were killed at a home in Crosby, Texas. Joseph Lamar, 38, Janell Renee Knight, 43, and Zachary David Thomp-son, 36, were killed by their friend on July 15 in Woodland, Washington. Miguel Bravo, 21, was killed when gunmen open-fired on the house party next door on July 16 in Bakersfield, California. Three police officers, Montrell Jack-son, 32, Matthew Gerald, 41, and Brad Garafola, 45, were killed in the line of duty on July 17 in Baton Rouge, Lou-isiana. Edward James Long, 49, was killed on July 17 in Houston, Texas, while stand-ing outside a Walgreens. Bobbie Odneal, III, 23, and Rickey McGowan, 25, were killed on July 23 at a nightclub in Cincinnati, Ohio. Erica Rodriguez, 21, her 3-year-old son, and Paula Nino, 20, were killed by Erica’s boyfriend on July 23 in Bastrop, Texas. Kalif Goens, 22, was killed by his brother on July 24 in a bar in Ham-ilton, Ohio. Sean Archilles, 14, and Stef’An Strawder, 18, were killed outside an under-18 club on July 25 in Fort Myers, Florida. Denzel Childs, 25, and Kayana Armond, 34, were killed on July 28 at a

block party in Chicago, Illinois. Jes-sica Williams, 16, witnessed the shoot-ing and suffered an asthma attack that killed her. Davon Harper, 23, was killed on July 28 in Baltimore, Maryland. Anna Bui, Jake Long, and Jordan Ebner, all 19, were killed on July 30 in Washington when Anna’s ex-boyfriend showed up at the house party with an AR–15. Carole Comer, 71; her son, John Comer, 50; and her daughter, Rebecca Kelleher, 45, were killed by their hus-band and father on July 30 in Bridge-ton, Missouri. Takeeya Fulton, 39, and her children, Nuckeria and Corey, were killed by Takeeya’s boyfriend on July 31 in Miami-Dade County, Florida. A few words about my constituent, Teqnika Moultrie, 30, who was killed on July 31 in Austin, Texas. She was from San Carlos and worked as a school bus driver for Sequoia Union High School District. She was visiting with her wife’s family in Aus-tin when a gunman opened fire as she exited a doughnut shop. She died in her wife’s arms. They had only been mar-ried for 3 months. After her death, her wife said: We just wanted to live a nor-mal life, an everyday life and raise a family, be good moms and do it to-gether. Now we don’t get to do any-thing. So many of these people killed at parties, on the sidewalks, and in their homes by people who were supposed to love them don’t get to do any of that. Mr. Speaker, deaths matter. All deaths matter.

ZIKA FUNDING The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. C
URBELO ) for 5 minutes. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to implore Congress to take action to fund Zika response ef-forts in South Florida, throughout the country, and all over the world. Seven months have passed since the adminis-tration made its initial request for $1.9 billion to combat Zika, a request I sup-ported. As of September 7, the State of Flor-ida alone has seen 596 travel-related cases and 80 Zika infections involving pregnant women. Across the United States, thousands more have been in-fected with the virus. Mr. Speaker, Florida has been ground zero for Zika, and we are seeing first-hand the devastating impacts it has not only on public health but on our economy as well. Neighborhoods in Wynwood and Miami Beach and other communities across Florida are seeing decreased tourist traffic, and some residents, es-pecially pregnant women, are fearful to venture outdoors. My wife and I know pregnant women who have moved away from South Florida to protect them-selves and their unborn babies from a potential Zika infection. Over the months of July and August, I met with the director of the Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Tom Fried-man, as well as other government offi-cials, including Senator RUBIO, Gov-ernor Scott, and my Florida colleagues from both parties to discuss the progress of the government’s response and the importance of funding these ef-forts long-term. It is imperative that Congress act on Zika legislation as soon as possible to provide the CDC and other agencies at the national, State, and local levels the tools they need to rid our neighbor-hoods of this disease. Combating Zika is not a Republican or Democrat initia-tive. It should be a national priority. The mosquitos carrying this disease will not discriminate between congres-sional lines or infect people from only certain States. All Members of Con-gress from both parties and across the country must appreciate the severity of inaction on passing Zika funding legislation. Let’s put politics aside and get this done for our communities and for all Americans. 
CONDEMNING AL -ASSAD ’S BRUTALITY  
Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speak-er, today I rise again to strongly con-demn Bashar al-Assad’s atrocities against the Syrian people. It has been reported that the government has, once again, unleashed barrel bombs with chlorine gas in Aleppo as the regime continues its brutal siege of that city. Victims of the attack suffered from breathing difficulties similar to the symptoms we have seen in the past when the government ignored inter-national law by assaulting innocent people with chemical weapons. This was the second recent chlorine attack that affected Syrians who have been cut off from aid and are unable to escape. In spite of repeated warnings, the Syrian Government continues to utilize barrel bombs filled with chem-ical weapons as a tool to remain in power. This continued disregard for human life and the well-being of Syrians un-derscores why Assad must go and not be allowed to take part in the political transition discussions or Syria’s fu-ture. The death and destruction in Syria is one of the greatest blemishes on human history. The entire world must do more to put an end to it. 
BACK TO SCHOOL  
Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speak-er, the end of the summer marks the beginning of the school year and a fresh start for teachers, students, and families. As a father of two young stu-dents and as a former school board member from Miami-Dade County Pub-lic Schools and now the husband of a teacher, I greatly cherish this time of year and the excitement that children feel while preparing to enter the next grade. Soon after classes started, I visited Redland Middle, a school in my district that has greatly benefited from my amendment to provide students learn-ing English an extra year to become proficient before test scores count against their teachers and schools. Like all students, English language learners must be counted without being counted out, and their teachers deserve our support. As a proud member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, ensur-ing young people the brightest future possible is a central focus of my work in Congress. I wish the students, par-ents, teachers, support staff, and fami-lies of Miami-Dade and the Florida Keys much success as this new school year gets underway. f 
b1100 HONORING MS. TANGELA SEARS Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to honor Ms. Tangela Sears, a local activist who has spent decades serving the south Florida com-munity. She has been an outspoken leader on many topics, including gun violence and the need to protect young people in our community from these senseless crimes. She is a confident leader who stands up for her beliefs, and a fearless advocate who works to make south Florida a safer place to live. A year ago, Tangela’s son, David, died at the hands of gun violence, a tragedy she had worked her entire life to prevent. Though heartbroken, she used the memory of David as an oppor-tunity to continue spreading the mes-sage of nonviolence and justice more than ever before. I thank Ms. Sears for her years of service, advocacy, passion, and strength to make our community a better place for all, especially those who live in neighborhoods that have seen a troubling spike in violent crimes. We are extremely grateful for your unrelenting dedication to our community, and I know that David is extremely proud of you.

DEMANDING ACTION ON FLINT, MICHIGAN, AND THE ZIKA VIRUS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California (Ms. L
EE) for 5 minutes. Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues who are demanding action for the families in Flint, Michi-gan. First, I want to acknowledge many Members of the Michigan delega-tion, led by Flint’s Representative, Congressman D
ANKILDEE , who are fighting every day to bring justice to these families. Their work is essential to ensuring the people of Flint have the resources that they need to re-cover. Mr. Speaker, the situation in Flint is nothing short of a tragedy, and a trag-edy that could have been prevented. Michigan State officials sacrificed the health and futures of Flint’s children in order to save a few dollars in water costs. This really is a shame and a dis-grace.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH5172 September 8, 2016 
Mr. Speaker, I have to ask, would this have happened in a city where the residents had the advantage of wealth? Or do these gross breaches of public trust only happen in cities where poli-ticians believe the residents are ex-pendable? Sadly, I think we all know the an-swer to that question. After the incred-ible harm that has already been done to these families, our elected officials are, once again, turning their backs on the people of Flint. These families de-serve better. The people of Flint were already hurting before the water crisis. The av-erage family income in the city is just $24,834 a year. No one can raise a fam-ily on that. Many of these courageous and resilient families struggle to find high-quality child care, access healthcare services, and afford healthy food. And now the costs of this crisis are mounting for families, the schools, and the entire community. We can, and we must, do more for our fellow Ameri-cans in their time of need. Two years since this tragedy began, families are still relying on bottled water for daily life. Imagine using bot-tled water for everything from brush-ing your teeth to making a bottle for a hungry baby. We can do better by these families. They need support, including health care, nutrition, specialized education, and developmental care. And we need to fix the root of the problem: the de-graded, dangerous pipes, and infra-structure that caused this tragedy. The shortsighted, dangerous actions of Michigan officials have already caused unimaginable pain for these families. We cannot allow Congress to betray these families as well. Let me just say that I was part of a congressional delegation that traveled to Flint, Michigan, to listen to the residents regarding the horrendous im-pact of these government decisions that led to the poisoning of those chil-dren and families. The environmental injustice in Flint is an example of how many low-income communities of color throughout our country, not just in Flint, throughout the United States, an example of how they are treated dif-ferently than affluent communities. Mr. Speaker, Congressman D
ANKIL-
DEEand members of the Michigan dele-gation have introduced legislation that would help these families rebuild their lives and get the care they need for their children. The Families of Flint Act, H.R. 4479, is a comprehensive plan to address their most urgent needs. It would provide for critical investment in Flint’s water system to replace the lead pipes that poisoned these families. This legislation would also provide essential support services to the fami-lies of Flint to help these children mitigate and overcome lead exposure. These are simple, commonsense measures for the people of Flint. Ad-dressing this tragedy really shouldn’t be a partisan issue. Every Member of this Chamber should understand the need for urgent action. It could happen in any of our communities. Yet, con-gressional Republicans have not held one single vote, or even a hearing, on this bill. That is just simply out-rageous. And let me just say that Flint is not the only public health crisis that con-gressional Republicans have ignored. There are 17,000 Americans—including almost 1,600 pregnant women—who have contracted the Zika virus. The President submitted an emergency re-quest of $1.9 billion for Zika funding more than 6 months ago, and the Re-publicans have failed to act on it. Now, if we don’t act soon, the CDC will be out of money to combat Zika in a mat-ter of weeks. Congressional Republicans also failed to do their job on gun violence. Every day, more than 90 million people die from gun violence. This, too, is a public health crisis; but congressional Repub-licans, once again, have refused to take up any commonsense gun legislation, even though 91 percent of Americans support background checks to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists and criminals. It is clear that the American people need Congress to do its job. The women in Florida who can’t leave their homes for fear of a mosquito bite need Con-gress to do its job. The families who fear gun violence on their block need Congress to do its job. f 
CALLING FOR ACTION ON PUBLIC HEALTH CRISES FACING OUR COUNTRY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. S
CHAKOWSKY ) for 5 min-utes. Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, on July 14, House Republicans streamed out of the Capitol as I stood on this floor with my Democratic colleagues calling for action on the public health crises facing our country: gun violence, Zika, and Flint, Michigan’s, poisoned water. It is now nearly 8 weeks later. Con-gress has returned from the longest summer recess in more than 60 years, but we still have seen no action from the Republican majority on our Na-tion’s most urgent crises. Meanwhile, we are in the midst of a Zika outbreak. Puerto Rico is on track to see 25 of its population infected. Florida has locally transmitted Zika cases, and it is only a matter of time until we see cases in other States. Ac-tually, we have seen some in other States. Parents who should be looking forward to the birth of a child are ter-rified that the baby may be born with devastating lifelong health problems. Yet, Republicans refuse to provide the funding we need to combat this outbreak. Instead of passing a bill with sufficient funding, Republicans insist on making sure, believe it or not, that the Confederate flag can fly at VA cemeteries and on preventing family planning clinics from helping patients with Zika. That is right. Even though Zika has the greatest impact on women who are, or could become, pregnant, Repub-licans want to add a rider to stop the family planning clinics that serve women from responding to Zika. Today, family planning clinics, like Planned Parenthood, are already on the front lines in fighting against Zika. In addition to providing family plan-ning services, Planned Parenthood vol-unteers are visiting 25,000 households in Florida to find people of reproduc-tive age, especially young women, who have likely not been reached by State or Federal Zika education efforts. They are providing Zika kits for pregnant women, containing items like insect repellent and standing water treat-ment. Family planning clinics are an im-portant part of our response to Zika. But instead of recognizing that fact, Republicans have doubled down on their extreme views on women’s health. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the Infectious Disease Institute at the Na-tional Institutes of Health, has said in no uncertain terms that if we do not pass additional Zika funding, we will have to stop our efforts to develop a vaccine. Already, Federal agencies have had to borrow money from other critical health priorities to address the Zika problem. We have allowed money to be taken—or the Republicans have— from Ebola, cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. We can’t keep fighting back by cutting back our fight against these other diseases. Republican’s refusal to pass Zika funding will have serious, deadly con-sequences for years to come. Ameri-cans can’t wait any longer. At the same time, the people of Flint are still waiting for congressional as-sistance after the tragic lead poisoning crisis in that city. I joined 25 of my Democratic colleagues in Flint earlier this year. We heard from nearly 200 community members, including par-ents, worried about their children’s fu-ture. After that trip, we said we wouldn’t forget these families, and Democrats haven’t. Again and again, I have joined with my colleagues to call on Republican leadership to bring the Families of Flint Act—that is a bill—to the floor. Flint’s Congressman K
ILDEE ’s bill would provide supplemental funding to repair and support this community’s needs. Lead has often devastating brain development effects, but families can meet that challenge if we provide the health, education, and the wraparound services that they need. But months later, we have come up dry. No bill to fund Flint aid. No fund-ing for Zika. No gun safety legislation. Nothing. What is on the floor this week? Well, we have bills that will help Wall Street make even more money. And we have a bill to impeach the head

HONORING THE CLEAR RIDGE BASEBALL TEAM The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. L
IPINSKI ) for 5 minutes. Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Clear Ridge base-ball team on winning the Senior Little League World Series in Bangor, Maine, on August 6. This is the first team from Illinois to ever win this prestigious international tournament during its 56- year history. The Clear Ridge Senior League Championship team is made up of 16 extraordinary 15- and 16-year-old men from the Garfield Ridge and Clearing neighborhoods in Chicago, all of whom attend area Catholic high schools. Their journeys to becoming champions began as tee-ball players when they were very young. But this Senior League team only came into existence in May of this year. In a short amount of time, they were able to come to-gether to form an extraordinary team. Clear Ridge showed dominance throughout the summer by not losing a single regular season game. In the postseason, they continued this trend by winning 19 straight games after a single loss to neighboring Burbank Na-tional in the first game of the district playoffs. The championship game pitted Clear Ridge against Asia-Pacific champion, Australia, whom they had already de-feated once in the tourney, and who were considered by some to be the team to beat. But Clear Ridge turned out to be that team, prevailing 7–2 to capture the world title. The following Saturday, I joined hun-dreds of people at Hale Park to honor players, coaches, and everyone who contributed to the success of the team. The title and the celebration were es-pecially meaningful to me, having played 8 years in Clear Ridge Little League when I was growing up. This team embodies the best of the close- knit neighborhoods on the southwest side of Chicago that I know so well. These are the people who often seem to be forgotten or overlooked in our coun-try today. Many of these kids have par-ents who are police or firefighters, and all come from hardworking, middle class families. b1115 When I read the names, you will hear a diverse mix of Irish, Mexican, Polish, and other Central European names. The championship players are: Paolo Zavala, Mike Skoraczewski, Bobby Palenik, Gary Donohue, Gage Olszak, Noah Miller, Tom Doyle, Joe Trezek, Tim Molloy, Dave Navarro, Mike Rios, Jake Gerloski, Jake Duerr, Mel Morario, Julian Lopez, and Zach Verta. Of course, these kids could not do it on their own. Team manager Mark Robinson and coaches Ray Verta and Will Trezek provided the strong leader-ship and dedication that helped dem-onstrate the importance of determina-tion and the results that come from hard work. Clear Ridge is more than just this one Senior League team. Multiple teams of both boys and girls compete in various leagues. Heading up all of these leagues are President Adam Rush, Vice President Ryan Aderman, and Treasurer Jay Derby. Without the work of these men and countless others who prepare the fields, work the con-cessions, and do all of the other thank-less but necessary jobs, Clear Ridge could not function. Congratulations go to the parents of all of the players. They not only raised champion baseball players, but good, respectable young men. Mr. Speaker, when I met with the team at the celebration, I told them how proud they make me, and I encour-aged them to keep up the good work. Now I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing this great achievement by the Clear Ridge Senior League team and in congratulating them on their world championship. I wish each and every player continued success.

PRAYER The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: Merciful God, we give You thanks for giving us another day. We pray this day, O Lord, for peace in our world, that freedom will flour-ish, and righteousness will be done. The attention of our Nation is drawn toward an impending election, but there is work yet to be done. Send Your spirit upon the Members of this people’s House, that they might judiciously balance seemingly irrecon-cilable interests. Help them to execute their consciences and judgments with clarity and purity of heart, so that all might stand before You honestly and trust that You can bring forth right-eous fruits from their labors.

CONFRONTING THE ZIKA THREAT TO SOUTH FLORIDA (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise for the third time this week since the House reconvened to demand Fed-eral funding to stop the Zika epidemic that is impacting families throughout our Nation, but especially in my area of south Florida. Reports have suggested that even those individuals charged with pro-tecting our communities—in this case, a police officer from Miami Beach—are not safe from Zika as they do their jobs to patrol our neighborhoods. Local businesses in the Miami neigh-borhoods most impacted by Zika are suffering, including those at the lovely Wynwood Yard, a very popular outdoor food and culture scene, where small businesses are suffering from reduced foot traffic. Many public outdoor areas are being closed to visitors, including the beau-tiful Miami Beach Botanical Garden after extensive testing found Zika-in-fected mosquitos on the ground. The Zika virus is costing residents their peace of mind and access to their public spaces and outdoor recreational activities. Mr. Speaker, we need more Federal funding now to confront this threat. When will Congress act? Every day that we delay is a threat to our fami-lies in south Florida.

NEW HAMPSHIRE COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY COUNCIL CELE-BRATES 50 YEARS (Ms. KUSTER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize and celebrate the New Hampshire College and University Council, which recently celebrated its 50th anniversary. I would also like to recognize Thom-as Horgan, the president and CEO of the council, who announced earlier this week that he will be stepping down after 23 years on the job. Tom has been a leader in the higher education field for many years and has made a tremen-dous impact on our community. The New Hampshire College and Uni-versity Council has long been com-mitted to working to strengthen the Granite State’s higher education sys-tem and ensuring that students are given the opportunities they so de-serve. The council works tirelessly to collaborate with both public and pri-vate institutions and to promote great-er awareness and understanding of New Hampshire higher education at every level, from students, professors, and administrators, all the way to the col-lege presidents. New Hampshire’s colleges and univer-sities are major contributors to our State’s economy, employing over 17,000 people throughout the Granite State, with salaries and benefits exceeding $1 billion. Education at every level is vi-tally important. We must continue to promote higher education in New Hampshire.

RECOGNIZING MR. GUS BELL (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to recognize Mr. Gus Bell and his 50 years of service to the Hussey Gay Bell Firm, a design and ar-chitecture company located in Savan-nah, Georgia, dedicated to innovating the engineering field. Mr. Bell joined the company in 1966 and, with his hard work, purchased the company 20 years later. He then led Hussey Gay Bell’s expansion to inter-national clients, proving itself an international pioneer in architecture and engineering. While a big one, this is only one of Mr. Gus Bell’s many accomplishments. For the last five decades, Mr. Bell has also dedicated himself to the enrich-ment of the State of Georgia. He has chaired the board of Mercer’s medical school, founded the St. Andrew’s School Board, and represented the State of Georgia in a major water dis-pute. Mr. Bell’s influence is felt throughout the region and, certainly, beyond. I am honored that Mr. Bell is a resi-dent of Georgia’s First Congressional District, and I thank him for his dedi-cation to our area. On a personal note, I thank him for all of his assistance to me while I was mayor of the city of Pooler. I am hon-ored to call him my friend. f 
CAMPAIGN FINANCE (Mr. KILMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a warning, a warning that the voices of the American people are at risk of not being heard. Outside groups funded by the deepest of pockets have taken center stage in this year’s election. The Center for Re-sponsive Politics reported this week that outside spending has already reached two-thirds of a billion dollars in 2016. That is more than twice what these groups spent at this point just 4 years ago. Wave after wave of these ads dominate our screens and turn political debate into a pro wrestling match. But there is more to the problem. This system gives a small group of the wealthiest Americans a disproportion-ately loud voice. It affirms the fear that so many Americans have that spe-cial interests and deep pockets have undue say. That is not good for the fu-ture of our country or of our democ-racy. It is time we stood up and said, ‘‘Enough.’’ It is time we stood up and said that corporations are not people. It is time we pass campaign finance re-form, and it is time we revitalize our democracy and bring people power back. 
f 
OBAMA’S CASH PAYMENTS TO IRAN (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute and to re-vise and extend his remarks.) Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, sadly, my remarks con-demning the shocking $400 million ran-som payment to Iran were understated. Yesterday, The Wall Street Journal re-vealed: 
The Obama administration followed up a planeload of $400 million in cash sent to Iran in January with two more shipments total-ing $1.3 billion . . . lawmakers have voiced concern that Iran’s military units . . . would use the cash to finance military allies, in-cluding the Assad regime in Syria, Houthi militias in Yemen, and the Lebanese militia, Hezbollah. 
Last month, The Augusta Chronicle disclosed: ‘‘No legitimate case can be made that none of the . . . billions . . . will fund terror. It’s inevitable. The White House even admits it.’’ I appreciate House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman E
DROYCE ’s ef-forts to advance legislation to ensure this can’t happen again for enemies who still chant, ‘‘Death to America. Death to Israel.’’ In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his actions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. The Presi-dent’s legacy is American families at greater risk of attack, ever, with fi-nancing. f 
REMEMBERING CONGRESSMAN MARK TAKAI (Ms. HAHN asked and was given per-mission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago, I attended the funeral of one of our col-leagues, my good friend, Congressman Mark Takai of Hawaii, who lost his battle with pancreatic cancer. Mark was a great leader. He served his country both in the military and the Hawaii National Guard, as well as being a public servant in the Hawaii State House and here in the U.S. Con-gress. He was taken from us far too soon. Mark was only 49 and left behind his wife and two children. He was a won-derful father and deserved more time with them. Pancreatic cancer has one of the low-est survival rates of any cancer. Just 6 percent survive 5 years past their diag-nosis. While death rates for other can-cers are declining, pancreatic cancer is projected to become the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the U.S. in the next 4 years. Every year, pancreatic cancer sur-vivors and family members walk the Halls of Congress advocating for more Federal funding for pancreatic cancer research, with the goal of doubling their survival rates by 2020. For too long, those calls have fallen on deaf ears. But perhaps now, in the wake of losing one of our own col-leagues, Congress will do what is right and dedicate much-needed funding to curing this deadly disease.

TRIBUTE TO MRS. PAT WALKER (Mr. WOMACK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of Pat Walker of Springdale, Arkansas, who passed away on September 3 at the age of 97. Pat was a northwest Arkansas icon whose spirit of philanthropy touched so many lives. She not only provided crit-ical resources for charities involved in medicine, the arts, education, and her beloved Razorbacks, but she also in-spired those around her to get involved and be of service to their fellow man. She was steadfastly dedicated to our community, and the honors bestowed upon Pat are evidence of this. A mem-ber of the Arkansas Women’s Hall of Fame, Pat was named one of the Most Distinguished Women in Arkansas. She was a lifetime member of the Winthrop P. Rockefeller Cancer Institute, the 2002 American Heart Association Tif-fany award recipient, inducted into the Towers of Old Main, and was a member

VOTING RIGHTS (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of all of those individ-uals who died or were assaulted trying to register to vote and vote. I rise today in support of all of those individ-uals who are registering to vote and will vote. I also rise to condemn the as-sault on Americans’ fundamental right to vote. Across the country, including in my home State of Ohio, we are seeing greater restrictions on voting rights following the Shelby County v. Holder decision. It is no secret these laws are designed to make it harder for Ameri-cans to vote, specifically, minorities. They are laws like the one passed by the Ohio Legislature taking away ‘‘Golden Week,’’ a week-long period al-lowing individuals, Mr. Speaker, to both register to vote and cast a ballot at the same time. Well, I say enough is enough. Our de-mocracy is stronger when all Ameri-cans, not just a few select, are able to vote. As our chaplain said today, let us work together so freedoms flourish. Let us not give up, Mr. Speaker. Let us pass H.R. 885, the Voting Rights Amendment Act, to restore the full power of the Voting Rights Act and right the wrongs created. 
f 
RECOGNIZING KIMBERLY BIGOS (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Kimberly Bigos, a student at Spring Arbor University in my district. Kimberly created the moving piece of artwork displayed to my left. I have had the privilege to see it in person, and the picture doesn’t do it justice. It is a life-size wheelchair made out of lit-tle toy green Army men, innocent as they might be. She used more than 1,000 Army men and spent more than 60 hours to finish it. The sculpture signifies all the as-pects of military service, from fighting on the front lines in battle, to return-ing home with life-altering injuries, to the supreme sacrifice. America’s veterans sacrifice so much and we often lose sight of the effects of their service. Kimberly’s sculpture is a powerful reminder about real life for our wounded warriors. These men and women have displayed incredible cour-age and heroism in service to our coun-try, and now it is time for us to serve them. f 
b1215 STARBUCKS AND FEEDING AMERICA TACKLING HUNGER (Mr. M
CGOVERN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. M
CGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, to kick off Hunger Action Month, today I joined with Representative L
YNN JEN-
KINS of Kansas on a tour of Starbucks on Capitol Hill to learn about an inno-vative partnership between Feeding America and Starbucks to donate un-used food. At the end of each day, Starbucks will package surplus ready-to-eat food that gets picked up overnight and de-livered to local food banks. I was im-pressed by the selection of nutritious food. We often think of Starbucks as a place to stop for a great cup of coffee, but we saw a number of healthy op-tions like salads, sandwiches, and more. Starbucks will expand the project to all its stores in the next few years. They expect to donate 50 million meals annually, diverting 60 million pounds of surplus food away from landfills and to hungry families in need. More than 47 million Americans suf-fer from hunger and food insecurity. In the richest country in the world, we must do all we can to ensure that no family goes hungry, and donating un-used food is a key step. Starbucks de-serves much credit for being a leader in the effort to end hunger. 
f 
SUICIDE PREVENTION MONTH (Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, recently, Roger Webb, of the University of Manchester, conducted a study which found that when parents have psychiatric illnesses or have at-tempted suicide, their children are at increased risk for attempting suicide themselves. Our healthcare system for families with genetic histories of other biologi-cal diseases should be no different from those of psychiatric diseases. We must intervene early before the mental health crisis starts. But, unfortu-nately, in the United States, with too few psychiatric beds, a shortage of psy-chiatrists and psychologists, and 112 Federal agencies that are a disjointed mess, no, we are not there yet. But the House passed the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act in July to make a difference in this. We now call upon the Senate to make a difference as well. They need to make sure they pass this bill and don’t pass up the opportunity to save lives. So far, since September 1, 7,672 lives have been lost related to mental ill-ness; and since the House-passed bill, 61,000. We have to understand we must have treatment before these tragedies and provide help before hope. I hope the Senate passes H.R. 2646 be-fore they leave in September. f 
RECOGNIZING SUSAN MARCHESE (Mr. ASHFORD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. ASHFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize one of Omaha’s most illustrious athletes, Susan Mar-chese. Susan has been a dominant fig-ure in Nebraska amateur golf for 40 years, dating back to her first two high school State championships in 1977 and 1978 as a student athlete at Omaha’s Duchesne Academy. After high school, she attended the University of Oklahoma, where she was a four-time letter winner and an indi-vidual runner-up in the Big Eight tour-nament in 1981. Throughout the course of her post- college career, Susan has won 18 State amateur golf championships, 16 Omaha city championships, and six Nebraska senior women’s golf championships. Her success on the green led to her in-duction as a member of the Nebraska Golf Hall of Fame, Nebraska High School Hall of Fame, Omaha Athletic Hall of Fame, and the Duchesne Acad-emy Sports Hall of Fame. Now, as a Member of the House of Representatives, I am here to recognize the outstanding career of Susan Mar-chese. 
f 
DEFECTIVE MILITARY EQUIPMENT (Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with grave con-cerns over a recent Justice Department Inspector General report detailing how Federal Prison Industries manufac-tured defective military equipment that endangered the lives of our troops. The DOJ investigation into FPI, which is owned and operated by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons found that ‘‘FPI had endemic manufacturing problems.’’ This photo of a test mannequin in an NBC News story about defective pris-oner-made equipment shows brain dam-age likely would have occurred from a small 9 millimeter bullet through a helmet. Making matters worse, the investiga-tion also uncovered that FPI employ-ees instructed inmates to lie and false-ly indicate that the helmets being manufactured had passed inspection and met the required safety specifica-tions. This is completely unacceptable, and potentially criminal. The FPI response? Reassign the em-ployees. Can you imagine if these were pri-vate sector employees rather than gov-ernment bureaucrats?

In order to hold FPI accountable, I have introduced H.R. 4671, the Small Business Protection Act. It is our re-sponsibility to supply our troops with the highest quality, American-made gear available. FPI does not deliver on that promise, and I request the support of my colleagues in this endeavor.

ZIKA IS A GROWING PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS (Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, when we left Washington 7 weeks ago, there were 311 Zika cases in Florida, and no local infections. Now there are over 600 cases, including 56 local infections, and the number of cases in pregnant women has doubled. Rather than meeting the serious pub-lic health crisis with serious policy, Republican leadership is playing a dan-gerous game by blocking Zika funding to make a political statement about Planned Parenthood and abortion. We get it. You oppose women exer-cising their constitutionally protected rights. You would like to live in a world where women don’t have access to safe and legal abortion. You want to live in a world where Roe v. Wade is not the law of the land and where women do not have access to contra-ception. Enough. In the real world, Zika is spread by mosquitoes and Zika spreads through sex. Safe sex means fewer infections, and Planned Parenthood will help in this fight. It is time to protect American fami-lies in the real world, where the Con-stitution protects women’s health care rights, and where we are facing a pub-lic health crisis from the Zika virus. Mr. Speaker, I urge Republican lead-ers to listen to anxious Floridians, Democrats and Republicans alike, who want Congress to act for them and not for attempted political gain. 
f 
100 YEARS OF SUPPORT FOR MINNESOTA FARMERS (Mr. EMMER of Minnesota asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Anoka County Farm Bureau. As a supporter of agri-culture in Minnesota’s Sixth District, the Anoka County Farm Bureau does an excellent job promoting the inter-ests of Minnesota’s farmers and their products and produce. For many farmers in Minnesota, farming is not just a job; it is a way of life often passed from one generation to the next. They work 7 days a week, from dusk till dawn, to ensure that our groceries are stocked and that Min-nesotans are fed quality food. It is not an easy job, but it is a vital one. As the backbone of Minnesota’s econ-omy, our farmers deserve as much help as possible. Without the constant sup-port of the Anoka County Farm Bu-reau, our district and our State would not be where it is today. That is why I not only want to congratulate the Anoka County Farm Bureau on this very special anniversary, but I want to thank them for supporting Minnesota farmers for the past century, and we look forward to a long future. f 
ZIKA VIRUS IS PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY (Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the Zika virus, which has now become a serious public health emergency. Of-ficials from the Department of Health and Human Services have spent August reiterating the dire need for funding to protect the American public from Zika and its potential harm. While the Centers for Disease Control worked furiously to control and re-search the mosquitoes that carry this virus, and the National Institute of Al-lergy and Infectious Diseases labors over finding a vaccine for the virus, Congress has stalled over funding the package. You have heard the cry from Demo-crats and Republicans about how seri-ous this is. In the United States, in-cluding territories, we currently have 16,832 active Zika virus cases. In south Florida, we now have cases of local transmission that could have been pre-vented with better vector control and preparedness. We must give our health profes-sionals the tools they need to fight the spread of this virus. Today I ask that we in Congress do our jobs, please. 
f 
COMMEMORATING FRANCIS BELLAMY (Mr. COLLINS of New York asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. COLLINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Francis Bellamy, one of the most influ-ential individuals from Mount Morris, New York. Francis Bellamy is the au-thor of the Pledge of Allegiance. Today marks the 124th anniversary of the Pledge of Allegiance, which was first published in a magazine called The Youth’s Companion, on September 8, 1892. The Pledge was originally written as part of a campaign to put American flags in every school in the United States. In its original form, it read: ‘‘I pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which it stands, one na-tion, indivisible, with liberty and jus-tice for all.’’ In 1923, the words ‘‘the Flag of the United States of America’’ were added. In 1954, Congress added the words ‘‘under God,’’ creating the 31-word pledge we say today. Bellamy’s words are recited millions of times every day and are ingrained in our society as an expression of national pride and patriotism. f 
HURRICANE HERMINE AND THE NORTH FLORIDA WAY (Ms. GRAHAM asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. GRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, more than 250,000 people were without power. Ten-foot storm surges destroyed homes. Lives were lost. This is what my hometown and north Florida has experienced in the past week as a re-sult of Hermine, the first hurricane to strike Florida in 11 years. It was one of the worst storms ever to hit north Florida, but throughout all the devastation and destruction, we also witnessed community, kindness, and love, or what I like to call the north Florida way. Organizations like the Red Cross and Salvation Army sheltered and fed those in need. Churches opened their doors to those suffering, and neighbors took in neighbors to help give them respite and relief from the heat. Mr. Speaker, it will take weeks and months for us to recover from this storm, but today I want to recognize and thank all organizations, volun-teers, workers, and people who have helped us all in our time of need. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. We are truly grateful.

HURRICANE HERMINE (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, this past week, the Tampa Bay Area was impacted by the flooding as a result of Hurricane Hermine. I personally vis-ited the flooded areas in my district throughout the weekend, and I saw families and properties that were dev-astated. Some of the worst-hit areas were along the Anclote River Basin. Unfortunately, despite infrastructure improvements throughout the county, this area has been repeatedly impacted by flooding. One potential solution is to dredge the Anclote River to help im-prove flood water egress through the basin. This will help provide residents with long-term relief. I have reached out to the Army Corps of Engineers to ask that the agency help craft a permanent, workable solu-tion. The safety of our community is at stake, and I will not rest until we get this done.

have to get funding to address the Zika crisis. We now have over 16,000 identi-fied cases. It is a terrible virus, and we have to get ahead of this. As a doctor and public health expert, I understand the importance of giving our physicians, our healthcare profes-sionals, and our scientists all the tools that they need. The NIH is doing mag-nificent work getting a vaccine up and running and into clinical trials, but we have to give them the resources; we have to get ahead of this. We also have to make sure all the pa-tients have access to reproductive healthcare choices, like Planned Par-enthood and other assets, so they can prevent the terrible effects of this virus on their fetuses and their babies. So it is incredibly important, let’s get that funding out there. Let’s stop playing politics with this, and let’s get the help to the places that need it. It is a public health emergency. Let’s do our job.

b1230 SHAME (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, too often victims of human sex trafficking are ashamed. But, Mr. Speaker, the traffickers and the buyers are the ones who should be ashamed and shamed. Buyers and sellers want to remain anonymous, but those days are over. It is time to use public punishment for their dastardly deeds. As a judge in Texas, I successfully used public pun-ishment. The SHAME Act will give Federal judges the discretion to publish the names and photographs of convicted human sex traffickers and buyers as well as sending them off to prison. Buyers and sellers who force victims to repeatedly sell their bodies should be publicly shamed for all of us to see. Photos of slave traders and buyers that appear on billboards will also deter other would-be criminals. Such photographs should appear before large conventions or sporting events—events where trafficking, unfortunately, in-creases. Let the public see the faces of slave traders and buyers of children— children that are sold on the market-place of sex trafficking. Shame traffickers, and shame on them. And that is just the way it is.

COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM (Mr. POLIS asked and was given per-mission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call upon the House of Representa-tives to address our broken immigra-tion system, one that serves our na-tional security poorly, one that inhib-its the ability of law enforcement to keep our communities safe and replace it with comprehensive immigration re-form so we know who is here, so that people who are here illegally will be re-quired to register and get right with the law and pay a fine, that we provide a pathway to citizenship for people who are here and playing a productive role in our economy, and that we can make sure that parents aren’t taken away forcibly from their American citizen children. It has been scored by the Congres-sional Budget Office that immigration reform would reduce our budget deficit by over $200 billion. There are people here today working, Mr. Speaker, and we don’t even know if they are paying taxes. We need to make sure that ev-erybody who works in our country pays their just share of taxes, fulfills their responsibilities as legal residents or as citizens of our country, and the only way that we can do that is through congressional action. I am proud to support comprehensive immigration reform. I call upon Speak-er RYAN and the Republican majority to put a bill forward that secures our border, reduces our deficit, and pro-vides a way that people are required to get right with the law and have work-place authentication.

DEMAND ACTION ON ZIKA (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, with sum-mer coming to an end and a new school year underway, the threat of Zika still lingers on, a threat we in the House took up months ago. The House passed legislation back in June ensuring the administration would continue to have resources in place to protect the public from the threat of Zika. This legislation came with tight restrictions to ensure the funds are spent appropriately. Despite this and after already agreeing to the proposed funding levels, Senate Demo-crats have repeatedly blocked this much-needed funding. Tuesday night, H
ARRY REID and Senate Democrats, again, voted to block this legislation— leaving the public’s health in limbo. This is unacceptable. Before the dis-trict work period, I joined my col-leagues in the Georgia delegation, along with our Senators, I
SAKSON and P
ERDUE , in a letter to the President de-manding that we put aside politics and urge immediate passage of Zika fund-ing. With newly reported Zika cases in our country daily, we should be focus-ing on protecting Americans from this virus and not petty politics. I am so thankful that our 12th grand-child, Robin Hampton Wills, born Mon-day, January 12, did not have to face this threat. That is why I urge Senate Democrats to give up partisan politics and move this legislation forward so that families do not have to face the threat of this terrible virus. f 
HONORING THE MEMORY OF CAP-TAIN ROBERT ‘‘DAVE’’ MELTON (Mr. YODER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. YODER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Captain Robert ‘‘Dave’’ Melton, who was killed in the line of duty several weeks ago in Kansas City, Kansas, in my district. Each night we sleep soundly knowing that there are men and women patrol-ling the streets and guarding our bor-ders to keep us safe and defend our freedom. Like Captain Melton, they put themselves in harm’s way out of service to our community and to our country. When one of these brave Americans loses their life in the line of duty and on our behalf, it is a devastating blow to all who wear the uniform and the families who support them. My heart breaks at each and every loss of one of these heroes. Captain Melton is a true hero who served 17 years in law enforcement and did tours in the military in Iraq and Afghanistan throughout his distin-guished career of service to our coun-try. He did not deserve to have his life cut short at age 46. Mr. Speaker, may God bless Captain Melton, his family, and all those who serve our great Nation.

RECOGNIZING D EMARCUS COUSINS (Mr. BYRNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mobile native DeMarcus Cousins for winning an Olympic gold medal as a member of the U.S. Men’s Basketball Team. Throughout Olympic play, he aver-aged 9.1 points and 5.8 rebounds. While his play on the court is to be com-mended, I was more impressed by DeMarcus’ work back home in Ala-bama. DeMarcus recently held a free basketball camp for young children at his alma mater, LeFlore Magnet High School. Following the basketball camp, DeMarcus organized an important con-versation about relations between members of the African American com-munity and law enforcement. Like many communities across the Nation, my hometown of Mobile has faced our share of challenges in this area; but thanks to local leaders and leaders like DeMarcus Cousins, Mobile can serve as a prime example of how to defuse racial tension and increase un-derstanding between all members of our community. So on behalf of Alabama’s First Con-gressional District, I want to, again, congratulate DeMarcus on his gold

CONGRATULATING DAVID PLUMMER (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Wayzata’s David Plum-mer on winning the bronze medal in the 100-meter backstroke in this year’s Olympic Games. David’s path to the Olympics was not an easy one. David is an alumnus of the University of Minnesota and the very first former Golden Gopher men’s swimmer to win an Olympic medal for the United States. After missing the 2012 games in London by a fraction of a second, he thought his Olympic aspira-tions might be shattered. However, David never gave up and continued to pursue his dream. This year, at the age of 30, he made the Olympic team and reached his goal of competing and win-ning the bronze medal at the Olympic Games. On top of his achievements in the pool, David is also a leader in our com-munity. He is the head coach of the Wayzata High School boys’ swim and dive team, leading them to a State championship in his first season, as well as winning Minnesota’s State Coach of the Year. Mr. Speaker, we can draw inspiration from David’s determination to over-come any obstacle. David has made the State of Minnesota and our entire country proud. Congratulations, David.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tleman from Texas is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the cus-tomary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. P
OLIS), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-tend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule, which is a fair rule that makes in order every single amendment submitted to the Rules Committee. The rule provides for con-sideration of H.R. 5424, the Investment Advisers Modernization Act of 2016, and H.R. 2357, the Accelerating Access to Capital Act of 2016. This package comes to the floor via the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Chairman J
EB H
ENSARLING , who brought this package to the Rules Committee because of the needs of the American people and the needs of the financial services industry that is trying to grow jobs, investment, and opportunity for people in America. We have an incredible opportunity before us today, Mr. Speaker, an oppor-tunity to take good ideas, good ideas that come directly from the American people. It is called the financial serv-ices industry of the United States of America, men and women who get up and handle our financial needs, many men and women who not only have dedicated themselves to the success of this country, but also to the success of the American people. We are trying to take this oppor-tunity to move those ideas that they bring to us today through the House of Representatives so that we have a bill that we can present on a bipartisan basis to the United States Senate and to the President of the United States and say these are great ideas. Mr. Speaker, I will tell you that your work that you do personally to make sure these ideas are brought forth not only to the Financial Services Com-mittee, but to other areas of this Con-gress to make sure that we are passing legislation that is about jobs, job cre-ation, and the availability of the Amer-ican people to have a better shot at the American Dream, is why we are here today. b1245 The goal of this rule and the under-lying legislation is simple: to keep the flow of capital moving across our cap-ital markets, to make it easier—not harder—to make it easier to overcome barriers for small businesses, entre-preneurs, and startups to have the cap-ital that they desperately need to grow and thrive. Mr. Speaker, this part of the Amer-ican Dream is someone who has great ideas, the ability, and the desire, and to take those ideas and match it up with the capital, a marketing plan, and the ability to move forth in that plan.

That is part of the American Dream to make not only your life better but, along the way, a bunch of other people who meet their American Dream also. Capital is the lifeblood of growing new companies—not a surprise—and access to capital can literally make or break small business. Mr. Speaker, it can make or break a person’s great idea also. That is why we are here today on the floor. Good ideas that come from men and women in the in-dustry, men and women who talk to the Financial Services Committee on a partisan basis, men and women of this Congress bringing these great ideas, and it is all on behalf of trying to give people a better shot at the American Dream through growing companies ac-cessing capital and making the hard break become successful. I have seen firsthand the detriment of overregulation in industries and poorly written laws, and I have also seen the power of the free enterprise system. While serving as chairman on the board of the Greater East Dallas Chamber of Commerce, I saw, first-hand, companies that could not get the capital that they needed because they weren’t large enough to qualify or per-haps had some other burden or impedi-ment in front of them. As we know today, because of tech-nology, time, and people’s purpose, we have the opportunity for doing some-thing remarkable. We have the ability today to enact legislation that will bol-ster opportunities for small businesses to secure capital, to reduce the strain of a one-size-fits-all regulatory regime, and to take that and add an oppor-tunity to overcome these by using the American spirit and killing regulatory things that stand in the way. That is why we are here. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes. Mr. Speaker, over 6 months ago, the Obama administration actually identi-fied the Zika virus as a public health crisis. It is well reported on. My con-stituents are aware of it. It has already affected many Americans in States like Florida, Texas, and Louisiana. The Obama administration requested addi-tional resources to combat the virus. The White House and the CDC cor-rectly predicted that the virus would soon spread to the Southern United States. In fact, just as Congress left for its 7-week break, there were several re-ports of Zika transmission in south Florida. In fact, just last week, the Di-rector of the CDC warned that, without congressional action, they will soon run out of money for combating Zika. Now, in a moment, I will talk about the bills we are considering, but I think the American people expect Con-gress to react to a public health crisis. Had we reacted 7 weeks ago, perhaps we wouldn’t be where we are today. I need and call upon this body to act today so that we are in a better situa-tion 7 weeks hence. In fact, the House is only in session for 15 more days before taking at least a 6-week break in October and Novem-ber. In the handful of days we have left, it is critical to provide an emergency package to fight back against Zika. That is not currently on the calendar, Mr. Speaker. Instead, we are consid-ering these bills. I will be going into the merits and lack thereof of them; but certainly, I think my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would agree with the objective assessment that these bills do nothing to combat Zika or address the public health concerns around Zika. The Senate did pass a partisan Zika funding bill to provide emergency re-sources. It doesn’t have unrelated poi-son pills unrelated to Zika. Obviously, issues like where or if the flag of the rebel States, the Confederate flag, is displayed, or whether Planned Parent-hood is funded, these are contentious issues here, but I think we all agree they have nothing to do with Zika. The Confederate flag does not have an im-pact on Zika. Planned Parenthood has at least a related aspect to it—repro-ductive health. Of course, one of the symptoms or one of the effects of Zika is a higher rate of microcephaly among children that are born to women who suffer from Zika while they are pregnant. So certainly the family planning aspect of it is relevant, but not central, to the issues affecting public health around Zika. We need to make sure that there aren’t any of those poison pill provi-sions and move forward. Instead, we have different bills here. We have bills related to financial mar-kets. The first one is the Accelerating Ac-cess to Capital Act of 2016. That one brings together several different bills that had been offered. First, it includes a bill that affects microcap companies, or pink sheet companies, and removes many of the SEC transparency regulations around how they sell stock and how they are listed. It is not a step forward for transparency. In fact, this kind of ef-fort is likely to decrease confidence in our public marketplace. It is likely to hurt the very stock market that pre-sumably it was designed to help. This would effectively allow microcap companies worth less than $75 million with one class of securities to issue an unlimited number of shares using shelf registration in a 12-month period, not even notifying the SEC ahead of the issuance, and permit un-listed microcap companies to sell up to one-third of the aggregate market value of their common equity using shelf registration in a 12-month period. In many ways, these provisions are at odds with the other bills that I will talk about, which provides some regu-latory relief towards private equity by favoring small cap public companies. It is hard for a small company to be pub-lic. It is questionable whether small cap companies should be public. When we talk about private equity in a moment, we will see that one of the features of that is: A, they have, of course, a more sophisticated owner-ship; and, B, they have a more con-centrated ownership. So, for instance, the issues like runaway executive pay, CEO pay, is less of a problem with pri-vate equity and a significant problem with public companies, and, again, in particularly small cap companies with diffuse ownership, which this bill would likely lead to more of. It would also remove exchange pro-tections like corporate governance re-quirements. Again, these kinds of measures reduce confidence in the pub-lic marketplace, they hurt the stock market, and, in the immediate and long term, they hurt the ability of companies to go public and access pub-lic capital because of the reputation of the pink sheets and the reputation of microcap. It is a fine line. I am sure that we would probably agree on some regu-latory relief around small cap compa-nies, but this package is not it. This package would hurt the stock market, hurt access to capital, and hurt the very legitimate players that it is de-signed to help. The second bill in here is the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act. It would eliminate Federal and State investor protection around crowdfunding in reg-ulation A under certain conditions. First, I was an original sponsor of the JOBS bill. I worked with many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get that through. I will be among the first to say that I was disappointed with the way that that has been imple-mented by the administration. Crowd-funding should be easy. It should not have 900 pages of regulations. The main consumer safeguard that we have in there is that nonaccredited investors are only allowed to invest up to $10,000. That is a very important protection that we have. This would eliminate that protection under several circumstances. One, if there are 35 or fewer purchasers; or, two, the aggre-gate amount of securities sold by the issuer is $500,000 or less in a 1-year pe-riod. It basically does away with one of the legislatively imposed consumer protections in the JOBS Act. Now, I would agree. I think there has been some regulatory-imposed inhibi-tions in the JOBS Act that I wish that we could strike out in a laser-like way with a scalpel. In fact, many States, in-cluding my own State of Colorado, have implemented more sensible bipar-tisan crowdfunding legislation that en-ables it to occur at least within a State in a much easier way than the very cumbersome Federal law which does inhibit both the use of crowdfunding as well as the presence of crowdfunding as part of an overall capital strategy be-cause of the difficulties concerning other types of capital investors and capital partners.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH5180 September 8, 2016 
I would love to see reform of the JOBS Act or reform around micro of-fering, but this particular answer real-ly undermines the entire concept of the consumer protections. It is not tar-geted. It removes the protections for smaller of the smallest of the small of-ferings. And again, what you would find and the danger here is folks—we can call them scam artists or folks try-ing to make a buck off of this and not build legitimate businesses—can sim-ply set up a number of companies each raising under $500,000 to meet the cri-teria of this exemption. There is not any consumer protection around that. There is nothing to stop a bad actor from asking for significant invest-ments for each of those companies, even from the same individual deplet-ing the savings of that individual rath-er than sticking to the $10,000 cap, which was in our JOBS Act. So again, I would like, and many of my colleagues on my side of the aisle would like, crowdfunding to be easier, to be done quicker, to remove some of the excess paperwork and regulation A requirements, but maintaining that basic consumer safeguard and not pro-viding exemptions just because there are 35 or fewer purchasers or $500,000 or less over a 1-year period. It doesn’t even address overlapping ownership or related status between, again, multiple companies that might each raise $500,000, might substantially have the same external owners, but would get around the JOBS Act consumer protec-tion provisions by effectively cloning a bunch of small companies and offering them up separately for individual in-vestors. These things need to be thought through. There is a kernel of an idea in there. I agree that the administration has gone beyond the legislative intent of the JOBS Act in its implementation of the JOBS Act. There is, hopefully, a way that we can work together to em-power crowdfunding to play a more central role in capital development in entrepreneurship in our country. This bill is not it. The final component of that bill, the Private Placement Improvement Act of 2016, would make it very difficult for the SEC to finalize investor protec-tions that it proposed back in 2013. The title would require issuers selling secu-rities under an exemption that allows companies to raise an unlimited amount of money to file within 15 days of sale a single notice of sale, which the SEC would then be required to make available to State and other reg-ulators. This relates to some current rules that the SEC is moving forward with. I think that, again, there is a way to tweak those rules, but I don’t think that this is the way to do it, to allow for unlimited capital to be raised under a single notice of sale. And, of course, this also affects the prerogative of State regulators, and there are a vari-ety of practices there, by requiring the SEC to make it available to State and other regulators. I think that there is room for im-provement in that area, but, again, the bill falls short. Now, the other bill, the Investment Advisers Modernization Act of 2016, a majority of Democrats on the com-mittee support it. Many also voiced concerns. Some were the concerns of the Obama administration about some of those provisions. But I am glad to say that many of those concerns have been addressed by my colleague’s, Mr. F
OSTER ’s, amendment. First, a little bit about private eq-uity and what this bill does and doesn’t do. b1300 My State and my district, like, prob-ably, every other district in the coun-try, has seen the benefits and the im-pact of private equity investment in its providing growth capital to companies, providing stability in ownership. There are over 100 private equity-backed companies headquartered in Colorado that we know of that support close to 100,000 jobs in Colorado. In 2015, private equity firms invested $12 billion in Col-orado-based companies. They are real jobs, and they have contributed to the economic growth that Colorado has seen over the last few years and that the country will see over the next few years. Private equity has helped to create and sustain thousands of jobs and has made substantial investments in every State in the country. It provides re-turns to public pensions, to university endowments, to many people as part of their own individual retirement plans and savings. It is important both from a capital perspective and from an oper-ating perspective—a very important sector. Firms that are owned by pri-vate equity—at least, because, again, there could be some that are not part of this—employ over 8 million people. The private equity industry invested over $600 billion into these companies. For physical infrastructure, for addi-tional hires, for expansion, private eq-uity has been a source of capital for Main Street businesses across our country, in my State, and everywhere else in the country. That is why the bill passed the Fi-nancial Services Committee with a ma-jority of Democrats—with strong bi-partisan support—and I think it will pass this body with strong bipartisan support as well. Of course, there have been stories about bad actors in private equity just as there could be bad actors among any type of ownership entity. That is what private equity is. It is a type of entity that may own a local company. What are the other kinds of owner-ship that a company may have? It may have public ownership. It may be public. We talked about that in the microcap bill. In many ways, that is a worse form of ownership in that there is additional administrative overhead that is associated with being public. Even if the regulatory relief were to become the law, there is still signifi-cant additional overhead with being public. It is very difficult for a $20 mil-lion or a $50 million company. Two, because of the diffuse owner-ship, frequently, there is no one watch-ing the shop, meaning that manage-ment runs it. We have the problems of excess CEO pay, of excess executive pay. There are horror stories of CEOs making hundreds of times the pay of the line workers. Those kinds of things don’t happen in private equity-backed companies. There is someone minding the shop, and the entity that is mind-ing the shop is an entity that is look-ing for long-term growth, for long-term stability. They are not in and out. There has been some confusion among Members of this body in dis-cussing hedge funds versus private eq-uity. Private equity is not a hedge fund. Hedge funds have liquidity, and they make transactions rapidly. They don’t participate in governance and growth. Private equity is very, very different. It is more analogous to ven-ture capital. They are in there for 5 years, 6 or 7 years, 10 years—long-term investors who are building the compa-nies, serving on boards, recruiting oth-ers to serve on boards, providing sound corporate governance, making sure that CEOs and executives aren’t paid too much, making sure that talent is in the company, making sure that growth capital is available. H.R. 5424 just takes a scalpel ap-proach to existing regulations by fo-cusing on aspects of SEC adviser reg-istration that impede the capital for-mation in the private equity industry. For instance, there are provisions in the bill that would make reporting to the SEC more efficient and effective for their purposes and less costly and burdensome for private equity firms. Keep in mind that private equity firms do not represent, in any way, shape, or form, a systemic risk to our Nation’s financial security. They are simply a type of ownership that Main Street companies have. If a private eq-uity firm invests poorly, runs compa-nies poorly, they will deliver a very poor return for their investors. That does not impact in any systemic way the economy in the way that a hedge fund—placing highly leveraged bets on derivatives or on some other financial instrument—can cause an entire eco-nomic meltdown, as we saw during the mortgage-backed security crisis in 2008 and in 2009. Private equity firms provide patient, stable, long-term capital to privately owned businesses across the country. In fact, they help take the emphasis off of the quarterly financial reports that are so important for public companies. One of the failures of public company governance is that there is too much emphasis on the short term at the ex-pense of the long term—too much em-phasis to pump up the quarter at the expense of medium- and long-term growth—2 years, 3 years, 4 years—in underinvestment in research and in

underinvestment in long-term growth. Having a private equity ownership of an operating company addresses that kind of moral hazard that exists with regard to the incentives of the public marketplace. Private equity firms have a long- term outlook that results in lower vol-atility. While the public company model may not perform as well as pri-vate equity firms, it, obviously, can provide access to capital, to additional liquidity that private equity doesn’t have. The two are related in that, for some private equity investors, their goal is a public offering exit in the 5-to 10-year time frame. That is not always the case, but that can be the case; and having an operable public market in addition to a private equity market is, of course, of interest and importance to the private equity industry as well, which is why the reforms in the other bill are so bad, because they deterio-rate confidence in the stock market. They ultimately will result in decreas-ing liquidity for the good actors, mean-ing some of the private equity-backed or owner-operator-owned companies that want to have a public partial exit or exit through the public market-place. Again, the bill isn’t perfect. The White House identified a number of issues. But, fortunately, my colleague, Representative F
OSTER , offered an amendment, which has been accepted and, hopefully, that will address a number of these issues. The amendment removes a provision of the bill that would have allowed cer-tain ancillary or minor funds or enti-ties that are affiliated with a private equity firm to also be exempt from an-nual audits or surprise inspections. It addresses concerns around trans-parency by continuing the current re-quirement that advisers provide infor-mation about fees and services in a brochure. It restores the transparency elements while maintaining the con-cept of the regulatory relief of redun-dant regulations with regard to capital formation and private equity. The goal is to enact this common-sense bill that will make it more effi-cient for private equity firms to oper-ate and continue to grow businesses on Main Street in districts like mine and across the country while simulta-neously maintaining the regulatory re-gime to make sure that nothing unto-ward is occurring. The bill does not, as some have false-ly argued, allow private equity firms to escape regulation by any stretch. In fact, most private equity firms have embraced the changes that have been implemented under Dodd-Frank. They have compliance teams to make sure they are operating properly under the new regulatory scheme. In any form, they do not represent a systemic risk, but to protect investors, many of them agree with the sensible regulations that have been imposed with the excep-tion of those that we are seeking to re-move that are redundant and that cre-ate overhead. When you create over-head for private equity firms, that re-sults in less investment in our Main Street businesses. If they have to di-vert funds to comply with unnecessary regulations for the sake of regulations, it is that much less money and that many fewer jobs in your Main Street businesses located in your districts. The substitute amendment makes positive changes to the legislation. It addresses many of the concerns that have been raised about the bill. I and many of my colleagues plan to support its passage and also take this occasion to make sure that our colleagues are aware of the contributions of this par-ticular model of ownership to our Main Street businesses. It has been a growth sector, in fact, largely due to showing, over time, superior performance to companies that have a public govern-ance model, in fact, in large part, due to their dissipated owner base and lack of concentration in ownership. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I appre-ciate the gentleman from Colorado’s not only observations as a business leader from Colorado, but as a member of the Rules Committee. He recognizes the need for ideas to flow up from the industry to Members of Congress, for us to, on a bipartisan basis, approach these issues to where we can provide safety and soundness for the American people.

MMER ), the gentleman who is of-fering his legislation, which is a part of title II of the legislation. Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. I thank the chairman. Mr. Speaker, government doesn’t cre-ate jobs; people create jobs. But with the President, Congress can create Fed-eral policies that establish a pro-work-er and pro-business environment to lift people out of poverty, to help families, and to allow Americans to realize their greatest dreams. One problem today that is impeding job growth is the access to capital for small business. Often, American entre-preneurs can’t get the money they need to start a new enterprise or to grow an existing one. In fact, small businesses still create the majority of new jobs in our country today despite the fact that far fewer small business loans are being made today than were being made prior to the 2008 recession. Compounding this problem even fur-ther is the unfortunate reality that en-trepreneurs from less affluent commu-nities often have the greatest difficulty in securing the capital they need to make their business dreams come true. As a result, thousands of jobs and hun-dreds of new products are left on the drawing board as unrealized aspira-tions of American entrepreneurs. Thankfully, if the rule before us today is adopted, the House can consider four solutions that will address this small business access to capital problem im-mediately. The Accelerating Access to Capital Act of 2016 will make it easier for busi-nesses to raise capital. First, thanks to Congresswoman WAGNER , this legisla-tion will make it easier for small com-panies to comply with SEC security registration requirements by simpli-fying the process, by eliminating dupli-cative paperwork, and by, ultimately, allowing people to do their business in-stead of compliance. Second, thanks to Congressman G
AR-
RETT ’s Private Placement Improve-ment Act, the bill will make it easier for small businesses to raise capital under rule 506 of regulation D, ulti-mately leading to greater access to capital for small businesses and unleashing the full potential of title II of the JOBS Act. Third, the Micro Offering Safe Har-bor Act will make it easier for Ameri-cans to raise capital from friends and family if three simple criteria are met. These three criteria include that the investor has a substantive preexisting relationship with the owner, that there are 35 or fewer investors, and that the aggregate amount of the investment does not exceed $500,000. Additionally, this provision would exempt such offerings from blue sky re-quirements, but with all Federal and State antifraud laws remaining in ef-fect. It is important to note that this micro offering proposal does not create a new law, but, rather, simply clarifies an existing law by making an explicit safe harbor for certain private security offerings under the Securities Act of 1933. Finally, thanks to Congressman H
URTand Congressman V ARGAS , the In-vestment Advisers Modernization Act will modernize the Investment Advis-ers Act by removing redundancies and making necessary enhancements to in-crease capital formation. With American productivity decreas-ing, wages essentially stagnant, and the U.S. economy struggling to get to historically normal GDP growth levels, these proposals in the Accelerating Ac-cess to Capital Act will help jump-start our ailing economy. By providing new opportunities to make the most of cap-ital formation vehicles that are al-ready available or by creating new ones, these proposed reforms will en-able American entrepreneurs and small businesses to access the capital they need to grow and to prosper. I thank the Speaker of the House and the chairman of the Financial Services Committee for prioritizing the consid-eration of these pro-business, pro-jobs, and antipoverty bills. I encourage my colleagues in the House to support the rule. This is a tremendous opportunity for the House to support Main Street mom-and-pop stores, aspiring entre-preneurs, and established manufactur-ers to create jobs, wealth, and oppor-tunity for Americans from all walks of life. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I do have a speaker, but I can’t locate her right now.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH5182 September 8, 2016 
I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, you just heard from one of our brightest new members of the Committee on Fi-nancial Services. This committee is full, on a bipartisan basis, of men and women who care very much about growing our economy. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. R
OYCE ), a senior member of the Finan-cial Services Committee and the chair-man of the House Foreign Affairs Com-mittee. Mr. ROYCE. I thank the chairman. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and the underlying legislation of this H.R. 2357. It encompasses, by the way, H.R. 4850, and this is the Micro Of-fering Safe Harbor Act. What I will share with my colleagues is that California is the innovation capital of the world. From Silicon Val-ley to Orange County, technology startups are reimagining the way that the world works, and these new compa-nies don’t have thousands of people on payroll. b1315 They don’t need dozens of floors of office space. They don’t need billions of dollars to function, but they do need capital. They need that capital to oper-ate. Our current regulatory framework creates impediments to these small businesses tapping into the market. According to the Federal Reserve, the startup rate has fallen sharply over the past 30 years. It was 14 percent of total companies in a given year, but today it is down to 8 percent. The like-lihood of a young firm being a high- growth firm has also declined over the years, and these trends are alarming, if you think about the consequences. These trends need to be reversed. The Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act turns the tide by lowering compliance burdens for firms seeking low-dollar in-vestments from a small group of inves-tors that they have a relationship with. So the legislation appropriately scales the regulatory oversight of cap-ital formation, while keeping intact in-vestor protections. The resources that startups would sink into compliance and legal costs could be redirected—to what?—to hir-ing workers, redirected to creating new products. Uber, Google, and Airbnb, these were all startups. Passage of the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act ensures that the next success story will be told. I thank Mr. E
MMER of Minnesota for his work on this important issue. I urge my colleagues to support both the rule and the legislation. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self such time as I may consume. The gentleman talked about the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act. Again, I think that there is the kernel of a good idea there, if the good idea would be to streamline the excess regulation above and beyond the consumer safe-guards that were put in the JOBS Act; if the bill, for instance, were to take some of the best practices from the States, including my home State of Colorado, around crowdfunding and put them into a revised version of Federal direction. To be clear, I would join my col-leagues in agreeing that the adminis-tration went well beyond the expressed legislative intent and legislative lan-guage of the JOBS Act in creating bar-riers to micro financing across the country. Unfortunately, that is not what this bill does. It cuts back by providing gaping loopholes on the consumer protections that Congress very thoughtfully in-tended to put in the JOBS Act. So these are not the unintended regu-latory aspects that the administration added to the JOBS Act. These are cut-ting away at the very consumer protec-tions which Congress deliberately—in-cluding, as one of the coauthors of the bill along with my Republican col-leagues, Mr. ISSAand many others, the protections that we actually put into the bill, this would gut. So, again, a kernel of a good idea. Perhaps the inception of this bill is, hey, we messed up on the implementa-tion of crowdfunding. Let’s fix it. Un-fortunately, that is not what this bill does. I wish it was what this bill does. It is something I am certainly inter-ested in doing. I think many of my Democratic colleagues are, and we would be happy to work on a bipartisan basis to address the poor implementa-tion of the JOBS Act. Of course, if there was something ex-pressly provided legislatively, we would be happy to go back and look at that. But this glaring loophole that is opened is simply not it, with regard to if there are fewer than 35 purchasers, under $500,000, some kind of preexisting relationship. These loopholes are sim-ply too broad and would effectively re-move the consumer protections that we have in crowdfunding. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the pre-vious question, I will offer an amend-ment to the rule to bring up the bipar-tisan no fly, no buy legislation, which I am proud to support. It would allow the Attorney General to bar the sale of firearms and explosives to those on the FBI’s terrorist watch list. If somebody is on the FBI terrorist watch list, they should not be allowed to quietly assemble an arsenal to com-mit a terrorist act. In fact, the FBI should immediately be on top of the situation, find out their intent, and see what is going on. It is a commonsense bill that would help keep America safe. My amendment would give the House an opportunity to simply vote on this commonsense bill, which so far, unfor-tunately, the Republicans have not even allowed us to debate. We cannot wait any longer for Congress to take meaningful action to reduce the risk of terrorism in our own country, and this bill would do that. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-sent to include in the R
ECORD the text of my amendment, along with extra-neous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. EMMER of Minnesota). Is there objec-tion to the request of the gentleman from Colorado? There was no objection. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, we have been talking about thoughtful young members of the Financial Services Committee, who work with people all across the United States who are en-gaged in financial services to bring more capital to bear, not only for small business, but also better investment tools, investor tools. We have had the advantage of having not only Mr. P
OLIS, a young entrepreneur from Colo-rado, but we have had E
DROYCE . We have had T
OMEMMER . We now would like to have another very bright, young man who serves on the Financial Services Committee to talk to us, who brings this bill to us from Winfield, Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. H
ULTGREN ). Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 844, which provides for the consideration of H.R. 2357, the Accelerating Access to Capital Act, and H.R. 5424, the Investment Ad-visers Modernization Act. I know how hard my colleagues on the Financial Services Committee worked in crafting this legislation that will strengthen our economy. I am, also, grateful for the hard work to make sure that this is a bipartisan ef-fort. I was proud to support this legis-lation in the committee, and I am hopeful it will see a strong vote of ap-proval when voted here on the House floor. I am proud to join Representatives V
ARGAS , STIVERS , FOSTER , and S INEMA  as a cosponsor of Mr. H
URT’s legisla-tion, H.R. 5424, the Investment Advis-ers Modernization Act. The modest changes that this legislation would make makes it easier to invest in job creators, our families, and our commu-nities. Dan Gallagher, a recent Commis-sioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission, agrees and has testified in the Financial Services Committee that the bill ‘‘preserves the registration re-gime for private fund advisers while at the same time removing or modern-izing—in rather modest ways—some of the more unnecessary, outdated, and overly burdensome requirements of the now 76-year old Advisers Act that drive costs up for funds and investors, and hinder the efficient allocation of cap-ital to help grow businesses and create jobs.’’ These changes will make it easier to invest in our communities, and these administrative savings then can be passed on to investors. The Accelerating Access to Capital Act, led by my colleague on the Finan-cial Services Committee Mrs. W
AGNER ,

would make it easier for small busi-nesses and entrepreneurs to access the capital they need to grow their compa-nies and create jobs. It is important that we have smart regulations in place that provide cer-tainty to investors and to our markets. It is equally important that the Securi-ties and Exchange Commission not un-necessarily inhibit capital formation. In fact, the agency has a mission that states these two things should be treat-ed with equal importance. This important package of legisla-tion includes relatively modest but meaningful changes to our securities laws that will improve access to cap-ital for smaller businesses and entre-preneurs without jeopardizing con-sumer protection. Title I of this package authorized by Mrs. W
AGNER makes it easier for more small companies to use a less burden-some document when registering with the SEC. Over the last 5 years, the number of smaller companies—those with less than 500 employees—has de-clined. This is the first time that this has happened since the U.S. Census Bu-reau began keeping data on the sub-ject. In 2012, the SEC’s Government-Busi-ness Forum on Small Business Capital Formation report included a rec-ommendation to modernize and expand the utility of form S–3 for a great num-ber of public companies. This is just what Mrs. W
AGNER ’s legislation pro-poses to do. Furthermore, the report noted that investor protection concerns have been substantially eliminated with the ad-vanced information technology, includ-ing EDGAR, which is the SEC’s elec-tronic disclosure filing system. The Accelerating Access to Capital Act includes two other very important titles. The gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. E
MMER ) has put forth legislation that would exempt certain micro offer-ings from the registration requirement of the Securities Act of 1933. This im-portant change in law would allow a startup business—the engines driving growth in our economy—to solicit friends and family to invest in their businesses. Investors with a preexisting relation-ship with those most committed to the company’s success likely have the greatest understanding of its growth trajectory and prospects for generating a healthy return on investment. This will allow small business to access cap-ital without having to navigate more complicated Federal securities reg-istration or win approval of the SEC. Mr. E
MMER ’s legislation will help fuel growth on Main Street and help create the jobs our constituents deserve. Mr. G
ARRETT , the chairman of the Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises and a strong leader on these issues, has put forth legislation to ensure the SEC re-turns more of its focus to supporting capital formation, just as Congress in-tended in the JOBS Act. Mr. GARRETT ’s legislation would di-rect the SEC to revise regulation D, so fewer small businesses are required to register their securities with the agen-cy. It would help eliminate some of the most excessive regulation we hear about far too often from our constitu-ents. The legislation will allow entre-preneurs and small businesses to go back to doing what they do best—inno-vating and creating jobs—ensuring families in our communities have a paycheck to put food on the table, can cover the increasing costs of health care, and provide opportunities to help their children be successful in the world. Again, I would like to thank Chair-man H
ENSARLING and my colleagues on the Financial Services Committee for all of this hard work. I encourage all of my colleagues to support the rule and the legislation to follow. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire if the gentleman has any re-maining speakers. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, in fact, in this colloquy, I do have an addi-tional speaker, and then I would choose to close. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, the Committee on Financial Services has presented a number of their members who have come to the floor today to offer thoughts and ideas on a bipar-tisan basis, thoughts and ideas that have emanated up from literally finan-cial services experts across the coun-try, commonsense ideas, and investor ideas. They have been vetted. They have been looked at. They have been talked about. They have been marked up on a bipartisan basis; and that is why we are here today, to make capital easier and more available from an in-vestor perspective, as well as from the perspective of the financial services in-dustry. One of the leaders from the Financial Services Committee for a number of years has been our next speaker, and I am delighted to yield 5 minutes to a fa-vorite son of St. Elizabeth, Missouri (Mr. L
UETKEMEYER ). Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the distinguished gen-tleman and friend from Texas, the chairman of the Rules Committee, for that eloquent introduction. I also thank him for all of his hard work on his committee as well as bringing this important bill to the floor. I also want to recognize my col-leagues on the Financial Services Com-mittee, Mr. G
ARRETT , Mrs. W AGNER , Mr. E
MMER , and Mr. H URT, for their tireless efforts on behalf of our Na-tion’s investors and small businesses. Mr. Speaker, today or tomorrow, the House will consider legislation that will allow small businesses and those starting or investing in small busi-nesses to access needed capital without being subject to burdensome and un-necessary regulation. As we have seen throughout the fi-nancial services sector and across our economy, one-size-fits-all rules are damaging our Nation’s businesses, fi-nancial institutions, and, as a result, American workers and their families. Main Street has been crushed under the weight of this administration’s reg-ulatory regime, as even the ranking member admits. H.R. 2357, composed of three bills that passed the Financial Services Committee earlier this year, simplifies registration requirements for small companies and facilitates access to capital without triggering costly regu-latory expenditures. H.R. 5424, the Investment Advisers Modernization Act of 2016, eliminates duplicative requirements for invest-ment advisers, allows for greater cap-ital formation and development, and streamlines elements of the 76-year-old Investment Advisers Act. I recently met with a company in my district that relied upon private equity to stay afloat and continued to employ my constituents. Capital should be used to create jobs and spur economic growth and, as the chairman men-tioned in his opening remarks, to help Americans realize the American Dream. Capital should not be used to fulfill meaningless and unproductive regulatory requirements. Our economy sits in idle. It is time to put it in drive. Regulation should serve to protect taxpayers and not hurt them. It should enhance the economy, not stymie it. There is no room for reg-ulation that serves to appease bureau-cratic demands. b1330 Mr. Speaker, I come from the busi-ness world, and in another life I was a banker on the regulatory side of the table as well as a bank examiner. I have seen the impact of rules and regu-lations on small businesses and com-munities, and my community as well. I have looked across the table and helped those small businesses get started. Capital is the lifeblood of these small businesses being able to start busi-nesses, help employ people, and be able to help people have jobs and enhance the communities that they come from. It is extremely important. These discussions that we are having today are important from the stand-point of enhancing our ability as a na-tion to continue to thrive and grow, and to stymie what is hurting our-selves. The statistics are there. Small businesses have been deteriorating. We have lost more small businesses in the last several years than we have had. So, therefore, why do you think we have the jobs problem that we have today? It is pretty evident to me. This rule and the underlying bills we will consider during the remainder of this week will move us towards an eco-nomic recovery and a more responsible regulatory environment. I want to, again, thank my col-leagues on the Committee on Financial

Services and the Committee on Rules for their work on these issues and for their advocacy on behalf of our Na-tion’s investors, small businesses, and employees. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, is the gen-tleman from Texas prepared to close? Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I would expect at this time that I have no fur-ther speakers and will close when given that opportunity. Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-self the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, again, while I do ap-plaud Democrats and Republicans for coming together around H.R. 5424, the Investment Advisers Modernization Act, I wish that we had come together around the pressing public health crisis of Zika. I wish we had come together to prevent terrorists from assembling ar-senals to commit terrorist acts in our country. Unfortunately, while the Sen-ate has acted in a bipartisan way to ad-dress Zika, House Republicans con-tinue to sit on their hands and ignore this critical public health issue. The CDC is quickly running out of money to combat Zika. We have yet to even begin serious discussions on com-prehensive immigration reform, with only a couple months left in this ses-sion, not to mention the crisis of lead in the pipes in Flint, Michigan. And, of course, in the weeks after the deadliest mass shooting in our Nation’s history, Congress has not acted on anything around preventing violence, as well. We should be voting on those kinds of bills. Many of those are also bipartisan, just as this private equity bill is, but I would argue that they are more timely, more important. Instead of focusing on policies that help save lives, Repub-licans are instead spending time on two bills, one of which will almost cer-tainly receive a veto from the Presi-dent. The other one, we hope that Mr. F
OSTER ’s amendment addresses the issues the President had with it, but both of which are not likely to pass the United States Senate. We are spending more of our time and taxpayer money ignoring the most pressing issues before us, issues that could move through the Senate, issues that I hear about from my constituents every day back home. Again, I applaud the Democrats and Republicans coming together around the H.R. 5424 bill. This bill, if it were to become law, would absolutely encour-age greater investment in mainstream businesses in our communities. It might make the difference of them making that additional hire or two. That might be your neighbor; that might be your cousin; that might be your spouse; it might even be you, that extra job or two or three that is cre-ated by encouraging private capital re-sources to be put into our commu-nities. Again, private equity had nothing to do with the financial meltdown in 2008 and 2009. There is nothing systemic about it. It is simply ownership groups of companies, and whether those own-ers are local ownership groups, whether they are founders, whether they are family offices, whether they are pri-vate equity, whether they are publicly traded, they all have pros and cons. We, of course, like to think of the very idealized vision of a mainstream business where it is owned by your neighbor and somebody who is account-able that you know, but those kinds of businesses have transition issues as well. When their owner-operator gets ill or passes on, what is to become of those businesses? What is the route to sustainability? How can we make sure they continue to add value in the com-munity? For many, for transition plan-ning, private equity can provide that answer. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the bill and defeat the previous ques-tion so we can reduce the risk of a ter-rorist attack in our country, and vote ‘‘no’’ on this restrictive, misguided rule. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time I have remain-ing. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. HULTGREN ). The gentleman from Texas has 7
1⁄4minutes remaining. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, thank you very much. I yield myself the bal-ance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate and thank my colleague, Mr. P
OLIS. Today has been a thoughtful exercise where there was some disagreement. That is okay. That does not bother me, and it should not bother him that he had to speak his mind in areas that he felt were important. But today, Mr. Speaker, Mr. P
OLIS has very objectively been able to cri-tique the bill in front of us, to provide his analysis of that bill, acknowledging it is a bipartisan bill, acknowledging that this bill is about jobs, job cre-ation, making life better, albeit that it might be one or two people in a neigh-borhood. This country is full of neigh-borhoods and full of people who want a better job, people who want a better opportunity to invest, people who want to have their ideas taken up, and this bill came directly to us today from back home, back home people who have ideas, back home people who are looking at rules and regulations and saying, wow, that is an impediment to my good idea. Mr. L
UETKEMEYER , Mr. E MMER , Chairman R
OYCE all said, oh, by the way, they have an American Dream they are trying to live up to also, and there are things that are getting in the way of their dream. So they do the things that are necessary to float their ideas up to their Member of Congress. It came to the Committee on Financial Services. The young chairman, J
EB H
ENSARLING , creates ideas that are able to move to legislation. That is why we are here on the floor today, subscribing ideas that provide more capital that is available. The cost of securities regulation con-tinues to fall heaviest on small compa-nies. Small companies are the engine of our economy, where many of the bright people who today, by graduating from college, going to business school, learning things, they realize as they enter the marketplace, wow, there is another hurdle out there. That is why we are here today. They want to bring their ideas to the mar-ketplace. We are here to help them through safety and soundness, through working through the instruments of government, and to do so so that tradi-tional financing options are available for small companies that work. Our predatory administration—that is this Obama administration—is using Dodd-Frank as its main weapon against the free enterprise system today. This administration is using the weapons that they have available to them to stop and stifle and to make more difficult the creation of jobs, the creation of more wealth, the creation of investment, and it is all done. We see this, Mr. Speaker, when we look at GDP growth. Our country is stagnant. Yesterday, when we were having the motion to recommit, the young gentle-woman from the Democratic side ac-knowledged most forthrightly, these are difficult financial times. All across America there are terrible financial times because of an administration that chooses to strike at the heart of the free enterprise system: the heart of the free enterprise system in health care, the heart of the free enterprise system in banking, and regulations on the energy industry, striking at the heart of people trying to get homes and keep jobs and to move things. This administration has a constant attack against jobs, job creation, and, I believe, the American worker, yet they find it easier to give lots of money to other people but not Americans for our own job creation. That is why we are here today. But we are not going to cast this as what this is about. What this is about is a positive effort about the American Dream, about good ideas, about bipartisanship, about fol-lowing the rules to get things through a committee, to get things to the Com-mittee on Rules, to get things on the floor, to get people to vote on a bipar-tisan basis. We have, essentially, four bills in this rule, four bills that I believe are desperately—I will use that word, ‘‘des-perately’’—needed by small business to grow and innovate ideas. What is on the other side of that? We have already said it 10 times, the American Dream. But it is also freedom. When issuers sell securities to the public, that means more money goes into the com-pany, money that can be used to hire more people, push a product and make it successful. That is why we are here. We are here to take the ideas, a proc-ess, in a bipartisan way. Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I include in the R

talked about, and that is the Zika funding issue.

Why don’t you spend a little bit of money on important issues like the Zika virus? We are on record. We are waiting for the Senate to move the bill. Mr. Speak-er, I want you to know your time that you have allocated today, the precious time of this House, was done today for bills that came to us from ideas from the American people that floated on a bipartisan basis directly up to the Committee on Financial Services, which brought these bills forward. They have been talked about, marked up, and vetted. They are good to go, and I am in full support of not only this rule, but this legislation; and for that reason, I urge my colleagues to continue to support this rule and the underlying bills. 
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE SENDS JOINT H
OUSE AND SENATE LETTER TO THE WHITE H
OUSE URGING ACTION ON ZIKAFUNDING  W
ASHINGTON , July 14.—House Appropria-tions Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, along with Senate Appropriations Chairman Thad Cochran and other senior members of the House and Senate committees, today sent a joint letter to President Obama urg-ing White House action on Zika funding. Senate Democrats today again blocked leg-islation that would immediately fund efforts to prevent and fight the spread of the Zika virus. Chairmen Rogers and Cochran wrote that given the critical need for these funds and absent the funding that was blocked today, the White House should ‘‘aggressively use funds already available to mount a strong defense against the virus.’’ The full text of the letter is below: JULY14, 2016. President B
ARACK OBAMA , The White House, Washington, DC. D
EARMR. PRESIDENT : Your Administration has asked Congress to provide additional re-sources to prepare for, and prevent, the spread of the Zika virus. We have responded by both supporting the reprioritization of ex-isting resources and passing through our re-spective chambers legislation that would provide additional Zika response funding. On February 18, 2016, we called upon your Administration to repurpose available funds to be spent immediately to fight the disease. On April 6, 2016, you did so through the use of existing authorities, repurposing $589 mil-lion for Zika response activities. Given the urgency of your request, we were surprised last week when Politico reported the fol-lowing based on information shared by Ad-ministration officials: ‘‘The Obama adminis-tration has so far distributed only about one- sixth of the unspent Ebola funding that it di-verted to combat the Zika virus.’’ This money is available immediately to prepare for and combat Zika, yet is seemingly not being spent. The House passed a conference report that would provide an additional $1.1 billion in emergency supplemental funding to continue to prepare for, and prevent, Zika both do-mestically and internationally. It is unfortu-nate that Democrats have blocked action on this legislation in the Senate. The con-ference report provides the same amount of funding that every Senate Democrat pre-viously supported. It fully funds vaccine re-search, and increases funding for mosquito spraying and eradication, Zika surveillance, and advanced development of treatments and diagnostics. The conference agreement pro-vides the same access to health services as your supplemental request, contains no new prohibition on any health service, and ex-pands access to health services in Puerto Rico beyond your initial request. If Senate Democrats continue to block consideration of Zika legislation, we urge you to aggressively use funds already avail-able to mount a strong defense against the virus. We also note that the fiscal year 2016 appropriations bills allow the Administra-tion access to additional funds. The Sec-retary of the Department of Health and Human Services has transfer authority that can be used as an additional source for Zika preparedness. The previous Secretary did not hesitate to use this authority to support the failing Affordable Care Act Exchanges. The Secretary of State also has authority to re-program funding to provide additional for-eign assistance to address the Zika virus outside the United States. We urge you to use available funding now to ensure our nation is prepared. Sincerely, R

ANAMENDMENT TO H. R ES. 844 O FFERED BY  M
R. POLIS At the end of the resolution, add the fol-lowing new sections: S
EC. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consider-ation of the bill (H.R. 1076) to increase public safety by permitting the Attorney General to deny the transfer of a firearm or the issuance of firearms or explosives licenses to a known or suspected dangerous terrorist. The first reading of the bill shall be dis-pensed with. All points of order against con-sideration of the bill are waived. General de-bate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and con-trolled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general debate the bill shall be consid-ered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of con-sideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to fmal passage without intervening motion except one motion to re-commit with or without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill. S
EC. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 1076. 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT I
TREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against or-dering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), de-scribes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject be-fore the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the de-mand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party of-fered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH5186 September 8, 2016 
‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitz-gerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy im-plications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Repub-lican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Rep-resentatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Al-though it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member con-trolling the time will not yield for the pur-pose of offering an amendment, the same re-sult may be achieved by voting down the pre-vious question on the rule....  When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the pre-vious question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amend-ment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amend-ment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, sec-tion 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon re-jection of the motion for the previous ques-tion on a resolution reported from the Com-mittee on Rules, control shifts to the Mem-ber leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for de-bate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy impli-cations. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican major-ity’s agenda and allows those with alter-native views the opportunity to offer an al-ternative plan.

ACCELERATING ACCESS TO CAPITAL ACT OF 2016 
GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-bers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their re-marks and submit extraneous mate-rials on the bill, H.R. 2357, to direct the Securities and Exchange Commission to revise Form S–3 so as to add listing and registration of a class of common equity securities on a national securi-ties exchange as an additional basis for satisfying the requirements of General Instruction I.B.1. of such form and to remove such listing and registration as a requirement of General Instruction I.B.6. of such form. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Texas? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to House Resolution 844 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consider-ation of the bill, H.R. 2357. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. D
UNCAN ) to pre-side over the Committee of the Whole. b1423 
IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE  
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 2357) to direct the Securities and Exchange Commission to revise Form S–3 so as to add listing and registration of a class of common equity securities on a na-tional securities exchange as an addi-tional basis for satisfying the require-ments of General Instruction I.B.1. of such form and to remove such listing and registration as a requirement of General Instruction I.B.6. of such form, with Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. H
EN-
SARLING ) and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. C
AROLYN B. M ALONEY ) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may con-sume. Mr. Chairman, regrettably, we know that we continue to be mired in the slowest, weakest, and most tepid eco-nomic recovery in the history of the Republic, and our fellow citizens con-tinue to suffer. The economy continues to not work for working people. Now, we hear a lot of happy talk coming out of the administration, and they throw statistics at us telling us how happy we should be with this econ-omy. But the economy is limping along at 1.5 to 2 percent of economic growth when the historic norm is 3.5 percent; and if you can’t grow America’s econ-omy, you cannot grow the family econ-omy. So all this happy talk coming out of the administration, try to convince the 8 million Americans who don’t have a job that this is a good economy. Try telling that to the 6 million Americans who want to work full time but only find part-time employment. Mr. Chair-man, tell that to the 94 million Ameri-cans who are out of the workforce en-tirely. So many of them have just given up ever being able to find any type of gainful employment in this economy. Again, it is falling so far short of its potential. All across America, Amer-ican families are worrying: How are they going to pay the bills? How are they going to pay the mortgage? How are they going to be able to pay their skyrocketing healthcare premiums under ObamaCare? We must—we must—get this econ-omy moving again, but, Mr. Chairman, our great challenge is the job engine of America is broken, and the job engine is small business. One of the primary challenges for small business is they cannot access capital. Right now, bank lending to small businesses is at a 25- year low. Entrepreneurship, the launching of new business, and innova-tion, Mr. Chairman, is at a genera-tional low. We have more small-busi-ness deaths than we do births in Amer-ica today. This cannot be allowed to stand. That is why, Mr. Chairman, I am so happy that today the House Financial Services Committee is putting to-gether a package of bills that will help unleash capital for our innovators, for our entrepreneurs, and for our small businesses. It is all part of the House Republican Better Way. We don’t have to be stuck in this lackluster Obamanomics econ-omy that is not working for working people. We can do better, and we must do better. So I am happy today that we will soon be voting on H.R. 2357, the Accelerating Access to Capital Act, sponsored by the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER ), who has been a real leader in access to capital. This is a bill which simply amends a registration form with the Securities and Exchange Commission to eliminate unnecessary cost for small private companies. This overburdensome regulation that has nothing to do with consumer pro-tection is strangling small businesses. We need to pass this bill, again, be-cause the cost of securities registration is falling heaviest—heaviest—on our small companies. Another bill in this package, Mr. Chairman, is H.R. 4850, the Micro Offer-ing Safe Harbor Act sponsored by the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. E
MMER ). This would give really small businesses and startups more flexi-bility to raise funds from existing rela-tionships without having the added cost of having to register with the Se-curities and Exchange Commission. The third bill in this package is H.R. 4852, the Private Placement Improve-ment Act sponsored by the chairman of our Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises Subcommittee, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. G
ARRETT ), and it helps the bipartisan JOBS Act reach its full potential by maintaining a clear and commonsense approach to regulations for private of-ferings. Again, it simply helps smaller com-panies raise capital. You cannot have the benefits of capitalism for American families without capital. I commend each of my colleagues on the House Financial Services Com-mittee for authoring these bills, for furthering these bills, and for what they will do to ensure that we can have economic growth for all, bank bailouts for none. Now, we will soon hear from the other side of the aisle, Mr. Chairman, and if history is our guide, we will have great angst, wailing, and gnashing of teeth that somehow this is hurting consumers. Nothing—nothing—in this package does anything to detract from the Securities Act of 1933, the Securi-ties Exchange Act of 1934, the Invest-ment Company Act of 1940, the Inves-tors Advisers Act of 1940, the Sarbanes- Oxley Act of 2002, and the list goes on. Fraud is fraud. Fraud is illegal. You cannot have competitive, efficient markets with it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5189 September 8, 2016 
b1430 But the SEC has a tri-part mission. Part of that mission is capital forma-tion, and they have failed. They have failed. We must succeed on behalf of American families. I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am going to oppose this bill because I think it rolls back too many investor protections. But I understand and ap-preciate the chairman’s goals here. We all support the goal of increasing cap-ital formation. We just disagree on the best way to accomplish it. My view is that the best way to stim-ulate investment is to treat investors well and protect them, and that means strong investor protections. I firmly believe that markets run more, and better, on confidence than on capital. Unfortunately, this bill goes in the wrong direction. It strips away protec-tions that investors want in order to feel comfortable investing in startups and small companies. I have particular concerns with title I of this bill, which would allow very small and thinly traded companies to sell securities using the faster shelf registration process. This raises seri-ous market manipulation concerns. Let me explain why. Shelf registration allows companies to register securities in advance and then sell them later on short notice, without getting SEC approval. Tradi-tionally, shelf registration has been limited to larger, well-known compa-nies, like GE or Apple, that are already widely followed by the markets, in other words, companies that investors are already very familiar with. In 2007, the SEC decided to expand the number of companies who are eligi-ble to use shelf registration. In doing so, however, the SEC was very careful to balance this against the need to maintain strong investor protection. The SEC was comfortable allowing certain very small companies to have a limited ability to use shelf registration to offer securities, but only on the con-dition that the company have at least one class of securities listed on the ex-change. This was because the ex-changes have their own standards that companies must meet in order to get their securities listed on the exchange. These listing standards provide inves-tors with sufficient assurance that the company is legitimate, has a reason-ably wide investor base, and will have enough trading interest to assure a reasonable amount of liquidity in the stock. Without the comfort provided by the exchange’s initial screening procedures for these companies, however, I am not sure we should be comfortable allowing these very small companies to use shelf registration. But that is what this bill would do. It would allow very small companies that trade in over-the- counter markets to sell securities using shelf registration. Allowing a small company, whose stock is very thinly traded to quickly sell a large amount of securities under the shelf registration raises real con-cerns about potential market manipu-lation. A company could easily bid up the price of its stock and then imme-diately dump a large amount of new stock to investors at the artificially in-flated prices. As Columbia Professor John Coffee noted in his testimony before the Fi-nancial Services Committee on this proposal last Congress: ‘‘Letting a small company with a modest $50 mil-lion public float use shelf registration to attempt to sell $150 million in secu-rities invites potential disaster and in-vestor confusion.’’ Mr. Chair, I include in the R
ECORD  his entire, very critical testimony of the dangers of this legislation.

LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS TO ENHANCE CAPITAL  
FORMATION FOR SMALL AND EMERGING  
GROWTH COMPANIES  Chairman Garrett, Ranking Member Waters, and Fellow Members of the Com-mittee: Introduction I thank you for inviting me. I have been asked to comment on seven proposed bills, some of which appear to be a still early stage of drafting. Reasonable people can disagree about several of these provisions, but others are beyond the pale. Still, my overarching comment is that each of these bills rep-resents a piecemeal attempt to ‘‘tweak’’ something in our existing system, but collec-tively they are uncoordinated and lack any consistent vision. If there is any common theme to these bills, it is that better inte-gration and coordination is desirable be-tween our twin disclosure regimes under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Ex-change Act of 1934. That could well be true. If so, the appropriate starting point might be to mandate a study by the SEC (within, say, a realistic two-year period) of how to better coordinate both (1) these two disclosure sys-tems, and (2) public and private offerings. Absent such an attempt at coordination, we will obtain only piecemeal (and fumbling) re-forms that resemble the seven blind men groping at the elephant. In particular, as these proposals suggest, private placements may soon overtake public offerings—without adequate attention being given to the appro-priate role of each. More generally, we seem to be moving from JOBS Act I to a JOBS Act II without any serious evaluation of the impact of the first round of changes. On balance, the JOBS Act may have had only modest impact, and the proposals that are being considered today will likely have less. Because my time is limited, I will analyze these proposals in terms of the intensity of my reaction, mov-ing from those that I feel are likely to cause real harm to those that are understandable (but that probably do not require legisla-tion). I will 509 begin with a provision (the definition of ‘‘well-known seasoned issuer’’) whose impact has not been adequately or candidly explained. 1. The Definition of ‘‘Well-Known Seasoned Issuer.’’ This may be the most radically de-regulatory of the seven proposals now before this Subcommittee, but it has not been ade-quately explained just how far reaching this proposal would be. The proposal derives from the 2011 Report of the SEC Government-Busi-ness Forum on Small Business Capital For-mation, where it was the 19th out of 25 rec-ommendations made by that body. Frankly, it received only lukewarm support. The rec-ommendation there made was to: ‘‘Expand the availability of the special public offering provisions currently applica-ble only to ‘‘well-known seasoned issuers’’ (WKSIs) to all public companies, including smaller reporting companies and foreign pri-vate issuers. This would permit such compa-nies to, among other things: a. File a universal shelf registration state-ment; b. Test the waters; c. Pay as you go; and d. Use forward incorporation by reference for Form S–1 registration statements.’’ (Em-phasis added) Each of these ‘‘benefits’’ can be debated. For example, a WKSI is exempt from the ‘‘gun jumping’’ and ‘‘quiet period’’ restric-tions of Section 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, and there can be reasonable debate about the wisdom of freeing smaller compa-nies from these rules. Still, the key implica-tion of expanding the definition of ‘‘well- known seasoned issuer’’ has not been ex-plained: it would permit the majority of pub-lic companies to qualify for ‘‘automatic shelf registration.’’ This may not have been the intent, but it is the consequence. Under Rule 405, a ‘‘Well-Known Seasoned Issuer’’ generally qualifies for ‘‘automatic shelf registration.’’ Since 2005, the instant that a ‘‘well-known seasoned issuer’’ files a registration statement, the registration statement becomes ‘‘effective’’ and the secu-rities can be sold under it—without any prior SEC review. As a practical matter, allowing a company to qualify for automatic shelf registration both (1) denies the SEC’s staff any opportunity to review and correct the registration statement before sales are made, and (2) makes it much more difficult for the issuer, its investment bankers, and its other agents to conduct a pre-offering ‘‘due diligence’’ review of the registration statement’s contents (because there no longer is a pre-offering period between the filing of the registration statement and its effectiveness). Further, the SEC has a sub-stantial staff in its Division of Corporation Finance that conducts a pre-effectiveness re-view of the registration statement and en-gages in a dialogue with the issuer. This pro-vision short-circuits that review and largely renders them irrelevant for such issuers. At present, a ‘‘well-known seasoned issuer’’ (or ‘‘WKSI’’ in the parlance) basi-cally must either (i) have a ‘‘public float’’ of at least $700 million (that is, the worldwide market value of its common equity, voting and nonvoting, held by non-affiliates must equal or exceed $700 million), or (ii) have issued over the last three years $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities. These are high standards. By some estimates, only about a third of the issuers on the NYSE meet this standard. Under the proposed legislation, the $700 million standard would be reduced to $250 million. At that point, probably a majority of the issuers on both the NYSE and Nasdaq could become WKSIs—and in most cases could use ‘‘automatic shelf registration.’’ Many of these issuers might be followed by only a single securities analyst, and do not necessarily trade in an efficient market. The SEC’s staff that reviews registration state-ments would be unable to focus on these of-ferings and would be left to concentrate on IPOs and very smaller issuers. This seems a poor allocation of the SEC’s resources. Since 1933, prior review by the SEC’s staff of the registration statement has been one of

the bedrock protections of our federal securi-ties laws. Thus, I suggest to you that it is a fairly radical step to deny the SEC’s staff any opportunity for a pre-offering review of the securities to be issued by most issuers. Yet, that is what this proposed expansion of the definition of WKSI does. This result may or may have been intended, but it both in-vites misbehavior (if an issuer knows it will not be subject to prior review) and encour-ages costly litigation (if errors are later dis-covered). Even if this proposal were cut back so that it only permitted smaller issuers to use ‘‘universal shelf registration,’’ I would still have some concerns. When shelf registration was first introduced in 1983, the issuer had to allocate the gross dollar value of its offering to specific types of securities (i.e., debt, eq-uity, warrants, etc.). Then, in 1992, the SEC permitted unallocated shelf registration. In such a ‘‘universal’’ shelf registration, the issuer may pre-register debt, equity and other classes of securities in a single shelf registration statement without any alloca-tion of offering amounts among these class-es. In 509 1992, the SEC lowered the threshold for Form 5–3 and universal shelf registration to $75 million (well below the $250 level here proposed). Thus, smaller issues can already make use of universal shelf registration. What then is achieved by expanding the definition of WKSIs (other than entitling the issuer to use ‘‘automatic shelf registration’’)? A partial answer is that WKSIs can uniquely register securities for sale for the account of selling shareholders without separately identifying ‘‘the selling security holders or the securi-ties to be sold by such persons’’ until the time of the actual sale by such persons. See General Instruction ID(d) to Form 5–3. In short, by expanding the definition of WKSI, we facilitate not primary offerings by the issuer, but secondary sales by large share-holders. This does not raise capital for the issuer or create jobs, but essentially encour-ages a bailout by insiders. Such secondary sales, which do not have to be disclosed in the original registration statement, seem particularly problematic in the case of smaller companies. To sum up, this provision is not what it seems. It does not simplify the issuer’s ac-cess to capital, but it does both (i) strip the SEC of its pre-offering review authority, and (ii) facilitate secondary bailouts by insiders. 2. HR 2659 (‘‘Accelerated Filer’’). This pro-vision would modify the definition of ‘‘accel-erated filer’’ in SEC Rule 12b–2 (17 C.F.R. 240.12b–2), which today makes an issuer an ‘‘accelerated filer’’ if it has a ‘‘public float’’ of between $75 million and $700 million (that is, the value of its equity shares not held by affiliates). Under the proposed revision, the new test would be moved up to $250 million (instead of $75 million), and in addition the issuer would need to have ‘‘annual revenues of greater than $100,000,000 during the most recently completed fiscal year for which au-dited financial statements are available’’ (see Section 2 of H.R. 2629). Thus, many issuers today deemed accelerated filers would escape that label under this revised test, including some with very large market capitalizations. What is the consequence of this change? First, it will allow many companies to es-cape Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and its requirement of an annual audit of internal controls. The JOBS Act already did this with respect to ‘‘emerging growth companies’’ (at least for a five-year ‘‘on ramp’’), but this provision would exempt older companies that did not qualify for that exemption. Also, the exemption could con-tinue forever and not just for five years. Sec-ond, under the instructions to Form 10–Q, an ‘‘accelerated filer’’ must file its Form 10–Q within 40 days after the end of the fiscal quarter, whereas all other issuers must file within 45 days after the end of the quarter. This is a further small step away from trans-parency. If the goal is to cut back further on the scope of Section 404(b), this might best be done directly without causing any other col-lateral consequences. Still, some estimate should be made of just how many companies will escape Section 404(b) by this back door. Finally, the JOBS Act had a stronger ration-ale for its Section 404(b) exemption, (namely, that it permitted a temporary accommoda-tion for young and emerging companies), whereas this bill’s exemption covers old companies and potentially forever. 3. Raising the Disclosure Exemption Under Rule 701(e) from $5 million to $20 million. Currently, Rule 701 exempts from registra-tion sales by non-reporting issuers of their securities to employees, consultants and ad-visors (and their family members) pursuant to a written compensatory benefit plan or compensatory contract. Effectively, this rule shelters non-reporting companies from the potentially expensive obligation to register stock options and similar equity compensa-tion under the Securities Act of 1933. But under Rule 701(e), some minimal disclosure is required, including financial statements and ‘‘information about the risks associated with investment in the securities.’’ This lim-ited obligation to provide such information is not applicable if the issuer sells less than $5 million of its securities under this exemp-tion during any consecutive 12-month period. The proposed bill before this Committee would raise this $5 million level to $20 mil-lion. Because the disclosure obligation under Rule 701 is minimal and does not require the preparation of any formal disclosure docu-ment, this proposal to raise the exemption by 400% to $20 million seems hard to justify. First, there is no rationale advanced for the $20 million threshold. Second, there is little hardship or burden in giving your financial statements to your own employees. This pro-posal did not even seem to win substantial support within the small business commu-nity (as it has not been regularly cited at the SEC’s Government-Business Forum on Small Business Capital Formation). Further, once the volume of sales under Rule 701 exceeds $5 million and begins to ap-proach $20 million, the cost of providing minimal disclosure falls as a percentage of the total transaction. It may seem a nui-sance to an issuer to provide disclosure when its Rule 701 sales are minimal, but if the sales fall into the $5 to $20 million range, this is a major (and probably recurring) ac-tivity for the issuer. 4. Expanding the Availability of Form S–3. Today, eligibility for use of Form S–3 (and thus the ability to use shelf-registration) generally requires that an issuer have a ‘‘public float’’ of at least $75 million. See General Instruction IB(1) to Form S–3. In ad-dition, other registrants can use Form S–3 if (i) the aggregate market value of securities sold by the registrant during the period of 12 calendar months immediately preceding and including the sale does not exceed one-third of its public float (i.e., the aggregate market value of its common equity held by non-af-filiates—see General Instruction IB(6)(a) to Form S–3), (ii) the issuer is not a ‘‘shell com-pany,’’ and (iii) the registrant has at least one class of common equity registered on a national securities exchange (General In-struction IB(6)(c) to Form S–3). In effect, this alternative test allows listed companies with less than a $75 million public float to use Form S–3, but places a ceiling on the size of the offerings that they may do using Form S–3 that is equal to one-third of their public float, Letting a small company with a mod-est $50 million public float use shelf registra-tion to attempt to sell $150 million in securi-ties invites potential disaster and investor confusion. Nonetheless, a bill before this Committee, known as the ‘‘Small Company Freedom to Grow Act of 2014’’ would permit this by eliminating most of these limitations. Effec-tively, it would allow any company, which is not a ‘‘shell company’’ (as defined in Rule 405) and that has not been a ‘‘shell company for at least 12 calendar months, to use Form S–3. Under this provision, even microcap companies could thus use shelf registration and offer securities from time to time in any amount, at least if they were reporting com-panies and were current in their 1934 filings (to thereby satisfy General Instruction IA). This would represent a significant change in long-standing SEC policy, and I suggest that Committee consult the SEC to hear its view. Traditionally, shelf registration was limited to seasoned issuers with a sizable market capitalization and an established market following. Under this provision, even companies traded only on the Pink Sheets or the OTC Bulletin Board might use shelf reg-istration and make a sizable offering with no prior notice. As a practical matter, I doubt that the market will accept such offerings or that reputable underwriters will feel com-fortable with them, but the door is at least opened (and in a frothy market, anything can happen and has). 5. Blue Sky Preemption. The above-noted ‘‘Small Company Freedom to Grow Act of 2014’’ would also preempt state ‘‘Blue Sky’’ laws in the case of ‘‘smaller reporting com-panies’’ and ‘‘emerging growth companies.’’ Currently, Section 18 of the Securities Act preempts only ‘‘nationally traded securities’’ that are either (i) listed on certain national securities exchanges (under SEC rules that look to their listing standards), or (ii) are issued in certain exempt transactions involv-ing qualified purchasers. This proposal would extend the scope of Section 18’s preemption of state blue sky law by an order of mag-nitude. Potentially, companies traded on the Pink Sheets (or not even traded at all) would be exempted if the issuer was a reporting company. This makes little sense at a time when the SEC is resource-constrained and cannot Challenge every transaction. The cases most likely to sneak under the SEC’s radar screen are precisely those involving local or re-gional companies that are traded over-the- counter, on the OTC Bulletin Board, or on the Pink Sheets. Unfortunately, these are exactly the low visibility companies that this statute would exempt from the scrutiny of state regulators. Perhaps, the sponsors of this bill see state ‘‘Blue Sky’’ regulators as difficult, overly suspicious, bureaucratic, or prone to delay. I believe such a characterization is unfair. State regulators are hard-working, have more than enough to do, and typically focus their attention on precisely those smaller companies that the SEC is most likely to overlook. Preempting state law simply be-cause an issuer files reports with the SEC places excessive reliance on the SEC and in-vites fraud and misconduct. 6. Form S–1 and Forward Integration. For some time, the SEC’s Government-Business Forum on Small Business Capital Formation has called for changes to permit smaller re-porting companies that have filed a Form S–1 to incorporate by reference documents filed with the SEC. Effectively, this would make the Form S–1 ‘‘evergreen’’ in the sense that it would not become stale. Of the var-ious proposals before this Committee, I be-lieve this one does have real efficiency jus-tifications and could help smaller issuers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5191 September 8, 2016 
Again, I believe the Committee should seek the views of the SEC on this matter, and I do not suggest that Form S–1 should be expanded to become a vehicle for shelf reg-istration (which should instead require that the issuers qualify for the use of Form S–3). But I do see merit in this proposal. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I share Professor Cof-fee’s concerns about this proposal. I also oppose title II of this bill, which would create another exemption for the securities law for certain microcap offerings of less than $500,000. Unfortunately, history has proven that there is a good deal of petty fraud in microcap offerings. So ensuring that there is proper oversight of microcap offerings—ideally, by State securities regulators—is important if your goal is to protect retail investors from fraud. Finally, title III of the bill would strip away even the most modest inves-tor protections that the SEC has pro-posed for unregistered, private securi-ties. It is important to note that we are already seeing a trend toward much greater use of unregistered, private se-curities rather than publicly registered securities. In fact, the private securi-ties market is now larger than the pub-lic securities market. In 2014, compa-nies raised $2.1 trillion through the pri-vate securities market compared to only $1.35 trillion through the public securities market. What this means is that more securi-ties are being sold with fewer investor protections. Title III of this bill would take away yet another investor protec-tion by allowing companies to sell un-registered, private securities without having to file any information with the SEC first. I think this bill goes in the wrong di-rection. We should be talking about strengthening investor protections, not weakening them. I would also like to note that Presi-dent Obama has issued a veto threat on this bill and states that all three titles are dangerous for investors. He states that markets function more efficiently when they are transparent, well regu-lated, and trusted by investors and in-surers alike. These bills would reduce trans-parency, inhibit effective regulatory oversight of our capital markets by the SEC, and would undermine not only the health and integrity of our mar-kets, but the very capital formation process they claim to promote. Mr. Chair, I include in the R
ECORD  this veto. 
STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY  
H.R. 2357—ACCELERATING ACCESS TO CAPITAL  
ACT OF 2016 —REP. WAGNER , R–MO) The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 2357, the Accelerating Access to Capital Act. The Rules Committee Print of H.R. 2357 con-tains the text of H.R. 2357 as reported (Title I), as well as texts of H.R. 4850, the Micro Of-fering Safe Harbor Act, as reported (Title II), and H.R. 4852, the Private Placement Im-provement Act, as reported (Title III). Mar-kets function most efficiently when they are transparent, well-regulated, and trusted by investors and issuers alike. These bills would reduce transparency and inhibit effective regulatory oversight of our capital markets by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These bills would undermine not only the health and integrity of our markets, but the very capital formation process they claim to promote. H.R. 2357 (Title I) would weaken investor protections by reducing the quality or avail-ability of information needed to make in-formed investment decisions. By compelling the SEC to amend Form S–3, the bill would: (1) allow microcap companies traded on an exchange to issue an unlimited number of shares using shelf registration within a 12- month period; and (2) permit unlisted microcap companies, including those listed on the ‘‘pink sheets,’’ with less than $75 mil-lion in common equity to sell up to 1⁄3of the market value of their common equity using shelf registration in a 12-month period. This bill would harm investors by reducing disclo-sure requirements and infringe on the SEC’s ability to appropriately respond to market developments. Such changes would increase the risks posed by accounting fraud, market manipulation, insider trading, and the sale of artificially-inflated stock. H.R. 4850 (Title II) would similarly under-mine investor protections and the integrity of capital formation for small businesses. Specifically, the bill eliminates all existing investor protections for crowdfunding and Regulation A offerings, provided that the se-curities: (1) are sold to purchasers with a substantive pre-existing relationship with individuals affiliated with the company, in-cluding controlling investors; (2) involve 35 or fewer purchasers; (3) do not exceed more than $500,000, annually; and (4) do not involve a person who has violated the securities laws. These criteria do not negate the need for consumer protections embedded in cur-rent regulations. This legislation would create yet another unnecessary and unwarranted exemption from the Securities Act of 1933 to enable the sale of microcap offerings (those involving sales of securities valued at $500,000 or less in a single year) without appropriate regu-latory protections. While the legislation would limit the total number of investors in such offerings, it lacks a requirement that those investors have the financial sophistica-tion to understand potential risks of the of-fering or the financial means to withstand losses. It requires only that they have a ‘‘preexisting relationship’’ with an officer, director, or major shareholder of the issuer, a condition that provides no meaningful pro-tections. Finally, H.R. 4852 (Title III) runs counter to SEC efforts to enhance disclosure require-ments, limiting the SEC’s ability to finalize previously proposed investor protections, and would weaken other key consumer pro-tections and provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protec-tion Act. Additionally, H.R. 4852 bars the SEC from taking appropriate actions to pro-vide needed oversight of the financial mar-kets, encourages widespread non-compliance with existing SEC filing requirements, and undermines the SEC’s informed policy-making. If the President were presented with H.R. 2357, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I would just like to close by reminding our colleagues on both sides of the aisle why these inves-tor protections were put in place. We still have not recovered from the 2008 crisis where literally millions of Amer-icans lost their homes, lost their jobs, and, depending on which economist you listen to, $15 to $18 trillion of wealth in this country lost and down the drain. I just came from a hearing of the Joint Economic Committee where tes-timony included a statement that this was the first financial crisis in the his-tory of our country that could have been prevented by better regulation and oversight of our markets. I do not understand why anyone in this body would want to support rolling back in-vestor protections. This merely keeps in place protections that have worked well for this country and for investors. I urge all of my colleagues to vote against this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chair, I yield 31⁄2minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. W
AGNER ), the author of H.R. 2357, the Accelerating Access to Capital Act. Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman of the Financial Services Committee. I am proud to sponsor the Accel-erating Access to Capital Act, H.R. 2357. I would also like to thank and congratulate my colleagues, Rep-resentative E
MMER and Chairman G AR-
RETT , for their legislation as well. Regulatory burden is one of the rea-sons why we are still in the slowest re-covery of our lifetime since the finan-cial crisis. Small businesses are finding it more and more difficult to find fi-nancing in order to grow and expand their business. Dodd-Frank has made traditional bank lending for small businesses more scarce. Smaller companies that wish to go to the capital markets are finding compliance and regulatory require-ments too extensive and far too costly. This legislation builds upon other ef-forts by this committee to provide sim-plified disclosure and reduce burdens for smaller companies in order to lower the cost of raising capital. Specifically, this would extend to smaller reporting companies the abil-ity to utilize Form S–3, a much more simplified registration for companies that have already met prior reporting requirements with the SEC. Allowing small companies to use this form would provide significant benefits with its shorter length, allowing forward incor-poration by reference and the ability to offer securities off the shelf, which are all things that larger companies are currently able to enjoy. Streamlining disclosure will lower compliance costs associated with filing redundant paperwork, which will in turn allow companies to direct more resources to growing their business. Fuel Performance Solutions, which is a fantastic company based in my home-town of St. Louis, has spent the last 10 years working on exciting fuel prod-ucts that could potentially save Ameri-cans money at the pump and reduce harmful emissions. In order to fund this research in breakthrough technology, Fuel Per-formance Solutions eventually decided

to register with the SEC and go public to raise more capital and expand their business. The company conducted a study, Mr. Chair, and found that, instead of filling out a 100-page registration form which takes about 4 to 6 weeks to complete, this legislation would allow them to fill out a 20-page form which only takes 2 days to complete. As a result, they would have incurred less legal fees, less accounting, and less investment bank-ing fees and saved close to $225,000. Additionally, under this job growth legislation, they could have received SEC approval in days, rather than months, and thereby obtain certainty in regard to funding their business. I am proud that the greater Metro-politan St. Louis region is the fastest growing startup scene in the country. But we must provide opportunities for these businesses and many others to grow and drive and thrive in the mar-ketplace. Extending these cost-saving provi-sions to smaller companies that large companies are currently able to enjoy is absolutely critical and can make the difference in their ability to issue an additional offering, expand their busi-ness, and create more jobs. The Accel-erating Access to Capital Act will do just that. I urge the passage of this legislation. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I yield 3
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. S
ARBANES ). Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I rise in opposition to H.R. 2357, the Accelerating Access to Capital Act. Mr. Chair, 7 weeks ago, the Repub-lican majority recessed the House for the summer district work period—7 weeks. Seven weeks is a long time, time that we in Congress could have spent addressing the many pressing issues that are facing the country right now. The 7 weeks did, however, provide me and my colleagues an opportunity to go back to our districts, meet with our constituents, and learn about what their priorities are, what the priorities are that the American people have for the remainder of the 114th Congress. I, for one, heard from my constitu-ents on a number of things. They are concerned about the arrival of Zika in the United States, and they want a more comprehensive Federal response to that outbreak. b1445 They were shocked by the devasta-tion in Flint, Michigan, and worried about their own water quality. They were bewildered that the gun lobby continues to block sensible gun safety reforms in the face of increas-ingly routine mass shootings and senseless gun violence on our streets. Incredibly now, Mr. Chairman, we have returned; and what are we doing in our first days? What are we doing? What are some of the first things that we are bringing up in spite of what the public has said its priorities are? Yet again, we are voting on a bill that is designed to roll back the impor-tant oversight of our financial markets and to eliminate critical consumer pro-tections that guard against unscrupu-lous securities sales. This bill, H.R. 2357, the Accelerating Access to Capital Act—or, as I call it, the ‘‘Wolf of Wall Street Enhancement Act’’—would jump-start fraud in our capital mar-kets. Each of the bill’s three titles would reduce transparency, weaken consumer disclosure, and fuel fraud in our financial markets. I want to ask my colleagues: Who are the people out there who are asking for these changes in our securities law? Did anyone hear in a town hall that they did? Did anyone hear at those meetings this summer about the need to expand shelf registration for unproven companies? Who back home is clamoring for unregistered, undis-closed security offerings? Who wants to further tie the hands of the SEC’s in adopting even the most modest disclo-sure requirements? Yet again, Congress’ agenda has been warped by the undue influence of nar-row special interests. Yet again, we are ignoring the real priorities of the American people. Mr. Chairman, we have more important business than this. I urge my colleagues to vote against this legislation. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. M
CCARTHY ), the Repub-lican leader and the leader of our Inno-vation Initiative. Mr. M
CCARTHY. I thank the gen-tleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, innovation is the key to America’s future. With it, America can continue to be the economic and cultural leader of the world while pro-viding important and good-paying jobs here at home. With it, our government can spend more time and money in helping Americans who need it and less in supporting a wasteful, ineffective, and outdated bureaucracy. I have seen firsthand the power of innovation in America, and it is not just in Silicon Valley. Centers of innovation are grow-ing across our country and are bringing with them new opportunities and sec-ond chances. I recently visited a company called ZeroFOX in south Baltimore. They pro-vide social media security and they gather intelligence on the threats that are facing employees, businesses, and other organizations online. ZeroFOX is a bright spot in a city, like so many others in America, that was hit hard by a recession but that was struggling long before then. These communities were centers of industry—they manu-factured and thousands were employed. Then some companies closed up shop; manufacturing declined; and people lost their livelihoods. But America is not a story of decline. Even today, you can see communities rising again, not by trying to recreate the past, but by looking to the future. New centers of innovation from south Baltimore to San Antonio and from North Carolina to Louisiana are spreading across America and are bringing with them new economic ac-tivity, new construction, new jobs, and, especially, new hope. That is what our country needs. That is what working people across America need. The package of bills we have before us today is part of the Innovation Ini-tiative—our legislative project to bring innovation into government and to allow innovation to thrive in the pri-vate sector. What this package of bills does is to help innovators gain access to capital. You can ask any business owner or dreamer out there. They know that ideas and work ethic are fundamental but that it takes capital to be able to make those ideas a re-ality—to make even more success sto-ries in communities across our country like in south Baltimore. I thank those Members who worked on these bills: ANNWAGNER , T OM E
MMER , S COTT GARRETT , and, espe-cially, Chairman J
EBHENSARLING . We need more practical solutions like these to create new opportunities for the American people, not in theory, but in their everyday lives. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am really underscoring that my col-leagues should vote against this bill be-cause it rolls back investor protec-tions. Why in the world do we want to roll back investor protections? We have heard some of my Repub-lican colleagues suggest that, because the bill does not alter the securities laws regarding fraud, it has no bearing on fraud and will only help small busi-nesses. This is wrong for a number of reasons. Let me try to explain this with a real life example. Robbie Dale Walker was a former po-lice officer who was living with his mother in Dripping Springs, Texas. Mr. Walker approached his mother’s best friend, Dolores ‘‘Pokey’’ Conn, and of-fered to sell her an investment in an oil and gas drilling program. Mrs. Conn was a 96-year-old widow at the time of the solicitation. After gaining her trust, Mr. Walker sold Mrs. Conn an in-vestment of $100,000 in an oil and gas drilling program. Later, he convinced her to invest another $100,000. Mr. Walker convinced two other individ-uals to invest an additional $55,000. In this case and in similar instances, State securities regulators often get calls asking whether an issuer or a dealer is selling legitimate securities. If the securities are not registered and have not filed a Form D with the SEC, the State securities regulators can warn investors about a potential red flag. In addition, the regulators’ en-forcement divisions can open investiga-tions into the matters. If title II of H.R. 2357 is enacted, the Texas regulator in this case would not

be able to quickly provide a red flag to a concerned investor like Mrs. Conn be-cause Mr. Walker would not have to provide any disclosures to investors or regulators. Although I don’t doubt that the Texas regulator eventually would have caught Mr. Walker, the most likely outcome would have been that he and fraudsters like him would have been able to have run their schemes for sev-eral more years, further defrauding other seniors like Mrs. Conn. Today, Mr. Walker is serving a 25-year prison sentence for this fraud, and Congress should not be making it easier for the next Mr. Walker to defraud another grandmother. Again, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this bill. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds just to say, with regard to the gentlewoman’s anec-dote, if the gentleman engaged in fraud, apparently, he went to prison. Fraud is against the law, and people who perpetrate it should be in prison. Apparently, they are, and nothing in this bill changes that. I was also struck by the previous speaker from the Democratic side who cited all of these constituent priorities and who didn’t once mention the plight of middle-income workers, who are falling behind, whose paychecks are stagnant, and whose savings have been decimated. The National Small Busi-ness Association has found that 20 per-cent of small businesses had to reduce the number of employees as a result of tight credit. That is why we are work-ing to get access to capital for small businesses. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. G
ARRETT ), the chairman of the Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises Subcommittee of the Fi-nancial Services Committee, and who also happens to be the author of H.R. 4852, the Private Placement Improve-ment Act. Mr. GARRETT. I thank the chair-man. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2357, the Accelerating Access to Capital Act of 2015. I also want to thank Mrs. W
AGNER , Mr. E
MMER , and all of my colleagues on the Financial Services Committee who have continued to support legislation that will allow our economy to grow and to expand opportunities for all Americans across this country. Mr. Chairman, as I spend time with my constituents in the Fifth District, the message I hear from them is large-ly the same one I have been hearing for the last 8 years. People are concerned about jobs. They are concerned about their economic security and retire-ments. Perhaps, most importantly, they are concerned about whether their kids—their children—are going to have the same kinds of opportunities that they have enjoyed. You see, there is no more ambiguity remaining about the economic legacy of the Obama administration. Last month’s news that the economy grew at an abysmal 1.1 percent during the second quarter merely confirms what we already knew: we are mired in the weakest economic recovery since World War II. Some economists now think we are heading into another re-cession. It appears that all of the prom-ises that came with the passage of Dodd-Frank, ObamaCare, the $800 bil-lion stimulus package, and the thou-sands of regulations in the last 8 years were just that: promises. Fortunately, for the last 5 years, the Financial Services Committee has been an oasis in a desert of bad ideas. Our committee has been at the forefront of putting forth job-creating, bipartisan legislation—most notably, the JOBS Act of 2012, as well as a number of other important measures that were signed into law in 2015. Here we have H.R. 2357. It is a com-pilation of bills, if you will, that have passed our committee and would help empower entrepreneurs and small busi-nesses, not bureaucrats and Wash-ington insiders. First, we have Mrs. WAGNER ’s bill, which would expand the number of companies that could take advantage of the short form registration. Allow-ing more companies to use the form would significantly reduce paperwork and man-hours. As she has indicated, last year, it would have saved 70,000 man-hours and over $84 million in com-pliance costs. Allowing expanded use has been a frequent recommendation of something called the SEC’s Govern-ment-Businesses Forum on Small Busi-ness Capital Formation; but it is not surprising that the SEC has ignored those ideas year, after year, after year. H.R. 2357 also includes Mr. E
MMER ’s ideas, under the Securities Act of 1933, to allow the so-called micro offerings. What this means in layman’s terms is that a business would be allowed to stand up before a local Chamber of Commerce or Kiwanis Club and solicit an investment without running afoul of all of the securities laws. This really is an innovative idea, and it requires Con-gress to step in and facilitate it. Finally, you have mine. You have the Private Placement Improvement Act, which I authored. This is part of the package, and it would prohibit the SEC from implementing onerous, new regu-lations or requirements on companies that raise capital—how?—through pri-vate channels that they proposed back in 2013. As several experts have testi-fied before our committee, the mere ex-istence of these amendments by the SEC is preventing more job creation. Taken together, finally, Mr. Chair-man, all of these bills continue the good work of the Financial Services Committee, under our chairman, J
EB H
ENSARLING , over the last 5 years, to bring our capital markets into the 21st century and create opportunities for American businesses and their fami-lies. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would like to respond to the chair-man of the Financial Services Com-mittee in that the point of these inves-tor protections is to enable regulators to stop the abusive practices and fraud, as was being perpetrated on the friend of Mr. Walker’s mother. Because they had disclosure requirements and he had not disclosed or filed with the SEC, they knew it was a fraud securities and were able to intercede and stop the fraud and arrest Mr. Walker. I feel that these rollbacks are really very dangerous to investors, and I can-not understand why anyone would want to make it easier for a ‘‘Mr. Walker’’ to defraud grandmothers in this country. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. MAXINE WATERS ), the distinguished ranking member. b1500 Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I certainly appreciate Congresswoman M
ALONEY holding down the fort while I was away today, and I appreciate the work that she has put in this committee on these issues. I am very pleased to be here with her today. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 2357, a toxic package of bills that would outright encourage fraud in our financial markets and put retail investors and small businesses at risk. Instead of addressing a host of critical issues facing the American people, including helping the people of Baton Rouge, for example, where there has been a loss of 160,000 homes, in-stead of helping to come together with this side of the aisle to deal with Zika, instead of helping to deal with the problem we have of water up in Flint, or dealing with the idea that we need to expand Social Security, here we are. Those people in Baton Rouge, who have just suffered all these devastating losses following the historic flooding last month, are looking to us for help and support. Here we are under the leadership of our Republicans prioritizing a bill that would make it easier for companies to scam investors by escaping regulatory scrutiny. In particular, H.R. 2357 would allow small companies that are not listed on a national stock exchange to publicly offer their stock as an accelerated filer, without first alerting the Securi-ties and Exchange Commission or gain-ing its approval. Currently, this accelerated filer sta-tus is reserved for larger companies that meet the standards of and are traded on a national stock exchange. They also are closely followed by ana-lysts, giving investors more insight into their activities. Small companies traded off exchange simply don’t have the same safeguards in place. Providing this type of quick access to our securities markets without suffi-cient oversight and transparency would

lead to accounting fraud, market ma-nipulation, insider trading, and sales of unofficially inflated stock. Anyone who has seen the movie, ‘‘The Wolf of Wall Street,’’ can tell you just how bad this would be for our investors and their savings. Next, the bill would recreate a pri-vate securities offering that would be exempt from Federal and State securi-ties laws. The bill would carve out a scenario where a private company could sell stock to certain investors without providing them or the SEC with any information. This stock could then be distributed to the public at large without restriction and, again, without any information. What is more troubling is that the SEC previously eliminated this exact type of offering exemption after con-cluding that it, in fact, facilitated fraud. Specifically, the exemption had been used frequently in fraudulent pump-and-dump schemes where these early investors aggressively promoted the stock to artificially inflate its price and then dump their shares on unsuspecting investors. The provision also ignores the fact that the JOBS Act created similar, yet responsible, exemptions to facilitate small company offerings under the crowdfunding rules in regulation A. As a result, this bill would simply create a big loophole for companies to secretly conduct public offerings and swindle investors. Lastly, the bill would stop the SEC dead in its tracks in advancing impor-tant investor protections in the tril-lion-dollar private securities market. In particular, it would block the Com-mission from requiring companies to file a short, simple notice of a sale to alert the SEC and State regulators to possible fraud. It also would prevent the SEC from stopping private equity funds and hedge funds from using misleading ad-vertising materials. This would essen-tially allow bad actors to run wild and sell stock to unknowing investors about their true intentions. Mr. Chairman, it is clear that this bill represents reckless shortsighted-ness and woeful disregard for the his-tory of fraud in the securities market by undoing much-needed disclosure re-quirements and investor protections. The administration has threatened to veto this bill saying it would ‘‘under-mine not only the health and integrity of our markets, but the very capital formation process they claim to pro-mote.’’ I therefore strongly urge my col-leagues to join me, investor advocates, and State securities regulators in op-posing H.R. 2357. I close by raising the questions: Why is it, coming back from break, with all of these important issues facing the American public, do we move so quick-ly to protect Wall Street, to protect private equity, to protect hedge funds? Who are we looking out for in the Con-gress of the United States of America? Do we have to go back and remind peo-ple what happened in this country in 2008 when we put so many families and communities at risk because we didn’t have the oversight, we didn’t have the transparency, we didn’t have the watchful eye of the cop on the block really doing the work we needed to pro-tect our investors and our citizens? Why are we doing this? Why are we spending this time? I am hopeful that my colleagues will join me and vote against this bill and send a message to our citizens and our constituencies that we are on the side of Main Street, not Wall Street. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds to answer the ranking member’s question. We are here because we care about the plight of the working poor. We care about the fact that middle-income families are falling behind. The other side of the aisle has had 8 years of their econom-ics, and we don’t have a healthy econ-omy. So we are growing the economy through this bill, and that is why it is so vitally important. I must say, Mr. Chairman, I think it is the first time since coming here as a Member of Congress that I have heard a Hollywood film cited as an authority. If I recall the film, the guy went to jail, as he well should have. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. E
MMER ), the au-thor of H.R. 4850, the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act which would give our very small businesses and startups more flexibility to raise funds and cre-ate jobs for a better economy. Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Chair-man, with real unemployment at al-most 10 percent, labor force participa-tion at an all-time low, and a mere 1 percent economic growth last quarter, it is clear that the American economy is just not working. Contributing to the problems are the regulatory burdens caused by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act, which has reduced the number of credit unions and community banks in my State of Minnesota by nearly 25 per-cent over the past 6 years. Because of this, it is increasingly dif-ficult for entrepreneurs to find the cap-ital they need to start a new business or expand an existing one. In fact, today there are 3 million fewer small business loans made annually than prior to the 2008 crisis. This is particularly alarming because small business creates roughly 70 per-cent of the new jobs. And today’s small businesses, as we all know, are tomor-row’s Fortune 500 companies. Just think of all the great businesses in this country that started with a dream in a garage: Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Dis-ney, Harley Davidson, and Minnesota’s own Medtronic. I fear that with our current lack of access to capital, many of them would not have gotten off the ground today. Who knows what future American suc-cess story we may not be able to wit-ness due to these issues. In fact, ac-cording to the Kauffman Index, a meas-ure that tracks business startups in each State, America has dropped from prerecession highs when it comes to starting new businesses. Our legislation, the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act, which is included in this proposal before us, will fix the ac-cess to capital problem that is limiting sustainable growth in our commu-nities. It will make it easier for entre-preneurs to borrow money from their friends and family. Minnesotans will be able to launch their business ideas and encourage the creation of jobs, wealth, and opportunity for everyone. Specifically, this legislation allows Americans to do a private security of-fering, free from any hoops to jump through by the SEC if they meet these three simple criteria: the investor has a substantive preexisting relationship with the owner; there are fewer than 35 investors; and the aggregate amount from all investors is no more than $500,000. Not only will this help Americans, but the other two bills we are consid-ering today are equally important. The Accelerating Access to Capital Act will make it easier for certain companies to register securities, and the Private Placement Improvement Act will make it less complicated to issue securities under regulation D. Together, these bills will generate economic prosperity, boost wages, and help Americans from all walks of life find good paying and rewarding jobs. I want to thank Congresswoman W
AGNER , Congressman G ARRETT , and Chairman H
ENSARLING for their leader-ship on these issues. I urge all of my colleagues to support these proposals. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Again, I want to underscore that this bill is bad for investors, bad for the fi-nancial industry, and bad for our coun-try. It moves us in the wrong direction. It treats investors terribly. They were treated awfully in the financial crisis where millions lost their jobs, millions lost their homes, and well over $15 tril-lion of private money evaporated from the economy of this great country. Now, investor protections are there to protect investors. I cannot under-stand any valid reason why anyone would want to roll back protections, some of which have been on the books since the Great Depression. Again, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on it. I would like to inform the chairman of the Financial Services Committee that I have no further speakers. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2
1⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. C

2015. I especially want to voice my strong support for the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act, which is now an inte-gral part of this bill and which I was happy to cosponsor when it was first introduced. I want to thank Chairman H
EN-
SARLING and all of the folks on the Fi-nancial Services Committee for work-ing on behalf of small businesses all across the country. I happen to chair the House Small Business Committee, as was mentioned. Small businesses are hurting across America. There is no question about that. Access to capital is a critical issue for America’s 28 million small businesses. At the Small Business Committee, we like to acknowledge that every small business started with an idea. Those ideas can become jobs. In fact, those ideas create about 7 out of every 10 new jobs created in this country every year, but access to capital is the key ingredient. A lot of our existing laws and far too many Federal regulations make access to capital harder for small business. It is harder for them than it is for larger companies, larger corporations, and hedge funds. H.R. 2357 takes an impor-tant step in addressing this problem. By clarifying the law in a way that al-lows small businesses to raise capital through limited, smaller scale, non-public offerings, we are cutting through the red tape that has kept far too many new investors just out of reach from a lot of our small busi-nesses. b1515 This legislation also addresses the unfair share of the Federal regulatory burden that our small businesses carry. At the Committee on Small Business, we hear countless examples of busi-nesses that have to decide between meeting regulatory costs and meeting their payroll, and that affects many, many families, American families all across the country that depend on these small businesses. That is what happens when regu-lators don’t consider the impact of what they are imposing on businesses of every size. A regulation that might be workable for a large company can prove devastating for a small business. The Small Business Regulatory Flexi-bility Improvements Act, which the House passed last year, addresses this problem. Today’s legislation also fully recognizes that the Federal Govern-ment’s regulatory approach cannot be a one-size-fits-all, especially where small businesses are concerned, and that is why I am here to support it. I again want to thank Mr. H
EN-
SARLING and all the folks on the Com-mittee on Financial Services for their hard work in this area. We have to do something about helping small busi-nesses all across the country. The regu-latory burdens that come out of this city, out of Washington, D.C., are kill-ing companies all across America. They are killing jobs. Thank you very much for working hard on this legisla-tion. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I continue to re-serve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to yield 31⁄2minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. H
URT), vice chairman of our Sub-committee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises. Mr. HURT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Accel-erating Access to Capital Act. Like many of us here, when I first ran for Congress, I ran because I believed that Washington had become too far re-moved from the people it is supposed to represent. I was concerned then, as I am today, that Washington’s policies are negatively impacting Fifth District Virginians and the future for our chil-dren and grandchildren. I represent a sweeping district along the Blue Ridge Mountains that spreads from Fauquier County south to the North Carolina border. Within our dis-trict, there are few areas with robust economic activity. In fact, most of our district is comprised of rural country-side and Main Street courthouse towns. Unfortunately, much of our district has suffered devastating unemploy-ment, at times reaching double digits. That is why I am pleased with the work that we have done on the Committee on Financial Services under the leader-ship of Chairman H
ENSARLING , as it has a real impact on the economic growth of our small companies and their ac-cess to our capital markets. Our Na-tion’s small businesses are our most dynamic job creators, and helping them grow and expand ultimately cre-ates jobs. This bill is not about Wall Street. This bill is, indeed, about Main Street. H.R. 2357 is comprised of three titles, the first being authored by Representa-tive W
AGNER . This measure would amend the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Form S–3 registration statement to expand eligibility to small reporting companies. The cost of securities regulation falls heaviest upon smaller companies, and title I eliminates unnecessary costs by ex-panding the use of Form S–3 to smaller reporting companies. This would lower compliance costs and would not elimi-nate the SEC’s ability to bring enforce-ment actions. Every one of the investor protection provisions in Federal securi-ties laws would remain unchanged. Title II of the legislation is Mr. E
MMER ’s Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act. This measure would amend the Se-curities Act of 1933 to provide an ex-emption for small, private offerings of securities known as micro offerings. For this exemption to apply, each in-vestor has to have a preexisting rela-tionship with the owner, there must be 35 or fewer purchasers, and the amount cannot exceed $500,000. Again, the SEC still has the authority to bring enforce-ment actions, and every investor pro-tection provision in the Federal securi-ties laws remains intact. Finally, title III, Mr. GARRETT ’s Pri-vate Placement Improvement Act, would direct the SEC to revise reg D to eliminate the SEC’s harmful proposed rule that is hindering small businesses’ ability to raise cash. As we all recall, the purpose of the bipartisan JOBS Act we passed in 2012 was to make it easier for startups to market their securities; but when the SEC implemented the new law, the SEC proposed a separate rule that would impose new regulatory requirements on small companies seek-ing to use the rule 506 to raise capital. This is not consistent with Congress’ intent, and now companies seeking to raise capital using rule 506 would be re-quired to submit additional form D fil-ings on an ongoing basis. The SEC has not acted on this proposed rule, which is why it is incumbent upon Congress to prevent it from doing so. In closing, the SEC has the responsi-bility to facilitate capital formation while remaining true to its duty to protect investors. The legislative pack-age before this body today is about en-suring that our Nation’s small busi-nesses are in the best position possible to do what they do best: to innovate, grow their businesses, and create jobs. These commonsense proposals will help them do just that. I urge my colleagues to support this good bill, and I thank the chairman for the time. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I include in the R
ECORD a letter from the North American Securities Admin-istrators Association, where they come out strongly against this bill. They say that it shifts ‘‘policies in the wrong di-rection, weakening the oversight of our capital markets and placing retail in-vestors needlessly at risk.’’

ANCY PELOSI , Democratic Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Re H.R. 2357—Accelerating Access to Capital Act of 2016 D
EAR SPEAKER RYAN AND LEADER PELOSI : On behalf of the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA), I write to express strong concern regarding H.R. 2357, the Accelerating Access to Capital Act, which may be considered by the House of Representatives this week. State securi-ties regulators have taken steps to help ex-pand opportunities for small businesses to access investment capital including imple-mentation of intrastate crowdfunding re-gimes and support of the SEC’s recent pro-posal to modernize Rule 147 and increase the offering limits of Rule 504. We are, however, very concerned that the provisions of the H.R. 2357 that are discussed below would shift policies in the wrong direction, weak-ening oversight of our capital markets and placing retail investors needlessly at risk.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH5196 September 8, 2016 
SECTION 2 : (THE MICRO -OFFERING SAFE HARBOR  
ACT OF 2016)  Section 2 of the Accelerating Access to Capital Act would amend Section 4 of the Se-curities Act to create a new transactional exemption from registration for certain se-curities offerings, including offers to retail investors. As presently constituted, the bill would permit the offering of private or un-registered securities to an unlimited number of unaccredited investors that may lack fi-nancial sophistication or wherewithal. For reasons that NASAA has already discussed extensively in comments to the Financial Services Committee regarding this legisla-tion, state securities regulators continue to question the practical necessity of this pro-posed exemption and the nature of the issuers it is intended to serve, We note that there are already several provisions at the state and federal level that small, microcap issuers can rely upon for limited offerings to unaccredited investors, including intrastate crowdfunding and other limited offering ex-emptions. Further, Section 2 would preempt state au-thority to review securities offerings that are by their nature local, state-based offer-ings. Preemption for this type of localized offering is inconsistent with investor protec-tions afforded by state review, and would handcuff the regulators best positioned to regulate the marketplace for these offerings. 
SECTION 3 : (THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT  
IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2016)  Section 3 of H.R. 2357 would prohibit the Securities and Exchange Commission (‘‘SEC’’) from adopting proposed rules to im-plement common-sense reforms for Regula-tion D, Rule 506 offerings. Title II of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (‘‘JOBS’’) Act repealed the long-es-tablished prohibition on general solicitation and advertising of securities under Rule 506. When the SEC adopted rules to implement Title II, on July 10, 2013, it also voted to pro-pose rules that could mitigate the risk to or-dinary investors from 506 offerings, including by requiring a pre-filing of ‘‘Form D’’ when issuers intend to advertise Rule 506 securi-ties to the general public, and by imposing meaningful penalties on issuers who fail to file a Form D. Section 3 of H.R. 2357 would effectively prohibit the SEC from adopting these rules. State securities regulators, pursuant to their antifraud authority, are the primary regulators of offerings under Regulation D, Rule 506, and fraudulent offerings involving Rule 506 offerings are routinely among the most frequent violations reported by state securities regulators. The SEC’s proposal to require the timely filing of Form D and es-tablish consequences for issuers who fail to file a Form D when conducting a Regulation D, Rule 506 offering, is a common-sense step that is long overdue. Form D is a short form that captures basic information about the issuer including the issuer’s business address, officers, directors, business type, and minimal information about the securities being offered. The infor-mation contained in a Form D is crucial to state securities regulators, who regularly en-courage investors to ‘‘investigate before you invest.’’ When investors contact their state regulators, particularly after learning about an offering through an advertisement or so-licitation, Form D is often the only informa-tion available about an issuer when an inves-tor calls. In addition to furnishing informa-tion that may allow regulators to look for ‘‘red flags’’ indicative of a fraudulent offer-ing, Form D provides regulators with the only direct source of information about the ‘‘private placement’’ market generally. The modest burden that Form D may impose on issuers is vastly outweighed by the essential role that it plays in state and federal efforts to understand and police the Rule 506 mar-ketplace. State securities regulators oppose Section 3 of H.R. 2357 or any action by Congress that would further diminish the ability of regu-lators to effectively regulate the private placement marketplace, effectively address investor protection concerns associated with these offerings, or gather important data that provides minimal transparency of this otherwise opaque market. Thank you for your consideration of NASAA’s views. Please do not hesitate to contact me or Michael Canning, NASAA’s Director of Policy, if we may be of any addi-tional assistance. Sincerely, JUDITH M. S HAW, NASAA President and Marine Securities Administrator. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Again, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this. I feel it is a very dangerous bill, but I would also like to point out to my good friends on the other side of the aisle that keep talking about the economy, and I would like to point out that when President Obama took of-fice, this country was shedding 700,000 jobs a month, and because of his lead-ership and Democratic policies, we have climbed out of that deep red val-ley of job loss and we are gaining jobs. Since March of 2010, this country has gained 14.6 million private sector jobs. That is a lot better than losing 700,000 jobs a month. When President Obama walked into office, we were at 10 percent unemploy-ment. We are now at 4.9 percent unem-ployment. I can assure you, no Demo-crat will be satisfied until every Amer-ican who wants a job has a good Amer-ican job, but this is a shift in the right direction of an improved economy. We have had well over 74 months of private sector job growth and, again, we are climbing—we would like to be doing better, but, again, it is a lot better than shedding 700,000 jobs a month. One of the ways that we grow an economy is by having safety and soundness in our financial institutions, trust in our financial institutions, trust that investors will be protected, and that is why I feel so strongly that this bill is going in the wrong direc-tion. We should be protecting inves-tors, not putting them more at risk. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I would like to inquire how much time is remaining on each side, please. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 6
1⁄2minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from New York has 3 minutes remaining. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. S
CHWEIKERT ), a distin-guished member of our Committee on Financial Services. Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Chairman, I was just listening to my friend from New York, and I would like just sort of a little consistency. At one point we talk about job growth and the des-perate need for more job growth, but then how many have come behind the microphones today and talked about a little technical problem we have. We are shedding—closing—more small businesses than we are opening, and this has been going on for years now. So those of us who were involved in the JOBS Act a few years ago—and re-member, it was a bipartisan discussion saying we desperately need to find ways to move capital to the little busi-nesses that are just trying to find some cash, some way to grow, some way to expand. And then you look at a piece of legislation like this, and let’s be bru-tally honest with each other, these are little tiny things that do good, but this isn’t necessarily a revolution of Dodd- Frank. It is not a revolution of the cap-ital markets. These are silly—excuse me, these are simple—simple—logical, obvious steps. Let’s take a look at some of the small offerings. If I am reaching out to people who know me, know my busi-ness, it is limited to, what, 35? That is somehow a risk to the financial sta-bility of the country that I am a small entrepreneur and I may be able to reach out to people who know me and my business and ask them to invest in my capital formation so I can grow and create those jobs and expand the busi-ness as I desperately need? How about cleaning up what we all agreed to, what, 4 or 5 years ago in re-gards to reg D offerings of how it me-chanically was going to work? Remem-ber, we sat there over and over for weeks discussing how reg Ds were going to work, and then the SEC de-cides they are going to change what we all thought the understanding was. How is that a danger to capital mar-kets, fixing where we already thought we were? The CHAIR. The time of the gen-tleman has expired. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. SCHWEIKERT. In some ways it breaks my heart, and I wish we could get over this game we play around here where it is a Republican piece of legis-lation, and a couple of my friends on the left feel obligated to stand up and oppose it, even though you and I know when we had the conversations of building parts of this just 4 years ago, 5 years ago, these were the very things we talked about we were agreeing to. We desperately need economic expan-sion if we are going to keep the social entitlement promises of this society, and to stand in front of even the small attempts to expand the economy—we need to get on the same page here. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume to respond to my good friend on the other side of the aisle. Democrats certainly support expand-ing and growing capital markets and li-quidity in the markets. I was one of the lead sponsors on portions of the

JOBS Act, and I supported the JOBS Act, but I do not support rolling back protections for investors. The protections that are in the law now, that they are attempting to roll back—which they will not be able to because the President has said he will veto it—these protections are not Dodd-Frank. These have nothing to do with Dodd-Frank, although I under-stand there will be a markup totally repealing it next week, so I have been told. But these are protections that have been on the books for decades. Title III, in particular, concerns a $2.1 trillion market. Now, that is not a small deal. $2.1 trillion is a lot of money. We just are recovering from massive rollbacks of regulations which econo-mists say led to the worst economic downturn in the history of this coun-try. Christina Romer testified before this Congress that the economic shocks at the time she was the head of the President’s Council of Economic Advis-ers were three times deeper and strong-er than the Great Depression. So I am mystified why anyone would want to roll back protections for investors that have worked well for people in this country. We have the strongest markets in the world. More people invest here, come here because they trust our markets. Why in the world do we want to under-mine that trust? I would say that the best way to stimulate investment is to treat investors well, and that means strong investor protections. I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. M
AXINE WATERS ), the distin-guished ranking member of the Com-mittee on Financial Services. Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I simply want a little colloquy with the gentlewoman from New York about what she just alluded to. I think she said something about we will be faced with legislation very soon that would roll back all of the work we have done with Dodd-Frank? Did I hear her say something like that? Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. As the ranking member knows, there is a bill before the Committee on Financial Services which would com-pletely roll back Dodd-Frank. I was clarifying that these rollbacks have nothing to do with Dodd-Frank. b1530 These are protections that have been on the books since we recovered from the Great Depression. But, apparently, that is on the agenda, or so I have been told. I am not in charge. The gen-tleman across is the chairman. He knows the schedule, but I have been told that that will be before the com-mittee next week. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Geor-gia (Mr. L
OUDERMILK ). Mr. LOUDERMILK. I thank the gen-tleman from the great State of Texas for yielding. Mr. Chair, we are at a time when the American people are forced to comply with crushing regulations that stifle business growth and strip Americans of their livelihood. At this time, Congress must take steps to reduce the red tape in the private sector. Earlier this year, the American Ac-tion Forum reported that the Dodd- Frank Act is costing Americans and consumers more now than any time since it was enacted. What ObamaCare has done to the cost of health care, Dodd-Frank has done to our financial sector. Since it was enacted, this law has re-sulted in 73 million hours of paperwork and $36 billion of harmful costs riding on the backs of taxpayers. In fact, The Wall Street Journal reports that regu-latory compliance is now the fastest growing job field in the financial serv-ices sector. To put that in perspective, Dodd- Frank takes 37,000 full-time employees just to comply with the law for 1 year. These statistics are evidence of Ronald Reagan’s warning that ‘‘government is not the solution to our problem; gov-ernment is the problem.’’ H.R. 2357, the Accelerating Access to Capital Act, would expand the number of companies that are eligible to use a simplified registration form for public offerings, which will allow companies to obtain SEC approval in a matter of days instead of months. For too long, the SEC has been a bar-rier to investment capital, which is contrary to its mission. This change would allow private companies to focus more on growing their businesses and creating jobs and less on complying with excessive regulations. Mr. Chair, at a time when our Nation is in the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression, we must take bold and decisive steps to reduce the excessive reach of government in our lives and foster a healthy economy. H.R. 2357 achieves these goals, and I en-courage my colleagues to support the legislation. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, the American people continue to suffer in this lackluster economy. I don’t care what happy talk there is from Washington politicians, the American people know the economy is not working for them. They have anx-iety about how they are going to pay their bills. Their paychecks are stag-nant. Their savings have been deci-mated. And they look around, and where is the economic opportunity? Small business has been decimated in America. The job engine of America has been decimated. As one of my constituents from Hen-derson County told me, when regula-tions get out of control, they put many small businesses out of business. And that is what we are seeing today, Mr. Chairman. People aren’t getting ahead. We need to unlock capital for our innovators, for our entrepreneurs, for our small businesses. We have three modest bills today that are doing just that. And yet we are being fought tooth and nail by those who want to grow Washington’s economy and not the Main Street economy; those who believe that Washington bureaucrats always know what is best. This House must enact the Accel-erating Access to Capital Act. You can’t have capitalism without capital. Small businesses can’t get it, innovators can’t get it, entrepreneurs can’t get it. So it is time that we move forward. And there is great news for the minor-ity, who must not realize—I wish they would study and see this—we still have the Securities Act of 1933, the Securi-ties Exchange Act of 1934, Investment Company Act of 1940, and it goes on. You can’t have an effective market without consumer protection. But guess what? We also must have capital formation if we are going to have a healthy economy for working families that are falling behind after 8 years of Obamanomics. We must pass H.R. 2357, the Accelerating Access to Capital Act. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HILL. Mr. Chair, today I rise in support of H.R. 2357, the Accelerating-Access to Cap-ital Act, which continues to build on the suc-cesses of the JOBS Act to stimulate capital formation for small businesses to help grow the economy and create good-paying jobs. Last week, I visited the Venture Center in Little Rock, Arkansas, with my good friend Mrs. WAGNER , the lead sponsor of this bill. The Venture Center has been working with the public financial services IT company, Fi-delity Information Systems (FIS) to launch the VC FinTech Accelerator, a program that will bring innovators and entrepreneurs from across the world to Little Rock. I had the pleasure of attending their Demo Day last month, where FIS and the Governor of Arkansas announced a two-year partnership with the program. This exciting program has only been active for a short time, but has already proven its ability to assist in our efforts to grow new tech-nology jobs across the region. These start-ups, however, often face signifi-cant and costly hurdles to obtain funding in the capital markets that is necessary to con-tinue to grow or go public, as the cost of secu-rities regulation disproportionally falls on small companies. H.R. 2357 helps reduce some of this regu-latory burden by making it easier for small companies to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission and creates a cost-ef-fective way for small companies to raise cap-ital through ‘‘micro-offerings,’’ so long as the sale meets certain criteria. It also prevents the SEC’s costly and com-plex proposed Regulation D rules from taking effect, which are inconsistent with the JOBS Act and Congress’ intent to make it easier for small businesses to raise capital. We need regulation in our capital markets, but we need smart regulation that does not unduly burden startups across the nation, who are at the forefront of innovation and job cre-ation.

AGNER , Mr. E MMER , and Capital Mar-kets Subcommittee Chairman G

exemption under such Rule on an issuer’s disclosure to the Commission of the issuer’s cybersecurity risks. The Commission is au-thorized to tailor such disclosure require-ment based on the size of the issuer making the disclosure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tleman from Washington is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will im-mediately proceed to final passage as amended. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encour-age my colleagues to support the mo-tion to recommit, which is about pro-tecting the personal information of the American people. It would require that those who are soliciting investments directly from individuals to develop a plan to ensure their personal financial data is protected against cyberattacks. Before coming to Congress, I spent a decade working in economic develop-ment professionally, and before that, I was a business consultant advising some of the Nation’s leading tech-nology companies. I actually agree with my Republican colleagues that we need to help small, innovative compa-nies raise additional capital so that they can grow, bring their ideas to market, and create jobs. However, we need to make sure that these new com-panies are taking seriously the risk of cybersecurity to ensure that those who are putting up capital to fund these companies aren’t subject to identity theft or other cybercrimes. Last month, I met with a group of cyber professionals from my State who told me that the threat of cybercrime is growing exponentially. According to these experts, every single business that has access to confidential personal data should have a plan in place to pro-tect that data and to quickly respond in the event of a cyber attack. This isn’t just anecdotal. We can look at the statistics. In 2005, cybercrime cost the average business just $24,000. By 2015, that number had jumped to over $1.5 million for the av-erage American business. We all want small and emerging com-panies to succeed. We also need to be sure that they are prepared to deal with the growing threat of cybercrime so that the personal information of their investors is protected. We also know that the financial serv-ices industry is a particularly ripe tar-get for cybercriminals. The Securities and Exchange Commission is already taking action on a case that resulted in the private records of more than 100,000 individuals being compromised. Com-mission Chair Mary Jo White has called cybersecurity the biggest risk to the financial system. We also know the impacts of cybercrime can be real. For an indi-vidual, a stolen identity can be dev-astating. It can lead to financial losses, lost time at work or with family dedi-cated to the stressful and extensive ef-fort of clearing up financial records. These impacts are even greater when the victim is a senior citizen, who are often targets of cybercrimes. We need action for the future growth of our economy and to give investors confidence that their personal informa-tion will remain secure. The motion to recommit would do that. It would re-quire companies taking advantage of rules that allow them to solicit invest-ments directly from wealthy individ-uals to disclose their cybersecurity risks to the Securities and Exchange Commission. This will provide the SEC with a better approach to helping smaller companies deal with the threat of cybercrime. The MTR is sensitive to the needs of smaller companies by allowing them to develop a plan that can be tailored to the size and risk profile of the com-pany. Mr. Speaker, this is a sensible ap-proach to addressing a real and grow-ing threat. It allows small companies to continue to take advantage of expe-dited procedures while protecting in-vestors from identity theft and other crimes. I encourage my colleagues to adopt the motion to recommit. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-tleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I have some good news for my colleague from Washington. The Financial Serv-ices Committee has already passed a robust cybersecurity bill, and passed it on a strong bipartisan basis: 46–9. We look forward to working with all of our colleagues in the House to forwarding this bill, working with our colleagues on House Energy and Commerce Com-mittee and others. It is a serious topic. But I would also point out, Mr. Speaker, with respect to this extra dis-closure, if cybersecurity is material, it already must be disclosed under cur-rent law. And I would add that, yet again, this is just one more burden, the subject matter of the motion to recom-mit, when we are trying to ease bur-dens on capital formation. I would remind all of my colleagues again that a recent report from the Na-tional Small Business Association re-leased just this week showed that 41 percent of small businesses said that the lack of capital is hindering their ability to grow their business. If they can’t grow their business, they can’t give raises, they can’t expand, they can’t promote. Twenty percent said they had to reduce—actually lay off employees—as a result of tighter cred-it. That is the whole purpose, Mr. Speaker, of why we are passing this bill today. It is to grant greater access to capital. We have heard from so many small businesses and angel investors across the Nation about the need for capital formation for our entrepreneurs, for our small businesses, for our innovators. We have heard from the co-founder and CEO of NextSeed: ‘‘Obtain-ing traditional financing from banks is still a tall order for many small busi-nesses, especially for smaller amounts.’’ Well, we want to respond to that. b1545 We don’t need yet one more hurdle from the motion to recommit to get in the way of small businesses’ end cap-ital. It is also one more out-of-pocket cost. We heard from the senior partner at Centerfield Capital: ‘‘These out-of- pocket costs and time spent by our pro-fessionals on SEC registration and compliance detract from our mission of empowering small businesses to grow.’’ We want to empower small busi-nesses on Main Street to grow, yet the motion to recommit would do just the opposite. Nothing could be more obvious than a quote from the gentleman, the CEO of Wilde & Company: ‘‘When corpora-tions access capital, they hire people.’’ We want people hired. We want peo-ple promoted. We want people on good career tracks. We want middle-income people to rise. We want the working poor to become members of middle-in-come America, and they can’t do that unless we access capital. The choice again is: Are we going to have another top-down, Washington- grown economy, or are we going to build our economy from Main Street up? House Republicans say it is time to build it from Main Street up. So it is time that we reject the motion to re-commit and assure that our small busi-nesses can access capital so that we can grow this economy, grow the fam-ily economy, and have a better Amer-ica. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is or-dered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-ant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on the question of the passage of the bill.

CELEBRATING 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF WAUBONSEE COMMUNITY COLLEGE (Mr. HULTGREN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Waubonsee Community College, which is celebrating 50 years of service to northern Illinois. Founded in August of 1966, it was named after a Native American chief, whose name means ‘‘early dawn,’’ and provides innovative education to its students. Offering career programs, business training, and professional learning, the college has stayed true to its mission of fostering a literate, democratic society through accessible, quality, and innovative institutions. This month, Waubonsee will reopen its Aurora Fox Valley Campus, dedi-cated to health programs. Critical to Waubonsee’s success is President Dr. Christine Sobek. As a member of my Higher Education Advisory Committee, she regularly provides me with advice and wisdom on the needs of community colleges and guidance on improving education pol-icy at the Federal level. I am grateful for her friendship and leadership in of-fering students high-quality education. Congratulations, Waubonsee, on your 50th anniversary. Your hard work helps our community’s students succeed. f 
DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE HACKING (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, 2016 is shaping up to be a banner year for cy-bersecurity, and not in a good way. From attacks on the Ukrainian power grid to attempts to undermine Amer-ican electoral confidence through the dissemination of hacked documents from the Democratic National Com-mittee, cyber tools are fully emerging as instruments of state power. If these incidents seem to be dis-proportionately affecting us and our al-lies, it is because our cybersecurity posture has not yet matched the threat we face. That being said, we recognize, of course, it is easier to attack than to defend. Thankfully, there are steps we can take to protect our networks. We can invest in our cyber defenses, we can clarify cybersecurity roles and respon-sibilities within government, we can build our workforce to take on these new challenges, and we can also build our resilience. The goal of our adversaries is not necessarily just to leak emails, but it is to shake faith in our electoral sys-tem. We cannot allow that to happen.

PENNSYLVANIA WILDS CENTER FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to ad-dress the House for 1 minute and to re-vise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, in August, I was proud to announce a grant of $500,000 from the Appalachian Regional Commission to the Pennsylvania Wilds Center for En-trepreneurship, located in Warren County in Pennsylvania’s Fifth Con-gressional District. The Pennsylvania Wilds region in-cludes 2 million acres of land in the north central and northwestern portion of Pennsylvania and includes 12 coun-ties. Tourism in that area has in-creased dramatically in recent decades, with plenty of opportunities for fish-ing, hunting, kayaking, and canoeing, not to mention plenty of forestland for hiking. This grant will be dedicated to the Center’s Nature Tourism Cluster De-velopment in the Pennsylvania Wilds, which is intended to develop a network of small businesses to support the in-creased need for products and services in the Pennsylvania Wilds region. The Pennsylvania Wilds Center for Entrepreneurship currently offers two business development programs, assist-ing prospective businessowners one on one to connect them with lenders, technical assistance providers, market-ers, public lands managers, and other resources needed to start a business. Mr. Speaker, tourism is one of Penn-sylvania’s largest and most vibrant in-dustries. I look forward to seeing what this initiative can do to help grow the industry in the communities of the Pennsylvania Wilds. f 
GUN VIOLENCE IN NEW YORK CITY (Mr. MEEKS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, Tiarah Poyau was young and full of life, like my daughters. She was the same age as many of the interns in my office. Like them, she had big dreams and she was full of promise. She completed her bachelor of science at St. John’s Uni-versity in my district and was pursuing a master’s degree. She dreamt of being an accountant. At 22, she had the promise of being a successful young woman and an out-standing and upstanding member of so-ciety. But those dreams and that prom-ise, they ended this past weekend. They ended when Tiarah’s life was cut short by a bullet in New York City. That same night, less than a block away from where she was shot, 17-year- old Tyreke Borel was gunned down— less than a block away. Behind every gun death is a person like Tiarah and Tyreke, a person with dreams and with promise. These vic-tims of gun violence and their families and friends have received thoughts and prayers from this Congress, but be-cause of the Republican majority, they haven’t received action. Victims and their loved ones deserve better. They deserve a debate and a vote on commonsense gun reform on the House floor. In this Nation, we encourage our kids to dream big. We tell them that with hard work, they can transform their potential into success. We let them down if we fail to protect them, and so far, that is exactly what we have done.

HONORING HOWARD ‘‘RED’’ M
CCARRICK (Mr. BISHOP of Michigan asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speak-er, I rise today to honor Howard ‘‘Red’’ McCarrick, a World War II veteran from Lake Orion, Michigan. On a whim, Mr. McCarrick signed up for the United States Army Air Corps in 1942. He had to wait until his 18th birthday in 1943 before officially join-ing. Initially, Mr. McCarrick trained to be a pilot, but he changed his focus and volunteered to be a ball turret gunner. After graduating gunner training as a corporal, he flew B–24s on national

security missions until the end of World War II and was honorably dis-charged in 1946. After his time in the Army Air Corps, Mr. McCarrick continued down the path of public service, working for the Rochester Community Schools for 31 years. Mr. McCarrick is an American hero— a patriot, a father, and a proud member of the Lake Orion community. He was recently honored by Chief Jerry Narsh and the Lake Orion Police Department as the 2016 Lake Orion Honored Vet-eran. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to have such an outstanding American hero in my district. Thank you, Mr. McCarrick, for your service to our country and your com-mitment to our community.

RECOGNIZING CLARESSA SHIELDS (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a remarkable young woman from Flint, my hometown. Her name is Claressa Shields. Her accomplishments as an athlete and as an Olympian and continued commitment to our State and to our community really make us proud. Introduced to boxing at a young age, Claressa has built an impressive career that boasts two consecutive gold med-als from the 2012 Olympics in London and the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janei-ro. That feat makes her the first Amer-ican, male or female, to win back-to- back gold medals in boxing. She also made history in 2012 at the Olympics in London when she became the first American woman ever to win gold in boxing. Through her victories, Claressa has inspired the dreams of young people in Michigan and across the country. She is an extraordinary young woman who credits her success to hard work and to her faith. Claressa Shields represents the resil-ience of the American Dream and the strong, proud spirit of our mutual hometown of Flint. I applaud her for her dedication to her sport, and thank her for her dedication to our home-town. The good news is Claressa Shields is just getting started.

RECOGNIZING THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA’S LUNAR AND PLAN-ETARY LAB (Ms. M
CSALLY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Ms. M
CSALLY. Mr. Speaker, it is launch day. I rise today to recognize the dedicated men and women at the University of Arizona’s Lunar and Planetary Lab, who are leading NASA’s historic OSIRIS-REx space mission. Launching from Cape Canaveral, Florida, tonight, the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft will embark on a 7-year journey to the Bennu asteroid, where it will collect samples before returning to Earth. If successful, the mission will mark the first time a spacecraft has gathered samples from a moving aster-oid. The University of Arizona’s leader-ship of the OSIRIS-REx mission adds to its already impressive reputation in planetary sciences. I would like to extend my best wishes to all of the scientists at UA and else-where working on this project for a successful launch and mission. f 
b1630 JEFF AND DERALYN’S 60TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Jeff and Deralyn Davis of Fort Worth, who celebrated 60 years of marriage on August 25 of this year. Jeff met his beloved Deralyn and began a courtship that led them to the sacred union of marriage on August 25, 1956, in Corsicana, Texas. For 55 years of their union, they have been resi-dents of the city of Fort Worth. Throughout the years, Jeff and Deralyn have been very, very active in the community. Jeff is a member of the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity and has served as the assistant superintendent of the Everman Independent School District. Jeff’s influence in education was such that he was commemorated by having a school named after him—the Jeffer-son Davis 9th Grade Center. Deralyn was a graduate of Jackson High School in Corsicana and was a graduate of Huston-Tillotson Univer-sity in Austin. She is also active in AKA, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, In-corporated, the Fort Worth chapter. Deralyn was also very instrumental in the creation of the Texas Coalition of Black Democrats during its heyday. The Davises have two children— daughter Jefflyn Davis and their son, Jock Kevin Davis, who passed away in 2005—and three grandchildren. I congratulate Jeff and Deralyn on 60 years of marriage.

IN MEMORY OF ROBERT KERSTIENS, SR. (Mr. L
AMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. L
AMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate a man who, I think, is bigger than life. He is a longtime resi-dent of Red Bluff, California. He is a cattleman. His name is Robert Kerstiens, Sr. He just passed recently here at the age of 92. Mr. Kerstiens was a World War II vet-eran and was also a ranger with CAL FIRE in California. He was a well-re-spected and revered figure in the com-munity, known for his selfless service, caring personality, and strong leader-ship. Straight out of high school, Bob joined the Army and was immediately sent off to training. When recalling his time in serving the country, we learned he was involved in the Battle of the Bulge and in the Battle of Remagen, which earned him a Bronze Star as well as a Presidential Unit Citation for his group. These are places I have read about in history and that movies have been made about. Bob Kerstiens has lived that, and he was an integral part of helping win those battles—very im-portant ones for us in winning the war in Europe. Following his return from the war, Kerstiens continued his path of service in a new role—as a firefighter foreman for CAL FIRE, where he worked his way up the ranks to the department’s ranger in charge, after which he was appointed to the State Board of For-estry. His service and contributions to our community and State left a lasting impact that shaped many of the poli-cies that keep our forests safe and healthy. In the community, his involvement never went unnoticed. An eight-time board president on the Tehama District Fair Board, a shareholder in the Red Bluff Round-Up Association, and a be-loved judge of the Wild Horse Race Rodeo, his involvement never went un-noticed. He was a true cattleman, a true gentleman, a great man from Tehama County in northern California. He will be missed. f 
PASS THE FAMILIES OF FLINT ACT (Mr. HUFFMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his re-marks.) Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, the on-going crisis in Flint, Michigan, is a clear reminder that this Congress has unfinished work to do. Our constituents will rightly judge our job performance by our work, not by our finger-pointing, not by empty expressions of concern. We need to get to work, and we need to work together to provide clean water for the people of Flint; but we can’t stop there because Flint is not an isolated incident. We have seen dangerous lead levels in schools that are outside of Fresno, California, and that are even in our own Capitol buildings here in Wash-ington, D.C. What has happened in Flint is a symptom of a much greater ill of underinvestment in our Nation’s clean water infrastructure. A generation ago, it was a Republican President and a Californian, Ronald Reagan, who signed significant updates to the Safe Drinking Water Act in 1986. He knew then that clean water infrastructure was not a partisan issue. Thirty years

later, it is our turn. The bipartisan case for investing in clean water infra-structure has never been stronger. Every single American deserves ac-cess to clean and safe drinking water. So let’s get to work. Let’s pass the Families of Flint Act, and let’s work on a national clean water infrastruc-ture plan to prevent another disaster like this from happening in the future. 
f 
THE ZIKA VIRUS AND GUN SAFETY (Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her re-marks.) Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to echo the pleas of the American peo-ple, especially those in my own home district of the United States Virgin Is-lands, in calling for this Congress to pass a Zika funding bill and to pass commonsense gun safety legislation. It has been more than 6 months since the President submitted a plan to this Congress and almost 3 months since House Democrats took to the floor to call for a vote on commonsense gun safety legislation. Instead of passing these bills, Congress has decided to focus its attention on politically charged investigations into investiga-tions. While this Congress was in its longest recess in 60 years, the number of overall confirmed Zika cases and the number of Americans killed and wounded by gun violence continued to grow. There have been 4,500 lives lost to gun violence in the time that we have been out in recess. This number, sadly, includes the lives of almost a dozen young men and women in the Virgin Is-lands, including the lives of two police officers and a firefighter. Additionally, there are now more than 11,000 con-firmed cases of Zika in the United States, 243 of those confirmed cases being in the U.S. Virgin Islands, and 14 of those are pregnant women. The lifetime cost of treating a child with microcephaly is estimated to be more than $10 million for that child—a cost that will only exacerbate the fi-nancial woes of this country’s and the territories’ public health apparatus. The lack of funding for these public health activities will put hundreds of thousands of pregnant women at risk. Mr. Speaker, I call on this Congress to act quickly and fully fund the Presi-dent’s emergency request to fight the Zika virus as well as to pass lifesaving, commonsense gun safety legislation. 
f 
THE ZIKA VIRUS: A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, you have heard the cries of our col-leagues. You have heard the cries of the American people. Redundancy is not a question here. It is telling the truth. In fact, our health professionals have indicated that the Zika virus pre-sents an unprecedented threat to the people of our Nation, especially to pregnant women. We cannot hear this often enough, and although busy with the beginning of the school year and with going back to work, it is impor-tant to warn the American people of this impending and ongoing threat. While we are fiddling and doing things that have no impact on pro-viding a portion of the $1.9 billion that is needed by the American people, we have 1,600 cases of Zika virus in the United States—200 plus women who are pregnant and 35 known transmitted diseases here in the United States of the Zika virus. We also now know, through health professionals, that it is sexually transmitted. We know that the entire United States is vulnerable, but most of the vulnerable States are in the Gulf region. It is time now to address the ques-tion of funding without riders, like pre-venting Planned Parenthood from get-ting funding, and without riders for al-lowing the Confederate flag to be in a veterans’ cemetery. Where is our concern about the American people—for the people in Louisiana with a lot of water? for the people in Texas with a lot of water? in Florida? in Puerto Rico? It is important that this funding comes now to rapidly expand mosquito control programs and to accelerate a vaccine. That is really important—to be able to provide the American people with a vaccine. They are in the midst of the research. They need the funding. The CDC and the NIH have repro-grammed more money than they have to try to help those who are desperate. I make the argument that it is time now for us to do the job. The other body needs to engage in providing a bill, and this body, this House, needs to stop playing those kinds of politics and provide the funding—the funding that does not take from Ebola but the fund-ing that the American people need to be safe. Mr. Speaker, we are currently in a state of a public health crisis as a result of the growing rate of Zika infections across the country. Sadly, we are failing as our nation’s leaders in our ability to respond to this crisis. As days and month go by it is alarming and the level of action and inaction my colleagues are taking to hamper the ability of our federal government to respond to this rapidly growing public threat. In particular, I am concerned that we—as a body of Congress—have not taken the critical steps to move forward and appropriate nec-essary funding that will help screen, treat, vac-cinate and test deadly cases of Zika infec-tions. According to the Coalition for Sensible Safe-guards, Congress should be looking for ways to strengthen our nation’s regulatory system by identifying gaps and instituting new science-based safeguards for the public. I cannot agree more—as we are now in per-ilous times where the Zika virus presents un-precedented threats to the people of our na-tion. As cited by Tom Frieden, Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Anthony Fauci, Director of the National In-stitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health in an op-ed, dated August 21, 2016: There have been more than 16,800 cases of Zika infection reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. and its territories, including more than 2,700 on the mainland. Laboratory tests have confirmed that 1,595 pregnant women have been infected with the virus, and tragically, 17 babies have been born with birth defects related to Zika. As highlighted by Frieden and Fauci—‘‘We have an obligation to meet the Zika threat and protect this country’’—as ‘‘the potential cost of a funding shortfall will be measured in human misery and even death.’’ Now is not the time to pass measures or engage in futile debates that will undermine or slow the ability of our federal and local gov-ernments to address and respond to this growing threat and active cases of Zika infec-tions. Rather, we need to invest in stopping this deadly, but preventable virus, before it is too late. We cannot afford to stand by with our hands tied any longer. Our limited time as the days in September wain down cannot be wasted. We should be focused on the crucial mis-sion of protecting our nation’s people. That is why, in these critical times of need, I am calling upon my colleagues to place the growing epidemic of the Zika virus at the top of our priorities and demand no less than fully financed measures to timely and adequately respond to this devastating and deadly public health emergency.

OWTOFIGHT ZIKA AND CURENATION ’SAIL-
INGPUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM —ENACT A LAW 
TORESPOND QUICKLY TO THREATS  (By Sheila Jackson Lee) There is an excellent model that dem-onstrates how the U.S. should reform the current reactive model of public health emergency management—it is the solution found to address disasters established by the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency As-sistance Act. Under the Stafford Act, en-acted in 1974 and later updated in 1988, au-thorizes the President of the United States, when disaster strikes, to deploy the coordi-nated efforts and resources of the federal government to save lives and property, and restore communities hit hard by a calamity. The federal government provides warnings of hurricanes and floods, and in cases of wildfires dispatches resources to extinguish flames before they threaten people and prop-erty. The knowledge of public health experts, the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-tion, policy makers, health-care profes-sionals and patient advocacy organizations should be brought together with the relevant committees in the House and Senate to de-velop measurable criteria to create baselines for defining, responding and mitigating pub-lic health threats to effectively and imme-diately without the delay engendered by the need for Congress to pass an emergency sup-plemental appropriations. The U.S. must be capable of responding quickly to emerging threats that are identi-fied anywhere in the world. The Ebola and Zika viruses for examples existed in other

nations for many years before they became a clear and present threat to public health in the Western Hemisphere and the U.S. The cost of waiting until a public health threat is present in the U.S. increases the threat to our nation’s public health systems; it re-duces the likelihood of success in winning the battle against a pathogen and it risks a new contagious disease becoming endemic— akin to the common cold. In addition, the cost of putting down a public health threat increases as time passes. There is a long history of threats to public health posed by pathogens. In March 1918, in Kansas, the U.S. had its first case of the Spanish Flu, which is recorded as the first H1N1 flu epidemic. This pandemic killed 50 million persons worldwide it ended abruptly in 1919. The mortality rate of the Spanish Flu was as high as 1 death for every 5 infec-tions and 50% of the deaths, or about 25 mil-lion, occurred in the first 25 weeks of the outbreak. We are now in the 31st week of the Zika Virus global health emergency, which was declared by the World Health Organiza-tion on Feb. 1, 2016. The world is still battling the HIV/AID global pandemic, which became known to public health experts well before the disease made it into the United States. Still, it took President Clinton’s efforts to put the full force of the federal government behind find-ing an effective treatment for HIV that slowed the progression of the disease from becoming full blown AIDs. By 2011, more than 6o million people globally had been in-fected by AIDS and 25 million had died. The legislative process has proven itself not to respond in a timely manner to public health threats. The U.S. to be more robust enough needs to have in place mechanisms designed to respond systemically to federally declared public health emergencies and de-liver assistance to support state and local governments in carrying out their responsi-bility to protect the public health. This is the second time in three years that a global health emergency has been declared that re-quired Congress to act by passing a new law to fund the national response. This is the second time that the legislative process failed to act quickly when the public health threat was known and its consequences were clearly understood by domestic infectious disease experts. On Aug. 24, 2014, the Democratic Republic of the Congo Ministry of Health notified the World Health Organization of an outbreak of Ebola virus. On Oct. 8, 2014, Ebola claimed the life of Thomas Eric Duncan after he pre-sented symptoms at the time of admission to an emergency room. He had recently trav-eled to a country where the disease was ac-tively being transmitted; he had a fever over too degrees accompanied by abdominal pain, dizziness, nausea and headache. Communica-tions had gone to public health officials, hos-pitals, and health-care providers from the Centers for Disease Control stating that all patients should be asked whether they had traveled to West Africa recently; and checked for sytnptoms of Ebola, which in-clude a dangerously high fever, abdominal pain, nausea and headache. Unfortunately, Mr. Duncan having all of the symptoms to be considered a possible Ebola patient was not admitted for observation, tests, and treat-ment, but instead sent home. As of April 13, 2016, globally there were 28,652 suspected Ebola cases; 15,261 labora-tory confirmed Ebola cases and 11,325 deaths from Ebola. Today, the CDC continue to monitor for Ebola disease outbreaks. We can no longer act as if a disease outbreak in a nation on the other side of the world has no relevance or importance to the public health status of communities within the U.S. In fact, we know that this is not the case. H1N1, Ebola, and Zika viruses are hard lessons to the global health community teaching that the world has changed and that it is time the U.S. adjusts by becoming proactive and cease being reactive in preparing for and defending against public health threats and emer-gencies. Establishing a model that is quantitative and based upon measurable changes in public health conditions around the world as well as within the U.S. and having the capacity to react quickly can save lives and assures pub-lic health system stability. Our nation has some local health-care systems that are sec-ond to none, such as the Houston Medical Center, but our national public health sys-tem has glaring weaknesses when handling pathogens that may be as dangerous as Ebola and as contagious as the Spanish Flu. There are only four hospitals in the U.S., and a total of 15–16 beds, for persons infected with a human viral hemorrhagic fever: Emory University Hospital in Atlanta has two Ebola beds, St. Patrick Hospital in Mis-soula, Montana, has one or two; National In-stitutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, has the capacity to treat two patients in its Special Clinical Studies Unit, according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infec-tious Diseases at the NIH; and Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, reportedly has a biocontainment facility with 10 beds total. The public health challenge for our nation is to effectively address the sudden emer-gence of a highly contagious pathogen with a mortality rate of 1 in 5 so that the public health threat may be identified within hours of patient zero, a team of public health ex-perts deployed with the requisite equipment and resources within 24 hours to any point on the globe, establish field labs, hospitals, coordinate with local public health officials, communicate with public health and disease experts globally; type and identify the threat; its method of transmission; and de-termine what is needed to contain the threat; while beginning work on treatments and potential cures. Their work would also be to calculate mortality rates and the point when the disease may become endemic over a 25 week time period to stop its spread, which should include communicating to local, state and tribal public health officials’ the information they will need to prepare to face the threat that may be just a flight away. A Public Health Relief and Emergency As-sistance Law is overdue—I urge the leader-ship of the House and the Senate to work in a bipartisan fashion to put on the desk of the President of the United States a law that will be the cure for the weaknesses in our na-tion’s public health system when it is faced with public health emergencies. 
President Obama is calling on Congress to fight the Zika virus by providing $1.8 billion in emergency funds to: Rapidly expand mosquito control pro-grams. Accelerate vaccine research and diagnostic development Educate health providers, women, and partners about the disease. Improve health services and support for low-income pregnant women. Help Zika-affected countries better control transmission. 
HOW IS ZIKA TRANSMITTED ? Zika is primarily spread to people through the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes. It can also be transmitted from a pregnant mother to her baby during pregnancy, though we do not know how often that transmission oc-curs. There is also evidence that the Zika virus can be sexually transmitted by a man to his partners. At this time, however, there is no evidence that women can transmit the Zika virus to their sex partners. You can learn more about the Zika virus and guidance to avoid sexual transmission. WHERE ARE PEOPLE CONTRACTING ZIKA ? People are contracting Zika in areas where Aedes mosquitoes are present, which include South America, Central America and the Caribbean. As the CDC notes, specific areas where the Zika virus is being transmitted are likely to change over time. 
WHO IS AT RISK OF BEING INFECTED ? Anyone who is living in or traveling to an area where the virus is found is at risk for infection. 
WHY ARE THERE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS  
FOR PREGNANT WOMEN ? There may be a link between a serious birth defect called microcephaly—a condi-tion in which a baby’s head is smaller than expected—and other poor pregnancy out-comes and a Zika infection in a mother dur-ing pregnancy. While the link between Zika and these outcomes is being investigated the CDC recommends that you take special pre-cautions if you fall into one of these groups: If you are pregnant (in any trimester): You should consider postponing travel to any area where the Zika virus is active. f 
SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS FOR FLOODING IN LOUISIANA (Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, yesterday I had the oppor-tunity to come and update the House on the flooding conditions in the State of Louisiana. I talked about how this is, potentially, the fourth most costly flood disaster in U.S. history. Lou-isiana received 31 inches of rain in a 36- hour period, which is what the Amer-ican average rainfall is. It would trans-late to nearly 25 feet of snow if it were a snowstorm. Mr. Speaker, I want to put this in a personal context. Think about a person who owns a $200,000 house. That per-son’s house is now worth $100,000 be-cause it is flooded and gutted. That person is going to have to pay $120,000 to finish his mortgage, which means he is upside down on his mortgage. It is going to cost him $80,000 to rebuild his house, $40,000 to replace his car, $10,000 to replace his wardrobe. Mr. Speaker, the Stafford Act is in-sufficient to address these financial situations that people are facing today. This isn’t one person. This is tens of thousands of homeowners and businessowners across south Louisiana who are facing this impossible finan-cial decision before them in the coming weeks. I urge the White House to imme-diately send a supplemental appropria-tions request to the Congress. Let’s get working on this and resolve this issue. Make this an easy decision for folks back home so we can get back on our feet.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5205 September 8, 2016 
15TH ANNIVERSARY OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-uary 6, 2015, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. F
RELINGHUYSEN ) is recog-nized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, this Sunday, September 11, marks the 15th anniversary of the vicious attacks on America. I very much appreciate the leader-ship’s scheduling a commemoration on the steps of the Capitol tomorrow morning, but more needs to be said as, I fear, time and events have dulled our memories. In addition, our Nation has grown by over 60 million since September 11, 2001—children born after the towers came down, including the 13,000 babies who came into this world on that in-credible day. Unlike the rest of us, they have no direct memories of these horrendous events that changed our Nation forever as hate-filled extremists struck in the streets of Lower Manhat-tan, in the fields of Pennsylvania, and at the Pentagon. Over 700 citizens from my State of New Jersey died on that day. Our mere words cannot possibly cap-ture the sentiments that surround Sep-tember 11. So in lieu of extended, for-mal remarks, I would like to read, as I have in past years, ‘‘The Names,’’ a poem written by the then-poet laureate Billy Collins, which he read before a congressional joint session in New York City just after the attacks which Members of Congress heard firsthand. 
‘‘THENAMES ’’ By Billy Collins Yesterday, I lay awake in the palm of the night. A soft rain stole in, unhelped by any breeze, And when I saw the silver glaze on the win-dows, I started with A, with Ackerman, as it hap-pened, Then Baxter and Calabro, Davis and Eberling, names falling into place As droplets fell through the dark. Names printed on the ceiling of the night. Names slipping around a watery bend. Twenty-six willows on the banks of a stream. In the morning, I walked out barefoot Among thousands of flowers Heavy with dew like the eyes of tears, And each had a name— Fiori inscribed on a yellow petal Then Gonzalez and Han, Ishikawa and Jen-kins. Names written in the air And stitched into the cloth of the day. A name under a photograph taped to a mail-box. Monogram on a torn shirt, I see you spelled out on storefront windows And on the bright, unfurled awnings of this city. I say the syllables as I turn a corner— Kelly and Lee, Medina, Nardella, and O’Connor. When I peer into the woods, I see a thick tangle where letters are hidden As in a puzzle concocted for children. Parker and Quigley in the twigs of an ash, Rizzo, Schubert, Torres, and Upton, Secrets in the boughs of an ancient maple. Names written in the pale sky. Names rising in the updraft amid buildings. Names silent in stone Or cried out behind a door. Names blown over the Earth and out to sea. In the evening—weakening light, the last swallows. A boy on a lake lifts his oars. A woman by a window puts a match to a can-dle, And the names are outlined on the rose clouds— Vanacore and Wallace, (let X stand, if it can, for the ones unfound) Then Young and Ziminsky, the final jolt of Z. Names etched on the head of a pin. One name spanning a bridge, another under-going a tunnel. A blue name needled into the skin. Names of citizens, workers, mothers and fa-thers, The bright-eyed daughter, the quick son. Alphabet of names in a green field. Names in the small tracks of birds. Names lifted from a hat Or balanced on the tip of the tongue. Names wheeled into the dim warehouse of memory. So many names, there is barely room on the walls of the heart. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

b1645 IGNITING AMERICA’S ECONOMY WITH FAIRTAX The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-uary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Geor-gia (Mr. W
OODALL ) is recognized for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I am down here with some of my colleagues to talk about one thing, and one thing only in our time, and that is about ig-niting America’s economy. We can talk all we want to about putting people back to work; but nib-bling around the edges of the American economy isn’t going to solve the prob-lem for the men and women in the Sev-enth District of Georgia, nor the men and women in the great State of Texas, nor the men and women in Alabama, or anywhere across this country. What we need is a competitive advan-tage on the rest of the world. We have the most capable workforce on the planet. We have the hardest working workforce on the planet. We have the best infrastructure on the planet. We have the most freedom on the planet. Why is it, Mr. Speaker, that we then would not have the most robust and growing economy on the planet? I tell you it is for one reason, and one reason only, and that is the burden of the American Tax Code on the American entrepreneur. It is the burden of the American Tax Code on those men and women who want to make America great, who want to put people back to work, but who cannot do it because the Tax Code dis-advantages them relative to the rest of the world. Mr. Speaker, there is an idea in this Chamber—and you know it well—it is called the FairTax, and it is H.R. 25. Anybody in America can look it up. It is at www.congress.gov. In just over 100 pages, H.R. 25 de-scribes how we could rip this United States Tax Code out by the roots and replace it—where we can rip this Code out by the roots and, rather than hav-ing the single worst Tax Code on the planet, have the single best Tax Code on the planet. It describes how we could rip it out by the roots and, rather than punishing people for how produc-tive they are, begin to tax people based on how much they take out of the economy, a consumption tax. That is the way our Framers founded this country, and that is the way we could fund this country again. Mr. Speaker, right now is the time. With the economic challenges, the headwinds blowing against America as they are today, right now is the time. I do not want to compete with the rest of the world based on low wages. I do not want to compete with the rest of the world based on unsafe workplaces. I do not want to compete with the rest of the world based on whose air is dirti-er or whose water is unsafe. I want high wages. I want safe work-places. I want clean water, and I want clean air. But I do want to compete with the rest of the world based on whose Tax Code makes the most sense. Mr. Speaker, I was elected in 2010, just 51⁄2short years ago. One of the Members in that freshman class with me was M
OBROOKS from northern Ala-bama. He’s down here on the floor to-night. When I got ready to introduce the FairTax in that Congress, M
Owas one of the first folks out of the box to say, R
OB, we can make a difference, we can make a difference for the country, and we can make a difference for indi-vidual families; put me down as a spon-sor of the FairTax. I yield to the gentleman from Ala-bama (Mr. B
ROOKS ). Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-er, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for the opportunity to stand with him tonight as we discuss the FairTax. Quite frankly, I wish my eloquence was that of yours. Certainly, my passion is for the FairTax, with all the economic benefits that it would yield to the American people, the job creation it would yield, and the simplification of the headaches that occur every March and April as American people, includ-ing job creators, have to try to figure out how much taxes they have to pay. In that vein, I have some prepared re-marks, but I am available for any col-loquy that you may want to have after-wards. Mr. Speaker, America’s Tax Code is so complex as to border on impossible for any one person to understand. Ac-cording to the National Taxpayers Union, in 2016, American taxpayers suf-fered an economic loss of $234 billion from the 1.9 billion hours of time spent trying to figure out and pay their taxes. Making matters worse, from 1986 when President Reagan signed the Tax

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH5206 September 8, 2016 
Reform Act into law to today, the Tax Code has grown from 30,000 to 70,000 pages, more than doubling in size. Fur-ther, the corporate tax rate has sky-rocketed to 39.1 percent, easily claim-ing the highest rate in the industri-alized world. I cannot emphasize enough the detri-mental impact America’s complicated Tax Code has on our economy and the burden it creates for taxpayers and job creators alike. As such, I strongly support Rep-resentative R
OBWOODALL ’s FairTax Act to abolish the Federal income tax, employment tax, and estate and gift tax, and replace them with a national sales tax and prebate that eliminates the effect of sales taxes on low-income families. Businesses and families know how to best spend their hard-earned money. We need a system that puts power back into the hands of the taxpayer, not government bureaucrats. The FairTax proposal makes this possible. In par-ticular, it eliminates the income tax and stops the Federal Government’s snooping into American citizens’ in-comes, savings, and bank accounts, while still producing the revenue need-ed to fund the Federal Government. The FairTax is simpler, thereby sav-ing taxpayers billions of hours and hundreds of billions of dollars in trying to determine tax liability. In addition, the FairTax dramati-cally stimulates America’s economy by eliminating costly income tax and compliance costs for America’s em-ployers, thus cutting the cost of pro-ducing American goods and services by roughly 15 to 20 percent, a huge com-petitive advantage in an increasingly tough international marketplace. This competitive advantage for American job creators means more jobs and high-er incomes for American workers. Mr. Speaker, I urge you to bring the FairTax legislation to the House floor for a vote to simplify the Tax Code, re-turn American individual freedom, and grow the economy. Similarly, Mr. Speaker, I encourage the Members of the House of Rep-resentatives to support this plain, com-monsense way of collecting taxes, stimulating the economy, and getting the Federal Government more so out of our own personal lives. Mr. Speaker, to the extent Congress-man W
OODALL has more that he wants to discuss, I am available. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman had me at more jobs and higher wages for workers. You had me there. One of the things we don’t ever talk about is the snooping that you de-scribe. Now, ‘‘snooping’’ is a powerful word. As you were talking about that, it dawned on me that the Federal Gov-ernment knows more about my fi-nances than any member of my family. Think about that. The Federal Govern-ment knows more about me and my fi-nances than I am willing to tell any member of my family. When I think about freedom in this country, when I think about what the government needs to do to keep us safe, to keep the economy growing, I don’t think about that degree of invasiveness as being necessary today. I yield to the gentleman from Ala-bama (Mr. BROOKS ). Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-er, it is not just the snooping. It is also the coercion where the Federal Govern-ment uses, Washington uses the Tax Code to compel people to engage in conduct that they otherwise would not engage in, or to not engage in conduct that, under normal circumstances were they free to do so without potential re-taliation by the IRS, they would en-gage in. We have some issues, by way of ex-ample, where the Internal Revenue Service has been used to try to achieve political gains, where the Internal Rev-enue Service has been used to punish people because they have chosen to ex-ercise their freedom of speech rights or their religious rights or because they chose to associate with some people rather than other people, all rights guaranteed in the United States Con-stitution and the Bill of Rights. The power that we have given the Federal Government and the Internal Revenue Service through the Tax Code can all be taken away from the Federal Government by going to the FairTax. The reasons to support the FairTax so far greatly outnumber any potential harms that detractors may describe. Again, I urge the Speaker of the House to allow this legislation to come up for a House floor vote so that we can sup-port it, so that we can pass it through the House of Representatives. Should it fail, the American people will know who was on record in support of liber-ating the American people from the In-ternal Revenue Service and who wants to keep the Internal Revenue Service as our masters with our being in bond-age to their whims. So there are lots of advantages and very few disadvan-tages. Again, I want to thank the gen-tleman from Georgia and the people of the great State of Georgia who have sent him here so that he can advocate on their behalf and advocate for a FairTax that just makes sense. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I have appreciated the gentleman’s friendship and his leadership since he and I ar-rived here together just two terms ago. While the gentleman from Alabama was speaking, I put up a poster that has a postmark that reads April 15. You were talking about what it means to make March and April less intimi-dating, less frightening. He talked about coercion and intimidation. I would wager there is not a single American citizen age 16 or older—any-one who has ever held a job and had a paycheck—that when I put up a post-mark of April 15 they don’t know ex-actly what that means. That means that is the day the tax man is going to come calling. I am going to do the very best I can to get it right. But if I don’t because it is too complex and I just can’t figure it all out, the Federal Government and criminal enforcement are going to come calling. It is a frightening day for folks to do a civic responsibility, and that’s to help keep the government open. If I had to choose a region of the country that led as aggressively as Alabama leads, as Georgia leads, it would have to be the great State of Texas. We are joined tonight by the chairman from the great State of Texas, Mr. C
ONAWAY . I believe, if I went back and counted all the cosponsors of the FairTax, the FairTax is the single most widely co-sponsored tax reform bill in the entire United States House of Representa-tives. I believe we have more cospon-sors from the State of Texas than any other State in the Nation. Of course, Texas has abolished their income tax and is governed by a consumption tax. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I am not sure Texas ever had an income tax, and I am pretty sure we are not ever going to have one. As part of my professional back-ground, I am a CPA and my license is still current. Before I joined Congress, I spent 30-plus years helping clients cope, deal, understand, and pay their taxes. Speaking of the IRS and the intimi-dation factor, as a CPA, if I get a letter from the IRS addressed to me, my heart rate goes up before I open it. Now, it shouldn’t be that way. It shouldn’t have that kind of impact on any of us because I work really hard, as you might expect, to make sure that I get my taxes done. My colleagues have both hit many of the high points on the FairTax. The choices we have out there now: there is the current Code, and there are advo-cates for that; there is a flat tax, and there are advocates for that; then there is a national sales tax, and I have co-sponsored it after six terms and am proud to do that. There are several reasons I have set-tled on the sales tax. One, it eliminates the IRS. Every government needs taxes in order to run. That tax collection scheme should have no other purpose, other than collecting the minimum amount of money needed to fund that government. The current Code from ‘86 forward— and back, actually, to 1916—has been used over and over and over to manipu-late this behavior, to incentivize that, disincentivize this, reward this half, punish, all these kinds of things. b1700 That is manipulative and it is ineffi-cient, and it is just the wrong use of a Tax Code. We shouldn’t be using it that way. So that is why I have settled on a national sales tax. The reason I do that versus a flat tax is because, quite frankly, the flat tax, as most people understand it, leaves in place the IRS,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H5207 September 8, 2016 
leaves in place the opportunity for the mischief that goes on with the current Code. We could go to a flat tax, as we did sort of in 1986. The 1986 act was more in that direction. It reduced rates, flat-tened the rates out, eliminated some, those kinds of things. Thirty years later, we are more complicated today than we were in 1986. The flat tax leaves all of that opportunity for mis-chief in place going forward. So the ink wouldn’t be dry on the flat tax until somebody would say, hey, you know, if you give us a little relief on that flat tax thing for this area, look how it would prosper, grow the econ-omy, create jobs, all those kinds of good things, and every one of those provisions are in there, so the flat tax and the current Code share much of that same risk. Sales tax, on the other hand, is col-lected by the States. You would elimi-nate the IRS, so it is collected at the point of sale. The compliance, the stud-ies show that the compliance with that sales tax would be greater than the current compliance we have with the income tax that we currently have, and so compliance would be better. It would be left up to the States to col-lect it. They would get a little slice for doing that on our behalf. The rest of the money would come into the Fed-eral Government. You would eliminate the entire bu-reaucracy that is the IRS and the good and the bad that they have done in the past, more bad lately than good be-cause of the punishing taxpayers, going after taxpayers because their political beliefs are different from the current boss of the IRS, who is Barack Obama. That goes away, and it is just better. I would caution, though, there are those who would argue, well, let’s just do both. Let’s have a little bitty in-come tax and a little bitty sales tax. Don’t do that. The jurisdictions who have both wind up raising both. Let’s pick one and stick with it, as hard as it might be to transition and all this kind of good stuff. Let’s do that because of the impact it has on the opportunity for manufacturing in the United States to compete, as you just said. In addi-tion to the tax, there is that overregu-lation thing that hurts them as well, but the Tax Code creates a huge com-petitive disadvantage that we can do something about now. Overregulation, you know, that is in the eye of the beholder, but the income tax, the impact the income tax has on the cost of goods sold outside of the country, that is clear, and there is defi-nitely something we could do about that. I appreciate my colleague bringing this up. The one thing that people ask back home who are supportive of the FairTax is: What do we do? How do we get this done? Quite frankly, it is edu-cating taxpayers, because the uninitiated would listen to that 30-sec-ond commercial that says, you know, this politician is in favor of a percent-age increase in taxes. They leave out the little nugget that we would do away with the IRS, do away with in-come tax, estate tax. That kind of gets left out of that 30-second commercial. We have got to have an educated tax-payer base out there that looks at that commercial and says, no, wait a minute, as Paul Harvey said, that is not—there is more to it, there is ‘‘the rest of the story’’ associated with that tax increase that they would like to champion this to go against it—so, educating taxpayers. I ask folks, when I bring this up at a townhall, to look at it themselves. What does it do to your business? What does it do to you personally? How does it impact you? Educate, because there is no interest like self-interest. So look what it does for you, and it is a better way to get at it. It has got all these advantages. All this investment would stay here in the United States. I have cosponsored it for 6 years. One quick anecdote and I will shut up. I have not had a CPA come to me and complain about sponsoring the FairTax, that you are going to put us out of business. I did have the mother of a CPA come to me, and she was a di-minutive little lady who thumped me on the chest really hard and said: Don’t you put my daughter out of business. I said: Ma’am, I have got that. I have got that. Well, it just so happens I am real good friends with the CPA daughter. I ran into her a couple weeks later. She said: Hey, I understand you saw my mom. I said: Yeah, she was worried about me putting you out of business. She said: Don’t worry about my mom. If the Code went away, all that tax compliance work went away, we would find really good stuff that we could do for our clients to promote their busi-ness, help them be more efficient, help them grow and do all those kinds of things that we would really rather do than comply with an ever-changing Tax Code. I appreciate my colleague sponsoring this hour tonight and those who are about to speak and have spoken, be-cause it is important to educate the American taxpayer so that that groundswell of support—you know, the folks who support a national sales tax, the folks who support a flat tax, basi-cally, are telling Congress, we want something other than the current Code. The problem is we have got to have enough oomph, enough political muscle from the electorate—I am not sure how she is going to spell that—to back it so they would represent that two-thirds to overcome a policy that is this invasive, this expansive, and make that happen. So it is about educating taxpayers, getting them on board to create that political will that then gets commu-nicated to the 435 of us who actually have the voting cards that can make it happen. So I appreciate my colleague for sponsoring this tonight and allowing me to prattle on for a whole lot longer than you probably wanted, but thank you for letting me be with you tonight. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Chairman, your leadership has been invaluable on this, not just because of the people you rep-resent, but because of your background as a CPA. The American people know instinctively there is a better way to do it, and to have it from someone who spent a lifetime in that space, we real-ly can move on. I laughed at your story about getting thumped in the chest. We have been joined by J
ODY HICE from the great State of Georgia. In our district, folks thump you in the chest and say, you better put your name on the FairTax. In fact, Congressman H
ICE has constituents out in the hallway right now but cared enough about the FairTax to come down just for a mo-ment. I appreciate him doing that. I am happy to yield to him. Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. It is just a great honor anytime to be able to speak on the FairTax, and I just want to say thank you for your incred-ible leadership in keeping this ball moving forward. But, yes, you are right. In fact, one of the first things I did when I took office here was to co-sponsor the FairTax. If there is any one issue in the 10th District of Georgia that I hear more than anything else, it is support for the FairTax. I think it is because the peo-ple know, really, two key things. Num-ber one, taxes are far too high, exces-sive, and burdensome, and the Tax Code is absolutely too complicated. I hear this over and over and over. Every year it gets more and more com-plicated and bigger and bigger and big-ger. And so, you know, we are at a point that the Tax Code itself literally cries out for reform, and I don’t know of any better way of dealing with this than the FairTax. We talk about having an economic boom, the likes of which we have never seen before. It is all wrapped up in re-forming the Tax Code in a manner that can be done here with the FairTax. And, you know, this is something that absolutely we need to do. It is going to strengthen individual freedom. Just think of this. Individual free-dom is wrapped up in economic free-dom, and the more we confiscate through our current tax system, the less individual freedom we have. It is going to promote jobs, the likes of which we haven’t seen before. It is going to eliminate the IRS. Who among us doesn’t want to see that happen? The IRS, as we watch it these days even targeting individuals, it is just in-sane to think of any government agen-cy targeting citizens of this country, but particularly an agency like the IRS that literally has the power to destroy lives. It is just an incredibly important issue for us to address, and so I am a strong supporter of the FairTax, and thank you for your leadership on this. I think, as we come to the close of this 114th Congress, we need to do all

we can to keep this on the forefront— tax reform and, in particular, the FairTax. We need to move this needle forward. To you and your predecessor, John Linder, you have carried this weight on your shoulders a long time, and I am deeply appreciative of this and for your leadership in this Special Order. Thank you for letting me par-ticipate in it. I am deeply appreciative. Mr. WOODALL. I thank the gen-tleman. He is a new, first-term Member here, and he is already leading on all of these issues, and I am grateful to him for that. He has got his ear to the pulse of what folks want back home, and what folks want is more freedom and more economic opportunity. I am so grateful to him. If I can ask the chairman: Trained as a CPA as you are, what is the benefit of the Tax Code? Everybody in this Cham-ber, from the far left to the far right, every Republican, every Democrat, ev-erybody wants a better job environ-ment. They want growth in the econ-omy. They want the American people to succeed and be prosperous. What is in it for America to keep what we have today? Mr. CONAWAY. Well, a couple things. Obviously, there is an industry created to help comply with a really complex Code. There is a smaller but, nevertheless, powerful industry that is in place to promote new changes and additional issues to add to the Code to make it more complicated. Every one of those special programs in the Code— deductions or credits—has an advocacy group. Somebody somewhere is using that piece in their tax return. Here is an example. I was talking back home about the advantages of eliminating—A Better Way has got an-other tax program. But I said, making a comment, we are going to eliminate all those deductions and credits for in-dividuals. I said, now, that is going to take political will because every one of them has an advocate, a taxpayer, not a lobbyist or all those kinds of bad words, but a taxpayer; and in order to overcome it, we are all going to have to give up our little special niches to make that happen. No sooner was that out of my mouth and I finished it than a guy came up to me and said, hey, I agree with doing away with all those tax credits and all those deductions, but leave in place section 1031. Well, 1031 is that like-kind exchange section where I can take in-come-producing property, sell it, defer the gain, invest it in another income- producing property, and just kind of daisy-chain that down the road. Well, he is a broker. He sells ranches and farms, so it was in his best interest personally to make that happen. It is hard to make broad statements that it does good stuff, but every one of those provisions has somebody some-where in America who is taking advan-tage of it. Here is another thing that just hap-pened, and this has really nothing much to do with this. I got two calls today, one while I was sitting here waiting for this to start from a voice that said, ‘‘Hello,’’ very stern, this is so-and-so from the IRS, Internal Rev-enue Service, and you have an audit problem that you have not addressed. There is a big deal going on, and if you don’t call this number back right away, we will interpret that as you try-ing to run from us, and it will enhance the charges against you. A clear scam because the IRS doesn’t call you. But nevertheless, there is a scheme out there available that someone could use as a scam artist to frighten taxpayers because, to an uninitiated person, they would call that number back. I have no idea what it would do to your phone if you called it back. There is something going on there that hasn’t happened, but here is what would never happen. You will never get a call that says you have not paid your sales taxes, and because you have not paid your sales taxes, we are coming to get you. No, sales taxes are collected at the point of sale, and there will be no collection agency. There will be no op-portunity for a scam in that regard. But back on who benefits. Obviously, there are a group of folks who do tax compliance, and much of that is offshored, quite frankly, and then the people who use those individual pieces. So part of this is to overcome that in-ertia to change. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Chairman, I am glad you mentioned that scam. I am going to find the camera that is fo-cused down here and tell folks, if you get a call from the IRS, it is not legiti-mate. Do not deal with somebody at the end of a 1–800 number who says there is an arrest warrant out for you. If you don’t have any other option, call your Congressman, and we will inter-vene for you in that space. It is hun-dreds of millions of dollars that have been scammed from American citizens, Mr. Chairman, through this scheme. The scheme works for one reason and one reason only, and that is that the IRS really is that scary to the average American citizen, and we created it. It is our creation, and we are complicit in this scam. Please, it is happening to your parents, your grandparents. I get those calls, too. I am in constituents’ homes. The calls are coming in then, and not everyone knows it is a scam. Folks are so frightened by the IRS, they are paying these folks hundreds of millions of dollars today. I appreciate you mentioning that. Mr. CONAWAY. I thank the gen-tleman. Again, I appreciate him spon-soring this hour. I know you have a couple other Members who want to speak. Thank you for your generosity tonight. Mr. WOODALL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We have got down here with us what I would say is a gentleman who is sec-ond to none in terms of FairTax sup-port. He is S
TEVE KING, from the great State of Iowa. Even before I was elect-ed to Congress, I could turn on C– SPAN, and when folks wanted to talk about tax reform, I would see STEVE  K
INGdown here talking about a better way to do a Tax Code. I would hear him talking about, from his own personal experience, what it was like to be tar-geted by an agency like this and what it would mean, as a small-business owner himself, to be free of that burden and be able to go out and hire. I have always been grateful for his friendship since he has arrived, and I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from Iowa tonight. Mr. KING of Iowa. I thank the gen-tleman from Georgia for yielding, but especially for his leadership here in the United States Congress, and especially on the FairTax. And that introduction, Mr. Speaker, it flashes back to me some of the things that I haven’t really spoken to recently and how far we haven’t come over the years that this became, obviously, the best thing that we could possibly do from a tax per-spective in America—or anywhere in the world, for that matter. I have often told the story, but I should say I used to tell this story often, and that is that I am running my little construction business that I started up in 1975, and we have com-pleted 41 years in business. I was au-dited one too many years in a row by the IRS, and I had learned that—we didn’t have copy machines in those days, so if they could ask for data, I would have just said: Here, I will run all these copies. You can analyze them. I will go out and start a machine up and go to work, make a little money so I can pay my taxes. What it really did was it shut me down. It shut me down because I had to sit there in my office and serve papers out to the auditor because I was the one who knew where the papers were, and they were in my filing cabinet. And I had learned in previous audits that I didn’t want to just say: Here is the filing cabinet. I am going to work. Let me know what the bill is when you are done. It didn’t work out too well for me. b1715 So, I sat there for 4 days, and I served papers to the IRS. I would say: I will give you a paper. You can look at it. You can take your notes. Do what you will. When you are done with that paper, hand it back to me and I will put it in the file, and then you ask for another record and I will give it to you. We did that for 4 days. At the end of that period of time, we had an intense negotiation. It came down to a number. I remember it clearly. It doesn’t seem so big today as it did then, but it was big then, and it was wrong. I paid the taxes that I owed and had done that with good intent as well. I complied with the law, and I had intent to comply with the law. But they seemed to have intent that they were going to justify the 4 days of being drug through—I thought I was drug through that, not them—but when it

was all done, I had to go to the bank to borrow the money to pay the IRS that I believe to this day I did not owe. If I had otherwise borrowed the money to hire a lawyer to defend myself against the IRS and the Federal Government, the odds of success were so infinitesi-mally small that I had to decide do I want to stand on principle or—if I stand on principle, I can sacrifice my company—or do I want to borrow the money and pay bondage to what was an unjust principle and try to keep my business alive? That is what I decided to do. Those who know me for the time I have been here know how hard that is— for me, especially. I had to swallow as hard as I have ever had to swallow. But I went back out to work, and I fired up that old bulldozer and I climbed in the seat and the smoke went out the ex-haust stack and out of my ears. This is the way that a person has to do busi-ness in this country. My oldest son owns that business today. He told me a narrative—not telling me the message I would get out of it—that he was joining up with an engineering firm to start a new busi-ness venture in addition to our con-struction work. They had a 90-minute meeting. At the end of that meeting, David King said to the engineer: Mike, did you realize that we have just talked business for 90 minutes? Yes, I surely do. Do you know what our topic was for 90 minutes on this business venture? Taxes. Ninety minutes of human resources were burned up on how to set up a tax structure to start a new business rath-er than figuring how to produce a good or a service that has a marketable value here or abroad. That is what is wrong. It is the waste of human re-sources that are consumed in compli-ance with the IRS, and it is the waste of human resources that could be far better used in producing that good or service that has a marketable value here or abroad. I have come not full circle on the issue. I stand exactly where I did in that time back in 1980 when I was au-dited one too many years in a row. But we are in the second generation of King Construction today, and I have to go back and look. Just yesterday, I had a 1-hour meet-ing with a Commissioner of the IRS, Commissioner Koskinen, who is facing a privileged motion as well as a filed motion to face impeachment for mal-feasance within the IRS; and the viola-tions, I believe, happened directly under the watch of Lois Lerner. So, I never imagined, Mr. Speaker, that day that I climbed in the seat of that old bulldozer and the smoke came out of the exhaust stack and my ears, and I began to think, I want to be rid of the IRS. I went through the process of, if you abolish the IRS, then what to do you do to replace the revenue? I spent weeks thinking that through. There was nobody to talk to in those days. I would go to, I called it my OshKosh B’Gosh caucus, the guys in the overalls at 6 a.m. in the morning, and I would sit down and I would tell them we need to have a national sales tax; we need to replace the IRS; we need to abolish the IRS. Give people their freedom. Let them make their choices on their taxes when they purchase, not have some-body looking over your shoulder sec-ond-guessing all the decisions you have to make while you are in business. For weeks, we went through that, and they got a little tired of hearing me talk about going to—I didn’t call it a FairTax; I didn’t have a name for it except national sales tax. Finally, they said, well, if that were such a good idea, we would already have done it by now. Anybody that served much time in Congress knows that is a laugher. We have lots of good ideas that we don’t do by now because there are com-peting interests here. I have taken this policy to Alan Greenspan, the former chairman, shortly after he retired. I went to his Spartan office in downtown D.C., and I asked him if he would be the national spokesman for the FairTax. It was my mission to be a good salesman—and I am a good salesman; I have a good- looking wife, and that is proof posi-tive—for the FairTax. We went through the FairTax, and he said: Congressman, this is not an eco-nomic question. You are asking me, as an economist, to be your spokesman. It is not an economic question. You will not find serious economists that dis-agree the FairTax does these things that you say. He said: It’s a political question. So economists should not be selling a po-litical question. Politicians should sell a political question. That is you. You go sell it. I said: Well, let me try this on you. I want to go through this list of things that I say the FairTax does that is good, and I want you to interrupt me and challenge me at any point along the way of any component that I have said that can’t be sustained in an eco-nomic argument, an economic forum. So, I went through the list. I will just hit some of them, not all of them. The FairTax abolishes the tax on produc-tivity. We are punishing productivity in America. People on that side of the aisle believe that consumption drives the economy. Well, if you don’t produce, it doesn’t. It is the production that drives the economy, especially when you are importing or exporting it, and we need to get that back. It eliminates the tax on production. It eliminates corporate income tax, personal income tax, estate tax, capital gains tax. It allows for the repatriation of the U.S. capital that is stranded overseas by the trillions of dollars that would be reinvested in the U.S. I went through this vast list of things the FairTax does that are good, and I stopped and I said: You are not inter-rupting me, Mr. Chairman. He said: I don’t need to do that, but you left something out. You didn’t mention that the FairTax provides an incentive for savings and investment, and this economy desperately needs an incen-tive for savings and investment. It wasn’t that I left it out on purpose. I just forgot to say it. So he said: Add that to what you are saying, and keep saying everything else. And so I turned it into this. Now I just tell people the FairTax does every-thing good that anybody’s tax policy does that is good. It does them all, and it does them all better. And that is pretty close to the final word on the topic. Now, America needs to come to her senses, and if we want to have a stimu-lated economy, if we want to reverse this imbalance we have in trade and bring it back to where we have an ex-port surplus instead of an import sur-plus, if we want to stabilize our cur-rency, if we want to stimulate manu-facturing and production in America, if you want to have a stable currency, a stable economy, an America that is a robust economy in the world again, we go to the FairTax. That little island of Ireland that has attracted over 700 former U.S. compa-nies that were domiciled in the U.S., now domiciled in Ireland with their lit-tle flat tax over there—it was zero for 10 years, became 10, then 13 percent or so. The dynamics that they have seen on that little island of Ireland, with the FairTax in America, would be mul-tiplied by a factor that I hesitate to guess at here on the floor of the United States Congress. But it would be an awesome, dynamic change to our econ-omy, and we wouldn’t need to be im-porting millions of people from foreign countries to do these jobs Americans would do, because the wages would go up, the benefits would go up, our com-petitiveness would go up, and America would be back in the preeminent place in the world again. That is how good this FairTax is. That is why I am here on the floor to support Mr. W
OODALL , and I thank the gentleman for his leadership on this issue and the opportunity to say a few words. Mr. WOODALL. For folks who aren’t following those numbers as closely as you are, yes, when this Tax Code was written in 1986, the average corporate income tax rate around the globe was almost 50 percent. Today, it is less than 25 percent. The rest of the world has been moving towards that tax com-petitiveness, while America has been standing still. You asked about the good things that happen around here. Generally, the good things that happen are because folks come with individual experience, as you have come with; they come with passion, as you have come with. What folks may not realize is here you are. The family runs King Con-struction, and you are not asking for a

tax cut. You are not asking for a tax carveout. You are not asking for a spe-cial favor or an exemption or a deduc-tion. You are saying do away with all the special interests in the Tax Code, and let’s just give everybody a fair shot at a flat and level code. It is that kind of selflessness that is going to drive the changes that have to happen here. Yes, there are special interests that are committed to selfish preservation of provisions in the Tax Code. I think selflessness is going to win out in that debate. We are joined on the floor by a new Member from the great State of Geor-gia. His name is B
UDDY CARTER . He rep-resents the single fastest growing con-tainer port on the entire planet. What I am saying to you is, when it comes to creating jobs in America, we have got to export to a billion new con-sumers in India and a billion new con-sumers in China, and we are not com-petitive with our Tax Code today. The gentleman from Georgia sees this day in and day out, going out of the great Port of Savannah. In fact, I am told—the gentleman can correct me if I am wrong—out of your automobile exporting plant, we now export more Mercedes to the rest of the globe than any other vehicle out of that American port, because we are building Mer-cedes-Benz better and cheaper than the rest of the globe, and the rest of the world wants to buy them. I yield to the gentleman from Geor-gia (Mr. C
ARTER ). Mr. CARTER of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for holding this important debate on tax reform and the FairTax Act. Tax reform is one of the most press-ing issues facing our Nation today. In fact, it is so important that my very first act in Congress was to cosponsor this bill. I had promised that to my constituents. When I got here, that is exactly what I did. Without question, one of the most pressing issues that our citizenry has right now is tax re-form. That is at the top of the list. So I am very proud to be able to partici-pate in this. You mentioned the ports. I am very blessed and very humble to be able to represent the First Congressional Dis-trict in Georgia, which includes two major seaports: the Port of Savannah, which is the number two container port on the Eastern seaboard and num-ber four in the Nation; and the Port of Brunswick, which is the number three roll-on, roll-off port in the country, meaning that we have cars down there that are leaving that port every day and going to all corners of the world. It is something that we are very, very proud of, and something that adds to our economy. And it is not just the economy of the First Congressional District, but of the entire Southeast United States. That is how important it is. Again, that is why the FairTax is so very important to our country and why I support it so much. We need a tax system that treats ev-eryone equally, that encourages Amer-ican businesses and the economy to grow and prosper. First of all, people don’t like paying taxes. We understand that. We all understand the need to pay taxes. But if they are going to pay a tax, they want to pay a consumption tax. They don’t want to pay a property tax. They would rather pay a consump-tion tax. I have learned that after years of being a mayor and after years serving in the State legislature, that has been something that has been just very clear to me. And people want a tax sys-tem that is easy to understand. They don’t like our current tax system that is so complex. When you look at the IRS manual and you see how thick it is, it just bog-gles the mind to think that we can’t come up with something much easier than that. That is why I compliment you on the FairTax, because it is sim-ple and it is straightforward and it is fair, and that is what people want. But even worse, we have got an out- of-control bureaucracy at the IRS that has completely lost the trust of the American people. When I go home, when I meet with my constituents time and time again, that is what they tell me, that they don’t trust the IRS, that it is too complex. They want it to where they can file their taxes on a postcard. And there is no reason why we shouldn’t have that and no reason why we shouldn’t continue to work to-ward that common goal. The FairTax Act would fully repeal our current tax system and replace it with a national sales tax on the use and our consumption of property or services in the U.S. By eliminating the Federal income tax, everyone can keep their entire paycheck and pay taxes only on what they consume. Again, a consumption tax. No more struggling to understand the volumes and volumes of tax codes an exemptions. It would do away with all that. Simplify, simplify, simplify. Everyone would contribute their fair share based on what they purchase. We all have to purchase. That is what makes our economy run, and that is why this is such an ideal tax and such an ideal system for me and for us as Americans. You know, as a former small-business owner, I am fully aware of how difficult it is to be successful and grow when the tax system is so complicated and bur-densome. I fought those battles. The uncertainty alone makes it very hard to take on the challenges and risk of building capital and hiring employees. The economy cannot grow if businessowners are held back from making the changes and additions that they need to expand. We have to have that. I believe that a simple and straight-forward system like the FairTax will provide the certainty that businesses need to grow with confidence. Our Na-tion is still in an economic recovery mode, and businessowners and families need all the confidence that they can get. Again, I want to thank my colleague from Georgia for introducing this legis-lation and compliment him on the ex-cellent job that he is doing. I encour-age all my colleagues to support the FairTax so that we can finally have the fair and simple tax system that Ameri-cans deserve. Mr. WOODALL. I thank the gen-tleman for making the FairTax number one out of the gate. I know he leads a passionate constituency. I listened to you talk about what the FairTax would do, and I am thinking that is almost unbelievable that there is that much out there on the table we could seize for the American economy and American families that we haven’t done. b1730 I am reminded that America is the only country in the OECD, the only economically developed First World country that does not have a consump-tion tax today. Folks around America are accustomed to all of the downsides of our current system that you went through. There is a better way and the rest of the world has found it and we are lagging behind. I appreciate the gentleman’s leader-ship to help get us there. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for his efforts. Mr. WOODALL. We also have on the floor the chairman of the House Budget Committee. Now, I will tell you that if there is someone who is working hard-er for the American economy than Dr. T
OMPRICE, chairman of the Budget Committee, I don’t know who it is. And he is absolutely trying to cut every penny of waste, fraud, and abuse there is in the budget, but I don’t know that we can cut our way into prosperity. I think we are going to have to grow our way into prosperity, and this burden-some Tax Code seems to be standing between us and that kind of success. I yield to the gentleman from Geor-gia. Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. I thank the gentleman, and let me add my voice to the echo and chorus of those who are commending him for his work on the FairTax. This is incredibly im-portant. And the gentleman is right. I have the privilege of chairing the Budget Committee, which is sometimes a blessing, sometimes a curse. But you put your finger on the thing that I want to talk about today because the FairTax, as you well know, our current tax system is punishing all the things that we say that we want. So we want hard work, we want suc-cess, we want entrepreneurship, we want savings, we want investment, we want all those things that people talk about that. They say: Why are we not getting those things that allow for that growth that has to happen? And one of the reasons, I believe— and I know you do, too—is because our current tax system punishes each and

every one them. Every one of those things that we say we want, our tax system punishes. So people make their equation and they say: Well, should I do this? Well, no. I am taxed more if I do that. I am taxed more if I work hard. I am taxed more if I succeed. I am taxed more if I hire more people, on and on and on. So when you look at where we are, from a growth standpoint, which is in-credibly important because we can’t tax our way out of the challenge that we have got. We can’t even cut spend-ing to the degree that we need to to get out of the challenge that we have from a fiscal standpoint. We need to grow the economy. And the growth rate that we have had over the last 40 to 50 years in this Nation, average growth rate has been about 3.2 percent. Your constituents and my constituents and people all across this great country know that over the past 6 months we have seen a growth rate of 1 percent, and over the past 8 years we have seen a growth rate in the neigh-borhood of 2 percent. So we have had a 33 to 65 percent reduction in the level of growth in this country. What does that mean to folks back home? It means the jobs aren’t being cre-ated. It means that there is part-time work instead of full-time work. It means that you have a son or a daugh-ter that graduates from college and they can’t find a job in the endeavor that they have chosen. All these things that make it so that the economy is tamped down, harmed by our current system. So the FairTax does all sorts of won-derful things, but one of the things that it does that would just reinvigo-rate and enlighten this economy is to incentivize the things that we say that we want: incentivizing savings, incentivize investment, incentivize hard work, incentivize entrepreneur-ship, incentivize risk-taking. Incentivize individuals who are out there trying to build a better mouse trap and we are going to reward them for trying to build that better mouse trap. So I am enthusiastic about H.R. 25, enthusiastic about the support that you have continued to generate for this. I want to commend John Linder, who is a dear friend of yours and mine, and the work that he did to begin this project. I know that we will ultimately get to this point of a FairTax, of a con-sumption tax, because it is the right thing to do and it is the only thing that we can do that actually solves many of the challenges that we have got. So let me commend you for what you are doing. God bless you. It is a wonderful, wonderful work. And if you keep at it and we keep at it, I know that the American people will ensure that they invigorate men and women in this Chamber so that they support this commonsense, logical, exciting so-lution to the challenges that we face from a fiscal standpoint. Mr. WOODALL. If I could say to my friend, a lot of folks believe that this town is just about talk, talk, talk, talk, talk. Yet you, in your budget that you have prepared, moved out of the Budget Committee, put down in writ-ing, black and white, put your name behind it for all the world to see, every cycle, that there is a better way and we can do better. Folks are afraid to take a stand on issues. You have been unafraid to take a stand. We cannot get from here to there without that kind of leadership, and I am grateful to you for that. Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Well, thank you, because this only happens when people get out there and say this is the solution. These are the kind of positive solutions that we can put for-ward, and if we were to adopt them, then it’s ‘‘Katy, bar the door.’’ Thanks so much for your great work. Mr. WOODALL. I thank my friend. And I would encourage folks, if you have any—if you want the black and white on this issue, go back to the Joint Tax Committee Tax Symposium. The Joint Tax Committee invited in everyone from the far-right economists to the far-left economists and said, Take a look at America’s Tax Code and take a look at a consumption tax like the FairTax and tell me what it would do for the American economy, for fami-lies, for jobs. Every single economist—not some, not most, every single economist—said a consumption tax, a move away from our current tax system will grow the American economy. Some said a little, some said a lot. But we can do better. There is not a single Member of this Chamber who de-fends the current Tax Code as being the best we can do. It is not. The FairTax just may be the best we can do. If you are not quite ready for the FairTax—and I hope you are; it is H.R. 25—let me refer to the Better Way agenda. The chairman mentioned it earlier. It is on the Speaker’s Web site, betterway.speaker.gov. It is on bet-ter.gop as well. The chairman of the Ways and Means Committee laid out a fundamental change in the way we do taxes. It is the most consumption tax-based plan a Ways and Means chairman has ever produced for this institution. It is not the FairTax, but dadgummit, it is mov-ing us in the right direction. If you want some encouragement about what is doable, about what we are able to bring ourselves together around, about what can really, Mr. Speaker, make a difference for jobs and the economy, look at what Chairman K
EVIN BRADY from Texas has done. Again, it is a part of the House’s Better Way agenda, but it is laid out there in black and white. What my challenge is, not just for Members of this Chamber, Mr. Speaker, but for all voters across the country is the chairman has laid out a plan that gets rid of the exemptions, the deduc-tions, the carve-outs, all of the lob-byist special favors. All of that is gone, but it is up to us to keep it gone. Take a look at it, believe in it, and then let’s work together to make it a reality. The only people who are disadvan-taged by a change to a competitive Tax Code are our foreign competitors over-seas. This isn’t about Republicans. This isn’t about Democrats. This is about America. This is about growth, and there absolutely is a better way. Mr. Speaker, I thank all of my col-leagues for their leadership and for joining me here. I yield back the balance of my time. f 
PORK SHIPS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-uary 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. S
PEIER ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, tonight we are going to talk about pork ships. Now, you may be scratching your head. What is a pork ship? Well, a pork ship was a name coined by POLITICO. Some may think, well, maybe that is a creative barbecue dish. Or military historians might say: Well, maybe it has something to do with the Bay of Pigs. Others might think it is an Oscar Mayer-sponsored cruise liner. But all those guesses would be wrong. The term actually applies to a chron-ically unreliable ship, the littoral com-bat ship. Well, how unreliable is this ship? In just the last 9 months, four of the six ships that we have built as Littoral combat ships have been in trouble. They have broken down. As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I have been working to rein in this program for years. Unfortu-nately, the ship’s manufacturers and some Members of Congress seem intent on throwing good money after bad. The LCS has cost us almost $20 bil-lion so far; $20 billion for six ships. But we have many more that we are going to build that are going to be flawed and that will break down. So the total cost of the ships over the course of the pro-gram is a mind-blowing $120 billion. That is right, $120 billion. Now, we are scraping right now to find enough money for the defense budget. We are scraping right now to come up with $2 billion to protect Americans from the Zika virus. Mean-while, we are spending truckloads of money on ships that don’t float. Now, maybe I am being a little hy-perbolic here, but I am going to follow through by talking about the history of the ship. The ship is so poorly con-ceived that even the name, littoral combat ship, doesn’t fit. The term ‘‘littoral’’ means that the ship should be able to operate along the shoreline. Yet, Navy officials have admitted that they haven’t studied carefully enough whether the LCS is the right ship for warfare in shallow waters.

Combat. Combat isn’t accurate either since the Defense Department’s Test-ing Office has said the LCS is not sur-vivable in combat settings. Littoral combat ship. It doesn’t meet the term ‘‘littoral.’’ It doesn’t meet the term ‘‘combat.’’ And considering that one of these ships spent 58 percent of a 10-month deployment idle in a port, we might suggest that maybe it is not even a ship. The Navy now wants to call it some-thing else. Since this grand scheme that was concocted back in the 1990s doesn’t quite fit today, let’s just re-name it a frigate. So what is a frigate? A frigate is a heavy, slow, and surviv-able ship. The littoral combat ship meets the heavy because it is much heavier than it was supposed to be. It is much slower than it is supposed to be, but it is not survivable. So the question then becomes: What are we doing? We are never going to get back the nearly $20 million we have al-ready appropriated on that vessel, but are we going to spend extraordinary sums of money on something that didn’t meet the initial expectations and has proven over and over again that it is not working? Let’s talk about the evolution of the LCS and how we got to this point. One of the primary reasons for building the LCS was to increase the size of the Navy by building smaller and presum-ably cheaper vessels. However, there was never a consistent agreement on the LCS’ mission. Military correspondent David Axe has called the LCS ‘‘Frankenstein’s warship’’ and questioned whether the LCS should be a heavily armored com-bat vessel, a mine clearer, a submarine hunter, a low-cost patroller. How about a small, fast amphibious ship? It was apparently meant to be all those things, yet we seem to have ended up with a ship that can do none of these things. Since the Navy didn’t conduct rig-orous analysis on the ship until bil-lions of dollars were already spent, they were building it without a stra-tegic plan. As a result, the LCS pro-gram has changed its fundamental ac-quisition plan—now, get this—four times since 2005. b1745 We now have a ship that is less sur-vivable and less lethal than originally planned. The real threshold question is: Do we really want to put our sailors’ lives at risk on a vulnerable ship? That should be the threshold question. If this ship is so plagued with flaws and is not survivable in combat, are we not putting our sailors at risk? On top of the fact that the LCS is struggling to perform its intended mis-sions, it is turning out to be the pro-verbial lemon. As detailed by a Polit-ico article in July, the ship’s maiden voyages have been marked by cracked hulls, engine failures, unexpected rust-ing, software glitches, and weapons malfunctions. So let’s start with February 2011. Here we are. What happened there? In February 2011, the USS Freedom sprung a 6-inch crack in its hull that required several months’ worth of repairs. All right, that is the USS Freedom. Now we are in June 2011, just a few months later, and we find that the USS Independence has suffered severe corro-sion and has been sidelined. In December 2012, the Defense De-partment’s director of operational test and evaluation released a report say-ing: ‘‘The LCS is not expected to be survivable . . . in a hostile combat en-vironment.’’ Now, this is the office within the Department of Defense within the Department that is charged with making sure our weapons are safe, effective, and accurate; and the testing office is saying: Do you know what? It is not survivable. In July 2013, the USS Freedom was, once again, immobilized during a trial run. So it has got two strikes now. Also in July of 2013, the GAO urged Congress to restrict the purchase of new LCS until the Navy completed technical and design studies and figured out how much it will cost to fix the vessel’s problems. These were very good sugges-tions. Now, we pay these departments to make these recommendations. But guess what. We just ignored it. We move from July 2013 to December 2014, Secretary of Defense Hagel di-rected the Navy to study ways to im-prove the program. However, the Navy doubled down on its failed strategy and prioritized costs and schedule consider-ations over mission requirements. In December 2015, the USS Mil-waukee—yet another LCS—broke down and had to be towed 40 miles after a software malfunction. In the same month, Secretary of Defense Carter di-rected the Navy to cut the program which would save billions of dollars. Once again, Congress resisted these ef-forts. Another LCS, the USS Fort Worth, in January 2016 was sidelined because its operators failed to follow proper main-tenance procedures. In June of this year, GAO rec-ommended Congress not fund any LCS for 2017. So what did Congress do? In a strained budget, did we heed the GAO? No. No, we didn’t. The NDAA author-ized not one, not two, but three new ships—three new ships—adding $1.5 bil-lion to the budget. Now, this is after the GAO said: Do not authorize any more LCS this year. What did we do? We actually upped the department’s re-quest of two to three. But there is more. In July of this year, the USS Freedom—oh, my God, the third time—yet again encountered more mechanical issues. How bad is it? This time its engine will need to be re-built or replaced. This is a $400 million ship that has been in dock, paralyzed, and towed in three times already, and now we are being told we have to re-place or rebuild the engine. Then most recently, yet another— there are only six of them, mind you, and five of them have had problems. In August of this year, the USS Coronado broke down because of an engineering problem. Despite all of these problems and all of these warnings, what do we do in Congress? We continue to throw money at this ship. Lemons may float in water, but this lemon of a ship evi-dently does not, and it is taking tax-payer money to the bottom of the ocean with it. Even the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, J
OHNMCCAIN, has questioned the LCS program, demonstrating that this is not a partisan issue. Members, we have a responsibility to take care of the taxpayers’ dollars. It makes you wonder why certain House Members are so committed to not just sustaining, but boosting the LCS pro-duction. Aren’t we supposed to be pru-dent with taxpayer money? The answer may be looking at what the shipbuilders were doing in Wash-ington from January to March of this year. During that time, these ship-builders were spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to lobby Congress. Do you know what? I bet we are all paying for that in the bottom line of that particular contract. I experienced firsthand what that money can buy when I attempted to in-troduce an amendment to the FY 2017 Defense Appropriations bill that would have reduced the total ships purchased from three to two for this fiscal year. Now, the Rules Committee appar-ently decided that my amendment was not germane to the bill. I mean, truly, that is right. An amendment on de-fense spending was deemed not rel-evant to a defense spending bill. This wasn’t an absurd proposal either; it was in line with the President’s budget request. It certainly wasn’t a poison pill. That one ship represented only about 0.06 percent of the total defense budget. In hindsight, I should have followed GAO’s recommendation to not fund any LCS next year. I thought only going with two ships was a fair com-promise. We won’t know because we weren’t even allowed to vote on it. That is what we do here. We avoid vot-ing on controversial issues. But that is our job, and this is more than just con-troversial. This is spending taxpayer money and spending it poorly. Even LCS shipbuilder Lockheed Mar-tin must have been surprised that my amendment never reached the House floor. They had already sent out a let-ter urging a ‘‘no’’ vote on it. Now, as I mentioned, it never even got consid-ered because it was held to be non-germane in a defense spending bill. But their arguments for voting against the amendment are about effective as a lit-toral combat ship is at a littoral com-bat, which is to say not very. Lockheed said that if we reduced the LCS program, the Navy would be ‘‘un-able to sustain fleet capability and

meet global requirements.’’ However, the Secretary of Defense said that cut-ting the LCS would actually improve our naval forces by allowing us to in-vest in more pressing needs. Lockheed’s letter also said that we shouldn’t reduce the LCS program be-cause ‘‘ship count is crucial for the Navy to meet its tactical missions.’’ Ship count may be an important meas-urement of capability, but we should not be spending billions of dollars just to reach an arbitrary ship number, es-pecially if those ships aren’t survivable in combat or stall out on the open seas and have to be towed back to port. But that is what we are funding. We are funding flawed ship design, and we are funding flawed ships that are costing us a truckload of money. Lockheed also maintains if we cut the program it would force the ship-yards to shut down. But that is not even true. The GAO says both compa-nies who work on the LCS variants al-ready have enough work on the books to keep their shipyards running to the year 2021. Fortunately, there is still an oppor-tunity to salvage some savings from this shipbuilding program. The NDAA conference committee has been meet-ing to discuss provisions for the final bill. The Senate version supports Sec-retary Carter’s directive to reduce the number of LCS. As a member of the conference committee, I have argued for the adoption of this provision. Cut-ting the total number of ships will save billions of dollars of taxpayer money over the long run. As wasteful and as unnecessary as this program has been, it is just the tip of the iceberg of Congress forcing the Defense Department to spend taxpayer money on weapons it does not want and only seem to benefit certain industries. For example, the House NDAA bill redirects $18 billion in critical funding for wartime operations towards pro-grams the Defense Department did not request. As a result, the bill would only fund the Defense Department through next April, effectively sidestepping the Bipartisan Budget Act compromise signed onto by both Republicans and Democrats that we reached just last year and putting funding for combat operations at risk. In any budget environment, this is not the way we should be doing busi-ness, but House Republicans think nothing of engaging in these wasteful and irresponsible budget shenanigans— and some Democrats, too. Now, I am all for Congress revisiting budget caps and looking for waste and areas where spending and support should be increased. But I do not sup-port cutting funding to crucial, exist-ing programs to fund programs the military doesn’t even want. Furthermore, should we be funding programs and should we be funding weapons that have not been fully test-ed, as the LCS is, that has already shown that it is flawed, that has al-ready shown that five out of the six ships that are afloat have had prob-lems, and they are big problems? Whom do we work for? Do we work for big business; or do we work for the American people? Throwing taxpayer money at failed programs solely for the benefit of industry is not how we should be operating. I am going to stop here. I am joined by my colleague from Minnesota. He is one of the most outspoken people in this Congress on issues around fairness in budgeting, and I am grateful that he is here. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. E
LLISON ). Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative S
PEIER for yielding. I appreciate the gentlewoman being the leader on this issue, looking after the public dollar and looking after our na-tional security making sure that we don’t waste any money but that we put our energy into making sure that we protect the American people at the most proper cost because a dollar that we waste is a dollar we cannot use to do anything else. So the gentlewoman’s advocacy here, I think, is absolutely important. I would like to thank the gentle-woman for organizing this hour to highlight an area of incredible waste of funds, the littoral combat ship. The Operational Test and Evaluation office in the Pentagon said in January that the ship is not reliable. b1800 The Pentagon wants to pay for only two of these ships in 2017, enough to preserve competition and to make sure that taxpayers get the best deal for their money. Yet some in Congress want to force the Pentagon to buy three ships. Key Members of the Con-gress have expressed their concerns about the ship. Senators J
OHN MCCAIN and J ACK R
EED do not believe that the littoral combat ship could defeat an enemy fleet ‘‘unless the enemy fleet consists of a small number of lightly armed boats at extremely short range.’’ The GAO thinks the problems with the littoral combat ship are severe enough to merit a complete production pause. The GAO recommends that Con-gress not fund these ships in 2017. The last of the Navy’s survivability tests will not be completed until 2018, giving us the answers we need to guide future development. The events of this week only rein-force the GAO’s recommendation. The Navy ordered all littoral combat ship crews to stand down and halt oper-ations in order to review procedures and engineering standards. Every sin-gle sailor with an engineering role on the crew will need to be retrained. This is due to ongoing challenges. That ought to be enough for us to take no-tice. Yet Congress is not listening to the facts. The House appropriated an extra $348 million for this ship in 2017. $348 million goes a long way to buying other things that can promote national security, but also things that can help domestic security—things like housing, things like food, jobs, all these kinds of things that we have urgent needs to ad-dress. We haven’t taken up the Zika. We haven’t dealt with Flint. Many ur-gent needs. This is not a worthwhile meritorious expenditure. Somebody is getting paid, and it is not right. The American peo-ple’s interest should be upheld first. That is $348 million above what the President requested for a ship that is not even working. There are better uses for the tax-payer’s money. Like I said, Zika. Let’s make sure that our veterans are stably housed and support mental health pro-grams. How about universal child care for working families? There are so many urgent needs that the American people have. Or, if we stick to military needs, let’s support our troops overseas for an entire year, not just a few months. I want to thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. SPEIER ) for bring-ing to light this critical issue. She al-ways is at the forefront when justice needs a champion. I want to urge Ms. S
PEIER to keep up the fight. We are very proud of her and the work that she does. We will always be standing by her side. Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. E
LLISON ) for his comments. He hit the nail on the head. There are so many important resources, there are so many important services that we need to fund, and yet we don’t find the money for that. Meanwhile, we have six ships, five of which have had prob-lems, flaws, and yet we will not only continue to fund those ships, continue to rehabilitate those ships, but they are going to add three more. When will we finally get the message that there is something wrong with this ship? Let’s go back to the drawing board. Let’s do this the right way. Let’s not build more ships until we find out what is really wrong. This ship has not been fully tested yet. Imagine if we put cars on the road that haven’t been fully tested and then were breaking down and they were being towed. Would we put up with that? Absolutely not. But we are put-ting up with it when it comes to the funding of these ships, and I think it is a travesty. I would say the LCS program has to go. Not just the name, because we have already proven that it is not subject to littoral shorelines. It is not eligible for combat survivability, and there is a big question as to whether or not it is a ship at all since it has the potential, or the propensity, to sink or to break down. Let’s trim the fat from this pork ship and finally sink it. Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-ance of my time.

ZIKA VIRUS The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. C
OMSTOCK ). Under the Speaker’s an-nounced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. J
OLLY ) for 30 minutes. Mr. JOLLY. Madam Speaker, I appre-ciate the opportunity tonight to come to the floor of the House together with a bipartisan group of legislators from the State of Florida to talk about the importance of urgent action on the Zika virus. Perhaps no story has captivated the anxiety of the American people more than Zika has recently. Neither has a topic more angered the American peo-ple, angered people throughout Florida, because of the inability of a Congress and a President and a divided govern-ment to put policy ahead of politics and actually address what is a growing public health crisis. Many issues that we face today—and the Founders intended this—are re-gional issues, from flooding, to health scares, to infrastructure issues. We have regional representation here in the House. Florida, in the continental United States, is ground zero for the impact of the Zika virus. What has emerged within the Florida delegation, I am proud to say, is con-sensus that continues to grow among Republicans and Democrats around ur-gency. Now, we all have different opin-ions about the packages that have been proposed. Over the past 6 months, we have seen three primary options: The President proposed a plan of $1.9 billion over 2 years. That was his ini-tial proposal. The House proposal had money flow-ing at about that same rate by reallo-cating $600 million from unspent Ebola money that was to be delivered over about 6 months, so $100 million a month, depending on how you calculate the color of money. The Senate reached a compromised plan at about $1.1 billion. Now, I am sure we all have differences of opinions about which plan is best. We have seen that. We have seen demands for votes on the President’s plan. In fact, in the Appropriations Committee, we have had to take those votes many times. We have seen the Senate act on their plan. We have seen the House act on theirs. I had great reservations about some of the elements of the President’s plan, and I was honest about this. The Presi-dent’s plan assumed a 2-year crisis in-stead of just 1. I had questions about that. The President’s plan allowed for construction of capital properties on leased lands with no recapture provi-sions. I had concerns about that in terms of stewardship of taxpayer dol-lars. The President’s plan also expands Medicaid services of taxpayer sup-ported health care in Puerto Rico by an additional 10 percent for any healthcare needs, not just Zika, argu-ably diluting money going to Zika. Those were my concerns. The system is set up for us to have that debate. It is okay that we have that debate. Others have great concerns about the House bill and some of the provisions and riders in the House bill. They have objected to those. That is understand-able as well. In the Senate, they reached a com-promise around a $1.1 billion clean bill. We should have these debates early on. Nothing should be rubber-stamped. We wouldn’t be doing our job if we didn’t actually read the legislation, see what is in it, and talk about a contest of ideas. But we can never let those dif-ferences lead us to inaction. That is what is at risk in the current Zika de-bate. We cannot let our differences lead us to doing nothing. I believe we have a pathway forward around a consensus, clean $1.1 billion package we have seen in the Senate today with my colleague, C
URTCLAW-
SON, from the State of Florida and oth-ers. We have introduced the clean version with no riders of the Senate plan here in the House of Representa-tives to hopefully give us a platform where we can build consensus around it. I believe that is the way to do it. Drop the riders, fund Zika. Let’s do it. Let’s do it now. But at the end of the day, whatever package comes through here, we are called to support it. This is a public health crisis that we must address, which is why, despite my objections initially to the President’s plan, I have begun to vote for the President’s plan in the Appropriations Committee be-cause the urgency is now, and it is time that we pass a Zika package. The American people are angry, but they are scared. It is not our job to take the nuances of legislation, the nu-ances of different colors of money in the Federal budget process, and try to preach at the American people why one side is right or the other. Our job is to listen to the anxiety of the American people and address a pending health concern in a divided government. The anger is that this issue perfectly reflects the dysfunction we often see in Congress, and it is doing so in the con-text of a public health crisis. We have to seize upon the better angels in this Chamber and in this town. You see, it doesn’t help when either side plays pol-itics with the Zika issue when the first thing that happens after a vote is the two campaign committees rush emails out the door in Members’ home dis-tricts trying to raise money or blame politics, blame each other. As a Florida delegation, let us lead tonight in trying to form consensus around a solution on Zika. In that light, I am happy to be joined this evening, first, by a colleague of mine from south Florida and the Keys, one of the most beautiful districts next to Pinellas County, I would say. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-tleman from Florida (Mr. C
URBELO ), a champion and early endorser of Zika funding. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. J
OLLY ), my distinguished colleague, for leading this very impor-tant discussion here this evening on a topic that has a lot of people worried back home. I remind people that, in the State of Florida, this is, obviously, a public health crisis. There are a lot of women who are pregnant and are very con-cerned. A few weeks ago, we got a call from my wife’s OB/GYN telling us that his office was full of patients asking questions—a lot of anxiety, a lot of nervous people in our State. In Florida, this is also an economic issue. I met recently with businessowners in the Wynwood- Allapattah area near downtown Miami. They tell me that business in that area is down 60 percent. That means jobs. That means people who aren’t going to be able to take income home to their families, income that they need. For us, of course, it is a public health crisis, and that is our number one con-cern because we want to make sure that people can live comfortably and feel safe in our State. We actually know a few people who have left the State because they are pregnant and they don’t want to risk exposing their unborn babies to the effects, the dev-astating effects, that we have seen Zika cause throughout the world, pri-marily microcephaly, babies born with brain disorders. By the way, we are still learning a lot about the Zika virus. We don’t know what the long-term effects are because, until recently, this isn’t a virus that had really come under the microscope. The bottom line is that we need these funds because we need long-term cer-tainty in the fight against Zika. We need long-term certainty so that all the Federal agencies—the CDC, Health and Human Services, State agencies, local agencies—can all respond, de-velop a vaccine, and, of course, help partner nations overseas. In Florida, we get tourists from all over the world, but especially from Latin America, from South America. We need to help nations like Brazil get this virus under control; otherwise, we will continue to be exposed. Madam Speaker, I am so thankful to my colleague, Mr. JOLLY , for his lead-ership on this issue, for bringing us to-gether here tonight—Republicans and Democrats—asking for common sense, asking to make the American people proud of this Congress, to show that we can be competent, that we can solve people’s problems, that we can help people feel safe and secure in their communities, especially throughout the State of Florida. Mr. JOLLY. Madam Speaker, my ap-preciation to Congressman C
URBELO . Carlos raises an interesting insight, which is part of getting to the bottom of this early on, that, as stewards of taxpayer dollars, what is the money to be used for? Those questions initially are very important. As I mentioned, I had some early objections with the President’s plan that I have resigned

over that I will support if it is what it takes to get a package done. But what is the money used for? That is an im-portant question for the American peo-ple. One of the questions was: Is mosquito control really a Federal activity? That is a legitimate question. Should we rely on States and localities for mos-quito control? Here is the important thing you will learn when you get into why we need a Federal bill to support Zika. It is about the vaccine development. It is about the research into how do we have a cure and eradicate the Zika virus, how do we partner with States and local-ities who are deploying resources right now for mosquito control, mosquito abatement and education; but how does the Federal Government also step in in the midst of what is a public health crisis with national implications both to people’s health, to their lives, and also to our Nation’s economy and Flor-ida’s economy? What is the proper role of the Federal Government? In this case, I believe it is to provide the funding, hopefully at the $1.1 bil-lion level, but I would be happy to sup-port the $1.9 billion as well, whatever it takes to get it done. b1815 Representing the urgency and con-sensus to get this done, we are joined by a Democratic colleague of ours from Palm Beach and the Broward County area, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. D
EUTCH ). Mr. DEUTCH. I thank the gentleman. Madam Speaker, I thank my Repub-lican colleagues for joining here on this vitally important issue. I rise to call for a vote on a Zika funding bill that is free of partisan hot button issues and that is free of polit-ical gamesmanship. I am proud to join in this call for ac-tion with my Florida colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike. We have come together—above partisan di-visions—to support the administra-tion’s request for emergency Zika fund-ing. Our ability to come together and the refusal of the rest of this Congress to do the same is telling. South Florida is actively fighting outbreaks in South Beach and Wynwood. There are cases in Broward County, and there are cases in Palm Beach County, and we have seen locally acquired cases in my home dis-trict. My constituents and the constituents of my colleagues throughout Florida are feeling the anxiety and the fear that come when there is so much that is out of their control. It is time for Congress to do all that we can to help stop the spread of this virus. This Con-gress’ inaction is hurting Florida’s families. As Representative C
URBELO  pointed out, it is hurting our economy. I have three children. My twin daughters are just settling back in to start a new year of college. Today, by the way—I share with my Florida col-leagues—they are celebrating their 21st birthday. My son is finishing up high school; but it feels like just yesterday when my wife and I were anxiously ex-pecting each of their arrivals into our lives. Like most Americans who are starting a family or who are growing a family, we experienced the full range of complex emotions as we waited for their births: the sense of not knowing exactly what is going to come, the ex-citement, the anxiety, the anticipa-tion, the joy. Unfortunately, the Zika virus is threatening the joy of growing a family for thousands of Floridians, and we are just not doing all that we can to stop it. In December of last year, after out-breaks in Brazil were connected to dev-astating birth defects, The New York Times reported a warning for the United States Centers for Disease Con-trol and Prevention. The CDC warned at the time that imported cases ‘‘will likely increase and may result in local spread of the virus in some areas of the United States.’’ Now, at that time in December, 2,700 babies had been born with microcephaly in Brazil—an increase from 150 the year before. These babies were born with abnormally small heads, and now we know, from subse-quent research, that the Zika virus at-tacks growing cells that cause incom-plete brain development and smaller heads in these children. These birth de-fects are devastating. They are also in-curable. These children will have life-long problems with their vision and with their cognitive abilities and will have other complications. Now we know that the CDC’s warning in December has become a reality in Puerto Rico and in south Florida. Verified cases have exploded in Puer-to Rico. In the span of only a few weeks—from the end of July until today—the total cases of Zika on the island have jumped from 5,500 total and 672 in pregnant women to nearly 14,000 total and 1,000 cases in pregnant women. If these trends continue, ex-perts expect that a quarter of the popu-lation of Puerto Rico will be infected— or 887,000 infections. That, unfortu-nately, would represent tens of thou-sands of babies being born with microcephaly. The costs of care and the toll on fam-ilies is staggering. This is an issue that affects families. It is also an issue that winds up affecting their communities. The lifetime costs of medical care for each of these children will be in the millions of dollars. While the virus is spreading rapidly in Puerto Rico, experts like virologist Tim Tellinghuisen of Scripps Research Institute said that the situation in Puerto Rico could very much happen in Florida. Over the past 7 weeks, as Con-gress was in recess, Florida cases went from 311—and no local infections—to over 600 cases, including 56 local infec-tions. The number of cases in pregnant women has doubled. Our constituents are at risk. For us, this is not a political fight. Honestly, in my heart, I do not under-stand how this has become a political fight for those leaders who have blocked the Zika funding in a clean bill. I understand and my colleagues here understand that we serve in the most polarized Congress in history. There are all kinds of issues that we could debate and ways that we might get at that and ways that we could change it as we need to. We have seen the divide over and over again between Republicans in Congress and President Obama; but the funds requested in this Zika battle—the funds requested to fight Zika—are not grounded in ide-ology. The President didn’t wake up one day and say: Hmm, I think we should have $1.9 billion to fund Zika. After the warnings that followed the outbreaks in Brazil, President Obama went to the scientists and to the ex-perts at the NIH and the CDC and other agencies, and he asked: What will it take to respond? His request to this Congress rep-resents their answer. As we heard last week, the funding situation is now dire. Dr. Tom Frieden, the Director of the CDC, said, basi-cally, we are out of money. So I join my colleagues here because it is past time to act. We have to put these political battles behind us. We have to do—and we have the oppor-tunity to do here—something that, I think, is not only the right thing for us and, more importantly, for our con-stituents—for the American people— but we could do something that would actually, perhaps, set an example. We should elevate the common good. We have to protect American families, and we have to pass a clean funding bill to stop the spread of Zika. To Mr. JOLLY , I will relay just one conversation I had on my way out of the office. I was talking to a staffer of mine about the coming months, and the conversation turned to November, when there is an election. Sometimes people from D.C. like to volunteer on campaigns on the weekend before the election. I have a young woman in my office who said she just doesn’t think that she is going to be willing to go down this year out of fear of Zika. How do we not show that we can act in a way that responds to a public health emergency, and only to that public health emergency, without bringing in all of these other issues? We have to do this. I am really grate-ful to be here on the House floor, and I am really thrilled to be here with my Republican colleagues, who are as com-mitted to doing this as I am. I am so grateful for the opportunity to share this time with you. Mr. JOLLY. I thank my colleague, Mr. D
EUTCH . That is the urgency. My colleague, Mr. D
EUTCH , mentioned his family, and birthday wishes are in order. Congratulations. My wife and I just got married last year, and we are hoping to have a fam-ily ourselves. We live within 5 or 10

miles of one of the non-travel-related cases. Folks do understand the anxiety that creates for people in Florida who are hoping to have a family. Yesterday and the day before—and it created a bit of a buzz—I brought about 100 mosquitoes of the Aedes aegypti va-riety, which are capable of carrying Zika. Through working with the Uni-versity of South Florida, we were able to get these mosquitoes here to Wash-ington, D.C., because I wanted col-leagues to understand the urgency of what happens to families in Florida when they are in the proximity of these mosquitoes. When I gave a speech with these mos-quitoes, do you know what the Amer-ican people said—hundreds and thou-sands of people? ‘‘Release them.’’ ‘‘Smash the jar.’’ Do you want to see Congress work fast? Expose Zika mosquitoes in this Chamber. We would shut it down. We would scrub the Chamber. People would get tested. That is the anxiety. That is the urgency. It doesn’t know partisanship. It is okay that we have had this debate ini-tially over what the right response is— the President’s proposal, the House’s, or the Senate’s. That is okay. That is doing our job, but it is not doing our job when we let the fighting and debat-ing lead us to do nothing. We are joined tonight by another leader in our delegation from the pan-handle—the Tallahassee area of Flor-ida—a good friend, a Democratic friend, Ms. G
WENGRAHAM . Ms. GRAHAM. I thank Congressman J
OLLY , and I thank Congressman D
EUTCH very much for arranging this tonight. It means a lot. I feel the same anxiety just being as close to the lar-vae as others feel, and I might just ask that the gentleman keeps them in the jar. Madam Speaker, let me talk about my home State of Florida. I was born and raised in south Florida. I think, right around now, the Sun is probably setting in south Florida. The weather is nice. It is 80 degrees. The sky is that beautiful pink that we get. Vaca-tioning tourists are strolling along the beach or are enjoying dinner on a patio. Somewhere—I know this—there is a dad outside who is grilling steaks, and moms are watching soccer prac-tice. That is our life. That is our life in the beautiful State of Florida. It is like a lot of other places around this coun-try except, right now in Florida, fami-lies are scared. I have thought about the gentleman and Laura, and I understand that fear. Families are scared because, as the Sun sets, the mosquitoes are coming out. For all of our lives we have lived with mosquitoes. It is part of our life in Florida, but now they are more than a nuisance. Now they are a deadly threat. We are scared because there is a deadly virus spreading. Parents are scared that, if their children are bitten, they could get terribly sick. Seniors are scared that, if they catch the dis-ease, they may not survive. Pregnant women are scared that they will wake up one morning with a mosquito bite and that it may cause the children in-side them to be born with terrible birth defects. My daughter would be appalled for me to say this, but she is 25. She doesn’t live in Florida right now. I hope she will move back, but the risk of pregnancy right now would not be one that I would want her to take. So this is the new normal in Florida. More than 600 people in Florida have been infected with the Zika virus. Al-most 100 pregnant women in Florida have been infected. We have been sounding the alarm for months, haven’t we, Congressman JOLLY ? I have come on this floor to ask for funding to fight the disease. I led a let-ter with more than 120 Democrats that asked Speaker R
YANto have a vote on full funding to fight the disease. I did a workday with the local mosquito con-trol team in Bay County, and I have asked my constituents in north Florida to do their part to fight off the spread-ing disease. I ask again—particularly now, fol-lowing Hermine, as we have had a lot of water in our area—to please go out and make sure that you dump any standing water. I am really proud of all that we are doing as Floridians to try and stop the spread of Zika in Florida. Florida State University is research-ing the virus and making important breakthroughs. b1830 Local municipalities are spraying. Ordinary people, as I said, are dumping standing water out of their yard. We are doing our part in Florida. Now, it is time for Congress to act and do their part as well. Madam Speaker, yesterday I joined a bipartisan letter with Florida Repub-licans and Democrats who are asking for one simple thing: Give us a vote on a clean bill that would fully fund the fight against Zika. Give us a vote on a clean bill that would fully fund the fight against Zika. This is a public health emergency. Just as important, let’s give sci-entists the certainty they need to re-search and develop a vaccine for Zika, and this could take several years. Pre-maturely cutting off resources before the vaccine is ready could be just as dangerous as not providing enough money today. I spoke with the scientists. As they develop vaccines, they go through dif-ferent trial stages. Ethically, you can’t start a vaccine study, ask people to participate, and then say: ‘‘Never mind. Our funding has dried up. You are not going to be able to continue.’’ That is not something that we could do. Our delegation has shown that Re-publicans and Democrats have come to-gether on this issue, and I believe that the entire Congress can as well. There are Republicans and Demo-crats in States along the Gulf Coast— Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana—who will come together and support full funding because their constituents are at risk, too. I am still holding out hope that Speaker RYAN will be able to support full funding to fight this deadly virus. Time is running out. It is time to put partisanship aside and vote on full funding to fight this horrific disease, Zika. We must all come together to make sure that the resources are there for mosquito control and for vaccine production. Mr. JOLLY. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, Ms. G
RAHAM . We are down to 4 or 5 minutes. We have two more speakers remaining. I yield to the gentleman from Pinellas County, Florida (Mr. B
ILI-
RAKIS ). Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I agree with Representative G
RAHAM  that we must fund this and we must fund a clean bill. Whatever it takes, Madam Speaker, we have to get this done as soon as possible. I have been focused on the growing problem of Zika since March, when the Energy and Commerce Committee held a hearing on Zika preparedness, and we have been working together in a bipar-tisan fashion to get this done. Zika is a unique problem that will only increase. As of the end of August, there were 2,686 cases of travel-associ-ated Zika within the United States. These cases came from international travel where the individual acquired Zika abroad and discovered it when they returned to the United States. There have also been 35 cases of lo-cally acquired mosquito-borne Zika. As a matter of fact, we have a nontravel- related case in our county, Pinellas County. There are 35 individuals who got Zika because a mosquito bit them within the United States. Because of this local transmission for the first time ever, we now have a CDC travel advisory about an area within the United States in the Miami area. If you expand the incidences of Zika to include the territories, there would be 14,059 cases of locally acquired infec-tions of Zika. Mr. Speaker, this is a large amount. We must act now. The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has nearly 14,000 cases of locally acquired Zika. That number will only grow, un-fortunately. 624 women within the United States had Zika while pregnant, and 971 women from the territories. We don’t know the full impact that Zika will have on their infants. Already, CDC re-ports that 16 infants have been born with birth defects within the United States. I don’t know how many more when we include the territories. Zika can cause microcephaly, a birth defect where a baby’s head is smaller than expected when compared to other

babies. Babies with microcephaly often have smaller brains that might not have developed properly. People are really scared, Madam Speaker. We have to get this done in a bipartisan fashion. Not all babies who have been exposed to Zika while in utero, have been born with visi-ble birth defects. However, we cannot say that they were born without any effect of Zika. It is possible that they may have delayed development. That’s why I plan on introducing tomorrow, the Pregnant Women and Infants Zika Reg-istry. This bill will establish a CDC registry pro-gram for pregnant women and will track in-fants up to age five, so that researchers can get a better understanding of the impact of Zika. This registry will collect information on preg-nancy and infant outcomes following labora-tory evidence of Zika virus infection during pregnancy. The data collected will be used to update recommendations for clinical care, to plan for services for pregnant women and families af-fected by the Zika virus, and to improve pre-vention of Zika virus infection during preg-nancy. I invite all my fellow Floridians and fellow members to cosponsor this bill. It’s a responsible tool to increase our knowl-edge of Zika and help increase the quality and standard of care for patients. Mr. JOLLY. Madam Speaker, we are about out of time. We have one last speaker. Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, hopefully I get an opportunity to speak and continue tomorrow. 
GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. JOLLY. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and in-sert extraneous materials on the topic of this Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. JOLLY. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Jupiter, Florida (Mr. M
URPHY ). Mr. MURPHY of Florida. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague and my friend (Mr. J
OLLY ) for organizing this Special Order, for his leadership on this issue, and convening this important conversation on the need for imme-diate action to combat Zika. It is clear to us in Florida that Zika is not a partisan issue. It is about pro-tecting our families and our children. Yet, 7 months after the World Health Organization declared an international public health emergency over Zika and the administration submitted its re-quest for $1.9 billion in emergency funds to combat the virus, no bipar-tisan agreement has been reached to pass a bill providing the resources needed for this fight. As the number of Zika cases con-tinues to grow across the Nation, in-cluding more than 50 local trans-missions in Florida alone, this pro-longed congressional inaction is unac-ceptable. That is why over a dozen members of Florida’s congressional delegation are calling on congressional leaders to take immediate action on a clean Zika funding bill. I was proud to lead this bipartisan letter with Congressman JOLLY , and I want to thank those Representatives who have joined us. Our hope is that the rest of Congress will work together like our delegation and treat this matter with the serious-ness that it deserves, taking action needed to protect the American people and public health. That starts with ending the political posturing and dropping divisive, unrelated policy rid-ers and immediately passing a clean funding bill to provide the resources necessary to fight Zika. This is an emergency, not an oppor-tunity to be exploited to score points against Planned Parenthood or to weaken the Affordable Care Act. Con-gress’ delay has only made the problem worse and more expensive as babies tragically born with microcephaly will require a lifetime of care. The need for emergency funding could not be more urgent given the CDC Director’s recent statements that current Zika funding is nearly ex-hausted, so we must find the bipartisan cooperation. We must pass a clean bill and get this done immediately. The people of Florida deserve it. This is even after the extraordinary move of reallocating over $80 million from research on Ebola, HIV, cancer, diabetes, and other chron-ic conditions to prioritize Zika efforts. Beyond the funding, we also need to make sure the scientists and researchers working on developing a Zika vaccine have the necessary tools to do just that. For example, during a recent visit to Scripps Florida, a leading research facility in my Con-gressional district, I heard from their Zika re-search team about the need for location-spe-cific blood samples for their ongoing work. Additionally, we must make sure that states and local partners have the resources needed to implement and maintain world-leading mos-quito control programs to prevent the spread of mosquito-borne diseases. I am proud to have put forward the SMASH Act with my colleague, the gentleman from Florida, Mr. C
LAWSON , who knows firsthand how important mosquito control districts are. The SMASH Act will support our local mos-quito control districts to help fight the spread of Zika. Additionally, the bill provides grants to sup-port the work of state and local health depart-ments, our partners on the ground, for treating infectious diseases like Zika. To further bolster prevention, detection, and treatment efforts, Governor Scott should ex-pand Medicaid in Florida. Up to one million Floridians could be newly covered if the governor would simply accept available federal dollars. These dollars would go directly to strength-ening our public health and responding to Zika. This crisis requires collective action, with all levels of government working together on both immediate and long-term solutions to combat this virus. There are also a few simple steps Floridians can take to protect themselves. To prevent bites and the spread of mosqui-toes, this includes wearing bug spray and draining standing water. Furthermore, it is important to remember that Zika can be sexually transmitted and the same safe sex practices that help prevent the spread of HIV will also prevent the spread of Zika. Zika and mosquitoes don’t care if you’re a Democrat or Republican. This is a serious health crisis that impacts all Americans. It is great to see growing bipartisan support in Congress to do the right thing, putting polit-ical posturing aside to move forward a clean funding bill to combat this virus and keep fami-lies safe. Again, I thank the gentleman from Florida, Mr. JOLLY, and the rest of our delegation for showing the leadership needed to get this done and enlist Congress in the fight against Zika. Mr. JOLLY. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF PHYLLIS SCHLAFLY The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-uary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. K
ING) for 30 minutes. Mr. KING of Iowa. Madam Speaker, it is my honor to be recognized to ad-dress the floor of the United States House of Representatives. I intend to take up the topic of the commemora-tion of the life of Phyllis Schlafly. 
GENERAL LEAVE  
Mr. KING of Iowa. Madam Speaker, I would ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days on which to revise and extend their re-marks and insert extraneous materials on the topic of this Special Order here this evening. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Iowa? There was no objection. Mr. KING of Iowa. Madam Speaker, this sad news came to me this past weekend that the relatively long and extraordinarily productive and impactful life of Phyllis Schlafly had come to an end at the age of 92. I got to know Phyllis throughout the political activism of the country among conservative politics. It goes back for me quite a ways now, too, I might add. But I didn’t pay a lot of at-tention to what was going on in the early ‘70s when Phyllis Schlafly’s eyes went on some of the transformative shifts that were taking place in Amer-ica. Phyllis was a pro-life activist before Roe v. Wade. She saw it coming. She knew what it meant. She became one of the strongest pro-life voices in all of America and, I would say, the most persistent, the most consistent, and the most relentless voice for the long-est period of time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH5218 September 8, 2016 
Phyllis was active on the public scene from at least as far back as 1952, all the way up until the last days of her life, which ended this past weekend. I would like to go through some of those milestones of Phyllis Schlafly’s life, and then perhaps have some comments about those milestones along her life. As I review some of that material, Madam Speaker, I look back on her im-pact, particularly in Republican poli-tics. She was a campaign manager for a successful Republican candidate for Congress in St. Louis in 1946. It was for Claude Bakewell. She served as an elected delegate to eight Republican National Conven-tions. I don’t know that there has been a more consistent or persistent voice at our Republican National Conven-tions over more than a half a century than we have heard from Phyllis Schlafly. She was an elected delegate to the Republican National Conventions in 1956, 1964, 1968, 1984, 1992, 1996, 2004, and 2012. You might wonder what she was doing in those missing convention years of 1960, 1980, 2000, and 2008. Well, she was an elected alternate in those conventions. And I would suspect that her choice was similar to that of what I had made a time or two in the past as well—that I wanted to make sure that there were young people that had an opportunity to be a delegate and that young people had an opportunity to come up and be active in politics. Phyl-lis Schlafly had facilitated thousands of young people to come into active politics. Phyllis attended the Republican Na-tional Convention in Cleveland this last July where it was the last time that I saw her as she came into the Re-publican reception, the Members recep-tion upstairs. I had an opportunity to speak a few words with her and see that radiant smile on her face. She was dressed in just a very, very colorful and gracious dress and seated in a wheel-chair. The brightness in her eyes told me there was a lot of spirit left in Phyllis Schlafly. Phyllis has played an active role in every Republican National Convention since 1952. The earliest real impact— when people began to notice who Phyl-lis Schlafly was—was when she pub-lished on May 1, 1964, the book, ‘‘A Choice Not an Echo.’’ It was a small little book that gave us an under-standing about how presidential can-didates are selected. It was a descrip-tion of some of the backroom deals that were made about the dynamics of the presidential process. She called it for 1964. She identified who the back-room supporters would be, how they would try to stop Barry Goldwater from being nominated. The book, ‘‘A Choice Not an Echo,’’ holds up to this day. She wrote a sup-plement to it as well to bring it up to speed, and published that book some-time in the last year or two. ‘‘A Choice Not an Echo’’ was an impactful book, and it was one that is one of the foundational documents that identifies the basis of modern-day con-servatism. Phyllis Schlafly was one of a very few original conservatives here in America. She has been one of about three voices that were still active in the public scene that go back to the era in the early ‘60s. For Phyllis, it goes back as far back as 1946, when she managed a congressional campaign. Phyllis’ life has been deeply engaged in this kind of activity. She was elect-ed first vice president for the National Federation of Republican Women, 1960 to 1964. She was a candidate for Con-gress in 1952 and 1970, in two different districts. Phyllis received numerous awards. She founded the Republican National Coalition for Life in 1990 with the spe-cific mission of protecting the pro-life plank in the Republican platform, and no one has been more active and had more voice on the pro-life movement and more effective than Phyllis Schlafly throughout these years. Her voice on this public scene will sorely be missed. She was a volunteer and a founder of Eagle Forum. The people that worked with and for Eagle Forum out across through the States came as volunteers. She also established offices in all of Il-linois and here in Washington, D.C., and kept a voice and a presence here. Phyllis Schlafly became a conscience for conservatives. As we are trying to clarify the meaning of the Constitu-tion, understand our place in history, and stand up for those principles that matter, often the voice of Phyllis Schlafly was echoing in our ears here on the floor of the House of Represent-atives. b1845 She would gather the young Eagles to come here at least once a year, usu-ally twice a year to hear from them and give a number of us an opportunity to speak to the young people and take questions, but the bright lights that she identified, that she brought into activism have made, I think, a dra-matic difference across America as that conscience of conservatism has multiplied across hundreds and then thousands of young Eagles that I had an opportunity to meet with and ex-change ideas with and listen to. One of my stories about Phyllis Schlafly, I will start it first with this. When I arrived here in this Congress 14 years ago, one of the first days that I was here to walk out on this floor to vote, I walked back through the back of these Chambers, and one of the Members from Missouri, Todd Akin, came over to me and introduced him-self. He said: I want to talk to you about Court stripping. And I said to him: You mean Article III, section 2 of the Constitution? And he said: Yes. How do you know that? Well, the reason I had paid attention to that was because it was Phyllis Schlafly who had written about it. In my years that I had been working in my construction office, all I ever really wanted to do was raise my family and run my construction business. I didn’t really think about being involved and trying to be in the middle of public pol-icy. I thought there were good, reliable people who would be here making those decisions. But I would send off for what, at that time, were little articles that I would call—you had to sign up for them, and you had to send off a check, and they would send you the mailing of her Forum document. Phyllis was all over the newspapers. I can’t count all the publications, but I know she has pub-lished at least 27 books. I would read these articles that would show up in these publications. Maybe the headline caught me, but I would skip the author. I would read the story, I would read the article, and, boy, that is clarity of thought, utter clarity of thought. And then I would look up: Who wrote that? Phyllis Schlafly. Time after time after time. Before I really knew who Phyllis was, I was reading her material. She was im-pacting my thinking, and I am won-dering: Who wrote this document? Phyllis Schlafly. Hundreds and thou-sands of documents, hundreds and thousands of analyses that she had done. And not only that, she was not dis-ciplined to stick to a particular topic. I was looking through some of these topics that Phyllis had written books on. Of the 27 books, she picked a few topics: family and feminism, her book on family and feminism, ‘‘The Power of the Positive Woman’’ and ‘‘Feminist Fantasies,’’ those things that won’t come true. Phyllis Schlafly, her comment on the judiciary, the book called, ‘‘The Su-premacists: The Tyranny of Judges and How to Stop It.’’ I have it here. I have a story about that I might tell if we have time a little later. On religion, her book, ‘‘No Higher Power: Obama’s War on Religious Free-dom’’; her book on nuclear strategy, ‘‘Strike From Space’’ and ‘‘Kissinger on the Couch.’’ Then her book on edu-cation, ‘‘Child Abuse in the Class-room’’; her book on child care, ‘‘Who Will Rock the Cradle?’’ and on phonics, ‘‘First Reader’’ and ‘‘Turbo Reader.’’ That is an example of the kind of work that Phyllis did. She wasn’t narrow at all in her scope. She understood her faith, her Christi-anity, her religion, her role as a moth-er of six, a grandmother, a great-grand-mother. She understood her role as a wife; she understood her role as a stu-dent, as a law student with a law de-gree; and she understood her role here in America. When the ERA came forward—and it was a mistake then, it would be a mis-take now—Phyllis Schlafly, when they thought it was all done and the Equal Rights Amendment was going to be ratified—there were a few States left— Phyllis Schlafly started the battle to shut down the ERA; and it was almost

singlehanded for a long time, but she mobilized a nation and put an end to the Equal Rights Amendment, which would have ended up with drafting women into the military. There is much going on today that she didn’t agree with, but we have slowed down this train of liberalism. She has been a significant player in it. I see that we have some Members who have arrived at the floor that I be-lieve would like to add some words to this. I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. D
AVIDSON ), if he is prepared to offer some words. Mr. DAVIDSON. Thank you, Mr. K
ING. It is an honor to be able to talk about Phyllis Schlafly. Though I never personally met her, like many of the heroes of our country, all Americans benefit from the service that she ren-dered to our country, and in particular to the Republican Party. She is the person, perhaps more than anyone, who made sure that the Republican Party is the party of life, that really is out there to this day on the side of science showing when life begins and showing what is happening at every stage of life. I am more optimistic than ever about what is happening to show this fact, but a voice there that just knew the truth and was unashamed in speaking for it, unashamed in helping our party coalesce around a core set of beliefs, and those core beliefs are the same ones that our Founders had. So when people look back and think that, you know, hey, the Founders were this era of giants, it is neat to have lived in an era when we have some of our own. Phyllis Schlafly was one of them. She certainly set the stage for Ron-ald Reagan’s speech, ‘‘A Time for Choosing,’’ because of her activities in the 1964 campaign and because of ‘‘A Time for Choosing’’ and Reagan’s suc-cess in that, success as Governor, and really shaping our modern party for the era that has been a conservative movement for a long time. That set the stage for Justice Scalia. So an eventful year, a sad year to see her pass and Justice Scalia pass in the same year, but also, you know, an era when we can look forward to future success and an era when we can see what the true meaning of womanhood is all about. She was a champion for women in a way she may never get credit for. So I am honored for her service to our country, for her defense of her faith and my faith, and for her con-tributions to make this the kind of country that really inspires so many around the world to see it as the land of opportunity. So thank you. Mr. KING of Iowa. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for his presentation here. I not only appre-ciate the kind words about the life of Phyllis Schlafly, but the voice of com-mitment to conservative cause that emerges as we listen to the gentle-man’s words from Ohio. I would like to now, if I could, yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. WEBER ), who has arrived. I would note also that our great friend Michele Bachmann from Minnesota is here on the floor of the House of Representa-tives tonight, and that adds a tremen-dous amount of joy to me to what oth-erwise is a sad occasion, but we have to be also celebrating the glorious life of Phyllis Schlafly. It helps commemo-rate it here to know that one of the people who was closest to Phyllis has made the trip here to be on the floor as we discuss her life and celebrate her life. Mr. WEBER of Texas. Madam Speak-er, I thank my colleague, Mr. K
ING, and I, too, want to echo that, for Congress-woman Michele Bachmann being here, what a treat. What an absolute treat. We miss her, by the way. We do miss her. I want to thank Michele for being here and all that she has done. Madam Speaker, we did not recently lose a true conservative. We didn’t re-cently lose the ‘‘first lady of the con-servative movement.’’ We didn’t just lose someone who was a threat to the liberal agenda and a threat to Com-munists. No, no, no. Phyllis Schlafly was much more than that. You know, eagles are known, Madam Speaker, for their strength and their ability to soar high above the clouds. Eagles are known to be above the fray. Phyllis was our eagle. However, she was that eagle who, while in the fray, main-tained that 30,000-foot view. And she was much more than that. She was a warrior. She was a leader. She em-bodied American patriotism and lib-erty. In 1975, Mrs. Schlafly founded the Eagle Forum, which has been a pillar in the pro-family conservative move-ment for four decades and counting. There is no doubt, Madam Speaker, that the Eagle Forum will live on, and we will see her eagle soar higher and higher with time. Mrs. Schlafly was the heart and soul of the conservative movement in the early days. Many people thought she wouldn’t make a difference, but as we look back, Madam Speaker, history is telling us otherwise. You hear it over and over again that one person cannot make a difference. Well, I will tell you that Phyllis Schlafly was living proof that one person can make a difference. Phyllis soared the highest, cared the most, and fought the hardest—more than anyone else—for our conservative values. Madam Speaker, since the day I was sworn in not quite 4 years ago, I have been saying it is time to put America first. Through all of Mrs. Schlafly’s work, at the very core of her efforts, she wanted to ensure that our country was first and that Americans were our top priority and that the Federal Gov-ernment and even State governments knew their place. I find great comfort, Madam Speaker, in knowing that in some small way, Lord willing, I might be allowed to take part in ensuring that the work of Phyllis Schlafly con-tinues. She was a passionate woman who loved this country, loved her family, and was fiercely, fiercely driven to en-sure that our liberties were protected and that the unborn—the unborn— would have a fighting chance to the guarantee of life, liberty, and the pur-suit of happiness. Madam Speaker, those who know Phyllis know she always put family first, politics second. I can’t help but believe that she knew that at the core of politics, it really was, really is, God first, family and country second, and political activism stemmed from that. Phyllis knew that. By the way, she cared so much for this country, she came out early on in support of Donald Trump, knowing it would raise eyebrows. But that was Phyllis. You never doubted where she stood. You never doubted her convic-tions. Madam Speaker, she did all that for her family because she cared about future generations of Americans. Above all, I appreciate her commit-ment to our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. We can take great heart in knowing that Phyllis joins her husband of 44 years, Fred, in the kingdom of Heaven with our Lord and Savior Jesus. Our hearts and prayers go out to her family. Mr. K
ING, you said 6 kids, 16 grandchildren—16 grandchildren. Phyllis was an amazing person who lived an amazing life and did so much good for our country. For that, I will be forever grateful to her and the work she did for the conservative movement. I want to thank you, my colleague, Mr. K
ING, for allowing me this oppor-tunity to memorialize one of the great-est Americans. Madam Speaker, you know I am right. Mr. KING of Iowa. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for coming down to help memorialize the life of Phyllis Schlafly. Madam Speaker, the things that come to mind as I listened to Mr. W
EBER talk about Phyllis Schlafly and I look across at Michele Bachmann, I think about a time that Phyllis took us back into a room in St. Louis to sit and talk to both of us about the future and the destiny of the country. It was three of us sitting there having a little snack and chatting away on the Con-stitution and the value of life and mar-riage and the current and the destiny of America. Phyllis always saw it, as I think somebody mentioned, from 30,000 feet. The time I spend here in this Con-gress, the time I have the privilege of dealing with people at some of the highest levels in the country, the longer I am at this, the fewer people I am able to identify who can see with clarity the big picture and understand the currents of the course of history and the cultural movements that oper-ate within this course of history that are actually driving it. Phyllis always saw it. She always saw it with a clar-ity, and that is what drove her to put 27 books out, and one of them was in support of Donald Trump.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH5220 September 8, 2016 
She had time in the last years of her life, ‘‘The Conservative Case for Trump’’ that is published. I think of the work that she got done. If some-body said to me: ‘‘Well, Donald Trump is going to be the nominee’’—and we maybe know this about the time of the Indiana primary—‘‘why don’t you just go out and write a book and publish that?’’—to pull that off and get that done, to do that when you are 92. I recall the time when Phyllis broke her hip and she was in a hospital in St. Louis. b1900 So, I thought, I need to talk to Phyl-lis. I just want to wish her well. I call her up and, yes, she is in a hospital bed all right, but already, first thing when she comes out from the anesthetic, she asked for her laptop. She is at the hos-pital bed with a laptop, no doubt writ-ing, producing documents, printing things, moving public policy in Amer-ica from the hospital bed. On another occasion, I had the privi-lege to be named to present an award to Phyllis here in Washington, D.C. It was at an event at a hotel here in town. So, I am thinking: How do I make this work? Actually, my schedule wouldn’t work for that. I thought: I can’t let Phyllis down. Then, I learned that Phyllis had hurt her back and she had gone in for back surgery. I said: I think I know how to do this. I will tape a video for the peo-ple that are there to commemorate Phyllis, and then I will go visit her in St. Louis on my way back to Iowa. I flew to St. Louis and went to the nursing home where she was recovering from this back surgery. Her lap was covered with books and works and things we know. She sat there and told me how, yes, they had to put some ce-ment in her back. I said: Just like it comes out of the truck? Well, pretty much, she said: They just go in there and fill in the gaps that I have, and now I have to take a little therapy and I will be fine. Well, she was fine, mentally. This woman had an aura about her. There was a radiance about her. I can only name three people that I have laid eyes on in my lifetime that when they were in the room you knew it; and you knew there was something emanating from the character, the spirit, the soul, and the intellect of Phyllis Schlafly. It is extraordinary. It is an extraordinary life. I know that one of her close friends was L
OUIE GOHMERT , who is here to-night on the floor. I yield to the gen-tleman from Texas (Mr. G
OHMERT ) to say a few words about Phyllis. Mr. GOHMERT. What a woman. What a person. Phyllis Schlafly led efforts to return America to being the shining light on a hill that it had been, but the light was dimming. She would see that. She could see the harm that was happening to our most vulnerable, and she led an effort more years than anybody that I have ever known personally to return America to being a citadel for freedom and for morality from which freedom can only grow. She saw us losing our way, yet she remained relentless. Those who despised her know better than most anyone else this is someone who would never, ever give up. She was a leader, a warrior, a mentor, and a friend. Like very dear friends, like family, you have disagreements some-times, but you know her heart. You knew she wanted what was best for you, for this country, for the world. Mr. KING of Iowa. I would interject; when I disagreed with Phyllis, I started with the assumption that I was prob-ably wrong. Mr. GOHMERT. That is a great as-sumption when it comes to Phyllis. Well, she has fought the good fight, she has finished her course, and she has kept the faith. I will be there Saturday morning with her family, but the best memorial we can give to Phyllis Schlafly is to make sure the light of freedom and morality does not die in America. Mr. KING of Iowa. I thank the gen-tleman from Texas for a very moving presentation here. I know that it means something very deeply in his heart, as it does in ours here on this floor and across this country by the thousands. A couple of things that I want to just quickly inject into this discussion. She would want me to say on article 3, section 2, Court stripping, we don’t need to genuflect to the supremacists. The Court has gotten out of control. The Constitution is set up to where they are to be the weakest of the three branches of government, not a superior supremacist branch of government. Phyllis handed me the manuscript to this book, as I had a lot of long plane flights to do. The manuscript was just printed off a copy machine and kind of clipped together. I worked through all of that. I wrote my edits on it, my notes in the margins, red ink. I worked through it for hours—in fact, it was days. It got lost on the plane on the way back from Africa. I went to her and said: Phyllis, I need a little more time to work on the edits of your book because the manuscript has been lost in the luggage. She looked at me and she said: Well, Con-gressman, I didn’t intend for you to edit my book. I just intended for you to have an early copy. I knew exactly what I wanted to say. The book stands out. She knew ex-actly what she wanted to say. That is a lot about her intellect and her per-sonality. With utter clarity, the clearest polit-ical thinker of our time, based in Bib-lical values, values of Christians, con-stitutional values, a clear under-standing of people and humanity and faith and family, she wrote on so many topics with utter clarity on topic, after topic, after topic. She lived a life of 92 years and was a player in the public arena since imme-diately post-World War II, and she is a player in our lives to this day. She is in our hearts, she is in our souls, she is in our conscience, and she affects our thinking and our actions—and she will for a long, long time to come. This is a woman who has redirected the destiny of America. I can’t think of any woman who had more impact on the course of the history in the United States of America nor weighs more heavily on our sense of duty of what we need going forward to continue to honor the glorious life of Phyllis Schlafly. Rest in peace, Phyllis. God love you. We do. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. f

.S5421 Vol. 162 WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 2016 No. 135 
Senate 
The Senate met at 9:30 a.m. and was called to order by the President pro tempore (Mr. H
ATCH ). 
f 
PRAYER The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-fered the following prayer: Let us pray. Eternal Spirit, by whose providence our forebears brought forth this Na-tion, use our lawmakers to make a bet-ter world. Empower them to remove those things that obstruct the coming of Your Kingdom on Earth. As they strive for human betterment, may they experience the constancy of Your pres-ence. Lord, give them the wisdom to give primacy to prayer, seeking Your guid-ance in all they think, say, and do. Teach them the lessons they ought to learn, enabling them to grow in grace and in a knowledge of You. And, Lord, with the approach of Sep-tember 11, we pause to thank You for Your sustaining and prevailing provi-dence. Remind us to not put our trust in human might, but in Your grace, mercy, and power. We pray in Your strong Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The President pro tempore led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
MOMENT OF SILENCE The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Senate will now observe a moment of silence in remem-brance of the lives lost in the attacks of September 11, 2001. (Moment of silence.) RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. HELLER ). The majority leader is recog-nized. 
f 
MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR—S. 3296 AND S. 3297 Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, I understand there are two bills at the desk due for a second reading. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bills by title for the second time. The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A bill (S. 3296) to amend the Internal Rev-enue Code of 1986 to provide an exemption to the individual mandate to maintain health coverage for individuals residing in counties with fewer than 2 health insurance issuers offering plans on an Exchange. A bill (S. 3297) to amend the Internal Rev-enue Code of 1986 to provide an exemption to the individual mandate to maintain health coverage for certain individuals whose pre-mium has increased by more than 10 percent, and for other purposes. 
Mr. M CCONNELL. In order to place the bills on the calendar under the pro-visions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings en bloc. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-tion having been heard, the bills will be placed on the calendar. 
f 
REMEMBERING SEPTEMBER 11 Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, 15 years ago this Sunday, Al Qaeda ter-rorists launched brutal and vicious at-tacks against our country. Yet this weekend America will remember not only the horror of those attacks but also the heroism of our response. We saw firefighters, police officers, and first responders rush in to confront danger. We saw the men and women of our Armed Forces stand ready and sac-rifice greatly in defense of our country. We saw Americans across the land work together in a spirit of unity. So 15 years later, it is clear that the ter-rorists did not succeed. We remain united against terror. So this Sunday is a day to remember and honor the victims of September 11 and pray for their families. It is also a day to express gratitude to the many Americans who have fought to keep us safe ever since—the men and women who fight for the very thing that makes this the greatest Nation on Earth—freedom. f 
CONGRATULATING BRIAN DUFFY Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to con-gratulate a fellow Kentuckian and a good friend of mine who has recently taken up the leadership reins of Amer-ica’s oldest and largest war veterans organization. This summer, Brian Duffy, of Louis-ville, was elected commander in chief of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Brian is the first Operation Desert Storm veteran to lead the VFW. His election is good news, not only for his fellow Desert Storm veterans but for veterans of every generation. That is because Brian lives to serve his fellow veterans, and he has been doing so for decades as a proud member of the VFW for 33 years. Let me give one example of what Brian has done for the veterans of Ken-tucky. He is the founder of the Blue-grass chapter of an organization called Honor Flight, a group that flies World War II and Korean war veterans to Washington to visit the memorials that were built in dedication of their military service. The program provides transportation and food for the veterans of this by-gone era, those whose numbers, unfor-tunately, continue to shrink year after year. Without Honor Flight, many of these veterans would never be able to see the World War II Memorial or the Korean War Veterans Memorial. It is important that they know, more than

six decades later, that America still deeply respects and honors their serv-ice and sacrifice. My father served in World War II. I have had the pleasure of meeting many of his contemporaries when they came to Washington to make this important trip. Hundreds of Kentucky veterans have completed this journey, thanks to Brian and subsequent leaders of Blue-grass Honor Flight. That is just one way Brian has worked to see that America stands up for its veterans, just as they have so bravely stood up for their country. It is one reason why I know he will make an excellent commander in chief for the VFW. Brian served in the U.S. Air Force as a jet engine mechanic on F–4 Phantom fighter aircraft before becoming a flight engineer aboard a C–141 Starlifter transport aircraft. He has de-ployed to Grenada and Panama as well as on Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. Brian and his wife Jean, who has also served in leadership posts for the VFW, live in Louisville and have two chil-dren, Tara and Andrew. I am sure his family is proud of Brian, along with many Kentucky veterans, particularly his fellow VFW members at Post 1170. Let me also congratulate my good friend Carl Kaelin, whom I have also worked with for decades on behalf of Bluegrass State veterans, for his ap-pointment to serve as chief of staff to the commander in chief. Carl and Brian will make quite a team. Kentucky and the Nation are grateful for their lead-ership and for their service. Brian has previously served the VFW as its junior vice commander in chief. He also served as the senior vice com-mander in chief. I know Brian is a huge hockey fan. So he will know what I mean when I say that his election as commander in chief makes quite a hat trick—to the benefit of Kentucky vet-erans and veterans across America. In Brian’s own words, the VFW is ‘‘an organization of doers’’ and ‘‘an organi-zation comprised of patriots.’’ Both of these descriptions aptly fit the VFW’s new chief. Under Brian’s leadership, I am sure the VFW will continue to pay it forward to every veteran who has raised his or her right hand and taken an oath to defend a nation dedicated to the preservation of life and liberty.

OBAMACARE Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, President Obama said something inter-esting just days before signing his namesake health takeover into law. In explaining the need for ObamaCare, here is what he said: 
[W]hat’s happening to your premiums? What’s happening to your co-payments? What’s happening to your deductible? They’re all going up. That’s money straight out of your pocket. So, the bottom line is this: The status quo on health care is simply unsustainable. 
‘‘Simply unsustainable’’ was the President’s view on the state of our health care system before ObamaCare. Here is his view on the health care sys-tem 6 years later: ‘‘Too many Ameri-cans still strain to pay for their physi-cian visits and prescriptions, cover their deductibles, or pay their monthly insurance bills; struggle to navigate a complex, sometimes bewildering sys-tem; and remain uninsured.’’ That is the President on the state of America’s health care law 6 years after ObamaCare. The President wrote this just last month. It sounds an awful lot like what we heard from him years ago, in the pre-ObamaCare world. It throws the reality of this partisan law into stark relief. It is not only that ObamaCare is failing to live up to the many promises invoked to sell it, but it is often making things worse. Just pick up any paper or turn on the news, and you will see that more trou-bling projections are rolling in when it comes to ObamaCare. In fact, each day seems to bring more forecasts of sky-rocketing premiums and dwindling choices. It is a trend hitting Americans across the country. For instance, here is the headline people in my home State recently awoke to: ‘‘Get ready to pay more for health insurance in Kentucky.’’ The story goes on to warn of ObamaCare premium rates that could skyrocket by as high as 47 percent. Nearly 160,000 people are expected to be impacted. Here is a letter from a man from Louisville who recently contacted my office. ‘‘How,’’ he asks, ‘‘are working class Americans, like myself, able to budget for such drastic changes?’’ ‘‘The so-called Affordable Care Act,’’ he said, ‘‘is unaffordable.’’ He and other Kentuckians are hardly alone in feeling this way. Take Illinois, where premiums could soar by as much as 55 percent; or Tennessee and Mon-tana, where some rates could sky-rocket by more than 60 percent; or Minnesota, where premiums could rise by an average of more than 50 percent. Minnesota’s Democratic Governor said he was ‘‘alarmed’’ by these ‘‘drastic in-creases’’ and called them ‘‘reason for very serious concerns.’’ Even my friend, the Democratic lead-er, referred to ObamaCare’s premium increases yesterday as ‘‘huge.’’ He is right. He was right to mention ObamaCare’s ‘‘tax increases’’ too. This partisan law raised taxes that hit the middle class after Democrats promised that it wouldn’t. So these huge premium increases aren’t the only reason ObamaCare is raising costs for the middle class. Pre-miums aren’t the only reason that Americans recently cited health costs as their No. 1 financial concern. It isn’t hard to see why Americans might be hurting. Taxes are up, copays are up, and deductibles are outpacing wages. Now, with more and more insurance companies pulling out of the ObamaCare State exchanges, Ameri-cans are being left with another big problem—fewer coverage options. The Obama administration used to promise us that the ObamaCare mar-ketplace would ‘‘provide more choice and control over health insurance op-tions’’ and result in ‘‘a significant in-crease in competition and an array of options for consumers everywhere.’’ That was the promise of ObamaCare. But that is not the reality for many Americans today. ObamaCare has forced out so many insurers that about one in five ObamaCare customers will be forced to find a new insurance com-pany this fall. More than half of the country could have two or fewer insur-ers to choose from in the exchanges next year, and about one-third of all counties in the United States, along with seven entire States, are set to have just a single insurer offering plans in their areas. That includes one coun-ty in Arizona that, until just last night, would have had no options in the exchange at all. I know this is some-thing that Senator MCCAINhas been deeply concerned about, and he has in-troduced good legislation to address it. ObamaCare co-ops continue to col-lapse at every turn, too, with less than one-third expected to offer plans next year. When these co-ops collapse, they can cost taxpayers millions and disrupt coverage for thousands of enrollees. They can force patients to start over on their deductibles midyear and even to find new doctors. These are the lat-est reverberating echoes of the Presi-dent’s most famous broken promise: ‘‘If you like your health care plan, you can keep it.’’ That was the President’s promise. Here is a Kentuckian from Campbellsburg, who wrote to me after losing his insurance: 
I lost my health insurance that I had for many years because of ObamaCare. Instead of something affordable, I face the possi-bility of struggling to purchase an Obama health plan that costs two to three times what I had been paying. 
To top it off, he said, the ‘‘process of trying to find coverage has been a nightmare.’’ Here is something to keep in mind when Democrats try to spin the Amer-ican people on ObamaCare. For all of this chaos and pain for middle-class families, ObamaCare still has not achieved its stated purpose of universal coverage—not even close. Tens of mil-lions still remain uninsured—tens of millions. And those who do have insur-ance are now discovering that simply having health insurance isn’t the same thing as having health coverage. They have insurance, but it isn’t the same thing as having health coverage. Take one New Jersey man who has suffered for years from chronic mi-graines and needs medication to help alleviate the pain. The moment ObamaCare placed him on Medicaid, he lost his access to each of his doctors, which meant waiting 4 months to see a new doctor and get a prescription for the medication he needs. He said: 
You have a card saying you have health in-surance, but if no doctors take it, it’s almost like having one of those fake IDs. Your medi-cation is all paid for, but if you can’t get the pills, it’s worthless.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5423 September 8, 2016 
According to a Gallup poll released just this morning, many more Ameri-cans report that ObamaCare has hurt rather than helped their families—and many more Americans say that ObamaCare will make their family’s health situation worse rather than bet-ter over the long run. Is it any wonder? Americans were told that ObamaCare would allow them to keep the health plans they liked. They couldn’t. Americans were told that ObamaCare would drive down health care premiums by $2,500 per family. It hasn’t. Americans were told that ObamaCare would not raise taxes on the middle class. It did. Americans were told that ObamaCare would in-crease choice and competition. The very opposite is proving true. And remember the promise that ‘‘if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor’’? It has been broken too. In fact, the Obama administration re-cently erased references to ‘‘keeping your doctor’’ from its Web site. These entirely predictable consequences are not just flukes or quirks of ObamaCare. They are not just small wrinkles in the system that will work themselves out with time. They represent fundamental flaws built into the law’s original de-sign. Republicans warned about ObamaCare’s consequences repeatedly from the very start. Democrats mocked us for doing so and rammed through their partisan law anyway. Every sin-gle Democrat in the Senate was needed to pass it, and they got every one of them. I invite Democrats to now consider following the lead of one of the Presi-dent’s own former health care advisers who recently penned an op-ed titled ‘‘How I was wrong about ObamaCare.’’ The problems Democrats caused for the middle class aren’t going away until ObamaCare does. So if Democrats are serious about helping the middle class, they will work with us to build a bridge beyond ObamaCare to better care. Anything else is just more hollow rhetoric. Today, 6 years on, ObamaCare is fail-ing the middle class, but the President still hasn’t offered a serious solution to fix it. He is now trying to convince Americans that the solution to his bloated, unwieldy, and expensive law is to make it more bloated, more un-wieldy, and more expensive. In other words, it is more of the same—more of the same, just worse. His preferred Presidential candidate says the same thing. So do congressional Democrats. How can anyone conclude, after read-ing all these stories about how ObamaCare is hurting the middle class, that what we need now is more ObamaCare in the form of a govern-ment-run plan? That is their solution now—more ObamaCare in the form of a government-run plan. Look, Democrats can continue to spin us on how great this law is. They can continue to tell Americans to ‘‘get over’’ this law and its pain for the mid-dle class. They can continue to laugh at Americans who lose their plans. They can continue to crow about ex-ploiting ‘‘the stupidity of the American voter’’ to push this partisan law on the middle class. Or they can work with us to move beyond the failed experiment of ObamaCare. They can prove that they are finally willing to put people before ideology. This much is clear: ObamaCare is a direct attack on the middle class. It hurts the very people it was designed to help. It raises costs, crushes choice, and is now crashing down around us. It simply isn’t working. To quote what President Obama said 6 years ago, ‘‘The bottom line is this: The status quo of health care is simply unsustainable.’’

REMEMBERING SEPTEMBER 11 Mr. REID. Mr. President, it seems it was just a few minutes ago, but it wasn’t; it was 15 years ago that, just a few feet from where I stand now, I went to a meeting. It was approaching 9 o’clock, and no one was in the room, S– 211. Senator Breaux from Louisiana walked in, and he said: Flip on the TV. And we did. We could see the tower had been hit in New York. We thought a plane had hit it by mistake. So we shut off the TV and Senator Daschle came in and started the meeting. In just a few minutes, some people came in and ushered Senator Daschle out of the meeting. He came back in quickly and said: The building has to be evacuated; there is a plane headed toward the Cap-itol. As we walked out of the room and looked out the window, we could all see the smoke billowing from the place we learned was the Pentagon. I will al-ways remember that. Of course I will. And, of course, we have learned since of the many heroes of that day—people running not away from danger but to-ward danger. On that day, I was first taken home. I had to rush back to the Capitol, through police barricades. Four Mem-bers of the leadership were helicoptered out of the Capitol to a se-cure location outside of DC. As the sun was going down, we came back to the Capitol steps. B
ARBARA MIKULSKI , the Senator from Maryland, who is known for giving dynamic speeches, didn’t give a speech that day. In front of this bipartisan group of Senators, she very simply said: I think what we should sing is ‘‘God Bless America.’’ We all did that. It was a beautiful rendition of all the varied voices of Senators, Repub-licans and Democrats, singing that song. We didn’t know what that meant—what tomorrow would bring— but that gave us some inspiration to think about how great our country is. The perpetrators sought to attack our democracy, our way of life, but they failed. The tragedy of that day re-minded every American of our collec-tive strength and resilience, led by George Bush who did such a remark-able job of rallying the Nation. We exhibited the best of ourselves in front of the world, and we resolved to degrade and destroy the terrorists re-sponsible. After many failed attempts and in spite of some people saying ‘‘Let’s wait,’’ President Obama said ‘‘Let’s do this.’’ And they killed Bin Laden. That was the right thing to do. It was a courageous move on behalf of President Obama but the right thing to do. He was ultimately brought to jus-tice. Today, 15 years later—I will always remember that experience a few feet from here, but we will all remember, in our own way, September 11, and in our own way honor the victims and the he-roes of that day and never forget. We are always stronger together when we are united. f 
OBAMACARE Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have trou-ble comprehending my friend the Re-publican leader—how he can, with a straight face, talk about how terrible America is today. Things are upside down; it is terrible. Remember, Obama was elected Presi-dent almost 8 years ago. That month, under the prior administration, for lots of reasons we have all talked about, our country lost 800,000 jobs in one month. That wasn’t the only month. Our unemployment rate shot up in places like the Presiding Officer’s and my State to more than 14 percent. Un-employment in America was raging. Major companies failed. I saw the Sec-retary of Treasury on his knees in the White House begging the Speaker of the House, N
ANCY PELOSI , for help. We joined together with President Bush. There was nothing partisan about what we did. Even though there were some small steps, we did our best to help the country. Since then, under the last 8 years of President Obama’s leadership, the country has been sig-nificantly turned in the right direc-tion. For my friend the Republican leader to parrot what Donald Trump is say-ing: ‘‘Make America great again’’— America is great right now. Unemploy-ment is less than 5 percent. Millions of jobs have been created in this adminis-tration—millions and millions of jobs— about 16 million. We have no ground troops, except in Afghanistan. They have been brought home, and rightfully so. To hear my friend the Republican leader talk about the awfulness of ObamaCare—you don’t have to have a long memory to know what it was like before ObamaCare. In-surance companies were canceling poli-cies, denying insurance, not writing in-surance because you are a woman, be-cause you had a prior disability. I don’t know if my friend is briefed by his of-fice, reads the newspapers, or watches

the news. Three days ago the word came out that the uninsured are at all-time lows in our country. Ninety-two percent of Americans have health in-surance. Is that bad? Is the insurance perfect? Of course it is not. We have 19 States led by Republican Governors who refuse to accept Medicaid. The Re-publican Governor from Nevada made the right choice, and it has been good for the State of Nevada. It is interesting that after more than 6 years, we still have never seen a plan by the Republicans and what they want to do other than vote against ObamaCare. ObamaCare has expanded coverage to millions of Americans. It has improved the quality of health in-surance. A lot of people who don’t like the plan don’t like it because they don’t think it is strong enough and they want to do more. The market-place will continue to connect Ameri-cans to quality, affordable health in-surance. I thought Republicans believed in the free enterprise system, and that is what we have with ObamaCare. The health insurance marketplace is so much better than pre-Affordable Care Act. They should stop trying to repeal ObamaCare and work with us to im-prove what we have. It is not going to go away. The Affordable Care Act has shown that it has had a positive impact on the stated goal of lowering the number of people without coverage. Millions of people have health insurance who didn’t before. He and other Republicans continue to come down to the floor and complain, although not as often as they used to because they have been embarrassed too many times. The Re-publican leader seems to think that things were better before Americans had coverage, including the 500,000 peo-ple in Kentucky who now have insur-ance because of ObamaCare. I guess he seems to be saying that he liked it bet-ter when insurance companies could deny coverage for any reason that they thought was appropriate; it didn’t have to be a good reason.

SUICIDE PREVENTION Mr. REID. Mr. President, September 10 is World Suicide Prevention Day. I had occasion to visit with our former colleague, Gordon Smith, a tremen-dously good Senator from the State of Oregon, while I was in Las Vegas a cou-ple of weeks ago. Even now we often speak—as we did in Las Vegas that evening—about our experience with those who have committed suicide. Gordon lost a son, I lost a father, and there are a small number of people here in this room today—if we could do an oral poll, we would find that many peo-ple in this room have been affected by suicide. Think about it. Each year, about 33,000 people commit suicide. That is a lot of people. It took me a while to ac-cept not feeling sorry for myself and to try to do something about it, and we have done some things here as a body about suicide. We really don’t understand it very well. For example, most suicides occur in the western part of the United States. I would have thought just the opposite. The West has bright, sunshiny skies, and the weather is a lot better than places like New York, but for some reason, west of the Mis-sissippi, we have a problem with sui-cide that doesn’t occur in other places. It is a national problem, and we have to do something about it. We have 33,000 people die every year, and those are the ones we know about. There are hunting accidents, car accidents, and hiking accidents that are really sui-cides but they are not acknowledged as such. From 1999 through 2014, the suicide rate in the United States increased by 24 percent, both men and women of all ages. Women are now becoming more equal to men in killing themselves. If we are going to actively address the increasing rate of suicides, we can’t ignore the role firearms play. Guns are the most common device men turn to when they commit suicide. That is ac-cording to the CDC and not some left-wing group the Republicans like to ha-rangue about. Almost 23,000 suicides were carried out with firearms in 2013— that is the last information that we have—which is 10 percent higher than 3 years earlier. We don’t really know what is hap-pening in the military. Twenty-two people in the military will kill them-selves today. It is mostly done after they have been honorably discharged from the military. We need to invest in evidence-based prevention. Young people are killing themselves. One of my wonderful staff members, my chief of staff—she is such a dear friend—comes from a large fam-ily of 10 children. One of her brothers is a medical doctor with twins. One of them hanged himself—an 11-year-old boy, dead. We have to have more science-based information, and we don’t have it. Mr. President, 33,000 people are dying each year as a result of self-inflicted inju-ries. I note with a degree of seriousness that September 10 is World Suicide Prevention Day. I hope we can all ac-knowledge this is something on which we need to work together. It is not a partisan issue; just ask Gordon Smith. It is not a partisan issue; just ask me. As I have indicated, many people who work in these wonderful buildings in the Capitol have been affected by sui-cide. Will the Chair announce the business of the day.

RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. R
OUNDS ). Under the previous order, the leadership time is reserved. WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2016 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will re-sume consideration of S. 2848, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (S. 2848) to provide for the conserva-tion and development of water and related resources, to authorize the Secretary of the Army to construct various projects for im-provements to rivers and harbors of the United States, and for other purposes. 
Pending: 
McConnell (for Inhofe) amendment No. 4979, in the nature of a substitute. Inhofe amendment No. 4980 (to Amendment No. 4979), to make a technical correction. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator Alaska. Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the bill we are debating, the Water Resources Development Act. I will begin by commending the chair-man of the EPW Committee, Senator I
NHOFE , and the ranking member, Sen-ator B
OXER , for their leadership on this legislation. Sometimes it is important to just look at what these bills are doing. The Water Resources Development Act— WRDA, we call it here—the title says: 
To provide for the conservation and devel-opment of water and related resources, to authorize the Secretary of the Army to con-struct various projects for improvements to rivers and harbors of the United States, and for other purposes. 
One of the things I have come to the floor of the Senate to speak on a num-ber of times is one of the most impor-tant things I think we should be doing in the Senate, and that is focusing on our economy. With all due respect to the minority leader with regard to the economy in the United States, things are not going well. Just over the past two quarters, we again had numbers that were dismal by any historical measure in the United States. Last quarter, I think we had 1.5 percent GDP growth, and the quarter before that, we had 0.8 percent GDP growth. As a matter of fact, President Obama will be the first President in U.S. his-tory who never hit 8 percent GDP growth in 1 year—never. No President has had such a dismal regard in terms of growing the economy. What should we be doing? First of all, we need to focus on the economy. One of the critical things we should be doing in the Congress—one of the things we need to unleash to the pri-vate sector is better infrastructure for this country. Again, I commend the chairman of the EPW Committee and the ranking member because they have been leaders on this issue. Last year, we passed the first long-term highway bill in many years with the FAST Act. That is infrastructure for the country. Right now, hopefully, the Senate will pass the WRDA bill. These aren’t perfect pieces of legisla-tion. No piece of legislation ever is. For example, I think both of them could

have had provisions that streamlined the permitting process to build bridges, roads, and ports. Right now in this country, it often takes years to cut through the redtape to get permission from the Federal Government to build infrastructure. We need to do a better job on that. But the FAST Act and now the WRDA bill are important bills. They are important bills to help us grow our economy, and that is why I am supporting the WRDA bill we are debating here on the floor. There are many provisions in this bill that are going to benefit different parts of the country. It will certainly benefit the State of Alaska. We are a young State. We are infrastructure poor, for sure, in terms of roads, ports, and harbors. One provision I wish to highlight is section 7106, the Small and Disadvan-taged Communities Grant Program. This is a new program that I had the opportunity to work on with my team, Senator I
NHOFE ’s team, Senator B
OXER ’s team, and Senator W ICKER . We are all focused on this issue. It stemmed from an important topic we were discussing. I know my colleague and friend, Sen-ator P
ETERS from Michigan, is going to talk about Flint, MI, and what hap-pened there and the topic of our aging infrastructure. I certainly respect his advocacy for his constituents on this topic. We have been talking about our aging infrastructure, but one topic we didn’t talk a lot about in the Senate— and I certainly tried to raise it a lot— is not just aging infrastructure, but how about the topic of no infrastruc-ture for communities in the United States? I know a lot of Americans don’t know this, but there are a lot of communities in our great Nation that have no clean water, no sewer, and no toilets that flush—entire communities in America. Think about that. They have no running water and no toilets that flush. They have what we call in Alaska honey buckets. Sounds sweet, of course, but it is not sweet; it is lit-erally American citizens having to haul their own waste from their house to a lagoon and dump it there. Can you believe that in America we have entire communities—in my State over 30— that have that problem? What this causes is often very high rates of dis-ease, such as skin disease, ear infec-tions, and sometimes at third-world disease rates. Again, this is happening in America. I think it is unacceptable, and I think most of my colleagues be-lieve it is unacceptable. It is not right. That is where the new provision, the Small and Disadvantaged Communities Grant Program, comes in as part of this bill. It prioritizes assistance to small communities throughout our country that don’t have basic drinking water or wastewater services. This is a 5-year program that is in the bill. It authorizes $1.4 billion to address what I think the vast majority of Americans would agree is an unacceptable condi-tion in certain communities through-out our great Nation. No American community should have to rely on honey buckets. No American commu-nity should have Third World disease rates because they don’t have water and sewer. So this WRDA bill is a serious start to address this issue. It is a significant challenge. It is not going to be ad-dressed overnight, but I think every-body in this Senate can agree we shouldn’t have communities of hun-dreds of people in our great Nation who don’t have basic services that the vast majority of Americans take for granted and assume that every community in our great country has, but we don’t. This is a good start to do what one Governor of Alaska put out as a vision and a goal, which is to put the honey bucket in a museum, and that is what we are going to try to do beginning with this program. I encourage my colleagues to support the WRDA bill that is being debated on the floor. I again wish to thank Chair-man INHOFE and Senator B OXER for their leadership on this important piece of legislation. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Michigan. Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Water Resources De-velopment Act, known as WRDA as well, which we are now considering and we expect to vote on next week. This bill will significantly reduce the threat of lead exposure and other drinking water contamination for our communities across the United States, and it will invest in our aging water in-frastructure. I am particularly pleased that language addressing the Flint water crisis—language I worked on with my colleagues Senator S
TABENOW , Senator I
NHOFE , Senator B OXER , and many others—is included in the WRDA bill before us. Their strong leadership has been invaluable, and I thank them for their efforts. WRDA provides resources that will improve drinking water infrastructure in Flint, MI, and other places where pipes, pumps, and treatment plants are crumbling and are woefully out of date. This bill also funds health care pro-grams for communities that have been affected by lead contamination. Also, all of the direct spending is fully paid for. Crafting this bill has been a con-structive process with input from many Senators. There are a number of new, smart policy changes that will vastly improve water quality and tack-le accessibility challenges. For exam-ple, this bill delivers funding for pro-grams that will reduce lead in drinking water, test for lead in schools and childcare facilities, and invest in new water technologies. WRDA also authorizes over $12 bil-lion for 29 Corps of Engineers projects in 18 States. These projects invest in ports and inland waterways, flood con-trol and hurricane protection, and the restoration of critical ecosystems. This worthy bill has earned the en-dorsements from a long list of critical stakeholders, and I appreciate the bi-partisan support that has made crafting and considering this bill such a collaborative process. While floor time for this measure is certainly long overdue, what really matters now is that we have an agree-ment to move forward. This is a fan-tastic opportunity to help millions of people all across our great country. We now have a pathway to success if we can move the final vote of this leg-islation next week. I urge my fellow Senators to show the American people we can continue to work together to address urgent needs across our coun-try, invest in critical infrastructure, and deliver much needed—and fully paid for—support for Flint families. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. NOMINATION OF MERRICK GARLAND  
Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise be-cause of three numbers—three simple but important numbers—100, 176, and 9. What do all of those have to do with the matter that I think should be be-fore us today? Well, it has been 176 days since President Obama did his job under the Constitution and nominated Chief Judge Merrick Garland of the DC Circuit Court, a consensus candidate, to our Nation’s highest Court following the untimely passing of Justice Scalia. We have, of course, 100 Senators whose challenge it is to find ways to work to-gether across the aisle and do our job and make progress for our country. It has also been 100 years that the U.S. Senate has had a Judiciary Com-mittee—a committee on which I have the honor of serving. In the 100 years we have had a Judiciary Committee in the U.S. Senate, we have never had this situation, where the President does his job under the Constitution and nomi-nates an eminently qualified jurist and the Senate Judiciary Committee re-fuses—just refuses—to conduct a hear-ing, to give a vote, to bring it to the floor, and to offer a final vote. Obviously, we have disagreements. We have disagreements in this body over principles and ideology. That is part of our job to come here rep-resenting our States and their different priorities and values. But to stead-fastly refuse for 176 days to even con-vene a hearing, to even begin the proc-ess to allow the American people to have some insight into the quality and caliber of the man nominated by our President strikes me as an unprece-dented refusal. It is the first time in a century that we have so blatantly had one group in this body refusing to pro-ceed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5426 September 8, 2016 
Our window for acting is closing be-cause in just a few weeks, on October 3, the Supreme Court’s new term begins. So the refusal to act and to fill the ninth vacant seat has now had a seri-ous ongoing impact on one term of the Supreme Court and now soon on a sec-ond term of the Supreme Court. We have never had a Supreme Court va-cancy go this long in modern history. In terms of the qualifications of the candidate, let’s just take a quick look at the public record so far. A bipartisan group of former Solici-tors General—the lawyers of the United States, the persons who rep-resent the United States in court and often before the Supreme Court—in-cluding Paul Clement, Ted Olson, and Ken Starr, have endorsed Judge Gar-land as ‘‘superbly qualified,’’ having ‘‘demonstrated the temperament, in-tellect, and experience to serve’’ on the Supreme Court. This is not a sharply divisive nominee who is pursuing a par-ticular ideological agenda. This is a well-regarded, well-respected, seasoned senior member of the Federal judici-ary. Top lawyers at 44 U.S. companies have written to the Senate calling Judge Garland ‘‘exceptionally well- qualified’’ and noting that a prolonged vacancy continues to leave important, even vital, business issues unresolved before the Court, giving them a lack of predictability and leading them to have to make decisions in the absence of clear guidance from the Court. Just yesterday my colleagues and I joined some of Judge Garland’s former law clerks in front of the Supreme Court. Sometimes when I have had the opportunity to review nominees for Federal judgeships, I like to hear from those who previously worked for them. In a letter to the Senate, a group of Judge Garland’s former clerks noted that ‘‘Chief Judge Garland deeply be-lieves that our system of justice works best when those who see things dif-ferently are able to work together, in a collegial manner, to arrive at a just re-sult.’’ Yesterday we heard again firsthand accounts from Judge Garland’s clerks of his wisdom, mentorship, decency, and commitment to justice. I wish we could follow the same approach in the Senate that Judge Garland’s clerks and other former coworkers said he fol-lowed in the Department of Justice, as a career prosecutor, and as a judge on the DC Circuit—an approach that fo-cuses on collegiality and success. I had the honor of meeting with Judge Garland on April 7. In addition to his truly impressive intellect and compelling and long judicial experi-ence, our conversation revealed to me a person of real character, good judg-ment, deep sensitivity, and thoughtful-ness. I wish I had the opportunity in front of a public hearing of the Judici-ary Committee to ask him similar questions that would allow my con-stituents, the President’s constituents, and other Members of this body to ask and answer important questions before the American people, before a com-mittee of this body, and before our col-leagues so that we could do our job and move forward. Yet we haven’t had this hearing—the hearing that the Amer-ican people so need and deserve. In May, my Democratic colleagues held a public meeting to try to further explore and air Judge Garland’s back-ground, where we heard from four es-teemed, significant, and experienced individuals deeply familiar with Judge Garland’s experience and character—a former court of appeals judge, a former U.S. attorney, a former Cabinet Sec-retary, and a U.S. law professor who clerked for Judge Garland. All four of them urged us to move forward and consider his nomination. Of those four, Judge Lewis’ testi-mony has particularly stuck with me. He was nominated by President George H.W. Bush in September of 1992, which, to the best of my recollection, was an election year. He was then confirmed by a Democratic-led Senate in October of 1992, less than a month before a hotly contested Presidential election. Judge Lewis previously came to testify in support of then-Judge Samuel Alito of the Third Circuit before his ele-vation to the Supreme Court. Judge Lewis warned us earlier this year in this meeting that what we are doing is not only deadlocking the Supreme Court, but it is diminishing it. Our system of justice, our Federal courts, and our constitutional order are one of America’s most precious as-sets. As a Member of the Foreign Rela-tions Committee, I have the honor of traveling to other countries to rep-resent our country, most often on bi-partisan delegations, where we urge them to follow our model. Sadly, in too many countries I have visited, they cannot depend upon their judiciary to be truly independent, to enforce the rule of law, to issue judgments that are in keeping with their laws, traditions, or, most importantly, their constitu-tion. That is why I am disappointed that we are engaging in this unprece-dented refusal to follow the rules, to follow the process of the Constitution and the Senate and to give this impor-tant nominee a hearing. That is why I am disappointed by Leader M
CCONNELL  and Chairman G
RASSLEY in their re-fusal to consider Judge Garland’s qualifications. It is my hope they will reconsider. In Chief Judge Garland’s nomination, President Obama fulfilled one of his most important constitutional respon-sibilities. Now all 100 Senators, on this 176th day that we are waiting to fill this 9th vacancy on the Supreme Court, must do our job and provide ap-propriate advice and possibly consent to the President’s nominee. The Senate has a valuable opportunity to show our constituents, the American people, and the world that even in the midst of a divisive Presidential campaign, our democratic and constitutional system still works. We cannot allow yearlong Supreme Court vacancies to become routine, and I am deeply concerned about the manner in which the Senate is conducting itself and the possibility that this unprecedented inaction will set a precedent for future vacancies and send a signal to the world that our constitutional order cannot still func-tion. I remain hopeful that my colleagues will give serious thought to the sys-temic consequences of what we are doing through our refusal to even hold a hearing on Judge Garland. It is long past time to put the good of our Nation and the Constitution above the politics of the day and to get to work on this confirmation. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The as-sistant Democratic leader. NOMINATION OF MERRICK GARLAND  
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleague from Dela-ware for joining me yesterday on the steps of the Supreme Court. We had law clerks who had served Judge Gar-land over the years who spoke in glow-ing terms about the man’s ability to serve. In fact, I have not heard any de-tractors or critics who have come for-ward to suggest that the President’s nominee is not a serious candidate for this job and one who would fill it with great competence. Here is the reality of what we face. This is the Executive Calendar, which is passed out every single day in the Senate. You will see it on the desks of many of my colleagues. In this publica-tion are nominations pending before the Senate. There are 27 Federal judi-cial nominees whose nominations are pending before the Senate. One nomination that might be of in-terest to those who are following this debate is a nomination that goes back to October of 2015 of Edward L. Stanton III, of Tennessee. Now, we know the way the process works is that Mr. Stanton’s name would not be on the calendar to be considered by the Sen-ate were it not for the support of both Senators from Tennessee—in this case, both Republican Senators of Ten-nessee. So we have a nomination to fill a vacancy on a Federal district court of Tennessee that has been approved by both Republican Senators and reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee in October of last year—almost 1 year ago. Obviously, a question must be raised. What is wrong with Mr. Stanton? What did he do? How did he get approved by both Senators and out of committee only to be sitting on the calendar for a year? What he did was he ran into a concerted, deliberate plan by Senate Republicans to stop filling judicial va-cancies under President Barack Obama. There are 26 like him who have been reported from the committee and sent to the calendar. Listen, here is the interesting part. Senator G
RASSLEY , the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has called a special meeting of the com-mittee today to take place right after

the first vote, right off the floor here. To do what? To add five more names to the calendar—five more nominees to the calendar. Why? Is there going to be one magic day when all 32 are going to fly out of the Senate by a handful of votes? Well, nobody said that is going to happen. Unfortunately, it means that for each of these nominees—starting with Mr. Stanton, 1 year ago—their lives are going to be on hold. They made a good-faith effort to step for-ward to serve the United States of America in the Federal judiciary. They submitted themselves to elaborate background checks by the FBI and other agencies, and then, when re-ported by the White House, they went through further background checks by the staff of the Senate Judiciary Com-mittee. Each of these individuals went through a hearing where, under oath, they were asked questions. Each of them, in many instances, was asked to present additional support materials for their nomination. They did it all. They did everything that was asked of them, and they sit on the calendar. What is this all about? Well, I would say Senator M
CCON-
NELL and Senate Republicans are not very veiled in concealing their strat-egy. They don’t want a Democratic President to fill a vacancy on the Fed-eral bench, despite the fact that the people of the United States chose President Barack Obama by an over-whelming margin, despite the fact that he continues to have the powers of of-fice. They want to thwart and stop that authority of the President to fill Fed-eral judicial vacancies. Their hope is that their favorite candidate, their be-loved nominee Donald Trump, will pick the next set of Federal judges. Can you imagine? What really is behind this is not just to give Mr. Trump his moment to pick the nominees and make nominations to pick the future members of the judici-ary but really to serve a specific polit-ical agenda. The Senate Republicans are afraid of what would happen to a Federal court system if independent ju-rists served. They want their friends instead. They want those who will lean in their direction when it comes to the important issues of corporate interests, Wall Street banks, and the Koch broth-ers. The courts mean an awful lot to companies and wealthy people, and they want to make sure the right peo-ple are sitting there making decisions when it comes to the future. So 27 nominees sit on the Senate cal-endar, and the Senate Republicans refuse to call them for a vote. Senator G
RASSLEY on the Senate Judiciary Committee wants to add five more to the list today. Why? Why are we doing this to these poor people, putting them through this charade of nomination when there is no intention to fill the vacancy? Incidentally, among the va-cancies currently pending on the Fed-eral judiciary—we are now up to 90 va-cancies across the United States—a third of them are in emergency situa-tions, which means that the courts cannot properly function because of the vacancies on the Federal bench. Despite this, the Senate Republicans refuse, being in control of the Senate, to call these names for consideration. They know they will pass. They are not controversial. They went through the committee, and they languish on the calendar because of this political deci-sion. I wish that were the worst example, but it is not. The worst example relates to the 176 days pending since the nomi-nation of Judge Merrick Garland, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. He has had his name before the Senate in nomination and has not been called for a hearing or a vote. Each of us, when we become a Sen-ator, walks down this aisle and over to the side where the Vice President of the United States administers an oath of office. We don’t take oaths lightly. For most of us, there are only a hand-ful of moments in our lifetime where we raise our hand and swear that we are going to do certain things. In this case, we stand there in the well of the Senate and swear to uphold the Con-stitution of the United States of Amer-ica. You might think it is a formal dec-laration—and it is—but it is also a meaningful declaration. This country was riven and also destroyed because of a dispute over our Constitution which led to a civil war. So we make certain, if you walk down this aisle and put up your hand over there, one hand on the Bible, one hand reaching to the heav-ens, taking an oath to uphold the Con-stitution, we are serious about it. Yet, when it comes to filling this Su-preme Court vacancy, the Constitution is explicit about our responsibility in the Senate. Article II, section 2, speaks to the President’s constitutional re-sponsibility—responsibility—to fill va-cancies on the U.S. Supreme Court. Why did the Founding Fathers make it a responsibility and a mandate? Be-cause they knew what would happen if vacancies on the Court could be used for political purposes, if leaving slots vacant on the Court advantaged one political party or the other. So they came forward and said: It is all about a full set of Justices and the President’s responsibility to nominate those who would fill the vacancies. The death of Antonin Scalia created a va-cancy. The Court across the street now has eight Justices. They have already been hamstrung by the fact that one Justice is missing and they were un-able to reach a decision in critical cases. So the President met his responsi-bility 176 days ago and sent the nomi-nation of Merrick Garland to be consid-ered by the Senate. I don’t use this term loosely. I have looked it up. I have researched it. I want to say ex-plicitly, the Senate of the United States of America has never, never in its history since the Judiciary Com-mittee has been in business, never once refused a Presidential nominee a hear-ing. It has never happened. Oh, I know, some of my critics on the other side will say: Well, if the shoe were on the other foot, if it were a Democratic Congress and a Republican lameduck President, you would do the same. Wrong. In recent memory, in re-cent history, when President Ronald Reagan was in the last year of his term and there was a vacancy on the Su-preme Court, he sent the nomination of Anthony Kennedy to a Democratic- controlled Senate, and instead of refus-ing to do our job, the Democratic Sen-ate approved Justice Anthony Ken-nedy, the Reagan nominee, in the last year of the Reagan Presidency. But Senator MITCH MCCONNELL and the Senate Republicans have said no. No, we are just not going to do it. We don’t care if the Constitution requires it. We don’t care if we have taken an oath to live up to the Constitution. We don’t care if it has never been done be-fore in the history of the Senate. We are going to stop this President from filling this Supreme Court vacancy be-cause our friends, our special interest groups, corporate interests, Wall Street banks, and the Koch brothers, don’t want to see an Obama nominee filling this vacancy. It is a shame. Merrick Garland is an extraordinarily gifted jurist. He is a son of Illinois—maybe I come to it with some prejudice—born in Chicago, raised in Lincolnwood, valedictorian of his high school, Niles West. He recently gave a graduation speech to that school. His father ran a small business. His mother worked as the director of vol-unteer services at Chicago’s Council for Jewish Elderly. Judge Merrick Garland is an intelligent man. He earned his un-dergraduate and law degrees from Har-vard, clerked for distinguished jurists Henry Friendly and William Brennan. He spent years in public service as a prosecutor at the Department of Jus-tice. He led the investigation of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. He served as a judge on the DC Circuit since 1997. Incidentally, he was confirmed by the Senate with a broad bipartisan vote for that position. Throughout his career, he has won praise from across the political spec-trum for his fairness, his brilliance, his work ethic, and his judgment. The American Bar Association took a look at this nominee and said: He is unani-mously ‘‘well qualified’’ to serve on the Supreme Court—unanimously. This is a man who has given decades of his life to public service, and the Senate Re-publicans will not even give him a hearing. They will not give him a mo-ment under oath to answer questions. The way the Senate Republican ma-jority has handled this Supreme Court vacancy is shameful. Since Justice Antonin Scalia’s untimely passing last February, the Supreme Court has had to operate with eight Justices. As

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5428 September 8, 2016 
President Ronald Reagan said back in 1987, ‘‘Every day that passes with the Supreme Court below full strength im-pairs the people’s business in that cru-cially important body.’’ During the last Supreme Court term, the Court was unable to reach a final decision on the merits seven times be-cause the Justices were deadlocked 4 to 4. Major legal questions have been left unresolved. On September 26, the Court will hold its first conference of its new term, still with only eight Justices, though the Senate has had plenty of time to fill a vacancy, but the Senate Republicans have refused to do their job. Unlike any other Senate in the his-tory of the United States, in the his-tory of this country, the Senate Repub-licans have refused a Presidential nominee to the Supreme Court a fair hearing—any hearing—and a vote. It is shameful. The Senate is now failing under the Constitution to do its job. The Senate Republicans, by design, are responsible. Judge Garland, the Supreme Court, and the American people deserve bet-ter. The Senate should give Merrick Garland a hearing and a vote. 
ZIKA VIRUS FUNDING  
Mr. President, when they write the history of this Republican-controlled Senate, they will surely note that we are a little over 2 weeks away from a deadline, when we were supposed to have a budget and appropriations bills, and we don’t have them. That has happened before. It is not the first time in recent memory. We have been tied up in knots before, but that is a reality. Despite promises to the contrary, we have not passed an ap-propriations bill. I might say in fair-ness, in defense, of the Senate Appro-priations Committee and the Repub-lican chairman, T
HADCOCHRAN , as well as the ranking Democrat, B
ARBARA MI-
KULSKI , we did our job. We held hearings on the important bills. They are ready for consideration on the floor. What has stopped their consideration is the Republican House of Representatives and Senator M
CCON-
NELL . The Republicans in the House just cannot reach an agreement. That is why John Boehner left. That is why P
AULRYAN’s hair is turning gray, try-ing to deal with a handful of tea party Republicans who would rather see the whole Congress grind to a halt and the government shut down. So when it comes to passing appro-priations and spending bills, there is not much to brag about on the Repub-lican side of the aisle. When it comes to the Zika virus in February, Presi-dent Obama said: Be careful. We have a public health crisis looming. This mos-quito we have discovered can cause ex-traordinary damage to pregnant women and to the babies they carry. So he asked us, in February of this year, 7 months ago, he asked us for $1.8 billion so they could stop the spread of this mosquito virus and start the re-search for a vaccine to protect every-one. He said it was an emergency. Obvi-ously, the Senate Republicans did not care. In May, we finally reached an agreement to a reduced amount, $1.1 billion, passed it out of the Senate. I believe the vote was 89 to 8, a strong bipartisan rollcall. Many of us breathed a sigh of relief. It was before the mosquito season real-ly got in full force in most of the coun-try. It looked like we were going to re-spond to the President’s call for emer-gency funding. Then what happened? It went over to the House of Representa-tives, and instead of taking the clean, bipartisan bill that passed the Senate, no, they decided they would embellish it with political poison pill riders. Lis-ten to one of them. They said women who were concerned about family plan-ning and their pregnancies because of this issue could not seek family coun-seling and women’s health care at Planned Parenthood clinics. Two mil-lion American women used those clin-ics last year. The Republicans are now saying: Sorry. As important and pop-ular as they may be, we are going to prohibit any money being spent for women to turn to these clinics for fam-ily planning advice because of the Zika virus. They went further. They took $500 million out of the Veterans’ Adminis-tration that was going to be used to process claims to get rid of the back-log. No, they will take $500 million away from that and put it into the Zika virus. Then, to add insult to in-jury, the Republicans in the House in-sisted on a provision that would allow them to display the Confederate flag at U.S. military cemeteries. What we had was a simple, straight-forward, clean bill to deal with the public health crisis turned into a polit-ical grab bag. They sent it over here knowing it would fall and it did, re-peatedly. Now the question is, whether Senator MCCONNELL and Senate Republicans will follow the lead of House Repub-lican Members who are telling them: Enough. Members from Florida—Con-gressman Y
OHO, for example—a Repub-lican Member says: Let’s clean up this bill and do something about Zika. Why is he saying that? Because the Centers for Disease Control has done something extraordinary, something I don’t think has ever been done before. They have warned Americans not to travel to parts of the United States, certain sec-tions of Florida, where the Zika mos-quito is showing up. Congressmen from Florida, including Republicans, have said: Enough of the political games. Pass the clean bill funding Zika. Senate Republicans refuse. They will not move forward on it. We are stuck, stuck with the situa-tion that we can cure and should cure on a bipartisan basis. My colleagues from Louisiana come to tell us about the terrible devasta-tion that has taken place in their State because of the flooding, national dis-aster, loss of life, damage to property. It is not the first time we have had a situation this serious—Katrina and others come to mind—but it is a re-minder, when it comes to natural dis-asters or public health disasters, for goodness’ sake, isn’t that where poli-tics should end and people should, on a bipartisan basis, set out to solve a problem instead of create a problem? So now it is up to Speaker RYANand it is up to Senator M
CCONNELL to show real leadership in the Senate. I know they are not going to back off on these judges. They have dug in real hard on those, but I would hope, when it comes to passing spending bills in a sensible fashion and funding our efforts to stop the spread of this Zika virus, that we will do something meaningful. They estimate, by the end of this year, one out of four people in Puerto Rico will have been infected by this virus. By the end of next year, it will be closer to 90 percent. It is a serious public health crisis. It is one we need to do something about. Ultimately, we need a vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control announced this week that they brought to a halt their efforts. They have run out of money. Now it is up to Congress. It is up to the Senate. It is up to the Republican leadership. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Minnesota. 
FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY  
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor once again on the topic of the vacant seat on our Su-preme Court. I would also echo Sen-ators D
URBIN ’s comments about the need to move immediately on the fund-ing on Zika. We of course passed some-thing here that had clear bipartisan support. Now we wait to get this done again and to not politicize this incred-ible public health threat. Today I am focusing my remarks on the damage to our system of govern-ance that is being done by leaving a seat open on our Nation’s highest Court. For years, we have seen some fraying of our democracy, the polariza-tion, but the citizens of America have always believed in an independent Su-preme Court. We have seen some polit-ical creep, as we know, into our judi-cial selection process. Nonetheless, the citizens of America have respected the rule of law. They continue to do that. When our Founding Fathers sat down to sketch out the framework of our Na-tion, they did not issue decrees. No, they set up a system of governance with three equal branches. The Fed-eralist Papers outline this balance of paper in detail. Alexander Hamilton once wrote about this balance. He wrote: 
The regular distribution of power into dis-tinct departments; the introduction of legis-lative balances and checks; the institution of courts composed of judges holding their of-fices during good behavior. . . . They are means, and powerful means, by which the excellences of republican government may be retained and its imperfections lessened or avoided.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5429 September 8, 2016 
Well, that is not going to happen if we have a Court that cannot fully func-tion. We have, in the most recent term, less cases brought up before the Court because we don’t have a full composite of Justices. We have had split deci-sions. Think back in time. What if we only had eight Justices and a 4-to-4 de-cision on Bush v. Gore or in the Mi-randa case or Brown v. Board of Edu-cation? Actually, an interesting fact is, the Brown decision may not have happened if it were not for the swift filling of a Supreme Court vacancy. Chief Justice Vincent died just before the reargu-ment of the case. By most accounts, the eight-person Court was split on the issue. Had this Senate refused to give Earl Warren a hearing and a vote, we would not have had the decision, but the Senate allowed for a vote and Chief Justice Warren was confirmed, the Brown decision was handed down, and our Nation has seen great progress to-ward equality as a result of that deci-sion. In fact, the process in the Senate for the last 100 years is that the Judiciary Committee holds hearings. In the few instances where they have not, that is because those nominees were con-firmed in 11 days or less. Since 1916, every nominee has been handled in that fashion. Justice Kagan has said the current Justices on the Court are doing everything they can to build a consensus and avoid a 4-to-4 split. While I appreciate that effort, that is just not how it is supposed to work. We want laws to rise or fall because the Supreme Court has decided them, not because of a 4-to-4 split. Look at the nominee we have. He is someone who has had broad support on both sides of the aisle. Senator H
ATCH  once came before this body and said he challenged everyone to come to the floor to say something negative about Judge Garland. Judge Garland oversaw both the Oklahoma City bombing case and the Unabomber case at nearly the same time. He earned a 76-to-23 vote in this Chamber for his last job, and he is someone who has routinely received positive comments from judges and commentators from the other side of the aisle who basically have acknowl-edged he is someone who looks for that common ground. I have no doubt he would excel in his hearing, but right now we are not going to know that. I just ask my colleagues: What are they afraid of? Are they afraid the citi-zens of America will be able to see this fine judge and how smart he is or how he answers questions? As my friend Senator A
NGUS KINGhas said, are they afraid they would like him too much? I do not understand why we simply cannot have a hearing. I had to put myself—I think, well, what would hap-pen if we had a Republican President and a Democratic Senate, what would I do? I have clearly thought this through, as a lawyer and as someone who is a member of the Judiciary Com-mittee, and know I would say we have to have a hearing because the Constitu-tion says our duty is to advise and con-sent. It doesn’t say advise and consent after a Presidential election or when-ever it is convenient. It says advise and consent. I am hopeful my colleagues are lis-tening to us, that they will find it within themselves to allow this great judge, this great jurist a hearing. I was there in the Rose Garden when Presi-dent Obama nominated him. I saw him tear up, and I thought to myself, not only is this a monumental moment in his own life, to be nominated for the highest Court of the land, but perhaps he was tearing up because he knew the burden he was carrying, one man, on his shoulders, the burden of carrying forward the American tradition of an independent judiciary, this simple con-cept that politics isn’t supposed to dic-tate our processes, that our Founding Fathers set out three co-equal branches of government. Our job in the Senate is to make sure the judiciary is funded so it can function, our job is to pass laws they then look at and apply when there are questions about those laws, and our job is to advise and con-sent on nominees to the Federal judici-ary. So let’s get our act together and do our job. I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. TRIBUTE TO PATTY WETTERLING  
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I wish to take just a few minutes to give a brief tribute to someone I know well, Patty Wetterling, and to her family. They are longtime Minnesota resi-dents. Patty and I know each other well. We actually ran against each other for the Senate in 2005, and out of that experience we came to be very good friends. Patty Wetterling is a woman of unbe-lievable courage. Her son Jacob was kidnapped at gunpoint 27 years ago. All that time she has kept the hope alive that he would be found. She knew it was a small hope, but, as we know, there have been cases in America where missing children are found 10 years, 20 years later, and that is what she was hoping for. This past week, those dreams were dashed, as a very evil man came for-ward to law enforcement—he was al-ready in captivity—and admitted to this crime and brought law enforce-ment to Jacob’s remains. The story, which I will not put on the record, is a horrific one, but I think the most poignant moment in this horrible story were Jacob’s last words, which were: What did I do wrong? This little boy did nothing wrong. He was an 11-year-old riding his bicycle in his town, in a very rural part of Stearns County, MN, where things are supposed to be safe. Well, they weren’t safe that day. The amazing part of this story is not only the memory of this little boy, but it is how for years Patty Wetterling and her family have turned their grief into action. Understandably, many people try to hang tight to their family. She has done that. She has been a great mom, but she went beyond that. She served on the board of directors of the Na-tional Center for Missing and Exploited Children. She has been a nationally recognized educator on child abduction and the sexual exploitation of children. She and her husband cofounded the Jacob Wetterling Resource Center to educate communities about child safe-ty issues and to prevent child exploi-tation and abduction. She served for more than 7 years as director of the Sexual Violence Prevention Program for the Minnesota Department of Health. She was named one of the ‘‘100 Most Influential Minnesotans of the Century’’ by one of our newspapers. She has kept this hope alive, but what is amazing about it is, she has saved other lives. A number of bills, legislation—including the sexual pred-ator registration—have come out of the work, better collaboration between local and Federal law enforcement. She has saved so many lives in Jacob’s memory. Senator FRANKEN and I are going to be putting a resolution on the record today on this topic, but I just wanted to take a moment personally to recog-nize Patty for her strength, her cour-age, and her grace.

REMEMBERING PHYLLIS SCHLAFLY  
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise to honor the first lady of the conservative movement. On Sunday, surrounded by her loving family, Phyllis Schlafly passed away. Few will ever match Phyllis’s conviction and tenacity. She literally stood on the frontlines, fight-ing against forces that threatened to upend families and sought to under-mine the Judeo-Christian values upon which our great Nation was founded. Without question, Phyllis Schlafly loved America. Her contributions to our country went far beyond her work exposing the illogic of liberalism. Phyl-lis led the charge to make the Repub-lican Party pro-life and defended the sanctity of marriage. She was a pas-sionate defender of U.S. sovereignty and championed Reagan’s policy of ‘‘peace through strength’’ during a cru-cial time in American history. The women and men of Eagle Forum, which she founded, are incredible patriots and grassroots activists who today, along with all of us, are mourning Phyllis’s passing. Our Nation continues to face many dangers, both foreign and domestic, and we need more individuals, more leaders such as Mrs. Schlafly, who are not afraid to stand and fight for the freedoms so richly bestowed upon us by our Creator. May she rest in peace. 
THE INTERNET  
Mr. President, today our country faces a threat to the Internet as we know it. In 22 short days, if Congress fails to act, the Obama administration intends to give away control of the Internet to an international body akin to the United Nations. I rise to discuss the significant, irrep-arable damage this proposed Internet giveaway could wreak not only on our Nation but on free speech across the world. So today I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me, along with Senators L
ANKFORD and L
EE, along with the Presiding Officer and his leadership, along with Con-gressman S
EAN DUFFY to stop the Obama administration from relin-quishing U.S. control of the Internet. Many have stood with us in both Chambers, and we are very grateful for Senators T
HUNE , GRASSLEY , BURR, COT-
TON, S ASSE, M ORAN , S ESSIONS , and R
UBIO, along with a number of our col-leagues in the House, including Con-gresswoman B
LACKBURN and Congress-men D
UFFY , BARTON , BRADY , BURGESS , C
ULBERSON , and F LORES . And I urge even more of my colleagues to come to-gether and stand united to stop the Obama administration’s Internet give-away. The Internet has been one of those transformational inventions that has changed how we communicate, how we do commerce, how we live our lives. For many, especially young people, it is hard to even imagine life before the Internet. Look at what the Internet has done. It has created an oasis of freedom for billions around the world. One of the great problems with some-one trying to start a business is what is known as the barrier to entry. What the Internet has done is dramatically reduce the barriers to entry for anyone who wants to be an entrepreneur. If you are a man or a woman or even a boy or a girl somewhere across the country or around the world and you have an idea, a service you want to sell or a good you want to make, you can put up a Web site, and instantly you have international marketing capac-ity. You have a portal to communicate with people. Anyone can go online and order whatever your good or service is. And between that and FedEx or UPS, you can ship it anywhere in the world. That is an extraordinary and trans-formational ability. That freedom of the Internet—that you don’t have to go and get anybody’s approval; you don’t have to go to a board for business authorization if you want to create a new business—is de-mocratizing in that effect. The Inter-net empowers those with nothing but hope and a dream to be able to achieve those ambitions. Right now the proposal of the Obama administration to give away control of the Internet poses a significant threat to our freedom, and it is one many Americans don’t know about. It is scheduled to go into effect on Sep-tember 30, 2016—22 days away, just over 3 weeks. What does it mean to give away con-trol of the Internet? From the very first days of the Internet, when it was developed here in America, the U.S. Government has maintained its core functions to ensure equal access to ev-eryone, with no censorship. The gov-ernment role isn’t to monitor what we say or censor what we say; it is simply to ensure that it works—that when you type in a Web site, it actually goes to that Web site and not somewhere else. Yet that can change. The Obama administration is, in-stead, pushing through a radical pro-posal to take control of Internet do-main names and give it to an inter-national organization—ICANN—which includes 162 foreign countries. If that proposal goes through, it will empower countries like Russia, like China, like Iran to be able to censor speech on the Internet—your speech. Countries like Russia and China and Iran are not our friends, and their interests are not our interests. Imagine searching the Internet and instead of seeing your standard search results, you see a disclaimer that the information you were searching for is censored—that it is not consistent with the standards of this new international body and does not meet their approval. If you are in China, that situation could well come with the threat of ar-rest for daring to merely search for such a thing that didn’t meet the ap-proval of the censors. Thankfully, that doesn’t happen in America. But giving control of the Internet to an inter-national body with Russia and China and Iran having power over it could lead to precisely that threat. And it is going to take Congress, acting affirma-tively, to stop this. If we look at the influence of foreign governments within ICANN, it should give us greater and greater concern. For example, ICANN’s former CEO, Fadi Chehade, left ICANN to lead a high-level working group for China’s World Internet Conference. Mr. Chehade’s decision to use his insider knowledge of how ICANN operates to help the Chinese Government and their conference is more than a little con-cerning. This is the person who was leading ICANN—the body we are being told to trust with our freedoms. Yet this man has gone to work for the China Internet conference, which has rightly been criticized for banning members of the press, such as the New York Times and the Washington Post. Even reporters we may fundamen-tally disagree with have a right to re-port and to say what they believe. Yet the World Internet Conference banned them. They said ‘‘We do not want these reporters here,’’ presumably because they don’t like what they are saying. That led Reporters Without Borders to demand an international boycott of the conference, calling China the ‘‘enemy of the Internet.’’ If China is the enemy of the Internet, do we want the enemy of the Internet having power over what we are allowed to say, what we are allowed to search for, what we are allowed to read on-line? Do we want China and Russia and Iran having the power to determine that if a Web site is unacceptable, it is taken down? I would note that once this transi-tion happens, there are serious indica-tions that ICANN intends to seek to flee U.S. jurisdiction and to flee U.S. laws. Indeed, earlier this summer ICANN held a global conference in Fin-land in which jurisdiction shopping was part of their agenda—trying to figure out which jurisdiction they should base control of the Internet out of around the globe. A representative of Iran is already on record stating: ‘‘[W]e should not take it [for] granted that jurisdic-tion is already agreed to be totally based on U.S. law.’’ Our enemies are not hiding what they intend to do. Not only is there a concern of censorship and foreign juris-diction stripping U.S. law from author-ity over the Internet, there are also real national security concerns. Con-gress has received no assurances from the Obama administration that the U.S. Government will continue to have exclusive ownership and control of the dot-gov and dot-mil top-level domains in perpetuity, which are vital to our national security. The Department of Defense, the Army, the Navy, the Air

Force and the Marines all use the dot- mil top-level domain. The White House, the CIA, the FBI, the Depart-ment of Homeland Security all use dot- gov. The only assurance ICANN has pro-vided the Federal Government regard-ing dot-gov and dot-mil is that ICANN will notify the government in the fu-ture if it decides to give dot-gov or dot- mil to another entity. So if someone is going to the IRS—or what you think is the IRS—and your comfort is that it is on a dot-gov Web site so you know it must be safe, you may instead find yourself victim of a foreign scam, a phishing scam or some other means of fraud, with no basic protections. Congress should not sit by and let this happen. Congress must not sit by and let censorship happen. Some de-fenders of the Obama proposal say: This is not about censorship; it is about handing control to a multistake-holder unit. They would never dream of censoring content on the Internet. Well, recently, leading technology companies in the United States— Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Microsoft reached an agreement with the European Union to remove ‘‘hate speech’’ from their online platforms within 24 hours. Giant U.S. corpora-tions are signing on with the govern-ment to say: We are going to help you censor speech that is deemed unaccept-able. By the way, we have seen that the definition of ‘‘hate speech’’ can be very malleable, depending upon what norms are trying to be enforced. For example, the Human Rights Campaign, which is active within ICANN, has featured the Family Research Institute, the Na-tional Corporation for Marriage, the American Center for Law and Justice, and other conservative and religious groups in a report entitled ‘‘The Export of Hate.’’ We are facing the real possibility of an international body having the abil-ity to censor political speech if it is contrary to the norms they intend to enforce. In their view it is hate to ex-press a view different from whatever prevailing orthodoxy is being enforced. It is one thing dealing with govern-ment organizations that try to stifle speech. That is profoundly inconsistent with who we are as Americans. But to hand over control of the Internet and to potentially muzzle everybody on the Internet is to ensure that what you say is only consistent with whatever is ap-proved by the powers that be, and that ought to frighten everyone. There is something we can do about that. Along with Congressman S
EAN D
UFFY in the House, I have introduced the Protecting Internet Freedom Act, which, if enacted, will stop the Inter-net transition and it will also ensure the U.S. Government keeps exclusive ownership and control of the dot-gov and dot-mil top-level domains. Our leg-islation is supported by 17 key groups around the country—advocacy groups, consumer groups—and it also has the formal endorsement of the House Free-dom Caucus. This should be an issue that brings us all together—Republicans, Demo-crats—all of us coming together. There are partisan issues that divide us. There always will be. We can have Re-publicans and Democrats argue until the cows come home about the top marginal tax rate, and that is a good and healthy debate to have. But when it comes to the Internet, when it comes to basic principles of freedom—letting people speak online without being censored—that ought to bring every one of us together. As Members of the legislative branch, Congress should stand united to rein in this President, to protect the constitu-tional authority expressly given to Congress to control disposition of prop-erty of the United States. To put the matter very simply: The Obama admin-istration does not have the authoriza-tion of Congress, and yet they are en-deavoring to give away this valuable, critical property—to give it away with no authorization of law. I would note that the government employees doing so are doing so in vio-lation of Federal law, and they risk personal liability in going forward con-trary to law. That ought to trouble all of us. Who in their right mind looks at the Internet and says: You know what we need? We need Russia to have more control over this. What is the thought process behind this, and what does it gain? What does it gain? When you look at the Internet, the Internet is working. The Internet works just fine. It lets us speak, it lets us operate, and it lets us engage in commerce. Why would this administration risk giving it up? Mr. President, when you and I were children, Jimmy Carter gave away the Panama Canal. He gave it away, even though Americans had built it. Ameri-cans had died building the Panama Canal, but he nonetheless gave it away. For some reason President Obama seems to want to embody the spirit of Jimmy Carter, and instead of giving away the Panama Canal, he wants to give away the Internet. We shouldn’t let him. The U.S. Constitution prohibits transferring government property to anyone without the authorization of Congress. Article IV, Section 3 of the Constitution explicitly requires con-gressional authorization. For several years now, Congress has also prohibited the administration from using any funds to ‘‘relinquish’’ control of the Internet. Yet, in typical lawless fashion, the Department of Commerce has been racing to prepare to relinquish control by September 30— directly violating Federal law and using taxpayer funding to do so. The administration’s continued contempt for the law and the Constitution, while, sadly, not surprising anymore, is par-ticularly dangerous here, as it is con-tempt in service of undermining Inter-net freedom for billions of people across the world. With the Federal Government main-taining supervision over ICANN and domain names, it means the First Amendment is protected. Other coun-tries don’t have First Amendment pro-tections. Other countries don’t protect free speech the way America does. And America does that for the world, pro-tecting free speech on the Internet by preventing the government from en-gaging in censorship. We shouldn’t muck it up. If the Obama administration jams this through, hands control of the Internet over to this international or-ganization, this United Nations-like unaccountable group, and they take it overseas, it is not like the next Presi-dent can magically snap his or her fin-gers and bring it back. Unscrambling those eggs may well not be possible. I suspect that is why the Obama admin-istration is trying to jam it through on September 30—to get it done in a way that the next President can’t undo it, that the Internet is lost for genera-tions to come. To stop the giveaway of our Internet freedom, Congress should act by con-tinuing and by strengthening the ap-propriations rider in the continuing resolution we will be considering this month and by preventing the Obama administration from giving away con-trol of the Internet. Next week I will be chairing a hear-ing on the harms to our freedom that come from the Obama administration’s proposal to give away the Internet. President Ronald Reagan stated: Freedom is never more than one genera-tion away from extinction. We didn’t pass it on to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children’s children what it was once like in the United States when men were free. 
I don’t want us to have to tell our children and our children’s children what it was once like when the Inter-net wasn’t censored, wasn’t in the con-trol of foreign governments. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come together, to stand together and ensure that we protect freedom of the Internet for generations to come. It is not too late to act. And I am encour-aged by the leadership of Members of both Houses of Congress who stand up and protect the freedom of the Internet going forward. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
ITT TECH AND THE GI BILL

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5432 September 8, 2016 
a college education. A college edu-cation opens doors, leads to a higher quality of life. A college education can boost our wages and our incomes. A college education is a first-class ticket to the middle class. We often talk about the young people in our communities who have made that dream a reality, and they may not have come from much. Their parents saved what they could. In many cases, they are the first in their family to go to college. They took out loans, they worked nights in many cases and on weekends, they hit the books. In many cases, they graduated with honors. They got good-paying jobs. They raised a family, and they planned to send their kids to college too. That is the dream we talk about, but for too many students across our country today, the dream of a college education has turned into a nightmare. I learned this week that 45,000 college students who were enrolled at a school called ITT Tech awoke and learned that their college was closed—not for a snow day, not for a holiday; ITT Tech closed its doors for good after years of questionable business practices and fi-nancial woes. Many of these 45,000 stu-dents are living a nightmare this week. They are scrambling to transfer to an-other school. They are hoping their credits will count elsewhere so they don’t have to start over again. They are scrambling to find out if they are eligible for debt forgiveness on their student loans. I rise today, though, to talk about a particular group of students who have been harmed by the sudden closure of ITT Tech—our Nation’s veterans and their families. Until this week, there were nearly 7,000 veterans enrolled at ITT Tech, using the post-9/11 GI bill to help finance their education. As a vet-eran myself of the Vietnam war, I know what it is to be eligible for the GI bill, which I and my generation were. While it was not as generous as this one today, nonetheless, it was a great lifesaver for me and a lot of other folks with whom I served. But the post-9/11 GI bill, while generous, is a finite ben-efit. It provides up to 36 months of tui-tion and housing benefits for veterans as well as members of their family. If the veteran doesn’t use their benefit, their spouse can. If their spouse doesn’t use the benefit, their dependent chil-dren may. It is an incredible benefit. But veteran students at ITT Tech have no recourse to get those GI tuition ben-efits back to put toward their studies at another college. The housing allowance that our vet-erans’ families have spent will come to an abrupt halt because they are no longer enrolled in classes. They have been robbed of their time and their hard-earned benefits, and, frankly, tax-payers have been robbed of their tax dollars. When I think about the men and women who volunteer to serve our country during a time of war, it is unfathomable that this is the position in which we could leave them—at a defunct college, without a plan to help them get their benefits back, and with-out a way to pay their rent or their mortgage next month. I think it is shameful. I also think enough is enough. Congress must act to protect our veterans in this instance, as we do in so many others. I don’t believe that all for-profit schools are bad actors. They aren’t. Some do a good job. But the poor edu-cational employment outcomes for stu-dents across this sector are undeniable. The damage ITT Tech has inflicted upon students and taxpayers is undeni-able. Let’s take a moment and look at the facts. ITT Tech is facing lawsuits by the Consumer Financial Protection Bu-reau, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and multiple State attor-neys general for illegal loan schemes, deceiving shareholders, and for decep-tive recruiting. ITT Tech’s accreditor recently found that the school ‘‘is not in compliance, and is unlikely to become in compli-ance’’ with accrediting standards. ITT Tech’s closure leaves taxpayers on the hook for a half billion dollars in closed school loan discharges—half a billion dollars. ITT Tech is one of the top recipients of post-9/11 GI bill dollars since 2009. ITT Tech did not use this massive tax-payer investment to provide a high- quality education to too many vet-erans. They used it for recruitment, they used those dollars for advertising and ultimately for profit. ITT Tech failed veterans and tax-payers for years. When they closed their doors this week, they left tax-payers and veterans and their families in the lurch. It is shameful. Again, enough is enough. The Department of Veterans Affairs must now work closely with the De-partment of Education to ensure that ITT Tech’s student veterans have the resources and guidance they need to transfer and continue their studies at a high-quality institution of higher learning. We in Congress have work to do too. I believe we have a particular responsibility to hold bad actors ac-countable and increase protection for veterans who plan on enrolling at for- profit schools that are under investiga-tion and heading for bankruptcy. For-profit schools, such as ITT Tech and Corinthian Colleges, which also suddenly collapsed last year, target veterans for their generous benefits that we as taxpayers provide for them, and those schools exploit something called the 90–10 loophole that allows for-profit schools to be 100 percent reli-ant on Federal taxpayer dollars—100 percent. Congress can take meaningful steps to protect veterans and their families, and chief among them would be closing this loophole. The 90–10 loophole has directly led to this ongoing nightmare for the student veterans at Corinthian, at ITT Tech, and at countless other schools failing to deliver on the prom-ise of a higher quality education. In conclusion, Congress must act. We must act to restore the dream of a high-quality college education for our Nation’s veterans. It is well past time to address this situation. Enough is enough. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Nevada. Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I rise today—— Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator will just yield for a moment. Mr. HELLER. I will yield. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Could the Senator give me some idea how long he will be? Mr. HELLER. About 5 minutes. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Nevada. Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Heller-Heinrich amend-ment No. 4981. Mr. President, with your experience in the West, you know water is the life-blood of our economy and culture. Without water, our communities can-not grow. Improving the rural water supply, their security, and economic development all goes hand in hand, which is why I have teamed up with my friend from New Mexico Senator H
EIN-
RICH to offer this western water amend-ment that will help ensure every drop of western water goes as far as it can. Our amendment simply ensures that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers im-plements its western water infrastruc-ture program as Congress intended. It will help advance projects like storm and sewer systems, water treatment plants, and delivery projects in Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming. It was first established in 1999. This program has been helpful to rural counties surrounded by Federal lands. Increasing the West’s water security is essential to the long-term economic competitiveness. I urge my colleagues to support this important bipartisan western initia-tive. Mr. President, I want to change top-ics and talk about something that is important to all of us; that is, Lake Tahoe. Mark Twain once said: ‘‘The Lake had a bewilderingly richness about it that enchanted the eye and held it with the stronger fascination.’’ Over the past year and a half, I have worked with my good friend from Okla-homa, Environment and Public Works Chairman J
IMINHOFE . I thank him for helping advance a longstanding pri-ority of mine—the Lake Tahoe Res-toration Act. This is a bill I cham-pioned in the House before I came to the Senate, and I am proud to be the lead sponsor of it in the Senate during the 114th Congress.

California colleagues Senators F EIN-
STEIN and B OXER , is focused on reduc-ing wildlife threats, improving water quality and clarity, improving public land management, and combating invasive species. Specifically, this bill invests $415 million into the Lake Tahoe Basin over the next 10 years. These important resources will address major issues that threaten the jewel of the Sierra’s economic and ecological health. That includes: helping prevent and manage the introduction of the quagga mussel and other harmful invasive species; prioritizing the im-portant fuel reduction projects that prevent catastrophic wildfire; and it advances storm water management and initiatives for transportation solutions that reduce congestion, minimize im-pact to the lake, and improve outdoor recreational activities. Collaborative efforts between Nevada and California, like the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act, are prime examples of what can be accomplished when we set our minds toward a common goal. Here in the 114th Congress, the first where I have been the lead sponsor, we are clos-er to enactment than ever before. The bill has advanced through committee in both the House and Senate for the first time in the same Congress. When it passed the Environment and Public Works Committee, it garnered unani-mous support among committee mem-bers for the first time. My hope is, when we finish consideration of this bill, the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act will have passed the full Senate for the first time in its legislative history. Before I conclude, I thank the chair-man for his leadership on infrastruc-ture and for teaming up with our dele-gations to preserve this lake. I am ap-preciative that the Environment and Public Works Committee moved our bill through the process, both as a standalone bill and part of the water resources bill in the past year. Like you, I know one of the core con-stitutional functions the Federal Gov-ernment is creating is the infrastruc-ture necessary to conduct commerce, trade, and allow for general transpor-tation. Infrastructure development is one of my top priorities in Congress and has been a top priority of this Chamber’s majority. It is important to note that we have successfully enacted important policies in this Congress to improve travel and infrastructure across our country but particularly here at Lake Tahoe. In July, the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act was enacted into law. This important legislation imple-mented important reforms that make U.S. air travel safer, more efficient, critical to Nevada’s tourism like Lake Tahoe. Last year we enacted the first long- term highway bill in nearly a decade— the Fixing America’s Surface Trans-portation Act. It is better known as the FAST Act. This bill is already advanc-ing a variety of important transpor-tation projects across our country. In fact, I secured a variety of provisions in that bill that will facilitate the de-velopment of new and innovative tran-sit, highway, and bridge projects spe-cifically in the Tahoe Basin, as well as a provision aimed at improving pedes-trian and cyclist safety. These trans-portation solutions improve mobility and outdoor recreation at the lake, while reducing the impacts transpor-tation has on water quality and clar-ity. Again, this week I stand with Chair-man I
NHOFE to advance yet another im-portant infrastructure bill—the Water Resources Development Act. This bill will strengthen our Nation’s infra-structure and mitigates flood risks, im-proves the route for movement of goods, and invests in aging infrastruc-ture for drinking water and waste-water. Initiatives such as these are impor-tant to maintaining public health, im-proving water security, and keeping our Nation competitive in the global market. I urge my colleagues to help preserve Lake Tahoe and other cher-ished places across our Nation so fu-ture generations can enjoy these nat-ural sceneries for generations to come. Let’s add another major infrastructure win for the 114th Congress—support for the Heller-Heinrich amendment, the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act, and the Water Resources Development Act of 2016. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Vermont. 
NOMINATION OF MERRICK GARLAND  
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, next month, on the first Monday in October, the Supreme Court will begin its new term. The question we have before us as Senators is whether there should be an empty seat on the dais when the Su-preme Court convenes. On the first Monday in October, we have always been accustomed to seeing all nine Justices there. For 7 months, the Court has been missing a Justice, and because of that vacancy, it has been repeatedly unable to serve as the final arbiter of the law. There have been eight Justices. There has been a vacancy most of this year. The President fulfilled his constitu-tional duty in nominating somebody. We have failed to do our constitutional duty of advice and consent. The uncer-tainty in the law has been harmful to businesses, law enforcement, and to families and children across the coun-try. It is a constitutional crisis. Worst of all, this constitutional crisis is wholly of the Senate Republicans’ making, and they have the power to stop this constitutional crisis. In February, the Republican leader claimed, because it was an election year, the Senate would somehow be justified in not doing its job in denying any consideration of the next Supreme Court nominee. Based on my conversa-tions with Vermonters across the polit-ical spectrum and in every poll taken on this issue, the American people re-ject this partisan justification. There is no election-year exception to Senators doing their jobs, there is no election-year exception to the President doing his job, and there is no election-year exception to the inde-pendent judiciary doing its job. Each branch of our government has its duty under the Constitution. The Repub-lican leadership has said the Senate is going to reject its duty. It will damage the function of our Supreme Court. That needs to stop. Since public confirmation hearings began in the Judiciary Committee for Supreme Court nominees a century ago, the Senate has never denied a nominee a hearing and a vote. The late Justice Scalia received a hearing 42 days after his nomination. Justice Ken-nedy, who was the last Justice con-firmed in a Presidential election year, received a hearing in the Judiciary Committee, which was under the con-trol of Democrats, just 14 days after President Reagan nominated him in a Presidential election year. The Demo-crats held a hearing in 14 days for this Republican nominee. Contrast that to Chief Judge Gar-land’s nomination that has been pend-ing for 176 days. It is a totally unprece-dented situation, and certainly that unprecedented delay has provided enough time for Senators and their staff to become familiar with his record in preparation for a hearing on debate. The press may be focused on what might happen in a lameduck session, but this Vermonter is focused on his job now. The time for the Senate to act on the Supreme Court nomination is now. We should have a hearing next week. The Judiciary Committee can debate and consider the nomination the following week, and then the full Senate can debate and vote on his con-firmation by the end of September. We have taken far less time in the past to confirm Supreme Court Justices, as the Senate has realized the urgency of hav-ing a Court at full strength. Chief Judge Garland is ideally suited to serve on the Supreme Court on day one. He is currently the chief judge on the DC Circuit, which is also known as the second highest court. He has been a Federal judge for nearly two decades. He has more Federal judicial experi-ence than any Supreme Court nominee in our Nation’s history. As a former Federal prosecutor, he has been praised for his work leading the Justice De-partment’s efforts on the ground in Oklahoma City in the days after the worst act of homegrown terrorism in our country’s history. Republicans and Democrats alike have recognized Chief Judge Garland as a brilliant, impartial judge with unwavering fidelity to the rule of law. Republicans serving in this body, as well as Democrats in this body, said so when they voted for his confirmation to the DC Circuit. Republicans should let this Chamber finally get to work on Chief Judge Gar-land’s nomination. Bring the Supreme Court back to full strength in time for

the first oral argument of October. Of all the challenges facing our country, ensuring that our Supreme Court can serve as high as its constitutional func-tion should not be one of them. This is a promise that Senate Republicans are making, but it is one they could easily solve this month. Let’s do our job. We took an oath to uphold the Constitution. Let’s show that when we raised our hand to swear to uphold the Constitution, we really meant it. The President fulfilled his oath; it is time for us to do our job and fulfill ours. I see my friend on the floor seeking recognition. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. F
ISCHER ). The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, we have a couple of votes coming up that are very significant, and the occupier of the chair is fully aware of it, having served on the committee that has worked on this legislation. I have to say one thing about the stuff we crank out of our Environment and Public Works Committee, and that is that it has been pretty significant. We had the FAST Act, the first high-way reauthorization bill in 17 years, which was a major one. Then we did the chemical bill, which was great, and now we are going to do the WRDA bill. One of the things that is interesting about it is the number of ports we are talking about. I often prided Tulsa as being the most inland port; however, it could conceivably be that Omaha may be giving us competition. Nonetheless, it gives you an idea of the significance of this legislation. Yesterday I talked about what would happen if this legislation doesn’t be-come a law this year. If that happens, 29 navigation, flood control, and envi-ronmental restoration projects will not happen. There will be no new Corps re-forms to let sponsors improve infra-structure at their own expense. There will be no FEMA assistance to States to rehabilitate unsafe dams. There will be no reforms to help communities ad-dress clean and safe drinking water in-frastructures, which is a serious prob-lem in my State of Oklahoma. There will be no deal on the coal ash, which has plagued the coal utilities for years with lawsuits. Finally, we have a very difficult issue that we have dealt with to most people’s satisfaction, and so we want to get this done in fast order, and today is a very important day in ac-complishing that. Here are some other reasons why the bill is so important. The bill gets us back to every 2 years. At one time when the first WRDA came out—and I was there when it happened—we were supposed to have a Water, Resources, and Development Act every 2 years, but then we started slipping. During the last 8 years, prior to our coming back as a majority, we really didn’t ad-dress this issue. This puts us back into our schedule of doing it every 2 years. These reforms can’t wait any longer. Secondly, we have recently been re-minded several times of the need for Corps projects. We saw the algae wash up on the beaches in Florida this sum-mer. The project that will fix Lake Okeechobee and prevent this problem in the future is in WRDA 2016. I generally don’t like everglades projects. In fact, I can remember—it wasn’t that many years ago—when I was the only one voting against the Everglades Restoration Act. However, let’s keep in mind that at that time there was not a chief report on it, and now that there is, we have something very significant that does affect that. This chart shows the algae blooms in St. Lucie, FL. This is a picture of the algae blooms, which were caused by de-teriorating water conditions. Not only are these blooms environmentally haz-ardous, but they are also economically debilitating to the communities living along south Florida’s working coast-line. Communities along the coast de-pend on clean, fresh waterflows to draw in tourism. As these blooms spread along the coast, economic development is negatively impacted. If we don’t au-thorize the Central Everglades Plan-ning Project, those communities will cease to exist. We also saw historic flooding in Baton Rouge, LA. There are two ongo-ing Corps projects that could have pre-vented much of the damage that we saw last month. WRDA 2016 directs the Corps to expedite the completion of these projects. This chart shows the Baton Rouge, LA, flooding. We can no longer use the ‘‘fix as it fails approach’’ as America’s flood protection. It is not about eco-nomic losses that communities face after a devastating flood; it is about loss of human lives. We are talking about human lives, and not acting is just not an option. Last year there were several colli-sions in the Houston Ship Channel be-cause of the design deficiency. The channel is too narrow, and the Coast Guard has declared it to be a pre-cautionary zone. This chart shows the Houston Ship Channel collision that happened in 2015. Without this bill, the navigation safety project to correct this issue will not move forward. The Corps of Engineers projects that these projects help generate $109 billion in annual economic development and generate $32 billion in revenue for the U.S. Treasury. Few understand the eco-nomic benefits associated with WRDA. As I noted yesterday, expansion of the Panama Canal is complete, now allow-ing the larger—I think they call them the post-Panamax boats—to pass through the canal. Look at the com-parison of the two vessels. This is what they can use today, and that is what is happening now. This chart shows the pre- and post- Panamax ships. By not passing this bill, many of the important deepening projects for our nations will go un-funded, making it difficult for them to accommodate new Panamax shipping vessels. One port that I pointed out yesterday was Charleston, SC. They have a 45- foot channel. With this bill, they will now be able to get to the 50- to 51-foot channel range that is necessary for this ship to be able to come in. The alter-native to that is going somewhere in the Caribbean so they can break down these loads and put them on smaller ships. That increases the costs dra-matically, and we are not going to allow that to happen. The investments in drinking water and other investments are important, but let’s not forget the fact that there are ports we can’t use right now be-cause they can’t accommodate the big ships. The investments in drinking water and wastewater infrastructure will benefit both public health and our economy. Earlier I mentioned that this is really significant for my State of Oklahoma. We have States that are not wealthy States and are primarily rural areas, and the unfunded mandates that come in are just unbearable. I say this from experience. I used to be mayor of a major city, Tulsa, OK, for a number of years. At that time our biggest prob-lem was unfunded mandates, and that is what we are separating from today. We can pretty much correct that with the changes we are making in our WRDA bill. A recent study by the Water Environ-ment Federation shows, just as this chart shows, that for every million dol-lars of Federal spending on drinking water and clean water infrastructure, we get $2.95 million in economic output for the U.S. economy. Due to the ripple effect through the economy, these in-vestments will result in new Federal tax revenues nearly equal to infra-structure investments. That is why we need to pass the WRDA bill now, and we have it in front of us today. It is a bill that will help protect America’s working people and has major eco-nomic benefits. The main reason I wanted to come to the floor—this is the second time that we have made this. It is not a mandate. It is just that the managers of this bill—that is Senator B
OXER from Cali-fornia, the leadership, and I—all agree that in order to finally get people to bring their amendments to the floor, we need to have a deadline, which will be noon tomorrow. We ask that you get your amendments down here this after-noon. We are talking about amend-ments to the managers’ package. We will not be able to consider those not in our package. That doesn’t mean we are shutting them off because next week we will have the opportunity to present some, but if you want to have them seriously considered, they need to be in our package. This should come as no surprise, as our committee had asked for any and all amendments in July, prior to the August recess, in preparation for consideration in Sep-tember. Last week, the Inhofe-Boxer substitute to S. 2848 was circulated, and our office stands ready to assist in any technical capacity in answering questions.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5435 September 8, 2016 
I have to say that Senator B OXER and I have worked very closely together. There are a lot of amendments that have come up and have been discussed. Some have been accepted, and others are being considered. Some are popular with Democrats but not Republicans, and the reverse is also true. This is our opportunity to do it. If Members are unable to make the noon deadline tomorrow for our man-agers’ package, we will still work to ensure that all amendments receive equal consideration as we work to clear as many amendments as possible and work to move amendments in regular order prior to the amendment-filing deadline for the underlying bill next week. We have the opportunity to do this. We are now operating on deadlines. It has been my experience in the Senate that until you have a deadline where you have to do it, people, generally speaking, find other things to do. We are going to hold their feet to the fire this time. Let’s try to get this through. Let me just comment on Senator B
OXER . We have worked on so many bills that are very meaningful to the American people. I can remember when they said on our side that we were not going to have a 5-year massive highway reauthorization bill. Yet I tried to ex-plain to my conservative friends that that is the conservative approach be-cause the only alternative to that is extensions. If you have extensions, that doesn’t work at all. We have worked very well together on that legislation, and of course we also were able to work on our chemical bill and do that, and now we are going to get this done next week. I wish to yield to Senator B
OXER and then retake the floor for the motions that will be necessary. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from California. Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I say to my colleague that I will speak for 30 seconds because I said a lot yesterday, and I agree with the Senator’s analysis of how important this bill is. I cer-tainly agree that we have shown this body that we can overcome our dif-ferences and bring important bills to the floor. This one is critical. My friend has gone into it in great detail. We are talking about clean drinking water, navigation, the economy, and how we need to move products in ports and so on. It just covers the gamut of issues that are so important. I think we have done it in a way that is fis-cally responsible. I am here to again associate myself with your remarks and also to call on my side if anybody has amendments. I don’t think our side has any more than the few that we have already started to work on. Look, we are trying to get this done quickly and trying to accom-modate everybody. I think most people agree that if Senator I
NHOFE and I can agree on something, then it is pretty much not controversial. I am here to lend my aye to the voice votes we are about to take, so I turn it back over to the chairman. Mr. INHOFE. I think Senator BOXER ’s side has done a better job of getting their amendments in than our side. In talking to her and the leader over there, the Democratic side is down to about seven amendments that are being considered. I encourage our Republicans to do the same thing and get this thing done so we can make it happen. I take this opportunity to thank the Senator from California for the hard work we have done together.

OBAMACARE  
Mr. M CCAIN. Madam President, over the last few weeks, my home State of Arizona has been thrust into the na-tional spotlight. I wish I could say it is because of the success of our sports teams or the strength of our univer-sities. Instead, it is because Arizona has become ground zero for the col-lapse of ObamaCare, leaving most of our citizens with limited choices and higher costs when it comes to the President’s signature health care law, which is a law that I fought against for weeks on end and which the then-ma-jority on the other side of the aisle, with 60 votes and without a single Re-publican vote and without a single Re-publican amendment, passed into law. In 2009 the President said: ‘‘[I]f you’ve got health insurance, you like your doctor, you like your plan—you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan. Nobody is talking about taking that away from you.’’ Let me repeat the words of the Presi-dent of the United States after, on a strict party-line basis, he passed ObamaCare: ‘‘[I]f you’ve got health in-surance, you like your doctor, you like your plan—you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan. Nobody is talking about taking that away from you.’’ That is a quote from the President of the United States when ObamaCare was passed. He also said that if you like your health insurance policy, you can keep your policy, period, in his own inimitable style. Ever since the passage of ObamaCare, Americans have been hit by broken promise after broken promise and met with higher costs, fewer choices, and poor quality of care. Let me read just a few of the most re-cent headlines addressing the collapse of ObamaCare in Arizona. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that relevant articles be print-ed in today’s R
ECORD . There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R

[From politico.com, Aug. 22, 2016] T
HECOUNTY OBAMACARE FORGOT  (By Rachana Pradhan) An Arizona county is poised to become an Obamacare ghost town because no insurer wants to sell exchange plans there. Aetna’s recent announcement that it would exit most of the states where it offers Obamacare plans leaves residents of Pinal County, Arizona, without any options to get subsidized health coverage next year, unless regulators scramble to find a carrier to fill the void between now and early October. About 9,700 people in Pinal signed up for Obamacare plans this year, according to ad-ministration data. The predicament of Pinal County is an ex-treme example of the contraction of insurers in the Obamacare markets expected in 2017. The federal health care law was supposed to offer a range of affordable health care plans through competition among private insurers. But that competition has dramatically de-clined in some states, as a result of pull-backs by national insurers and failed co-op plans. Decline in competition means fewer choices and, often, higher prices for con-sumers. Nearly 1 in 5 potential Obamacare cus-tomers may have just one insurer selling plans in their communities—up from just 2 percent of customers who had one option this year, according to the McKinsey Center for U.S. Health System Reform. But in Pinal County, a rural community within the Phoenix metropolitan area, many may lose health care coverage altogether. ‘‘If you have a several-hundred-dollar-a- month subsidy available and you lose that, that’s going to be huge,’’ said Thomas Schryer, director of the Pinal County Public Health Services District. He predicted that many Pinal residents would be unable to afford more costly insur-ance plans outside the Obamacare market-place and were likely to roll the dice and go without coverage—something that will be far more risky for those with chronic health problems or who are in the middle of treat-ments. Arizona’s Obamacare marketplace had pre-viously offered plans sold by national insur-ers like United-Health Group and Humana, as well as by a nonprofit co-op plan seeded with Obamacare loans. But the co-op col-lapsed, and United and Humana, like Aetna, are leaving the exchange. Other companies, like Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona, are scaling back their presence. ‘‘It’s a dramatic case of a more general thing: There are weaker markets that are going to be less attractive for carriers,’’ said Katherine Hempstead of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. It isn’t entirely clear why insurers are flee-ing this particular county, which had about an 18 percent poverty rate in 2014—higher than the roughly 15 percent for the country as a whole but not extreme. Median house-hold income was around $50,250, according to the Census. Yet there are higher rates of adult obesity, physical inactivity and teen births in Pinal County compared with statewide figures, ac-cording to data from the Robert Wood John-son Foundation. A shortage of health pro-viders is also acute, with only one primary care doctor for every 6,700 people. ‘‘The reason why it’s empty is because no-body wants to be there,’’ one insurance in-dustry source said of Pinal County. ‘‘The only thing a [regulator] can do is beg.’’ Although Pinal experienced a population boom in the 2000s, it doesn’t have much of an economic base, so most people work and likely receive their health care in nearby Phoenix, according to Arizona State Univer-sity professor Tom Rex. ‘‘The health care infrastructure often takes many years to catch up with the popu-lation,’’ said Schryer. Begging on behalf of Obamacare can be po-litically problematic in a red state like Ari-zona, where Obamacare has been a promi-nent feature of at least one reelection cam-paign in the current cycle. Sen. John McCain has made it a centerpiece of his bid for an-other term. Such was the case in Mississippi in 2013, when state Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney had to convince an insurer to offer plans in 36 counties that had no options ahead of the first open enrollment period. Chaney said federal regulators helped the state because it was ‘‘very unpopular’’ for a Republican to help recruit someone to cover the entire state. Humana eventually agreed to sell on the exchange in those counties, and it’s still there. ‘‘What we’re having to do now to keep companies in our state to cover all of the counties is to grant some pretty heavy rate increases,’’ Chaney said in a recent inter-view. Health policy experts say that Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona would be the most likely to sell plans in Pinal if regulators can coax it back. The company had offered plans in the county this year but decided to drop its offerings there, as well as in neighboring Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located, according to its 2017 rate filings. The company has said that in light of Aetna’s exit, it is re-evaluating where it will offer plans next year. But an agreement to return would likely come at a price. BCBS of Arizona had initially requested a rate in-crease of 65 percent on average for individual plans, when Maricopa and Pinal counties were part of its filing. When it dropped those counties, the company revised its proposed increase to 51 percent. Aetna initially submitted an 18 percent rate increase for its individual plans on the exchange. It later jacked up its requested rate increase to 86 percent, before pulling out entirely. Trish Riley, executive director of the Na-tional Academy for State Health Policy, said regulators have discretion in setting cov-erage rules but few things can be done quick-ly. Agreeing to look at rates again would offer an incentive to insurers to participate, she said. ‘‘What are your options?’’ she said of state regulators. ‘‘Disenfranchised consumers are going to sue you. People aren’t going to get coverage. Those aren’t good options.’’ In the long term, Riley said the recent spate of insurance company exits should spur a broader conversation about strategies to stabilize the exchanges. ‘‘I think this is a wake-up call,’’ she said. But state Insurance Department spokes-man Stephen Briggs offered a different per-spective, saying regulators ‘‘are not scram-bling’’ to find another company. He also dis-missed the notion that regulators might grant higher rate increases to an insurer if it agreed to serve Pinal. He said the depart-ment is still reviewing plan rates for 2017 and final rates would be released in September. ‘‘The decision to really offer a product is a business decision that the company still has the right to make,’’ he said.

RIZONA CONSUMERS FRET AS ‘OBAMACARE ’ I
NSURANCE OPTIONS DWINDLE  (By Ken Altucker) For many who buy their own health insur-ance, next year is shaping up to be a chal-lenging and financially painful year. Six major health insurers that sell plans directly to consumers are bowing out or scal-ing back on the Affordable Care Act market-place in Arizona. Only two marketplace insurers will remain in Arizona’s largest county, Maricopa Coun-ty, and the exodus has left Pinal County without a single insurer willing to offer a marketplace option next year to the nearly 10,000 people now enrolled. Federal and state officials caution that things could change between now and Nov. 1, the scheduled start of the three-month en-rollment period. They cite regulatory efforts to woo at least one Pinal County insurance provider. Arizona Department of Insurance officials do not expect to finalize the list of insurers until mid- to late September, said depart-ment spokesman Stephen Briggs.The state agency, which regulates the insurance mar-ket in Arizona, can’t say for certain at this point which plans will be available during enrollment. But six insurance companies already have announced plans or disclosed in state filings their intention to drop out or scale back marketplace coverage in 2017. Aetna, Health Choice Insurance Co., Humana and UnitedHealth Group will discontinue mar-ketplace plans in Arizona. Health Net will offer plans only in Pima County next year, according to state Department of Insurance filings. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona, Arizo-na’s health insurance mainstay, announced in June that steep financial losses had prompted it to stop selling marketplace plans in Maricopa and Pinal counties start-ing next year. The company had offered plans in every county since the Affordable Care Act marketplace launched in 2014. However, Blue Cross Blue Shield has since said it is reconsidering in the wake of Aetna’s exit. The trickle of insurers exiting—and rate- hike requests of as much as 122 percent for remaining insurers—is making consumers nervous. Some are taking step to prepare for what they fear could be delayed care and long trips to doctors’ offices and hospitals. ‘YOU’LL NEVER SEE A DOCTOR ’ Claburn Niven Jones, who owns a home in Scottsdale and a condo in the San Francisco Bay area, said the insurance shakeout has prompted him to take steps to relocate to California. The reason? The 63–year-old can-cer patient doesn’t think that there will be enough insurance and health-provider op-tions for Maricopa County residents next year. Diagnosed with prostate and thyroid can-cers, Jones envisions long waits for special-ists with crowded appointment calendars. He doesn’t want to take that chance. Enrollment figures show that more than 126,000 Maricopa County residents selected marketplace health plans offered by eight in-surance companies as of Feb. 1. Those mar-ketplace customers who seek to continue coverage will have only two options left by Jan. 1, 2017—Phoenix Health Plans Inc. and Cigna. ‘‘If you add them all up and throw them into a network, you’ll never see a doctor,’’ said Jones, a retired certified public ac-countant. ‘‘It’s going to be a health care dis-aster for the people of Phoenix.’’ Neither Phoenix Health Plans nor Cigna are willing to discuss proposed provider net-works until state and federal insurance regu-lators sign off on their plans for next year. Briggs said the state insurance department uses formulas to make sure there are enough doctors, labs and hospitals to handle the pro-jected number of customers. He acknowledged that the remaining insur-ers could face heavier customer loads after so many other insurers have dropped out or scaled back.

‘‘They do have to demonstrate their ability to—or lack thereof—to handle the (cus-tomers) in their network,’’ Briggs said. Jones has an insurance plan through a unit of UnitedHealth Group that will expire Dec. 31. UnitedHealth won’t offer an individual plan next year in Maricopa County. Jones said he began investigating other marketplace options even though he does not qualify for subsidized ACA coverage. He believes both Cigna and Phoenix Health Plans will be inundated with marketplace customers, and he said he can’t wait until Nov. 1 to find detailed information on the in-surers’ networks of doctors and hospitals. He will undergo proton radiation treat-ment this fall for his prostate cancer. He also needs regular appointments with an endocrinologist to monitor his thyroid can-cer, which requires periodic scans following an earlier surgery. Jones said he is preparing to establish full- time residency in California, where he owns a condominium in San Mateo. We moved to Arizona for a quality of life and (lower) expense,’’ said Niven. ‘‘I can’t get insurance, so I will have to leave.’’ Other Arizonans, too, are worried that Maricopa County’s narrowing options could pose challenges. North Scottsdale resident Jane Vesely, 62, has a Blue Cross Blue Shield plan that will expire at the end of this year. She wants a marketplace plan, but she worries that nei-ther Cigna nor Phoenix Health Plans will provide an in-network hospital near her house. Cigna’s current marketplace plans this year use its Connect network, which includes Banner Health hospitals and some specialty hospitals. The network does not include HonorHealth’s Scottsdale hospitals closest to Vesely’s home. The other marketplace plan, Phoenix Health Plans, is owned by the for-profit hos-pital chain Tenet Healthcare, It also does not contract with Scottsdale-based HonorHealth. It’s unclear if the Department of Insurance will ask the two plans to expand their exist-ing networks. Vesely long had access to hospitals, doc-tors and specialists near her home through her husband’s employer-provided health plan. Her husband retired in 2014 and is on Medicare. She has to wait more than two years before she’s eligible for the federal health program for those 65 and older. ‘‘The exchange was healthy (in 2014) and we made the decision that I don’t really have to go back to work,’’ said Vesely. Now she may need to get a job that offers health insurance due to the fraying marketplace. ‘‘I have a feeling there are a lot of people like me who may be in a similar position,’’ she said. 
FEDS SAY MARKETPLACE PLANS REMAIN  
AFFORDABLE FOR MOST  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released a report Wednesday high-lighting the affordability of marketplace plans for most people. Even if insurers raised rates by an average of 50 percent, 72 percent of Arizonans could buy health coverage next year for $100 or less each month, after tax credit subsidies are calculated, the report said. Tax credits are an Affordable Care Act tool used to offset the cost of monthly premiums for individuals who earn between 138 percent to 400 percent of the federal poverty level. More than 124,000 Arizonans who were en-rolled in a plan as of March 31 had received a tax credit. But another 55,000-plus resi-dents paid the full amount for marketplace plans, and they could face significant rate hikes next year. Phoenix Health Plans will seek to raise rates on marketplace plans by an average of 122 percent, while Cigna has requested a 19 percent increase. Blue Cross Blue Shield, ex-pected to be the only marketplace option in most rural Arizona counties, is seeking an average rate increase of 51 percent. The Department of Insurance is reviewing the proposed rate increases. However, it does not have the authority under state law to re-ject a rate increase. The state’s review can only determine whether an insurer’s rate change is reasonable or unreasonable. In the past, insurers have agreed to modify rate requests that state regulators deter-mined were unreasonable. There’s no guar-antee that insurers will do that this year, particularly with a majority of Arizona counties expected to have only one market-place insurer. ‘‘Even if we go back to a provider to say, ‘You haven’t demonstrated or justified the increase,’ they can say, ‘Well, we appreciate that. This is what we think we have to charge in order to not go bankrupt,’’’ Briggs said. While the HHS report emphasized the af-fordability of plans for those who qualify for health subsidies, it did not did not address the narrowing of health-care options in Ari-zona and other states. Ben Wakana, HHS’ deputy assistant sec-retary for public affairs, said it’s important to look at how the federal health law has transformed the insurance market. ‘‘Four years ago, companies in the indi-vidual market relied on a business model of largely denying coverage to people with pre- existing conditions,’’ Wakana said. He noted that the federal health-care law now forbids marketplace insurers from deny-ing coverage to the sick, and most people can buy coverage at subsidized rates, he said. ‘‘It has helped to get this country to the lowest uninsured rate on record,’’ he said.

BAMACARE CONSUMERS FACEHIGHER COSTS 
INFALL (By Keshia Butts) W
ASHINGTON .—When it comes to Obamacare in Arizona, not much is certain, but this much is: Coverage will still be avail-able, but it will cost more. Five insurance companies that had offered coverage in the Affordable Care Act market-place have told state regulators that they will opt out or scale back coverage when the next open season for Affordable Care Act coverage begins Nov. 1. There will still be coverage, but with fewer providers experts say costs will likely go up ‘‘much higher in 2017 than they had in the past couple of years.’’ A national estimate by the Kaiser Family Foundation predicts that premiums for one of the lower-costs plans could rise as much as 9 percent next year, compared to 2 percent this year. In Arizona, those higher premiums could hit more than 100,000 people. ‘‘The general trend is, as premiums are going up they are going up faster then cer-tainly consumers would like and even sup-porters of the law expected or hoped,’’ said Michael Cannon, the director of health pol-icy studies at the Cato Institute. Insurance companies had until Tuesday to let state regulators, and their customers, know whether they will still be offering cov-erage at all or scaling back plans when the next open enrollment period under the Af-fordable Care Act begins on Nov. 1. As of last week, five companies in Arizona had announced plans to pull out or pull back: Health Choice, United Healthcare, Humana, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona and Health Net. For the insurers, it’s a business decision: They are losing money on the policies they have offered in previous rounds of the Afford-able Care Act, better known as Obamacare. Jeff Stelnik, senior vice president of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona, said the com-pany lost $185 million on ACA plans in two years and expects to continue to see losses. ‘‘Our focus will be on our customers and finding the best way for them,’’ Stelnik said. Health Choice opted out of the Arizona marketplace for similar reasons, said Laura Waugh, the director of marketing and com-munications there. ‘‘The business and regulatory uncertain-ties that exist at this time with respect to the federal health insurance marketplace significantly impacted our decision to dis-continue our marketplace product offer-ings,’’ Waugh said in an emailed statement. The shifting marketplace was not unex-pected, as it is still a relatively new market, said Allen Gjersvig, director of navigator and enrollment services at the Arizona Alliance for Community Health Centers. But he said he also expects ‘‘as we go forward for some companies to expand coverage.’’ In the meantime, people looking for cov-erage in the next round of Obamacare, which runs from Nov. 1 to Jan. 31, should still have plenty of plans to choose from, analysts said. ‘‘In the key population areas of Arizona there is still going to be significant competi-tion so that people can choose among a vari-ety of plans, and that’s going to be very helpful to them,’’ said Ron Pollack, execu-tive director of Families USA. But they should brace for higher costs. ‘‘What we are seeing so far is that pre-miums are going up much higher in 2017 than they had in the past couple of years,’’ said Cynthia Cox, associate director of health re-form and private insurance at Kaiser Family Foundation. Cato’s Cannon said there are several rea-sons why premium prices are rising. ‘‘It requires people to buy more coverage than they did otherwise and it prevents in-surance companies from saying no to people who have pre-existing conditions,’’ Cannon said of Obamacare. ‘‘And then it encourages those with expensive illnesses to sign up for the most comprehensive plans.’’ But Pollack said that while premium prices will increase, so will the federal sub-sidies many consumers get to help them pay for their coverage. ‘‘Even if somebody’s premiums are some-what higher than they were before, their subsidies will be somewhat higher than they were before and the ultimate thing that a consumer cares about is how much do I have to pay out of pocket,’’ Pollack said.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5438 September 8, 2016 
The Arizona Republic, June 14, 2016: ‘‘Insurers seek rate hikes for ACA plans.’’ Come November 1, this will be the re-ality for hundreds of thousands of hard-working Arizonans currently en-rolled in ObamaCare. Already, UnitedHealth, Humana, Health Choice Insurance Co., Aetna, and now Phoenix Health Plan have all announced they are exiting Arizona’s marketplace. Up until late last night, Arizona had the dubious distinction of being home to the only county in America without a single health insurance provider of-fering plans in 2017. While I am pleased that Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona decided to step in to save Pinal County from having no choices in the Federal marketplace, there is no reason to be-lieve this is an economically viable or sustainable end result. The fact re-mains that this is a far cry from what President Obama promised before and after signing his signature health care reform bill into law. The mass exodus of health insurers from the ObamaCare marketplace should come as no surprise to anyone. Over the last few years, these providers have reported massive financial losses as a result of their participation in the Federal exchanges. UnitedHealth, for example, recently projected to lose well over $1 billion as a result of the poorly constructed ObamaCare mar-ketplace. For the insurers who con-tinue to participate in the exchanges, their only option is to raise premium rates astronomically high in order to cover their losses. In fact, one of the insurers in Arizona, in Maricopa Coun-ty, said they are going to ask for a 65- percent rate increase. Copays are going up into the thousands of dollars. What is clear is that ObamaCare is crumbling and Arizonans are being left to pick up the pieces. Let me direct the attention of my colleagues to this map. As we can see, as it stands today, 14 of Arizona’s 15 counties will have a single—that is one—a single health insurer to shop for coverage when open enrollment begins on November 1. That includes Maricopa County, Arizona’s most populous coun-ty, impacting more than 120,000 of my fellow citizens. This is down from the eight health insurance options Mari-copa County residents had in 2016. Let me repeat that. In 2016, they had eight health insurers to choose from. Guess what they are going to have in 2017. One, along with every other county in Arizona, with one exception that will have two. As we can see, none have three. Up until yesterday, Pinal Coun-ty was in the red. Worse still, of those 14 counties, 13 Arizona counties will see their premiums increase on average by 51 percent. Thirteen of these coun-ties will see their premiums increase on average by 51 percent. For some families, this could mean thousands of dollars per month out of their pay-checks. I doubt that their standard of living and their pay has increased suffi-ciently to cover a 51-percent increase in their premiums. That is why Cynthia Cox, associate director of health reform and private insurance at the Kaiser Family Foun-dation, recently stated: 
In most other parts of the country, large cities like Phoenix have multiple insurers participating in them. Arizona is by far the most affected state when it comes to these exits. 
For a law that President Obama said would bring ‘‘[more] choice, more com-petition [and] real health care secu-rity,’’ ObamaCare has delivered noth-ing more than empty promises. Today, thousands of my fellow citi-zens are asking ‘‘What happens if the only plan being offered in my county doesn’t cover my current doctor or the coverage is insufficient for my family’s needs?’’ or ‘‘Should I purchase health insurance at all, given all the upheaval in the market?’’ Well, when crafting this law, Presi-dent Obama and congressional Demo-crats thought it would be a good idea to penalize those people who don’t en-roll by forcing them to pay a fine—to pay a fine if they didn’t enroll. Put simply, if you don’t enroll, you pay a fine. If there is a monopoly in a given county with no competition, you are penalized. Being forced to choose between a much more expensive plan and paying a fine is unconscionable. In other words, they have two choices: not ac-cepting the one plan or paying a fine. That is unconscionable. That is why yesterday I joined Senators C
OTTON , S
ASSE, FLAKE , JOHNSON , and B ARRASSO  in introducing legislation that would protect individuals living in a county with no competition in the Federal marketplace from having to pay a pen-alty. These Americans should not be forced to bear the burdens of a health care system that was fatally flawed from conception. The collapse of ObamaCare in Ari-zona and across the country confirms what Republicans have warned about all along: Government-mandated health care is unsustainable. Now that the law is unraveling, it is no surprise that Democrats are clamoring for a so- called ‘‘public option’’ that is nothing more than government-run health care. If anything is clear about this failed law, it is that more government inter-vention is the wrong solution to fixing our health care system. This failed law will only continue to place undue burdens on Arizona fami-lies unless we repeal and replace ObamaCare with real reform that en-courages competition and empowers patients to make their own health care decisions. I will continue to push for this bill with Senator P
ERDUE that would do just that—replace ObamaCare with commonsense solutions that empower patients and doctors, not the govern-ment, to take back control of their health care. Until then, hard-working Americans will continue to bear the consequences of a failed ObamaCare. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a colloquy with the Senator from Wyoming. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MCCAIN. I see my friend Dr. B AR-
RASSO . I would ask Dr. B ARRASSO , what happens to average citizens when, as is the case in my State, all but one coun-ty only have one option, one health care provider? What happens then? Mr. BARRASSO. Well, it is so inter-esting that the Senator would bring this up because the entire State of Wy-oming has found itself in exactly the same situation where there is only one choice. Remember, the President prom-ised a marketplace. What the Amer-ican people have gotten is a monopoly. In one-third of all the counties in the country, they are down to a single— and it is not really a choice; it is a take-it-or-leave-it situation. I call all of these places falling into what is called the ‘‘ObamaCare wasteland.’’ It is unfortunate to see it happening in county after county. I know you have been talking about the headlines: 31 percent, one in three counties, one choice. That is not what the President promised. One broken promise after another. I don’t know if you saw the most re-cent polling today out from Gallup. It said a couple of things: The number of people who disapprove of the health care has gone up and the number who approve has dropped. The headlines are telling the true story about how bad this is. People are finally seeing the truth, in spite of all the things the Obama administration and the Demo-crats who passed these things have been saying for a number of years. Mr. M
CCAIN. If I could ask another question, and that is, we see—and it is well publicized—the increases in pre-miums. For example, in Maricopa County, the health care provider re-maining is asking for 65 percent in-creases in premiums, but what about the copays? In other words, isn’t it hard for Americans to understand why they would literally pay thousands of dollars before they would be eligible to receive the care? Mr. BARRASSO. Well, that is it. The deductibles and the copays are one of the reasons that people are saying they are disapproving of the health care law. The premiums have continued to go up, but on top of that, even if you get a subsidy that President Obama says is helpful, it doesn’t touch it that first time or the second or the 5,000th be-cause people, before they actually get to use the so-called insurance, have to come up with, for families, sometimes up to $10,000 out of their own pocket before that. So the insurance is not really useful. It is interesting when we listen to the President say they have coverage— but not if they can’t get care. It is use-less coverage. It is empty coverage. It is not what people want, which is af-fordable care. Mr. M
CCAIN. So if you are an aver-age citizen and you see your deductible at a couple thousand dollars, it seems

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5439 September 8, 2016 
to me that your only other option real-ly is to go to the emergency room, the most expensive form of health care. Mr. BARRASSO. That is very often the case, and we are seeing more and more of that across the country. Emer-gency room doctors are saying they are swamped. The President says that when they get ObamaCare, they will find family doctors. That is not what is happening. What is happening is the emergency rooms are being more and more in-cluded and involved, and that is where patients are turning today, which is why the Gallup poll today says 29 per-cent of Americans say they have per-sonally been hurt by the health care law, and this may also be true in Ari-zona, or worse. So to help people who didn’t have insurance, the President and the Democrats and those who voted for this bill should never have had to hurt so many Americans, and today about one in three Americans says they have been personally hurt by this law. Those are the numbers that are out today. Mr. M
CCAIN. So at the next townhall meeting you or I have, somebody is going to stand up and say: OK, ObamaCare has failed, Senator B
AR-
RASSO , or Senator M CCAIN. What is the answer? Mr. BARRASSO. Senator G
RAHAM  from South Carolina and I introduced a bill called the Health Care Choice Act to let the States have much more of a say in this. The State Health Care Choice Act provides freedom, flexi-bility, choice. So much of the reason prices have gone up so high is, the President has decided what kind of in-surance people need to buy instead of letting the people themselves decide what they need, what is best for them and their families. I have gotten let-ters, and I know you have as well, where families had insurance that worked for them, but it wasn’t good enough for President Obama because he feels he knows better than the people know about themselves and their fami-lies. We want to provide the freedom and the flexibility of choice to let States decide whether they want to comply with the mandates of ObamaCare. States have much more involvement than Washington’s one-size-fits-all that I know sure doesn’t work for Wyoming and I suspect doesn’t work in Arizona either. Mr. M
CCAIN. In a townhall meeting, someone will stand up in Cody or Tuc-son and say: Senator M
CCAIN, the cost of my prescription drugs has gone up 100 percent, 200 percent or whatever. How do we answer people who literally can no longer afford, in some cases, lifesaving prescription drugs? Mr. BARRASSO. ObamaCare has ac-tually made that worse because if you take a look at the numbers in the deductibles and copays, people who get insurance through ObamaCare have found out in the last several years that they have paid twice as much out of pocket for prescription drugs as people who got insurance through work be-cause at work the copays are lower, the deductibles are lower, and there is cov-erage for medications which are expen-sive because of medical breakthroughs. The life expectancy of human beings continues to go up because of the ad-vances in medicine and technology. All of these advances have been very help-ful for us as citizens of this country and as people living on this planet, but the costs are there, and with ObamaCare we are finding that those people who have to get prescriptions filled through ObamaCare are paying over twice as much as what people are paying who get insurance through work, which is why we need to get away from ObamaCare and repeal it and replace it with patient-centered care, which we are not getting under the ObamaCare law. Mr. MCCAIN. It seems to me that as we debated for weeks on the floor of the Senate, the fundamental premise of ObamaCare was to take money from healthy young Americans in order to pay for the health care needs of older, not so well Americans. We are seeing a lot of young Americans who are saying: I would rather pay the fine. I would rather pay the fine. So the estimates of those who would be enrolled is roughly half of what the Congressional Budget Office predicted would be enrolled. Ob-viously, this has a huge effect on the whole ability of health care, ObamaCare, to care for these people. Mr. BARRASSO. That was the front page story in the Washington Post on Sunday, August 28, ‘‘Health Exchange Sign-Ups Fall Short.’’ The Congressional Budget Office ex-pected 24 million people to sign up, and less than 11 million have signed up. So less than half of the people they pre-dicted would sign up have done so, and the reason is, so many people looked at it and didn’t sign up. Why don’t people sign up? Because they believe it is a bad deal for them personally. They looked at the high copays, the high deductibles, as the Senator from Ari-zona made reference to, and the high premiums. They decided it was cheaper to pay a fine than to buy the insurance. They find they cannot use it anyway because the deductibles and copays are so high. Mr. M
CCAIN. If you are a young per-son and you have paid the fine and then you get in an automobile accident on the way to the hospital, wouldn’t you want to sign up for ObamaCare? Mr. BARRASSO. Interestingly enough, President Obama has made it pretty easy to do that. What we found in watching some of these testimonies from around the country, in one State, you had over 250 people who signed up, got treatment, over $100,000 worth of treatment, and then dropped the insur-ance. They are gaming the system left and right because that is the way President Obama has it set up. Look, it was written behind closed doors in the office of the then-majority leader, HARRY REID, but because it has become such a disaster, the Democrats have lost the majority and are now in the minority because so many people are bothered by the way the President and the believers in his process have said: It is all right. We have the votes. We are going to do it. We are not going to listen to Republicans. We are not going to listen to doctors who have practiced medicine their whole lives. We know what is better for the Amer-ican people. That is exactly what we have happening. That is why so many people are saying: It is not a good deal for me. I don’t want any part of it. Now we see this Gallup poll where 49 per-cent of Americans believe this health care law has hurt them personally. Today we are seeing that a greater number of Americans believe this law is going to hurt health care for them and their families into the future. So that is not a good projection about what we need as Americans in a time when we have more people who are liv-ing longer and older and want to lead healthier lives. Mr. M
CCAIN. I would like to say to Dr. B
ARRASSO that I have appreciated your leadership on this issue, and your knowledge and background, frankly, ever since ObamaCare was passed. The Senator has been very helpful to people such as I as we have gone through this odyssey, where the President had said there would be more choice, more com-petition, and real health care security. He also said, by the way—I think you might recall it, in his own inimitable style, saying: If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan, period. Remember the ‘‘pe-riod’’ he added to the comment? So I thank the Senator, and I want to assure the citizens of Arizona that I will do everything in my power to re-peal and replace ObamaCare, which is causing so much harm to the people of my State. It is unconscionable, unnec-essary, and I would have it as one of my highest priorities. I thank Dr. B
ARRASSO and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Florida. Mr. R
UBIO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to speak as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (The remarks of Mr. R

I thank him for his diligence in trying to get to a solution.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5440 September 8, 2016 
We are so close. We did pass some-thing in the Senate. The House passed something a little different. It is time for us to figure out how to resolve these relatively small differences and provide the help that is needed. This is an emergency. It is a medical emer-gency. I was on the floor yesterday speaking about another emergency, which is the opioid issue and the heroin and prescription drug addiction and now fentanyl addiction issue that is facing Ohio and so many other States in this country. So these are both issues that I hope Congress will act on as part of the process of being sure the government is funded at the year’s end. Again, I commend my colleague from Florida, Senator R
UBIO, for his good work on this. Again, Madam President, what I want to talk about is a tax increase that is actually in the Affordable Care Act. This is a tax increase that many people don’t know about, but sadly it goes into effect at year’s end, and it is going to affect a lot of middle-income seniors in Ohio and around the coun-try. There are millions of seniors who are potentially vulnerable to this tax increase. Some of them don’t even know about it. By the way, it comes at a time when middle-class families all around this country are feeling squeezed. It is those very middle-class families who are going to be hit hardest by this tax increase. Let’s face it. Wages are flat, even declining, on average, when you take inflation into account; whereas, the cost of living has gone up, hasn’t it. There are a number of factors to that. Electricity costs have gone up in my home State of Ohio by about 25 per-cent in the last several years, for in-stance. But with regard to health care costs, there is no question that everybody is experiencing an increase—families, small businesses, seniors. The Presi-dent’s health care law, the Affordable Care Act, of course, was advertised as helping on that. The notion was, as was explained at the time, that there would be about a $2,500-per-family decrease in the cost of health care premiums. That has not happened. In fact, costs have skyrocketed to the point that for many people it is their biggest cost increase and they simply cannot afford health care cov-erage. It was supposed to bend the cost curve and bring health care costs down, but it simply hasn’t. The Ohio Depart-ment of Insurance just did an analysis. They say the average cost of health care insurance premiums for the indi-vidual market in Ohio has increased over the past 7 years by 90 percent—90 percent—almost a doubling. When you look at the Affordable Care Act exchanges themselves, it was just reported that we are expecting a 12-per-cent, on average, increase—12-percent, on average, increase—for people in the exchanges. Who can afford that? This is a double-digit increase. The result, again, is people are feeling the squeeze. Wages are flat, expenses up. There is a survey that was done by the Federal Reserve recently that said about half of all Americans say they have to bor-row money or sell something to cover a $400 emergency expense—$400. If you have ever had a health emer-gency, you know that can catch you by surprise. It can happen to anyone. Trust me, it usually costs more than $400. Seniors are especially vulnerable to these expenses, particularly seniors who are on fixed incomes. One econo-mist testified to the Senate Finance Committee at a hearing we had that, in part, because of those unexpected health care cost increases, more than 85 percent of Americans are at risk of having insufficient income in retire-ment—more than 85 percent. We think this middle-class squeeze is going to get worse, not better, in Ohio because so many companies are pulling out of the health care exchanges. So, in Ohio, 6 of the 17 companies that offer health care on the Ohio exchanges have now decided to pull out because they are losing money. Aetna is the most re-cent one. This means, of course, less choice. When you have less choice, what happens? Less competition. Less competition, what happens? You tend to have higher costs and lower quality. So this is going to make things even worse. The Congressional Budget Of-fice, the nonpartisan group in Con-gress, and the Joint Committee on Taxation projects that health insur-ance premiums over the next decade will continue to grow at about 5 per-cent per year, on average. So that steady increase is just impossible for people to be able to afford. For seniors, the Medicare trustees project Medicare’s monthly Part B pre-mium and deductible will increase even faster than that, by about 5.5 percent per year. Again, for a lot of people in that situation, they are on a fixed in-come. Their income is not going up 5.5 percent per year. One way seniors have found relief from the squeeze, of course, is take advantage of what is called the medical expense tax deduc-tion. It is very simple. It says that if your medical expenses exceed 7.5 per-cent of your income, then you can de-duct all of those medical expenses. A lot of seniors take advantage of that. Again, what a lot of seniors may not know is that as of the end of this year, under the Affordable Care Act, it increases—that threshold increases from 7.5 percent up to 10 percent. What does that mean? It means a lot of mid-dle-income seniors are not going to be able to deduct their medical expenses because they exceed 7.5 percent, but they don’t exceed 10 percent of their in-come. By the way, there are about 10 mil-lion Americans who use this deduction every year. Most of them are seniors. A lot of them make less than the na-tional average household income. In fact, most make less than that. Of course, a lot are on a fixed income. I have met with some of these people back home who are directly affected by this. One would be Susan Culbertson. She is from Zanesville, OH. I was with her in Columbus last week. Susan said she started working when she was 14 years old. She contributed to Social Security. She thought she had a decent plan for health care with Medicare and being able to take this deduction. Now, as a senior citizen, she has a chronic illness. She is losing sleep over how she is going to pay for all of her medical bills if this threshold goes up to 10 percent. Her husband Michael McVicker worked as a substance abuse counselor in a school. He is now living off of So-cial Security and, boy, that is hard to do, as seniors will tell you. When he had a heart attack a few years ago, the medical expense deduction helped him and his wife Susan be able to stay afloat financially. The difference be-tween the 7.5 percent and the 10 per-cent may not seem like much to some people, but it matters a lot to Susan, to her husband Michael, and to many other seniors in Ohio. I met with Lanny Hawkins. He is from Ontario, OH. He volunteers to help seniors do their taxes. God bless him. That is a hard job because the Tax Code has gotten so doggone com-plicated that people need help from these advisers. He tries to help them walk through the Tax Code. He told me that in his experience, the medical ex-pense deduction is especially helpful to seniors who have just lost their spouse. He says then only one income is there, and often they still have to pay their spouse’s medical bills after they are de-ceased. So in his practice, he has found peo-ple who fall between that 7.5 and that 10 percent number who are in that situ-ation. By the way, I was supposed to meet with somebody named Regina George— Regina is from Hamilton, OH—to talk about this very tax increase. I was looking forward to it, but she couldn’t make it. Do you know why she couldn’t make it? Because of the very health care problems we are talking about here. Regina just had triple bypass sur-gery and she has a broken hip. She has some out-of-pocket expenses. She has to depend on her son who lives with her. Her out-of-pocket health costs each month are increasing. She is very worried it is going to exceed 7.5 percent but not exceed 10 percent, and she is going to find herself in a situation where she cannot deduct these health care expenses. The Ohio AARP has done a good job of providing specific information on this to me and to other members of the Ohio delegation. That is really helpful because this is just not about numbers; this is about people. When you talk to these people and see what they are going through, I think it is something Republicans and Democrats alike should be able to come together on to solve before we leave during this ses-sion of Congress.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5441 September 8, 2016 
By the way, the data from the Inter-nal Revenue Service shows that seniors who use this deduction end to be the oldest, the least healthy, and, by the way, disproportionately women. Think about it. To have medical expenses above the threshold means you either have to have low income, high out-of- pocket medical expenses, or both. These are not folks we should be rais-ing taxes on, especially not now when they are feeling squeezed. Even with Medicare, as I said earlier, seniors still spend a large percentage of their income on health care. The aver-age Medicare beneficiary spent more than $6,000 a year in out-of-pocket health care expenses in the last year we have information for. The result is that some 8.3 million seniors rely on Medicaid in addition to Medicare. While this billion-dollar tax increase we are talking about today is intended to pay for part of the Presi-dent’s health care law, it could actu-ally, in the long run, cause more strain on an already struggling Medicaid sys-tem. I think that is sort of the defini-tion of pennywise and pound foolish, another reason for us to pass this legis-lation. Again, it is not about numbers. It is about people, some of the most vulner-able in our communities. That is why Senator B
ROWN and I have introduced this legislation—it is called the Senior Tax Hike Prevention Act—to block this tax increase from going into effect at the end of the year and to extend the current 7.5-percent threshold so many seniors are counting on. The bill is bipartisan. It is common sense. It is a chance for this body to show it does work for the most vulner-able in our society, that we stand with middle-class families who are feeling squeezed right now, and that we stand with our seniors. I thank Senator B
ROWN for being an indispensable partner with me in this effort. I also thank the many sup-porters of our legislation, like the AARP, the American Senior Housing Alliance, and the Ohio Alliance of Area Agencies on Aging. I urge my colleagues to join Senator B
ROWN , join others, join all these orga-nizations that represent millions of seniors, and join me in blocking this billion-dollar tax increase by sup-porting this commonsense legislation for the sake of those seniors who are caught in the squeeze, those seniors whom we represent. I yield back the remainder of my time. Madam President, I suggest the ab-sence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. S
ASSE). Without objection, it is so or-dered. UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST —S. 2952 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, shortly I will ask unanimous consent that the Senate pass S. 2952, the Stopping Mass Hacking Act. Colleagues, the bill is just one sen-tence long. What it does is simple, but in my view it is extraordinarily impor-tant. If the Senate does nothing, if the Senate fails to act, what is ahead for Americans is a massive expansion of government hacking and surveillance powers, and it will take place auto-matically on December 1 of this year. The legislation that I seek to pass, which has been bipartisan in the Sen-ate, would stop this automatic expan-sion of government hacking and sur-veillance powers. I have said it before and I want to say it again this afternoon: There is no question that it is a dangerous world out there, and I take a backseat to none when it comes to making sure our law enforcement and intelligence offi-cers have the tools they need to keep America safe. In fact, I was actually able to add the specific provision ex-panding emergency powers for our gov-ernment to act when there is a threat so that the government could move to protect the American people and come back and get the warrant later. But that is not what we are talking about here. What we are talking about here is a staggering expansion of government hacking and surveillance authority. These are major changes to Federal policy that are going to come about through amendments to rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. This is the kind of major issue that traditionally comes before the Judici-ary Committee. I see that two of my colleagues with whom I enjoy working very much are here. Chairman G
RASS -
LEYis here and also Senator C ORNYN , a member of the Judiciary Committee and a distinguished member of the Fi-nance Committee. We have big policy issues that come before the Finance Committee and that come before the Judiciary Committee. We work on them. We work on them in a bipartisan fashion. Chairman H
ATCH and I meet every Wednesday afternoon to work on these kinds of matters. That is not what is going to happen with this mas-sive expansion of government hacking and surveillance authority. Colleagues, these rules are going into effect on December 1 if Congress doss nothing. If Congress just says, ‘‘Oh, gee, we have other things to do,’’ these rules will go into effect. I guarantee you there are going to be many Ameri-cans who are going to be very unhappy, and they are going to ask their Mem-bers of Congress what they did to stop this ill-advised approach. By the way, in the other body, some of the most senior Republicans—Con-gressman S
ENSENBRENNER , the distin-guished Congressman from Wisconsin, is very concerned about this issue. The American people want security and liberty, but these amendments don’t give them much of either. This major policy change is going to make it easier for the government to hack into the personal devices of Americans and collect more information about them. They are going to do it by using computer programs called malware. The ‘‘mal,’’ in my view, is like ‘‘malev-olent.’’ It is going to make us less safe, not more. Allowing the government to use se-cret, untested malware could end up damaging not only our personal devices but the power grid or hospitals and nearly any other system connected to the Internet. Get your arms around that—hospitals in Iowa, Texas, and Or-egon being damaged not because the Congress made a policy decision but because something was done automati-cally as a result of a change in the rules of criminal procedure. I just want to say to my colleagues that I think there will be a lot of unhappy Ameri-cans if that is the case. The rule change says that the gov-ernment can potentially search mil-lions of computers with one single war-rant issued by one single judge. There is no difference, in terms of law en-forcement access, between the victims of a hack and the perpetrator himself. These changes will make people the victims twice over—once by a hacker and once again by their government. You wouldn’t punish the victims of a tax scam or a Ponzi scheme with a painful audit. It just doesn’t add up. I understand that passing legislation by unanimous consent is a difficult task. These days, you can hardly get unanimous consent to drink a soda at lunchtime. But this isn’t an issue where the Senate can do some kind of ostrich act and ignore the problem. By sitting here and doing nothing, the Senate will be giving consent to a sub-stantial expansion of government hacking and surveillance authority. By not acting, the Senate would give a stamp of approval on a major policy change that has received no hearing, no oversight, and no discussion in spite of the fact that some of the most im-portant companies in America are speaking in opposition to this. In my view, the limits of search and seizure are unquestionably an issue for this Congress to debate. The Justice Department should not have the power to change the practical meaning of the Fourth Amendment without the peo-ple’s elected leaders weighing in. In-stead, the Senate ought to be doubly concerned by the fact that the adminis-tration wants to conduct proactive cyber security policy through some kind of obscure bureaucratic process like rule 41. There aren’t folks in Oregon, Texas, Iowa, or anywhere else who are fol-lowing the details of something called rule 41, but I am telling everybody that they are going to be very concerned about the expansion of the govern-ment’s hacking authority. So I hope my colleagues will join me in sup-porting this bipartisan, bicameral leg-islation. If this bill does not pass today

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5442 September 8, 2016 
by unanimous consent, I look forward to having a hearing on this issue. I know there has been bipartisan inter-est in the Judiciary Committee. Lead-ers of the Judiciary Committee have talked about it, and I hope that hear-ing will take place shortly so that Americans can have a chance to under-stand exactly how devastating this pro-posal would be for them. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-sent that the Judiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. 2952; that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; that the bill be read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The majority whip. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, reserv-ing the right to object, let me start by saying to my friend from Oregon that I admire his passion and I admire his creativity at branding legislation. But for reasons I will explain, this is a com-monsense procedure that doesn’t relate to the Fourth Amendment—the con-stitutional right to be protected from unreasonable searches and seizures. This is a venue provision. This has to do with what court to go to in order to get a court order and to get permission of a court, after establishing probable cause, to conduct that search. Senator W
YDEN is seeking consent to block proposed changes in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure that have already been the product of thoughtful and lengthy consideration, including public hearing and deliberation. These rules, as all rules that are plied in the courts are, have been approved by the rules advisory committee. This is a group of judges, law professors, and practicing attorneys. Then they were approved by the Judicial Conference of the United States. Then, most signifi-cantly perhaps, they were endorsed by the U.S. Supreme Court. So if there were constitutional or other legal issues and concerns about this, one would think the highest Court in the land would have flagged those and de-clined to endorse them, but they didn’t. These changes have been approved because they are commonsense meas-ures, as I said a moment ago, that re-late solely to the appropriate venue for a search warrant. They simply make clear which Federal district court the government should go to in order to apply to a judge for a search warrant in cases involving sophisticated cyber criminals and people like child pornog-raphers and even terrorists. Ulti-mately, that makes our government more efficient—by making it clear which courts can consider these re-quests for search warrants—and better equipped to stop these heinous crimes. As I said earlier, these aren’t sub-stantive changes. This doesn’t change the balance between privacy and secu-rity in the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution. Rather, the government must still go before a judge and make the requisite showing in order to get a search warrant. I can’t understand who but the most radical of privacy advocates would say that—even after meeting the require-ments of the Fourth Amendment be-fore a judge establishing probable cause to get a search warrant, would say: No, we don’t want that to happen. I can’t imagine circumstances where we would say the Fourth Amendment is trumped by concerns about privacy, especially when the targets that must be proven up in court are cyber crimi-nals, child pornographers, and even ter-rorists. We can’t let that happen, and that is why these rule changes are so important. Our colleague claims the rule changes will allow for mass hacking and forum shopping. That is the cre-ative branding I told him I admired in the beginning. But these are the same claims that have been considered and rejected through a thoughtful, thor-ough process that I have already de-scribed. These changes are modernizing our laws and updating the tools gov-ernment has to investigate so they can better protect us from the very real and increasing threat of cyber crimi-nals and terrorists. The truth is, there are more things we need to do in addi-tion to this to update and modernize our laws. I would close by saying that I know public concerns have been raised. In-deed, I believe there have been some briefings—even today—by Federal law enforcement agencies and the intel-ligence community with regard to Rus-sian activities in cyber space, even fo-cused on our very system of electing our officials in the November 8 elec-tion. This is not a time to retreat and to allow cyber space to be run amuck by cyber criminals or people who would steal intellectual property or child por-nographers or terrorists. This is a very sensible tool of venue. It just says where the search warrant can be sought, not the substantive require-ments for what needs to be proven. That is preserved under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution that protects all of us, as it should, against unreasonable searches and seizures. So for all those reasons, Mr. Presi-dent, I object to the unanimous con-sent request. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-tion is heard. The Senator from Oregon. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am going to yield in just a moment to Sen-ator D
AINES , but just so we are clear in terms of my response to the distin-guished Senator from Texas, he has—as some have tried to do—sought to char-acterize this as kind of a routine kind of matter; that this was a rule of crimi-nal procedure of no great import and without any far-reaching consider-ation. I can tell you that cyber secu-rity experts around the country have spoken out virtually unanimously about the consequences of the govern-ment accidentally breaking their com-puters without telling them. I don’t know of anything that is rou-tine about this at all. Under this change, the government can search po-tentially millions of computers with one single warrant issued by one single judge. And, tragically, there is no dif-ference, in terms of law enforcement access, between the victims of a hack and the perpetrators themselves. So we are talking about clobbering victims twice. First they get clobbered by a hacker and then they could get hurt by the government. The distinguished Senator from Texas seeks to portray this as some kind of far-out kind of matter. Vir-tually all of the major technology com-panies in this country have written in opposition to this. Scores of cyber se-curity experts have written in opposi-tion. One of the key points they make is that you don’t punish victims twice in America. You wouldn’t punish the victims of a tax scam or a Ponzi scheme with a painful audit. That is what can happen here. The idea that a change of this mag-nitude would be made without any de-bate, consideration—there has been no hearing on this matter. I know of no meetings. I would like to hear any Member of the Senate tell me about some meeting they went to. I know of no sessions where the public voice could be heard. I am very hopeful, and I intend to come back to this floor again in an ef-fort to make sure the public is at least brought into this. I can tell you that Senator DAINES and I represent a lot of rural hospitals, for example. Well, cer-tainly if you heard some of what we have been told could happen in terms of what it could mean to computer sys-tems at hospitals and other kinds of fa-cilities, they are going to ask their Senators: What did you do about that? Why did you just let that rule go through that would damage those sys-tems that are a lifeline for Americans? So we are going to be back. As I men-tioned before, my colleague in the other body was starting to make a fair amount of progress. J
IMSENSEN -
BRENNER , who is a very influential Member of the other body, has taken a great interest in this, as have a number of colleagues on both sides. So we will be back. I am going to yield now. I know my colleague from Montana has been a wonderful partner in this effort, and he has some comments to make that will highlight once again the bipartisan concern about the magnitude of this change that would take place without any involvement, none, here in the Senate—no hearings, no debates, no discussions. This is a big change, and I hope we will discuss it. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Montana.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5443 September 8, 2016 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, my dis-tinguished colleague from Oregon com-mented about how technology compa-nies are concerned about what is going on. I spent over a decade in the private sector—in fact, 12 years with a cloud computing company. We had 17 offices around the world and a product in 33 different languages. I saw firsthand what it means to be engaged in the high-tech business and the challenges related to hacking. I also know first-hand the challenge our country does face when it comes to cyber criminals. We were attacked routinely in our company and had to defend those at-tacks off and build rock-solid, hard-ened firewalls to protect our cus-tomers. Technology has made it easier for bad actors to steal our identities, to distribute malware, and to commit a whole host of other crimes, all from be-hind a computer screen anywhere in the world. Our law enforcement faces tremendous challenges in tracking and stopping these criminals. The fact is, our law enforcement policies need to be updated to reflect the 21st-century re-alities, but these policy changes need to be made through a process that is transparent and that is effective and, importantly, protects our civil lib-erties. The changes to rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure would allow the government to hack an un-limited number of Americans’ com-puters, including innocent victims, with a single warrant. This rule change was approved behind the closed doors of a little-known judicial conference. Fundamental changes to the way we allow law enforcement to execute searches need to be made, there is no doubt about that. We are in agreement that changes need to be made; however, it must be through a process that is fully transparent to the American peo-ple. We cannot give the Federal Gov-ernment a blank check to infringe upon our civil liberties. If Congress does not act, this rule change will automatically go into ef-fect on December 1. S. 2952, the Stop-ping Mass Hacking Act, stops the rule change and will allow Congress to con-sider new law enforcement tools through—and this is very important— the full, open, transparent process they deserve. I urge my colleagues to support this not only bipartisan but also bicameral piece of legislation. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Iowa. 
FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY  
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about the work of the Judiciary Committee and to make a short speech on the issue of the Affordable Care Act. Earlier this week, the minority lead-er came to the floor to speak about the Supreme Court vacancy. He made per-sonal insults and threats, as he tends to do. But political stunts and childish tantrums aside, the minority leader knows the American people deserve to have their voices heard on the future of the Supreme Court. We have made the decision that the next President will select the next Justice of the Supreme Court. We have done that because the next Justice will have a profound im-pact on issues that matter to all of us for decades to come, and we think the people should have a voice in that mat-ter. I spent the past several weeks meet-ing with Iowans across my State and discussing issues that concern them and what is on their minds looking for-ward to the election this fall. The va-cancy on the Supreme Court created by the death of Justice Scalia came up time and again. At meeting after meet-ing during this summer, Iowans told me they appreciate the Senate’s deci-sion that the next President should nominate Justice Scalia’s replacement. They understood that this nomination will affect the Court for years to come. For that reason, they want to have a voice in the matter, and we will give them that voice. That is the position the Judiciary Committee took after Justice Scalia’s death. We wrote to Leader MCCONNELL on February 23 to advise him that the next President should select the next Justice. We ex-plained it this way: 
The Presidential election is well underway. . . . The American people are presented with an exceedingly rare opportunity to decide, in a very real and concrete way, the direction the Court will take over the next generation. We believe The People should have this op-portunity. 
Our explanation is all the more true as we find ourselves just 2 months away from the Presidential election this fall. I remain convinced that we owe the people a chance to speak their minds on the Supreme Court during this election. I have not been surprised to hear from my fellow Iowans that they want their voices heard on the issue, and the Senate’s decision to give the people this opportunity is no surprise either. We are acting in the Senate’s long tra-dition as a check on the President’s power to nominate. I would like to take as one example, because I have given several examples in other speeches—but go back to 1968. On June 26 of that Presidential elec-tion year, President Johnson an-nounced his nomination of Justice Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice of the Su-preme Court when Chief Justice War-ren declared his intentions to retire. Abe Fortas, of course, was already an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court and had been unanimously confirmed by the Senate just a few years earlier. But that confirmation didn’t take place in an election year like 1968. Within 24 hours of Justice Fortas’s nomination to be Chief Justice, 19 Re-publican Senators issued the following statement: ‘‘[T]he next Chief Justice should be selected . . . after the people have expressed themselves in the No-vember elections.’’ At the time, Democrats held the Sen-ate, so these 19 Republican Members did not control the Judiciary Commit-tee’s proceedings on the floor. But those 19 Senators promised that if the issue was forced to a vote, they would ‘‘vote against confirming any Supreme Court nominees by the incumbent President.’’ These 19 Senators made this commit-ment immediately following the Presi-dent’s announcement of his intended nomination for the same reasons the Judiciary Committee has elected not to move forward the President’s nomi-nation of a successor to Justice Scalia. Here is what Senator Howard Baker said, as one among those 19 Senators: I have no questions concerning the legal capability of Justice Fortas . . . [but] there are, in my opinion, more important consider-ations at this time. 
Then, to continue to quote Senator Baker: 
The appointment of the Chief Justice real-ly ought to be the prerogative of the new ad-ministration. . . . In my opinion, the judicial branch is not an isolated branch of Govern-ment. . . . It is and must be responsive to the sentiment of the people of the Nation. 
Those are my thoughts exactly, and they are not just shared by Repub-licans. Recall of course that then- Chairman B
IDEN said in 1992 that proc-essing a Supreme Court nomination in an election year harms the nominee, the country, and the Senate. And he only spoke of coming together on a nominee in the next Congress with a new President. I would finally like to address one more argument I have heard recently from those who support the President’s nomination this election year. As we have drawn closer and closer to this Presidential election, they have tried to use the length of this vacancy as reason to move forward with this President’s nomination. I have even heard some say that this is the longest Supreme Court vacancy ever. That is just plain false. I will list just a few ex-amples. Two vacancies to fill the seats of Jus-tices Baldwin and Daniel lasted longer than 2 years in the 1800s. Six Supreme Court vacancies have lasted longer than a year, and two more have lasted nearly that long. As this election draws closer by the day, the Judiciary Committee’s posi-tion remains consistent. The next President will choose Justice Scalia’s replacement. Senators have made this choice be-fore—like the 19 who declared during the 1968 election year that the next President should choose Justice War-ren’s replacement. They did so, just as then-Chairman B
IDEN said, because that course was best for the country during a politically charged election year. The same thing is true this elec-tion year. The next President will se-lect the next Supreme Court Justice.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5444 September 8, 2016 
Act. I would like to give a direct quote from President Obama about ObamaCare: ‘‘Too many Americans still strain to pay for their physician visits and prescriptions, cover their deductibles or pay their monthly insur-ance bill.’’ I am glad that the President has fi-nally heard that message. When I was having meetings in some of the 99 counties in Iowa this year, I heard plenty from families who felt duped by the promises of ObamaCare. Two fami-lies told me that their ObamaCare in-surance premium was more than their house payment. Many said they did not know how they would continue to pay the premiums. But President Obama says, in effect, ‘‘Pay no attention to rising pre-miums,’’ and then promises to give people subsidies. But 97 percent of Americans do not receive ObamaCare subsidies. ObamaCare seems to be collapsing. Insurers are leaving the exchanges. There has been a lot of news on that lately. Premiums are increasing by double digits. In Iowa, some of those premiums increased as much as 28 per-cent, and I have heard a lot of States are much higher. Americans have fewer health care choices every day, despite the many promises that ObamaCare would improve just about every aspect of our health care system. Twenty per-cent of ObamaCare customers will be forced to find a new insurance company this fall. So much for the promise that was made in 2008 that ‘‘if you like your [insurance], you can keep it.’’ And it is official: You can no longer keep your doctor. So much for the promise of 2008 that ‘‘if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.’’ The Obama administration has now even erased all references on its Web site to the words ‘‘keeping your doctor.’’ The link to the web page that used to say ‘‘how to keep your doctor’’ now says ‘‘how to pick a health plan.’’ So ObamaCare seems to be col-lapsing. This comes as no surprise. ObamaCare has worked as well as pil-ing 2 tons of fertilizer on a 1-ton truck, and of course any farmer can tell you, that just doesn’t work very well for a long haul. We could enact alternative reforms aimed at solving America’s biggest health care problems. Good places to start would be cracking down on frivo-lous lawsuits, letting people purchase insurance across State lines, improving transparency in the health care pric-ing, giving States more freedom to im-prove Medicaid, using consumer choice to drive competition, which in turn drives down costs, and changing the Tax Code so that small businesses can provide affordable health insurance to their employees. That financial help is something that ObamaCare took away, and this is exactly what my legisla-tion, S. 1697, the Small Business Healthcare Relief Act, will do to give those employers an opportunity to pro-vide that help to their employees. I have given only a partial list of pol-icy changes so the American people can know that the failing ObamaCare pro-gram is not the only answer. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Maine. Mr. KING. Mr. President, I ask unan-imous consent to speak as in morning business for up to 5 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 
COMPREHENSIVE ADDICTION AND RECOVERY BILL  
Mr. KING. Mr. President, last March this body passed CARA, the Com-prehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. Unfortunately, at the same time, we didn’t fund it. We didn’t provide any additional funds to support the treat-ment and recovery of people through-out the country. Since we passed that bill and failed to fund it, 15,000 people— 78 a day, 3 an hour—have died because we haven’t acted on funding. A group of us got together on March 2 and brought forth an amendment to provide $600 million of emergency fund-ing to give some substance to this bill, which had so much promise, and to provide support for recovery and treat-ment. That amendment was defeated. Passing that bill without funding is like sending the fire department to a five-alarm fire with no water. We don’t have the means to do what has to be done to defeat this scourge, which has taken the life of a constituent or more in every State in the Union. Every one of us has lost lives in our State because of this. Treatment works. Recovery is pos-sible. It is hard, but the greatest trag-edy—the greatest tragedy—is when someone struggles with this awful dis-ease, is ready to seek help, seeks help, and is told: Sorry, there is a 3-month waiting list. That is unconscionable. This is something that is taking lives right now. This isn’t an abstract, ‘‘maybe this will happen in the fu-ture.’’ This is right now, today, in Maine, in Florida, in California, in Ari-zona, in Washington, in Nebraska, in Texas—all across this country. It is the greatest public health crisis of my life-time. Seventy-eight people a day are dying, and it is preventable. There are three legs to the stool of dealing with this: One is law enforce-ment, one is prevention, and one is treatment. And without all three of those legs, the stool collapses and peo-ple die. These are real people. I have had roundtables in Maine. I sat next to a deputy sheriff who lost his daughter and one woman who said she hoped her son would be arrested so maybe then he could get into treat-ment. These are regular, ordinary Americans that are being affected by this, not only young people. These are older people, middle class, middle-aged people. This is a major crisis. There are lots of aspects to it, and I can talk about the fact that opioid prescription drugs lead to heroin and other drugs, but the real subject today is funding. I was told back in the spring: Don’t worry, we are going to take up CARA in appropriations. We are going to have appropriations bills, and it will all be dealt with. Well, now we are talking about a continuing resolution that would not have any additional funding unless we find a way to do it, and that is my plea today. I have written to the President; I have written to the chair of the Appro-priations Committee saying: Let’s find a way to at least fund the $181 million that is authorized in CARA. At least do that, even if we are doing a continuing resolution. By the way, I don’t understand why we are doing continuing resolutions when the agreement has been reached on the amount of the budget, the amount of the appropriations. The Ap-propriations Committee has done their work. Why aren’t we doing appropria-tions? That is another subject. But however we do the funding this fall, let’s deal with this terrible prob-lem that is taking lives, tearing fami-lies apart, and deeply wounding the heart of America. I ask the consideration of this whole body for this urgent problem and that we take real steps to deliver help to those people who are asking for it. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

OBAMACARE Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to share some flashbacks for throwback Thursdays, if we want to call it that, with regard to ObamaCare. There have been a lot of speeches made about ObamaCare recently. Spe-cifically, I want to look at the facts about ObamaCare, as we all know them now, more than 6 years after it was signed into law—6 long years—and re-mind the country what the President and my colleagues across the aisle promised all of us when they pushed this bill through the Congress. I say ‘‘push’’ because it passed without one single Republican vote and certainly not mine. First, the reality. All summer long, we have read the headlines about dras-tic premium increases being requested, insurers pulling out from different States, and patients being caught in the middle. My State of Kansas has not been im-mune. Last year, UnitedHealthcare an-nounced it would leave our State. Aetna was going to start offering cov-erage next year and then announced a massive exit from exchange markets across the country, including Kansas. We were at risk of having just one in-surer in many parts of the State, with no competition with regard to pricing. In June, the State insurance depart-ment announced a proposed rate in-crease for next year. The good news: A new insurer, Medica, was proposing to offer coverage in Kansas. However, there is bad news. The bad news is that premiums could be increased by nearly 50 percent next year for some individ-uals in our State and I know in many other States. Last year, the highest ap-proved increase was 24.5 percent. Next year’s rates are still being finalized, but they could be double that. Now let’s throw it back. In 2013, President Obama said about the law that ‘‘the result is more choice, more competition, real health care secu-rity.’’ Today, however, we see less choice, less competition. And with in-surers coming and going and rising pre-miums, I think Kansas families would agree they are not secure in their health care coverage. I don’t know any State that is. These are not just headlines in the paper or on the Internet; real folks back home are hurting. A nurse in Miltonvale, KS, wrote to me about what she calls the devastating effect ObamaCare is having on her patients and her loved ones. She says: ‘‘I am very concerned that continuing along these lines will further limit care and accelerate a decline in health care in our state, as well as our nation.’’ But, again, let’s throw back to what we were initially promised. Way back on the campaign trail in 2008, then- Candidate Obama promised that he would enact health care reform which would lower a typical family’s pre-mium by $2,500 a year. I don’t foresee any way those savings could be realized if a Kansan’s premium is going to be up to over 40 percent, on top of about 25 percent last year. Looking back to 2013, Congress-woman N
ANCY PELOSI said the imple-mentation of this law was ‘‘fabulous.’’ Fabulous, indeed. This was, of course, before open enrollment started and the failed launch of the healthcare.gov Web site, which crashed. More issues of concern to me have come from recent regulations that have been used to implement this law. This law has massive regulations. The law has 2,000 pages. We are now at over 10,000 pages of regulations. The administration has proposed changing how they verify individuals as being eligible to receive taxpayer as-sistance for their premiums under the

law. Discrepancies between what a per-son claims their income is and what is received from trusted data sources must now be off by 25 percent. Pre-viously, it was 10 percent in order for the administration to investigate a possible fraud. So I guess you can be fraudulent up to 24.9 percent now. The administration should not be lowering the standard by which it verifies eligi-bility for folks to receive our scarce taxpayer dollars. It is unacceptable for implementation of this law to further burden taxpayers by failing to protect against fraud and abuse. Another recent regulation gets at one of my biggest fears from the law’s passage: the ability of the government to ration care. There were four provi-sions of this law that I believed would decrease individual choice and open the door to rationing, one of which was the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid In-novation, CMMI. In March, this outfit passed a proposal to test, as the agency calls it, how we pay for prescription drugs for our seniors under Medicare Part B. Patient groups, doctors, and many of us in Congress are gravely concerned about how this test could af-fect the patient’s quality of and access to care. As the Kansas Medical Society explained to me, this so-called dem-onstration ‘‘will force Kansas Medicare beneficiaries with serious, sometimes life-threatening conditions to partici-pate, disrupt their treatment proc-esses, and impede their access to need-ed medications with no evidence of im-proved health outcomes or financial gains for the Medicare system.’’ Such a so-called test is now allowable because of the rationing provisions of ObamaCare. The law is simply not working for the large majority of Americans. Insur-ers are pulling out, citing large losses in covering the population of people who are seeking coverage on the ex-changes. So Americans are left with fewer options in selecting their health care coverage, and, most concerning, they are paying more for it—a lot more. Looking back to December of 2015 when this body sent legislation to the President’s desk to repeal ObamaCare, the President’s Statement of Adminis-tration Policy stated simply, ‘‘The Af-fordable Care Act is Working.’’ Yet, last month the President wrote in the Journal of the American Medical Asso-ciation that ‘‘too many Americans still strain to pay for their physician visits and prescriptions, cover their deductibles, or pay their monthly in-surance bills.’’ That is a true state-ment. I thank the President for waking up to this nightmare. Despite his new revelation that the Affordable Care Act is, in fact, the unaffordable care act for most, the President and his party’s candidate to succeed him say the answer is greater government control—a public option. Folks, that is government health care. That is what we are talking about. The failings of ObamaCare cannot be cor-rected with more government interven-tion, more restrictions, and more regu-lations. We must triage the pain this law is inflicting on hard-working Americans. We must repeal and we must replace this law. I know that many colleagues will join me in continuing to work to provide freedom from its mandates and increased taxes to all and enact re-forms to our health care system that will actually lower the cost of coverage and increase access to care for individ-uals. Simply put, this law is failing. It is our job to correct it, and we will con-tinue fighting to do so. I was talking about this matter in the cloakroom just moments ago. Sev-eral of our Members have been very ac-tive in this whole endeavor to try to not only repeal but to replace this law, and they pause a little bit and say: You know, maybe this law was designed to fail. Maybe this law is so bad in terms of falling apart that people could not help but know that and then come in and say that the only thing we can now move to is national health care, gov-ernment-run health insurance. If that is true, that is a 6-year effort with a lot of pain and suffering and in terms of political deceit, probably ranks right at the top. We have to repeal this law. We have to replace it. We have to get to work. And we have to prevent further steps toward national health insurance. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Michigan.

WRDA Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to speak about legislation that is currently on the floor, the Water Re-sources Development Act. I start by thanking a great legisla-tive team of opposites who come to-gether—and when they do they get things done—that is, Senator I
NHOFE , the chair of the committee, and the ranking member, Senator B
OXER . I thank both of them for tireless effort, including their staffs for bringing for-ward something that is very important to my home State but important to communities all across the country. I also want to thank our two leaders for coming together and finding a way to have a path forward that allows us to come to the bill without a vote on a motion to proceed, and that involves all of our colleagues wanting to work together and that is evident on this bill and I very much appreciate everybody’s efforts. This comes after the Environment and Public Works Committee approved the Water Resources Development Act by 19 to 1 in the committee. Clearly, there is very strong bipartisan support, and it comes because the water infra-structure needs of the country are so great for every community, every State. I know the distinguished Pre-siding Officer would be able to tell the same story in North Dakota. I particularly want to focus on one part—and then I will speak more broadly about the bill—but the part that deals with lead exposure and lead in water, which is very important to me, as colleagues know, and very im-portant to a community called Flint, MI, where 100,000 people, through no fault of their own, were exposed to ex-cessive levels of lead. There are efforts going on now to try to fix that, and we will focus on the long-term health and nutrition needs of the children and families, but the water is still not fixed. People have said to me: Gosh, that was really bad what happened before in Flint. I say: No, no, it is not what hap-pened in Flint, it is still happening. There are still bottles of water being delivered to homes, and people have been waiting. So we are grateful to be at this point, and there certainly is a sense of urgency coming from families in Flint and all around Michigan as well. More than one-half million preschool students in the United States are ex-posed to elevated lead levels. So this is an issue not only in Flint but in schools and other parts of Michigan, where the drinking fountains in the school—you know, when you are walk-ing down the hall and see the drinking fountain in the school is shut down be-cause of high lead exposure, that has happened in schools across the coun-try. We have a particular concern because there are 9,000 children under the age of 6, not counting all the children in school, who have elevated lead levels. It is quite frightening because some of the homes in Flint actually have reg-istered levels higher than a toxic waste dump. It is pretty scary and incredibly important that we support their efforts to get the pipes replaced as quickly as possible. The cost of lead exposure goes far be-yond the $50 billion a year Americans have to pay in health care and in bot-tled water and all of the other health issues. Having unsafe water costs us our well-being, the health of the com-munities, economic development. It costs us a sense of dignity. As Ameri-cans, we think one of the basic rights that we don’t think about—we just take it for granted that you are going to turn on the faucet and clean water is going to come out and you can drink it. That sense of basic confidence in in-frastructure has been shaken in Flint but also in other communities across the country. That is something we are addressing in this bill that is so very important. I am very pleased we have a bill in front of us that will comprehensively not only address a community that we have been fighting for and care deeply about but other communities around Michigan and around the country. We need the funding in this bill—the au-thorization in this bill because of a number of reasons. Let me again— speaking about lead, there are 5,300

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5447 September 8, 2016 
American cities that have been found to be in violation of Federal lead rules. So there are 5,300 cities right now that we know don’t meet the standards for safety. In USA TODAY they reported that excessive lead has been detected in nearly 2,000 public water systems across all 50 States. This is an impor-tant bill, and it addresses something that not only I have been focused on and my colleague Senator P
ETERS has been focused on but I know other col-leagues are focusing on in communities in their States. Frankly, there is no safe level of lead exposure and even a small amount can harm people over their lifetime. One study from Rhode Island found a cor-relation between even the lowest levels of lead exposure and declines in read-ing scores. There are certainly many other studies. When we look at what is happening in this bill, the first thing I am very pleased to say is that we have a provi-sion that helps our communities that have literally been shut down, not only families with bottled water, but can you imagine being a downtown res-taurant and we have economic develop-ment going on downtown and all of a sudden people don’t want to come be-cause they are worried the restaurant is using contaminated water. In fact, it is totally safe to come to downtown Flint, and they are making great ef-forts on economic development and re-vitalization. I was pleased to host the SBA Administrator a number of months ago, talking with small busi-ness entrepreneurs who are excited about being in Flint. When we look at the broad ripple ef-fect when a water system isn’t safe, it is most importantly about families and children, but it also affects small busi-nesses and it affects the entire econ-omy. So in this bill, we are very pleased we have a provision fully paid for by phasing out another program that will help address this. We also address lead contamination in communities across the country. There is a very important loan pro-gram that was put in place by the chairman and ranking member in the last WRDA bill but not activated, not funded, that we fund that will activate loans—$800 million, possibly more, in loans available for communities all across the country. The structure was set up in the last WRDA bill and now in this one we are actually funding it. So communities can activate very impor-tant loans to upgrade their water infra-structure. We also know that when we are look-ing at issues around lead contamina-tion, we see across the country drink-ing water issues in 22 percent of the homes in Jackson, MS, were found to exceed the Federal action lead levels. I remember the Mayor of Jackson saying to pregnant moms and children: Don’t drink the water. It is not just water. There are 37 mil-lion housing units in the United States that contain lead-based paint. Even though we have come a long way, we have addressed lead-based paint, but we still have problems there in older homes that are still affecting children. Soil is another issue, and certainly those of us who work with our farmers understand that as a critical resource in growing our food in East Chicago, IN, some show lead levels up to 227 times above the Federal lead limits and 135 times above the arsenic limit. It is pretty tough to be growing things when you have that kind of contamina-tion in the soil. The top 6 inches of soil had up to 30 times more lead than the level consid-ered safe for children. Atlantic City, Philadelphia, Allentown, Pennsylvania, where over 500,000 children have enough lead in their blood to merit a visit to the doctor. In this bill, we provide resources as well to address issues related to public health and lead in children. We know that for the 286 million Americans who get their tapwater from community water systems, this bill is an incredibly important investment in many dif-ferent ways. It is necessary for public health and safety, it is necessary for economic development, and commu-nities across America will benefit from this. I also thank the committee for once again focusing on something else we in Michigan care about—the Great Lakes. We are surrounded. We have the penin-sula surrounded by water and great beauty. Another wonderful summer we just had, where boating, fishing, and tourism is a very important part of our economy as well as a way of life. In this bill, for the first time, we estab-lished the Great Lakes Restoration Ini-tiative, formally in law, and it will au-thorize $300 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative over the next 5 years. This is important for all of us in the Great Lakes State. It is also important because 27 percent of the world’s freshwater comes from the Great Lakes. So it is a very important economic resource for all of us. This bill also authorizes new pro-grams to help with drought by pro-moting innovative water technology and research, for desalinization and water reuse and recycling. It authorizes very important Army Corps projects. There are 25 critical Army Corps projects in 17 different States that are authorized in this legis-lation. These are authorizations for in-frastructure projects that protect and address concerns in communities in South Carolina, Florida, New Jersey, and Louisiana, where we know about the hurricane and storm damage, and flood control projects in Texas, Mis-souri, Kansas, and California. There are environmental restoration projects in Oregon and in Washington State. There are additional dam improve-ment programs, new programs that allow FEMA to help rehabilitate high- hazard potential dams. America’s 84,000 dams are rapidly aging, and 14,000 of them are considered high risk, high hazard. We have about 88 of those dams in Michigan that are considered high hazard. So this is a bill that touches every single State. I know Members across the aisle have worked on this together. Clearly, it is something that is very important to Michigan, very important to families in Michigan. The piece that allows us to support the 100,000 people in Michigan is incredibly important for us, but we also understand that in the process of legislating, we have been able to support efforts and needs around the country and come together to do something that is important for communities in all of our States. I think that is what legislating is all about, as the Presiding Officer knows. You and I have worked together on many different projects that try to ad-dress concerns across the country. Again, I thank the chairman and ranking member for doing an out-standing job, for supporting our efforts but also supporting efforts of other Members. Hopefully, as we work our way through this process, we can come together on commonsense amendments that relate to this bill so we can have a very big vote on final passage and send it to the House, and hopefully our colleagues in the House will recognize how important this is to their districts and their States as well, and we will be able to get this to the President as soon as possible. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from Louisiana.

HONORING CORPORAL MONTRELL JACKSON, DEPUTY BRAD GARAFOLA, AND OFFICER MAT-THEW GERALD Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor three brave men: Cor-poral Montrell Jackson, Deputy Brad Garafola, and Officer Matthew Gerald. It has been a tough summer in Lou-isiana. Not only did we have the floods of which I spoke yesterday, but we had the Alton Sterling shooting, the civil unrest afterwards, and then these three officers killed and several others shot. I will speak today to these officers. On July 17, the three men I just men-tioned gave their lives while protecting our community when ambushed while reporting to a 9–1-1 call. Deputy Nick Tullier, Deputy Bruce Simmons, and Officer Chad Montgomery were injured during this attack. Thankfully, Deputy Simmons and Officer Montgomery have returned home to their families, but Deputy Tullier remains in the hospital. Please keep him in your thoughts and prayers. Speaking of those who died, Corporal Jackson was a 10-year veteran of the Baton Rouge Police Department, a lov-ing husband to his wife Trenisha, and a father to his 4-month-old child, Mason. Following the shooting of Mr. Alton Sterling, Montrell wrote on his Facebook page: 
I personally want to send prayers out to everyone affected by this tragedy. These are

trying times. Please don’t let hate infect your heart. This city must and will get bet-ter. 
Deputy Garafola served the East Baton Rouge Sheriff’s Office for over 24 years. He was a beloved son, husband to his wife Tonja, and father to their four children: Garrett, Braley, Brad, and Samantha. He was remembered for al-ways selflessly trying to help others. At the time of his death, he again acted selflessly, giving his life when he saw another officer down, running to that officer who was injured during the attack and by doing so exposing him-self to fatal gunfire. Officer Matthew Gerald joined the Baton Rouge Police Department just last year. Before this, he had bravely served our country in both the Army and Marine Corps. Between 2002 and 2009, Matt completed three tours of duty in Iraq as a crew chief on a heli-copter crew and received numerous awards and medals. Prior to his service in the Army, he had enlisted in the Ma-rine Corps in New Orleans and served 4 years from 1994 to 1998. Matt was a lov-ing son, husband to his wife Dechia, and father to Dawelyn and Fynleigh. His wife recently announced she is pregnant with their third child. Each of those men shared common core values that guided them: service, stewardship, and sacrifice. They put the needs and well-being of others be-fore their own. Scripture says, ‘‘Great-er love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.’’ In protecting their community, these men paid the ultimate sacrifice. I honor their lives and thank their fami-lies for their selfless service to the city of Baton Rouge, to the State of Lou-isiana, and to the United States of America. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN.

WRDA Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as the Presiding Officer knows, we are work-ing on a bill we call WRDA, W-R-D-A, which is the Water Resources Develop-ment Act. This is important to the en-tire country because what it focuses on is obviously clean drinking water but also the kinds of infrastructure that protect public safety and make com-merce and transportation possible. I commend the leadership of Chair-man I
NHOFE , the Senator from Okla-homa, and Ranking Member B
OXER , the Senator from California, for the work they have done getting us this far. In particular, I wanted to mention the application of this legislation to my home State of Texas. Texas under-stands that water is a precious re-source and one that needs to be man-aged effectively. There is an old saying in Texas that whiskey is for drinking and water is for fighting. It kind of makes you chuckle, but it dem-onstrates the point that water is essen-tial to life. It is essential to our agri-cultural community to be able to grow our crops and water our livestock. It is indispensable, but it is easy to over-look all the work it takes to craft good legislation that looks out for the whole country’s water supply and also pro-tects our ports, our waterways, and helps guard against flooding. These are just a few of the projects included in this bill. In April, this legislation overwhelm-ingly passed out of committee. I am pleased this bill serves as just another example of what we can accomplish when we put politics aside and work to-gether in the best interests of the American people. I wish to mention that I am also grateful this legislation includes part of a bill that I introduced last spring called the COAST Act. Texas has hun-dreds of miles of coastline, and the State’s location in the Gulf of Mexico makes it particularly vulnerable to hurricanes, storms, and other weather impacts such as flooding, storm surges, and high winds. I don’t need to tell the Presiding Officer about that, as Lou-isiana recently suffered terrible flood-ing. In 2008, Texans saw firsthand when Hurricane Ike made landfall. It became the second most costly U.S. hurricane on record. Of course, because the area is so densely populated and includes one of our Nation’s busiest ports and energy hubs, major damage along the Texas coast would likely be felt well beyond our State in much of the rest of the country as well, particularly the eco-nomic impacts. Safeguarding the gulf coast from the next major hurricane should be a priority not just to Texas but a national priority, as I say, both to those who live there and those who would suffer the potential economic consequences. That is why this par-ticular provision, the coastal Texas protection provision in the Water Re-sources Development Act legislation, is so important. This is very straightforward. All it would do is require the Army Corps of Engineers to take advantage of pre-existing studies and not have to dupli-cate those studies as a prerequisite to addressing this issue. The Corps wouldn’t have to duplicate efforts but could instead build on the good work of leaders in the State that had already been done, so the Texas coast can get the protection it needs sooner rather than later. Fortunately, the Water Resources Development Act also includes projects that will benefit communities across my State, such as infrastructure im-provements to help reduce flooding, provisions that make our ship channels more efficient and strengthen our ports by making them safer and better equipped to handle growing amounts of trade. I know there is a lot of discus-sion about trade, particularly in the Presidential election season, but I will tell you that trade is viewed as an un-mitigated good in my State. We are the No. 1 exporting State in the Nation, and that is just one reason why our economy is growing faster than the na-tional economy. We have learned a very simple lesson; that is, when you grow things—when you make things—and you have more people and more markets to sell to around the world, it is good for jobs, and it is good for the economy. I hope that some of our leaders and those who aspire to become the next President of the United States learn from some of the lessons that we have learned from in Texas—that trade is good. That is not to say that with globalization there aren’t some people disadvantaged, and we can address some of those concerns with funds dedi-cated to retraining efforts. But the fact of the matter is that more technology and more globalization are changing our economy and our labor markets in ways that we will never be able to re-verse. So we shouldn’t throw the baby out with the bath water and just turn our backs on the benefits of trade, which means we need to have efficient ports that are equipped to handle grow-ing amounts of trade globally. In conclusion, on the Water Re-sources Development Act, let me say again that I express my gratitude to Chairman INHOFE and Ranking Member B
OXER for this solid, bipartisan legisla-tion. I hope it passes the Senate soon. I trust it will be out of the Senate by the middle of next week.

JUSTICE AGAINST SPONSORS OF TERRORISM ACT Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this weekend is the 15th anniversary of the terrible attacks on our country on Sep-tember 11, 2001. It is impossible to for-get the horrible events of that day and the pain, grief, and mourning that our country felt. I think it is one of those seminal events in my life—and I am sure I am not alone—that I will always remember what I was doing and where I was when those planes hit the World Trade Center. It reminds me of when President John F. Kennedy was assas-sinated when I was much younger. I re-member where I was and what I was doing. I know communities across the coun-try will spend time on this anniversary of 9/11 honoring the lives of the vic-tims, their families, and the friends that they left behind, as well as the first responders and volunteers who put others before themselves in the wake of so much destruction. One way that Congress can honor the victims of that day and lend support to their families is by sending the Justice

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5449 September 8, 2016 
Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act to President Obama’s desk for his signa-ture. This bill would enable Americans and their family members to pursue justice against those who sponsor acts of terrorism on the U.S. homeland, such as that which occurred on Sep-tember 11, 2001. A few months ago this legislation passed unanimously in the Senate. Again, there is not much legislation that passes this body unanimously, but this did. I believe unanimous passage of this bill sends an unmistakable message that we will combat terrorism with every tool we have. Just as impor-tantly, we will make sure that simple justice is available to the victims of terrorist attacks on our soil by not erecting any unnecessary roadblocks to the pursuit of justice in the courts of law. I understand that the House of Rep-resentatives will vote on this legisla-tion, perhaps as soon as today or to-morrow, and I hope they send a similar message to the victims and their fami-lies on this 15th anniversary of 9/11. Finally, I hope the President will rethink his previous statements ex-pressing an intent to perhaps veto this legislation. It makes absolutely no sense to prevent the families who suf-fered losses as a result of terrorist at-tacks on our soils from having their day in court against whoever is respon-sible. This legislation does not purport to decide who is responsible but merely removes the impediments under the sovereign immunity act that prevent them from even presenting their case in court. It is time we help victims of ter-rorism in our country to seek justice, and it is time that the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act becomes the law of the land. With that, I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

WASTEFUL SPENDING Mr. COATS. Mr. President, today I return to the floor for talk No. 49—49 weeks of coming to the floor to talk about what we have described as ‘‘waste of the week.’’ We originally started this about 50 weeks ago in this cycle, with some skipping of weeks when we were not in session, trying to look at ways to make government more efficient and effective and to save taxpayer dollars. We set a goal of reaching $100 billion. Whether it was the Congressional Budget Office, whether it was the in-spectors general overseeing expendi-tures in the various agencies, we kept receiving these reports about taxpayer money that is wasted through waste, fraud, and abuse. We have talked about everything from the ridiculous to the really serious in terms of mismanage-ment, fraud, and waste that has oc-curred in this Federal Government. At a time when we cannot begin to balance our budget, when expenditures keep significantly exceeding revenues that are coming in no matter how much tax we collect, we find ourselves in a situation where we are continuing to borrow and borrow and borrow and borrow into the trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars—a truly unsustainable rate which will cause great harm to the American people at some point, if it hasn’t already. Clear-ly, it is holding down our ability to grow. Clearly, it is putting us in a situ-ation where expenditures on just pay-ing interest on the money we have to borrow continues to increase, depriving us of the opportunity to address some essential needs, such as infrastructure and basic science. NIH research, the CDC, and others are being squeezed be-cause we simply don’t have the funds available without continuing to go into debt. So this is No. 49. It is one of the more minor ones. Keep tuning in because next week we have a big one coming. We could come down here almost every day and talk about something, with the backlog of waste, fraud, and abuse documented by agencies that are non-partisan. They are not Republican. They are not Democratic. These are agencies that just deal with numbers, they just deal with facts, and they re-port to us, as Members of the Senate and the Congress, to make this avail-able to the public and to demonstrate that we could run a much better shop here and save the taxpayers a lot of money. Today I want to highlight abuse of a fund that exists within the Department of Health and Human Services. It is called the Nonrecurring Expenses Fund, otherwise known as NEF. ‘‘Non-recurring expense fund’’ is another fancy description the Federal Govern-ment has put out so that nobody can understand what it is, but we looked into this and found that the Non-recurring Expenses Fund is a fund that was created to place money which wasn’t used. There was money appro-priated by Congress for specific pur-poses, but they didn’t use all of it. In-stead of turning it back to the Treas-ury or the taxpayer, they said: Let’s create this fund that we can put this excess money in that hasn’t been used for the purpose it was designated. We will put it in a fund, and it will be there for use for some other purposes. Well, you know how government works: Never return a penny of the money that has been allocated to you by the Congress because the next time it comes up on an annual basis for your allocation, Congress may say: Well, they didn’t need all that money, so let’s give them less money next year. Oh, no, we don’t want to be in that position, so let’s make sure we find a way to spend it. Anyway, the money is sitting here in this slush fund called the Nonrecurring Expenses Fund, and it is supposed to be used for one-time expenses that come up on construction or IT projects and they can go to the fund and take some money out and use it for specified pur-poses. Well, all that was fine, I guess. I think it should have gone back to the Treasury. They did put a 5-year limit on it, and if it is still there after 5 years, it is supposed to go back to the Treasury but instead goes to this fund. Well, along came ObamaCare and all of its promises: Don’t worry, it is not going to cost you a penny more than what is already being paid. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. Your premiums won’t go up. All that was promised to us by the President. After every declarative thing he said, he added: Period. Not one penny increase, period. Keep your doctor, period. Done deal, folks. Trust us. Well, of course none of that hap-pened. ObamaCare seems to be col-lapsing under the weight of its own regulations and rules and operations. We read every day, almost every week of an exchange closing, of premiums skyrocketing. We are in for a very big surprise this fall. Some of this has been documented about the numbers coming in and the increases in premiums in the various States that are staggering. People are dropping out, people can’t afford to get in, and on and on it goes. In any event, under ObamaCare, as we all remember, when they set it up, the Web site didn’t work and people couldn’t make the phone calls, so the expenditures have been significantly higher than what we were told and what was projected, and we are talking about big money here. So the adminis-tration thought, well, let’s sort of look around, dig around, and maybe we will find a fund somewhere where there is some excess money we can use to prop up ObamaCare rather than having to go back to the Congress. Now, this is money appropriated for a specific purpose and not to be used or tapped into to pay for some other fail-ing program over here, but, of course, that didn’t stop the White House from doing that. It seems nothing does stop them, including laws passed by the Congress. In any event, they determined that, wow, here is a slush fund. Over the course of 4 years, it had about $1.3 bil-lion in it. So why don’t we just take it? It breaches the rules, maybe even the constitutionality of the fact that Con-gress appropriates money for specific purposes and puts it in specific places, and the administration doesn’t have the right to simply go over there and say: Oh, there is a pot of money over there. It has been sitting there. Even though the law says it should expire after 5 years and it has to go back to the Treasury, we will ignore that and

take that money, and we will apply it to pay for some of the bills on ObamaCare. And that is exactly what they did. So $1.3 billion was taken from a fund with-out a congressional vote—an abuse of power undermining Congress’s con-stitutional authority over appropria-tions. So here we are adding to our total the $1.3 billion that could have been saved, that was appropriated but not used. It could have been used for many things. We are talking about try-ing to find ways to pay for Zika fund-ing. This is a serious matter. Zika is having an impact. We have known that. The opposition here—the Demo-crats—have voted three times to pro-hibit us from going forward on that. But one of the issues here is the pay- for that we are under. If we are going to start a new program or appropriate more money to a program, we want to find something else to pay for it. Well, here is the perfect way to do it, and the amount of money is more than actu-ally requested. Mr. President, $1.3 bil-lion could be easily used as a pay-for for the Zika problem. That would get the CDC and get the States out there to deal with this very significant and difficult problem. But no, nope; it had to go to ObamaCare. It had to sort of once again fill the gap from expendi-tures that have gone all over the place. So what we have done is shown that this is money that we could have saved the taxpayer or that could have used for a better purpose, and under the waste of the week total here, we are now adding this $1.3 billion, which brings our total to $240 billion— $240,785,726,817. It just keeps going up. Here we are sitting on a total of nearly $241 billion of waste, fraud and abuse. As I said, fasten your seatbelts, folks; the next one coming in next week is a staggering number of documented waste, fraud and abuse. Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

ZIKA VIRUS FUNDING Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, we are in a race against time. The number of confirmed locally acquired Zika infec-tions in Florida now total 56. In Puerto Rico, it is estimated that 50 pregnant women are infected with Zika each day. There are now 67 countries and territories around the world reporting Zika cases. The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has announced that the agency has ex-hausted its current funds to combat the Zika virus, but thus far the Repub-licans have refused to work with the Democrats to actually provide the new funding in the race to find a vaccine. This is simply unacceptable. Last month, I visited Cabo Verde off the coast of Africa. I saw firsthand the devastating impacts of the Zika virus. Through a Catholic Relief Services pro-gram, I met with mothers and their in-fants suffering from microcephaly, the birth defect which causes smaller brains and other developmental defects in newborns. I was able to meet with two loving mothers: Dunia, the mother of Dara; and Suely, who is the mother of Senilson. Both babies were born on June 5, 2016. The first case of microcephaly associated with the Zika virus on Cabo Verde was detected in March, just 6 months after the disease was declared an epidemic in the coun-try. Now there are more than 7,500 re-ported cases of Zika on Cabo Verde, and the number continues to grow. Zika is a terrifying virus. It is the only known mosquito-borne virus that can cause birth defects and also be sex-ually transmitted. In addition to microcephaly, Zika also has been con-nected to neurological effects in indi-viduals of any age, including a link to the onset of Guillain-Barre syndrome, which can cause paralysis for months. One bite from an infected mosquito could damage the course of a life for-ever. We need only look back a few chap-ters in our own history books to under-stand how important it is for humanity to find a vaccine for a virus like Zika. In 1953, there were 35,000 annual cases of polio in the United States. Mothers and fathers all across America were frightened that their children would be next to contract the debilitating dis-ease. Two U.S. researchers, Dr. Albert Sabin and Dr. Jonas Salk, were locked in a historic race to develop a safe and effective polio vaccine. Fortunately, they were both successful. Today, those vaccines have virtually elimi-nated polio around the world. Now, in 2016, millions of parents and dozens of countries around the world are once again praying that the med-ical community can be catalyzed to de-velop a solution for today’s global dis-ease threat—the Zika virus. We are fortunate that in today’s new race for a cure, there are at least three leading Zika vaccine candidates. Last month, I toured the laboratories at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, which is collaborating with Walter Reed Army Institute of Re-search. Their vaccine candidate has been found to offer universal protec-tion against the Zika virus in labora-tory tests. The results were so prom-ising that the vaccine will be tested in a small group of individuals—human beings—this fall. There are two other vaccine can-didates also showing positive results. One is made by the National Institutes of Health and the other by Inovio Phar-maceuticals. Both are far enough along that they are already utilizing human subjects, but if the current trials in-volving just the small groups are suc-cessful, we will need to provide much more funding to cover the costs of ex-panding this research to thousands of participants. That next step in the Zika clinical trials, if both of these candidates that I just mentioned are successful, could cost upward of $100 million to $200 million, beginning as soon as this January, if these clinical trials are successful with small num-bers of human beings. That is a small amount of money when one considers that the cost of caring for one infant born with Zika-caused microcephaly will cost potentially up to $10 million through the life of that baby. Six months ago, knowing the imped-ing and impending threat of Zika once we entered the warm, mosquito-loving, hot summer months, fueled further by climate change, President Obama re-quested $1.9 billion in emergency funds from Congress to combat Zika, but in-stead of approving emergency funding at the start of the summer, Repub-licans, unfortunately, did not finish the business that we should have fin-ished before they recessed Congress for 7 weeks. Families cancelled their sum-mer vacations out of fear, while Repub-licans made Congress go on a vacation. Meanwhile, cases of Zika on our own soil, in Puerto Rico, and around the world ticked higher and higher. Whether it is Zika, Ebola, SARS, or the next global pandemic, we simply cannot treat every global health threat like a game of Whac-A-Mole. We need a sustainable and comprehensive emer-gency medical system that is put in place so we can respond to all emerging infectious disease threats. First, we need a Federal fund that is readily available for use when a global disease represents itself. Second, we need a single person at the White House responsible for organizing do-mestic efforts as well as liaising with our international partners in the face of an infectious disease pandemic. We did this on Ebola. We should do it for every global health threat. The truth is, though, that if on Ebola we had already had a pandemic re-sponse team in place, we probably could have cut the amount of death and harm that was done by that disease by a dramatic amount, but the most important thing we need right now is we need the congressional Republicans to stop playing politics and work with Democrats to pass a real and serious response to the Zika crisis, including emergency funding. The fastest way to do this is for the House to bring a bi-partisan, Senate-passed $1.1 billion compromise bill to address the Zika epidemic and bring it up for a vote. We have already passed that through the Senate. House Republicans should just take it up, vote on it, and we will get it done. It is only a matter of time be-fore the fear of local transmission in Florida becomes the reality for nearly every State in this Nation. That is why immediate funding is a critical compo-nent of the U.S. and global fight

against the Zika virus. We have the in-tellectual capacity to develop faster di-agnostic tests, efficient vaccines, and advanced therapeutics with Zika, but what we need now is the financial cer-tainty to support this kind of work in an accelerated way. The next pandemic that awaits the global community is just one frequent flier account away. This crisis demands that Congress pass a Zika funding package as soon as pos-sible. The continuation of vaccine de-velopment depends on it, our ability to stop the spread of the virus depends on it, and the lives of millions of people around the world depend on it. We won the race against polio in the 1950s. With accelerated funding, we have the opportunity today with these three vaccine candidates and others on the way to find a safe and effective so-lution to combat Zika by 2018. It is time to recognize the threat to human-kind and the impact such a harmful disease will have on an entire genera-tion of children by ensuring our 21st century scientists—our Sabins and Salks—have the funding they need to banish this virus to the history books.

HONORING NEBRASKA’S SOLDIERS WHO LOST THEIR LIVES IN COM-BAT Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise to continue my tribute to Nebraska’s heroes and the current generation of men and women who have given their lives defending our freedom in Iraq and Afghanistan. Each of these Nebraskans has a powerful story. 
CAPTAIN ROBERT J . YLLESCAS  
Today I will reflect upon the life of Army CPT Robert Yllescas of Osceola, NE. Rob’s life began in Guatemala, where he was born and raised. His mother Barbara would often bring young Rob to Nebraska during visits to her family in Osceola. When in Nebraska, Rob made plenty of friends, and he fell in love with the good life. He also met a young girl named Dena, who would one day become his wife. After graduating high school in Guatemala in 1996, Rob moved to Ne-braska permanently, and he enrolled at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. He also enlisted in the Nebraska Army Na-tional Guard. Rob had always wanted to serve in the military. He hoped to become a general one day. With this in mind, Rob enrolled in Army ROTC at UNL. Fate had something else in store for Rob during his college years too. He re-connected with Dena. They fell in love, were engaged a year later, and were married on July 29, 2000. Rob continued his studies and training, later grad-uating from UNL in May, 2001, receiv-ing his commission as a second lieuten-ant in the U.S. Army. That August, Rob and Dena wel-comed the birth of their first daughter, Julia. A short time later, Lieutenant Rob Yllescas began his first Active- Duty assignment on September 10, 2001. The very next day, everything changed for Rob, his family, and our Nation. America’s military priorities trans-formed dramatically, focusing on a new mission to combat terrorism. From the beginning of his military service, Rob’s commanding officers took note of his character and his lead-ership. One commander said, ‘‘Yllescas was an extraordinary person to be around. He brought that ‘lead from the front’ mentality into his work.’’ Another soldier who served with him said Rob ‘‘was strong as an ox with a smile as big as Nebraska.’’ Over the next several years, life be-came fast-paced for the Yllescas fam-ily. Rob deployed to Iraq in 2003 for a year, and then he returned for a second deployment in 2005, when the fighting grew more intense. Returning home to Nebraska in 2006, Rob continued to excel in the military, later graduating from Army Ranger School. Rob achieved the rank of captain and was assigned to the 6th Squadron of the 4th Cavalry Regiment. He took command of Bravo Troop, known as the Blackfoots. After nearly 2 years of training and earning the respect of his troops, Rob learned he would deploy to Afghani-stan. Shortly before his deployment, Rob and Dena welcomed their second daughter, Eva, on February 1, 2008. Upon arriving in Afghanistan, Captain Yllescas and Bravo Troop were sta-tioned at Camp Keating. This outpost, located in the eastern province of Nuristan, was known to many as the most dangerous territory in Afghani-stan. Camp Keating had been under constant attack since becoming oper-ational in 2006. Two prior camp com-manders had been killed before the Blackfoots arrived. Once again, Captain Yllescas made an immediate impact. His lead-from- the-front approach earned the respect of his men and improved the relations with the local Afghan leaders. Rob car-ried himself with a grace that would calm the nerves of these community leaders, and he often met with them unarmed and without that full battle rattle, but his charismatic style and the improved relations quickly became a threat to the enemy forces in the re-gion. Camp Keating, located in the Kamdesh District, was known to Amer-ican troops as the ‘‘Tip of the Spear.’’ Al Qaeda and militants moved freely through this area from safe havens in Pakistan. They filtered weapons and ammunition through this region to en-gage with coalition forces throughout Afghanistan. One soldier described his tour at Camp Keating, saying: ‘‘I was either extremely bored or extremely terri-fied.’’ For months, Captain Yllescas and his Blackfoots continued their focus on improving relations with the local Afghan community, and things seemed to be moving in the right direc-tion. As Captain Yllescas made progress, he also drew the attention of the enemy militants. By the fall of 2008, they were coordinating plans to re-move this threat to their supply chain. On October 28, 2008, a remotely con-trolled IED was detonated and seri-ously wounded Captain Yllescas as part of a planned assassination attempt. Rob was quickly evacuated out of Af-ghanistan. He was stabilized and moved to the Bethesda Naval Medical Center outside of Washington, DC. Throughout this time at the medical center, Dena remained at his side. Dur-ing Rob’s second week at Bethesda Medical Naval Center, President George W. Bush visited him on Novem-ber 10 and personally awarded him the Purple Heart. Rob’s best day occurred when his daughter Julia entered his hospital room. Just seeing Julia seemed to ease his mind. Ultimately, Rob’s severe leg and head wounds were too much to overcome. CPT Robert Yllescas died on December 1, 2008. A week later, the auditorium in Osceola, NE, was filled to capacity with people honoring their hometown hero. In the time since, Dena and Rob’s mother Barbara have become very ac-tive in the Gold Star family activities throughout Nebraska. His daughters Julia, who is now 15, and Eva, now 8, are also active in this cause. The two of them are well known for their beau-tiful voices and singing of patriotic songs at veterans events. For his service to our Nation, CPT Rob Yllescas earned many military decorations. Among the many impor-tant badges and decorations he earned, Captain Yllescas was awarded the Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Iraq Cam-paign Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal, and the Ranger Tab. CPT Rob-ert Yllescas embodied the pride of his State, served his country, and loved his family. I am honored to tell his story. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator from New Jersey.

ZIKA VIRUS FUNDING Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to voice my concern as an Amer-ican and my outrage as a grandfather- to-be about the lack of action to fund our response to the Zika epidemic. Zika has come to Miami, FL, and Con-gress needs to step up and provide the necessary funds to fight this terrible virus. Zika is like any other national emer-gency, and we are a nation that al-ways—always—responds to emer-gencies. While I am encouraged with the news that Republicans are seeing fit to do their job and drop some of the conditions in their Zika bill, which this body has voted down three times al-ready, there is no excuse for any fur-ther delay—no excuse for doing noth-ing while Americans face a risk that we have the power to mitigate.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5452 September 8, 2016 
The alarms have been ringing for months. We knew Zika wasn’t coming, but instead of being proactive and pre-pared for what was about to hit our shores, Republicans in Congress chose to poison our response with rightwing ideological policy riders that prevented us from appropriately addressing this issue. To make matters worse, rather than removing these unacceptable pro-visions from the bill, they simply chose to ignore it entirely and send Congress on vacation without acting. Since that time, we have had at least 43 instances of locally acquired Zika in the Miami area and nearly 16,000 lo-cally acquired cases in Puerto Rico. In the 50 United States, we now have 3,000 total cases, including those that were acquired outside of the country. Most frightening for families throughout our Nation is that we know of at least 1,751 cases of pregnant women infected with Zika—a truly devastating diagnosis for everyone involved. Today we have heard from the head of the National Institutes of Health’s Infectious Disease Institute that with-out immediate funding, the current on-going clinical trials into a Zika vac-cine will be forced to shut down—put-ting a halt to any real chance we have of developing a preventive vaccine in the near term. We, as Democrats, have fought the opposition to pass the President’s re-quest for $1.9 billion to battle Zika. In May, the Senate, in a bipartisan com-promise, agreed by a vote of 89 to 8 to fund $1.1 billion in response funding, but that bipartisan agreement was de-railed in the House of Representatives, where Republicans insisted on adding a poison pill provision that had nothing to do with Zika and everything to do with seizing the opportunity to pursue an anti-family political social agenda that would prohibit family planning clinics from getting Zika funds—di-rectly impacting the health of women in the most high-risk areas at a time that we know Zika can be contracted not only by a bite of a mosquito but by sexual intercourse. Every major health organization, from the Centers for Disease Control to the World Health Organization, to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, has recommended that the best course of action is to in-crease access to contraception and family planning services to decrease transmission of the virus. Today I call, once again, on the ma-jority leader and the Speaker of the House to address this crisis now. Let’s do our jobs and help keep the American people safe, healthy, and secure by ad-dressing this crisis with everything we have and all we can provide to women and families who face an emergency situation no less important and no less threatening than tornadoes, hurri-canes, wildfires, or superstorms such as Sandy. We need to quickly and decisively re-spond. We are already behind. We have lost critical time and sacrificed the progress we should have already made to political obstructionism that has prevented us from providing what we need to ensure maximum protection. We need to act now, not tomorrow, not the next day, not next week—now. But here we are 7 months after the Presi-dent’s original call for an emergency response to Zika and 5 months—long before Miami had become ground zero for the virus in the continental United States—5 months before the first con-firmed cases of locally acquired trans-mission occurred and began to spread. My Republican colleagues talk a lot about national security, about defend-ing this Nation and its people and I agree with them, but there are many ways to defend America from the many threats we face, and Zika is one of them. If we believe what we say about keeping America and Americans safe, then quickly passing the necessary funding to defeat Zika is in the per-sonal security interest of the United States. We are dealing with a virus that has tremendous costs. We do not yet know all the potential birth defects that Zika can cause, and we do not know all the potential effects of microcephaly to a newborn or the life expectancy of a Zika baby, but the health care costs for the 31-year-old mother in Hacken-sack, NJ, who gave birth to the first Zika baby born in the United States, will, no doubt, be staggering—in the millions of dollars. At the end of the day, protecting our people from an insidious virus that ul-timately can affect the next generation that is being born is in fact protecting the public. In my mind, it is not ac-ceptable to play politics with a na-tional emergency. We can have all the debates in the world about family plan-ning and access to women’s health care, but we are delaying the possibili-ties of a vaccine being prepared, of mosquito abatement to limit the popu-lation of infected insects. We are deny-ing care to those women who could be or are infected. We need to act now and pass the necessary funding just as we do in any national emergency, against any threat or any enemy, and Zika is a real and direct threat. I can talk from personal experience. It has affected my family and me. My daughter lives in Miami. She is now 6 months pregnant with her first child, and I am deeply concerned about her health, her well-being and the well- being of my first grandchild. While this moment is a moment of great joy, every young mother already has con-cerns about the normal course of events: Will my child be healthy? Will my child be safe and free from illness? These are normal concerns, but Zika adds a new dimension to those normal worries, and we could have done some-thing to stop it if it were not for Re-publican obstructionism in the House. Shame on us that we have not done all we could to mitigate the fear that young mothers are feeling, and that fear is palpable. It cannot be ignored, not by me, not by any father, not by any grandfather, and it should not be ignored by Republicans in Congress. This isn’t for me or my daughter. It is too late for her to take advantage of a vaccine or cure, but it is not too late for other mothers and their children across this country. How can we, in good conscience, not do all we can to attack this problem as best as we can? My daughter has taken precautions and is doing everything possible to pro-tect herself, but this issue goes beyond the personal aspect of what is hap-pening in my family, and while having a child is a moment of great joy, any woman who is pregnant in Miami—ac-tually, in reality, this knows no limita-tions geographically. It will continue to spread across the country. It is an added risk that is very real and should be of deep concern to all of us. We want to protect our children. We talked about that in many different di-mensions in different debates, whether it is about education or health care, and now we are doing something that every person who is a father or may be a grandfather understands very clearly. Every woman who serves in the Senate and has had a child understands very well the whole emotional process that goes on, like worrying about that child, taking care of themselves, hav-ing the right nutrition, and doing all the prenatal care they have to do so they can have a child who is born healthy. Women throughout the country are doing their best to protect themselves to the extent that they can, but not all of them have the ability to do some-thing about it like those of us in this Chamber. It is our responsibility, obli-gation, and duty to act in the interest of every family who cannot do what we can by simply passing this legislation and doing it now. The alarms have been ringing for months. We knew Zika was coming, but instead of being proactive and pre-pared for what was about to hit our shores, Republican leaders in Congress chose to ignore the warning signs and adjourn Congress without acting. Now we are back and our Nation faces an emergency. We are here. There are no excuses. There is no political justifica-tion for inaction. At the end of the day, lives are at stake and we swore to pro-tect every American. I call on my col-leagues in both Chambers to put this nonsense aside, stop the pointless po-litical posturing, and do your job. We are living in a political season that has devolved into a race to the bottom. Let’s not participate in that race by letting the rigid, fundamen-talist social agenda with the most ex-treme elements in our politics overrule common sense and shared values in the face of a crisis and danger to America. We know what is right. We know what we have to do, and now is the time to do it. It is with that hope that we break the shackles of this absurd political obstructionist chain that is holding us back from doing what is right and necessary.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5453 September 8, 2016 
I look forward to next week—since it seems we will be out of session now— ultimately addressing the concerns that women and families have across this country. We hear a lot about the protection of the unborn. Well, this is the very essence of being able to pro-tect the unborn from an insidious dis-ease that can affect their lives forever. I hope the conscience of the Senate will ultimately move itself to its bet-ter judgment. With that, I yield the floor and sug-gest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

WRDA Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time on the floor to first express my appreciation to the leadership for bringing forward the Water Resources Development Act. I know we are going to have a chance to vote on cloture on Monday, and I just want to thank the leadership for making the bill available for floor time. I also congratulate Senator I
NHOFE , the chairman of our committee, and Senator B
OXER , the ranking Democrat, because I am a proud member of the Environment and Public Works Com-mittee that has recommended the Water Resources Development Act to the full Senate. The process that was used by Chair-man I
NHOFE and Ranking Member B
OXER is the way the legislative proc-ess should work in the U.S. Senate. We had a very open process, where many Members—all of the members of our committee and many other Members of the Senate—participated in one of the most important bills that we consider during the congressional session. It deals with the conservation and devel-opment of our water resources and au-thorizes the construction projects for the improvement of rivers and harbors. In other words, this bill very much af-fects every State in the Nation because it affects our economy, our environ-ment, clean water, and public health. It is an extremely important piece of legislation. When we look at the content of this bill, we see that the leaders of our com-mittee were able to work out the right types of compromises so that we don’t have a contentious bill before the U.S. Senate. We have a bill that is focused on the purposes of WRDA, to conserve and develop our water resources and to authorize the construction projects for our rivers and harbors. For Maryland this bill is particularly important. When we look at the WRDA bill, so many projects and so many op-portunities in my State are involved. In Maryland we have the Port of Balti-more, which is the economic hub. I was there last week visiting the Port of Baltimore. I am there frequently. There are tens of thousands of jobs there. It is one of the most active ports in our country. It depends on the WRDA bill for the authorizations of the projects to keep the Port of Balti-more competitive and able to do the important economic work of our re-gion. So for the economic impact that our ports have on America, and cer-tainly the Port of Baltimore and Mary-land, this bill is particularly impor-tant. I make a point of being in Ocean City, MD, during the Association of County Conferences and had a chance to see firsthand the impact of these re-nourishing programs that are impacted by the WRDA bill. The protection of the Chesapeake Bay in my State, the largest estuary in our hemisphere, is very much impacted by this bill. The public health of the people of Maryland and indeed our Nation are very much impacted by the Water Resources De-velopment Act. So let me talk specifically about what is included in this bill that will help the people of Maryland and the people of our country. First, to the eco-nomic impact—as I said earlier, the passage of this bill will provide for job growth and economic growth in our country. It also will protect our public health. The dredging and maintenance of our rivers and harbors are para-mount to this. As a result of the pre-vious WRDA bills and continuing to this WRDA bill, we in our region are able to maintain our channels. We also have been able to find locations where we can put the dredge material. For example, in Maryland we had a national model for what we did at Pop-lar Island. Poplar Island was a dis-appearing island in the Chesapeake Bay that was basically all submerged. It was an environmental negative. It was a liability. Through the use of de-posits of dredge material, Poplar Island has been converted not just to a dredge site but an environmental restoration site and has helped very much in deal-ing with the diversity of species that we find in the Chesapeake Bay region. Through WRDA authorizations and ap-propriations, we have been able to con-vert a negative on our environment to a positive and at the same time find a way to use dredge materials to keep our harbors open. That is a win-win- win situation, and it is those types of projects that are included in the Water Resources Development Act. But there are many other commu-nities. In Maryland we have the Port of Baltimore—I talked about that—but we have a lot of smaller ports and har-bors in Maryland. During the break I visited Salisbury, MD. They have a port. They want to expand their port so they can not only import products as they do, but use it as an export loca-tion. In Salisbury, they have Chesa-peake Shipbuilding, which is one of the premier shipbuilding facilities we have, and they benefit from what is done in Salisbury Harbor. By way of example, I want to point out to the people I rep-resent in Maryland the important eco-nomic projects that are very much im-pacted by the passage of the Water Re-sources Development Act. The economic impact goes beyond just what we do in our harbors; it also involves our shoreline protection. While I was in Ocean City, I visited with Mayor Meehan, the mayor of Ocean City, who pointed out to me what happened during the last storm. We get storms along the East Coast; we always get storms. But he pointed out to me the impact that the beach re-nourishment programs have had in minimizing damage to property and to the shoreline. We invest in beach re-nourishment as basically an insurance policy against damage that could be much greater. We could have our money back and much more through the investments we make in beach re-nourishment in the Water Resources Development Act. I can state that peo-ple who have their homes and busi-nesses in Ocean City, MD, very much appreciate the fact that this Congress is paying attention to this issue. Then I can go to Smith Island. Smith Island is the last habitable island in Maryland on the Chesapeake Bay. It is eroding, and it has serious issues about its sustainability. For the people who live on Smith Island, it is not only their homes but part of the history of our State and Nation that they are pre-serving. We have provided in the WRDA bill a way that we can do living shorelines so a community like Smith Island continues to be safe from the devastation we are seeing with erosion. I am proud of all those provisions that are in this WRDA bill that will help us deal with those issues. As I pointed out earlier, the WRDA bill is important for our Chesapeake Bay. The Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in our hemisphere. I talk about it frequently on the floor of the U.S. Senate. It has been declared by many presidents as a national treasure. It is a national treasure. We have a com-prehensive program in partnership with the Federal Government and with the State governments of five States and the District of Columbia. We have a partnership with local governments, with the private sector, and we are making progress. In this bill, to give one example, we increased the authorization for oyster recovery programs. I was proud to offer this amendment from $60 million to $100 million, almost doubling the dol-lars that are going to be available for oyster recovery programs. Why is that important? I think most Members un-derstand that oysters are cash crops. It is nice to be able to harvest oysters and be able to serve them and to use them as watermen do. So we are in-creasing dramatically the number of oysters that can be harvested, using new methods, including ways in which we can seed oysters off the bottom, as

well as on the bottom of the river, and it is taking. We are seeing our oyster crops increase dramatically, which is helping the economy of the watermen of Maryland in our region. Oysters are also a filtering agent for the Chesapeake Bay. They cleanse the water. They give us a better quality water in the Chesapeake Bay, which helps all species and the future of the Chesapeake Bay. We were down to a small percentage of the historic crop of oysters when we started the recovery program. Now that we have been in the recovery program, we are recovering a significant number of oysters. We are not there yet; we have got a lot more to do. But this extra Federal help in oyster recovery will certainly help in that regard. Oysters also, by the way, build the infrastructure for the different species within the Bay. They actually become what the living organisms can live on and produce the type of food chain nec-essary for a healthy diversity within the Chesapeake Bay. So I was particu-larly pleased that the committee rec-ommended my amendment to increase our programs for oyster recovery. This bill also deals with clean water. In the 111th Congress, when I was chair of the Water Subcommittee of the En-vironment and Public Works Com-mittee, I filed S. 1005, which deals with our State revolving funds. Let me ex-plain for my colleagues—I think most know—that the State revolving funds are the major Federal partnership to help local governments deal with safe drinking water and clean water. Wastewater treatment is done through State revolving funds. We have taken some actions in order to mod-ernize this program. In this WRDA bill, we incorporate many of the elements of the legislation that I filed that will up-date and improve the revolving loan programs. It makes it much more pre-dictable and flexible for our States, so they can plan their projects accord-ingly, which is critically important for safe drinking water and economic growth. We expand the eligibility to in-clude preconstruction, to deal with re-placement and rehab, and for the first time allow these funds to be used for source water protection plans so that we actually can make sure we are get-ting safe water into our water supply. We also allow for the prioritization of sustainability, and we provide incen-tives for water efficiency that is cost saving and uses better technology, so that the way we handle our water can be done with less leakage, less waste, less energy, and more efficiency, which saves money. There is $900 million authorized for the Water Resources Research Act, and I was pleased to offer that to the com-mittee, and I was pleased it was in-cluded in the final bill that is before the committee. Let me talk for a moment about pub-lic health. The WRDA bill also deals with public health, which is very im-portant. I know every Member is aware of what happened in Flint, MI, on lead poisoning. We know how tragic that was. We know how many families and children were directly impacted by de-cisions that were made there. This bill does much to deal with the tragedies in Flint, but Flint is not unique in the risk factors to our children on the ex-posures to lead. I can give Baltimore City as an ex-ample. The schools in Baltimore City have turned off their water fountains because it would not be safe for the children in schools to use the water fountains that are there. The pipes that lead into the schools are contami-nated by lead. The city doesn’t have the resources to replace those pipes that come in and therefore have closed the water fountains and use bottled water instead. So we have problems in our water in-frastructure in America as it relates to the vulnerability of exposure to exces-sive lead. I think the Presiding Officer is aware that there is no acceptable level of lead in a child’s blood. We know that lead in the blood of children has an impact on their capacity to grow. I will give one example. Freddie Gray, who was tragically killed over a year ago in a police incident that caused a disturbance in Baltimore, had high levels of lead from his youth in his blood. These are matters we could take steps to correct, and this WRDA bill does exactly that. First, it takes many of the provisions of the bill that I filed working with many of my colleagues. It called for true leadership. We put to-gether many of our ideas on what we can do to combat lead poisoning. I put that bill together with my colleagues and filed that bill with Senator I
NHOFE  and Senator B
OXER ’s leadership. We were able to incorporate many of those provisions—most of those provisions into this WRDA bill that is now before the U.S. Senate so that we will be able to give public notice and transparency when public officials discover an unac-ceptably high level of lead in the water system. The public will know, and they can avoid the risks. We are providing money for testing of schools, testing of childcare centers, and individual children. In Maryland every child between 1 and 2 years of age will be tested to see whether they have excessive lead levels in their blood. There is truly an all-out effort. There is one provision I want to un-derscore. There is $300 million in this bill so we can secure the last line of pipe coming from the main sources into homes. There are a lot of individ-uals, families, and low-income families who live in homes where the water sys-tem itself is safe but the pipes that lead into their home produce lead and subject their families to lead poi-soning. They don’t have the resources to correct it, and this bill provides a program where low-income families can get help in correcting the pipes that feed into their house to make sure they are lead-free so their children aren’t susceptible to lead poisoning. These are all good-news issues. I ap-preciate the time and attention given to this, but I wanted to emphasize that this bill is a very important bill. It contains issues, as I said, from pro-tecting our environment to our public health, to our economy. It is a bill that deserves the strong support of the Members of the Senate. I hope my col-leagues in the House will also approve this bill. It reflects the hard work and leader-ship of Senator INHOFE and Senator B
OXER and the Environment and Public Works Committee and many Members of the Senate. I am very proud to sup-port this legislation. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

HONORING CORPORAL BILL COOPER Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise to honor the service and sacrifice of Corporal Bill Cooper of the Sebastian County Sheriff’s Office. Corporal Coo-per gave his life in the line of duty on August 10, 2016. As a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps who spent 15 years in the Sebastian County Sheriff’s Of-fice and 6 years with the Ft. Smith Po-lice Department, Bill Cooper was a true public servant. Corporal Cooper was remembered by his colleagues as a model law enforce-ment officer who did things the right way. He loved the men and women he worked with, and he exemplified what many in law enforcement aspire to, which was being an officer who never failed to show how much he cared about his community. As such, he continued to serve long after he was eligible to retire. Cooper was also a devoted husband, father, and grandfather who loved his family very, very much. Last month, Corporal Coo-per responded to a domestic call in-volving an armed suspect near Hack-ett, AR. The suspect opened fire on Cooper and Hackett police chief Dar-rell Spells. Corporal Cooper was fatally wounded. Chief Spells and Greenwood K–9 officer Kina were injured. The suspect later surrendered and was taken into police custody. In a true testament to the im-pact that Corporal Cooper had on so many who served with him or knew him, he was laid to rest at a funeral service attended by several thousand people, including law enforcement offi-cers from across the State and around the country. His colleagues and friends

remembered him to have always treat-ed citizens with respect and dignity, while also being a loyal partner and friend. While our hearts break for those who knew him, we also respect and admire Corporal Cooper for his lifetime of service. He truly was someone who ran toward danger in order to protect oth-ers. Corporal Cooper was a hero, and today we honor his sacrifice. My thoughts and prayers are with his wife Ruth, his son Scott, along with many other family members, friends, and col-leagues in the law enforcement com-munity. I humbly and sincerely offer my con-dolences and my gratitude to them as they grieve for Bill. Bill was a class-mate of mine at the Northside High School in Fort Smith. We as a class are very, very proud of him for his sac-rifice, for our safety, but also, and cer-tainly as important, the way he lived his life. May we always remember Cor-poral Cooper’s life and legacy of serv-ice. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.

U.S. INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today the U.S. International Trade Commission, or the USITC, is celebrating its 100th anniversary. That makes today an ap-propriate day for us to acknowledge the distinguished service that this independent and nonpartisan Federal agency has provided, and continues to provide, in the field of international trade. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I concur with Senator H
ATCH and also congratu-late the USITC on its centennial and commend the agency for its service over the last century. Established by the Congress as the U.S. Tariff Commission on September 8, 1916, the agency was reconfigured and redesignated as the USITC by the Trade Act of 1974. As mandated by Con-gress, the USITC performs three prin-cipal functions: No. 1, fairly and objec-tively administer U.S. trade remedy laws within its mandate; No. 2, provide the Congress, the President, and the United States Trade Representative with independent analysis, informa-tion, and support concerning matters related to international trade, tariffs, and U.S. competitiveness; and No. 3 maintain the Harmonized Tariff Sched-ule of the United States. By successfully executing these func-tions, the USITC performs a valuable service to the U.S. Government and the American people. Those of us in Con-gress particularly appreciate the high-ly technical data and analyses that the USITC provides to help inform our for-mulation of U.S. trade policy. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, of course, the core of the USITC’s success derives from the agency’s people. For decades now, the impressive and skilled com-missioners and staff at the USITC have driven the agency’s success. We con-gratulate the USITC for reaching this centennial milestone and for accom-plishing a well-deserved tenure of valu-able and professional service. f 
RECOGNIZING THE JEFFERSONTOWN POLICE DE-PARTMENT ANGEL PROGRAM Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, I have spoken many times on this floor about the threat that opioid abuse rep-resents to our country. Rates of sub-stance abuse have been on the rise in recent years, and Kentucky has been hit particularly hard by this epidemic. A recent State report from the Ken-tucky Office of Drug Control Policy said that, last year, over 1,200 deaths in the Commonwealth were caused by drug abuse. Well, I am glad to share with my col-leagues some good news in the fight against opioid abuse in Kentucky. This August, I visited with and saw up close a program that is changing how law en-forcement deals with drug addiction, a program that is saving lives. It is the Jeffersontown Angel Program, an ini-tiative spearheaded by the Jeffersontown, KY, Police Department. At the Jeffersontown Police Depart-ment, a priority has been placed on getting treatment for folks who re-quest help for their addiction to opi-ates by connecting them with local treatment facilities. In many cases, those with substance-abuse disorders can be taken immediately to a treat-ment facility to start their recovery. People who abuse drugs can also turn over their drugs or drug equipment without being charged with a crime. The new Jeffersontown Police De-partment Angel Program is the first of its kind in Kentucky. It is modeled after a successful program launched in Gloucester, MA, in 2015, which has so far referred more than 450 people to treatment and produced a 33 percent reduction in property crime rates. That evidence was enough to con-vince Jeffersontown Police Chief Ken Hatmaker. ‘‘When you can have a 33 percent drop in property crime,’’ he says, ‘‘I’m going to listen.’’ While the Jeffersontown Police De-partment remains strenuously com-mitted to investigating, pursuing, and arresting drug traffickers to the fullest extent of the law, the Angel Program helps reduce those traffickers’ clientele by working to remove the stigma of ad-diction and making it easier to access recovery programs. Fighting drug abuse is a cause I have embraced here in the Senate as well, and it has been a focus of mine for many years. I have traveled through-out the Commonwealth speaking with people, learning about the scope of sub-stance abuse in my State, and working with Kentuckians to combat it. A few years ago, I convened a listen-ing session in northern Kentucky, a re-gion particularly hard hit by this epi-demic, to hear from informed Kentuck-ians in the medical, public health, and law-enforcement fields. I testified be-fore the Senate’s Drug Caucus to share my findings with my colleagues. I have also met with the Nation’s Di-rector of National Drug Control Pol-icy—better known as the drug czar— and successfully persuaded him to visit Kentucky to see firsthand the damage done by drugs. His visit and greater Federal funding for law enforcement in Kentucky have both been a part of a multilayered strategy to stop drug trafficking. I also made it a priority to pass the Comprehensive Addiction and Recov-ery Act, or CARA, a bill I was proud to see recently signed into law. CARA is a comprehensive approach to tackling the opioid drug epidemic that bolsters treatment, prevention and recovery ef-forts, and gives law enforcement tools to help those already suffering with ad-diction and help prevent more senseless loss of life. CARA authorizes new grants for vital, lifesaving programs to help treat those suffering from drug addiction. It also includes several important policy reforms. It will expand treatment by giving prescribing authority to nurse practitioners and physician assistants to administer medication-assisted treatments for opioid addiction. It will increase the availability of naloxone, which can instantly reverse a drug overdose, to law enforcement agencies and other first responders. And it will strengthen and enhance prescription drug monitoring programs to crack down on ‘‘doctor shopping.’’ Substance abuse destroys lives. It in-creases crime, rips apart families, and leaves too many bodies in its wake. I want to commend the Jeffersontown Police Department for launching the Angel Program and leading the way in Kentucky in efforts to battle substance abuse. With the good work done by the Jeffersontown Police Department, along with the continued efforts we are doing here in Congress, I believe we can fight back against this scourge of ad-diction, and reduce its devastating ef-fects. The Louisville Courier-Journal re-cently published an article describing the Jeffersontown Police Department’s Angel Program. I ask unanimous con-sent that said article be printed in the R
ECORD . There being no objection, the mate-rial was ordered to be printed in the R

[From The Louisville Courier Journal, Aug. 25, 2016] J-T
OWN’SNEWSTRATEGY TOCOMBAT  A
DDICTION  (By Amanda Beam) Sgt. Brittney Garrett wants to save lives through changing attitudes. Her influence can be seen in the waiting area inside the Jeffersontown Police Depart-ment, the law-enforcement agency for which she works. Pamphlets about overcoming sub-stance abuse and local addiction support groups can be found on most every table there. This lobby welcomes with acceptance, not doubt, supporting the revolutionary initia-tive Garrett has embraced. It’s called The Angel Program, and it’s re-defining the way law enforcement views drug addiction. Through cooperation with community partners, the initiative gives resources to people searching for sobriety. During their intake hours of 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday, the J-Town PD serves as a conduit to connect those who seek therapy for their addiction with pro-viders who can access and provide treatment for their needs. Folks, in most cases, will be immediately taken to a treatment facility to begin their recovery. People who use can also turn over drugs for disposal to the police without fear of re-prisal. ‘‘The hard part isn’t coming in,’’ Garrett said of those who enter the station to obtain assistance. ‘‘The hard part is getting through your treatment.’’ Certain exclusions do apply. If you have an active warrant, a felony sex conviction, a violent history or are under 18 years old, you may not qualify. Garrett invites those with questions to phone the station at (502) 267– 0503. Since the program’s August 1, 2016 start, seven people have entered the program and been placed directly into residential rehab facilities. No wait lists. No jail. No criminalization of their illness. Just help is received. ‘‘We have to find innovative ways to deal with the heroin problem,’’ said Garrett, the Angel Program Coordinator. ‘‘A lot of it comes down to just being empathetic, com-passionate and educated of what we’re deal-ing with.’’ 
A NATIONAL SCOURGE  What J-Town and other communities across the nation are dealing with is an epi-demic. Heroin use continues to rise, and overdoses soar. Jefferson County on average experiences one overdose death each day. In addition to health concerns, crime has risen in the town of about 27,000. Increased thefts, general incidence reports and car ac-cidents occur as ramifications of drug use. Garrett has even seen an uptick in more seri-ous offenses as well. ‘‘Especially on the level of law enforce-ment, when you deal with people with sub-stance abuse disorder on the street, it’s al-ways bad. It’s never good. It’s someone com-mitting a crime,’’ Garrett said. ‘‘It’s hard for us to see the human side of addiction, that you committed a crime be-cause of your addiction.’’ But humanizing those with substance- abuse issues is a hallmark of the program’s creation. 
THE BEGINNING  The Gloucester Police Department in Mas-sachusetts established the now national ini-tiative in 2015, with the aim of targeting the demand side of the drug problem. Get help for those who are addicted so they stop using, and both supply and crime should go down too. Furthermore, law-enforcement agencies would face less strain on their lim-ited resources, and be able to concentrate on serious criminal cases. Not only did they find these actions more compassionate, but also more successful. So far, roughly 400 people have been re-ferred to treatment facilities through the Gloucester program. As predicted, drug-re-lated crimes in the surrounding area fell by more than 30 percent. Costs for treatment also fall far below the price of housing pris-oners, providing another incentive. ‘‘If you have a choice between a bed in in-carceration, or a bed in treatment, I’m for the bed in treatment,’’ said Jeffersontown Police Chief Ken Hatmaker. Enforcement still remains important, he added. When people break the law, con-sequences must be faced. But providing treatment opportunities to those suffering from substance-use disorder can stop many of the more serious crimes from happening in the first place, a bal-ancing act between service and enforcement that Hatmaker has learned to embrace. ‘‘That’s what it took for me to buy in was the education,’’ the chief said. ‘‘When you can have a 33 percent drop in property crime, I’m going to listen.’’ THE IMPACT  Changing perceptions isn’t always easy for law enforcement or those who find them-selves addicted. At times, both face stereo-types. The program aims to correct these bi-ases and facilitate greater communication between the police department and the larg-er community. ‘‘People tend to believe that (substance- abuse disorder) is a moral failing, that peo-ple chose to have a life of destruction, which couldn’t be further from the truth,’’ said Tara Moseley, a recovery advocate and Angel Program volunteer. Moseley understands the impact of addic-tion. For more than five years, the 30-year- old Louisville resident has been in recovery. Now, through her work in organizations like Young People in Recovery and the Angel Program, she tells others with the illness that better days can be in their future. ‘‘People need to know there is a way out and that there is hope,’’ she said. ‘‘A pro-gram like the Angel Program, they actually do all that stuff for you. They’re going to help you and take you where you need to go and make sure you are in somewhere and it’s right now.’’ The immediacy of the initiative plays a key role in its ingenuity. Those seeking as-sistance oftentimes face long wait lists to get into residential treatment. Not so with the Angel Program. ‘‘Unfortunately, as it relates to the drugs of choice today, it’s very possible they are risking their lives by waiting on a waiting list,’’ said Jennifer Hancock, president and CEO of Volunteers of America (VOA) Mid- States, a non-profit partner of Angel Pro-gram. In addition to providing a staff member to help with the station’s intake center three days a week, VOA also has placed several of the referrals from the program into its fa-cilities. ‘‘It’s important that we strike while the iron is hot and make sure we’re providing them with immediate access. Otherwise . . . then they’re waiting without the security and safety net of a very structured and ac-countable program, and it’s extremely com-mon that they will continue using.’’ Through several different initiatives that focus on specific populations, VOA maintains 185 residential treatment beds in Louisville and Lexington. More, though, are needed. Only additional funding can alleviate the overwhelming demand. And that’s the tricky part. The J-Town Angel Program only facili-tates people finding treatment. Funding of that treatment remains with the patient and the medical provider. Some facilities have pledged scholarships to the program, and many others can enroll patients in Medicaid or work with them to manage costs if they can’t afford the treatment. But funding doesn’t come close to meeting the demand. ‘‘If we have people lined up at our door, that’s great,’’ Garrett said. ‘‘But if we can’t take them somewhere because there are no beds available, no funding for these treat-ment centers, we’re just turning people away at that point and doing the opposite of what we’re wanting to do.’’ Current legislation in Congress called the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act could give more money to address these broader funding problems for treatment ini-tiatives. But until that occurs, the Angel Program will do its best to continue combat-ting the effects of the addiction epidemic one life at a time. ‘‘We’ve always been counselors and social workers as law enforcement, mediating con-flict and these types of things, but this is a whole new level,’’ Garrett said. ‘‘We’re enter-ing into a new realm.’’ f 
REMEMBERING SEPTEMBER 11 Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is hard to believe that 15 years ago this Sun-day the Twin Towers fell, smoke from the Pentagon could be seen from miles away, and a plane went down in a Pennsylvania field. For those who lived through that horrible day, the memory still feels fresh. Of course, this is especially true for those who lost loved ones. This week-end, Americans across the country will gather to remember the thousands of innocent lives that were taken so cal-lously and indiscriminately in those terrorist attacks. And we remember the first responders, law enforcement, intelligence, and military personnel who work every single day to keep our country safe. This year, we must also take a mo-ment to remember the spirit that united us in the days after the attacks. Americans of all races, religions, and backgrounds stood together in soli-darity to support one another and stand against the cowardice of ter-rorism. Following the attacks, Presi-dent George W. Bush visited a mosque. At a joint session of Congress, he re-minded Americans that ‘‘no one should be singled out for unfair treatment or unkind words because of their ethnic background or religious faith.’’ In the years after September 11, our country did not always live up to those words, but we must remember the ideals, val-ues, and humanity that sustained us through those first dark days. In today’s political environment, it is easy to lose sight of that common spir-it. Some are trying hard to divide us. A Federal judge has been accused of bias because of his ethnic heritage. Reli-gious and ideological tests for visitors to the United States are discussed as though they are serious policy pro-posals. The sacrifices of war heroes and

Gold Star families are belittled. And that is just the beginning. On this 15th anniversary of Sep-tember 11, we must reject this divisive-ness. While Americans will continue to mourn the loss of so many on Sep-tember 11 and in the wars that fol-lowed, we will never lose sight of the core principles that so many genera-tions of Americans fought to protect. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, this Sunday we will solemnly observe the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks that killed 2,977 people from 93 different nations and injured more than 6,000 others at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and a field near Shanksville, PA. For those of us old enough to remember, the events of that horrific day are seared into our memo-ries as if they just happened yesterday. Over 3,000 children lost at least one parent on 9/11. Many of these children were too young at the time to com-prehend what was happening or to re-member it today, even though they suf-fered such a devastating personal loss. According to the Census Bureau, near-ly 59 million Americans have been born since 9/11. Most of these young people learn about 9/11 in school, much the same way an earlier generation of Americans learned about Pearl Harbor. For those younger Americans who don’t remember 9/11, I think it is im-portant for them to understand that the attacks did not just test our char-acter; they revealed it. The worst at-tack in American history brought out the best in the American people. Amer-icans responded with courage and self- sacrifice, with charity and compassion and volunteerism and with resolve. There were incredible acts of indi-vidual heroism. ‘‘Numerous civilians in all stairwells, numerous burn [victims] are coming down. We’re trying to send them down first . . . We’re still head-ing up.’’ So said New York City Fire Department Captain Patrick ‘‘Paddy’’ Brown, Ladder 3, as he and 11 of his men climbed an emergency stairwell in the North Tower, making it to the 40th floor before the Tower collapsed. His remains were recovered 3 months later. Three hundred and forty-three mem-bers of the New York City Fire Depart-ment and 71 law enforcement officers gave their lives while helping evacuate 25,000 people to safety. ‘‘Are you guys ready? Let’s roll.’’—so said 32-year Todd Beamer as he and other passengers aboard United Air-lines flight 93 rushed the cockpit in an attempt to regain control of the jet, which the four al-Qaeda hijackers ap-parently intended to crash into the White House or the U.S. Capitol. The heroism of the flight 93 passengers un-doubtedly saved thousands of lives here in Washington. Todd’s wife, Lisa, was one of at least 17 pregnant women who became widows on 9/11; Morgan Kay Beamer was born on January 9, 2002. There were incredible acts of charity and compassion and volunteerism. The National September 11 Memorial & Mu-seum at the World Trade Center has documented some of them. Ada Rosario Dolch was the principal of a high school located just two blocks from the World Trade Center. On 9/11, she helped to evacuate 600 students safely; mean-while, Ada’s sister Wendy Wakeford was killed. To honor Wendy’s memory, Ada helped to build a school in Afghan-istan that opened in 2005. In 2006, Tad Millinger started the ‘‘Walk to Raise’’ campaign with high school friends Brandon Reinhard, Chad Coulter, and Dustin Dean. They walked 650 miles from their hometown of Rossford, OH, to New York City to raise money for the National Sep-tember 11 Memorial & Museum at the World Trade Center and the Flight 93 National Memorial in Pennsylvania. Tad is now a volunteer firefighter and emergency medical technician in his hometown. Sonali Beaven was 5 years old when her father, Alan, was killed on Flight 93. ‘‘My loss is central to my identity,’’ Sonali has said. ‘‘In a sense, each choice I’ve made since that day has been crafted by my experience. But, be-cause of my loss and the nature of my loss, I choose love and life every day. Because of my father and the other passengers, I can’t let fear limit me. I have to take today and every day and try to improve the world we live in and spread the ideology of love.’’ There has been resolve. We resolved as a nation to bring to justice the peo-ple responsible for 9/11. Roughly 2.5 million Americans have served in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq; despite the horrors of war and multiple deploy-ments, 89 percent of those veterans say they would join the military again. On May 2, 2011, Navy SEAL Team Six lo-cated and killed Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in Operation Neptune Spear. The global war on ter-ror is far from over, but I am confident we will prevail. As President Franklin Delano Roosevelt said in his May 26, 1940 fireside chat, ‘‘We defend and we build a way of life, not for America alone, but for all mankind.’’ What I hope our young people—those who don’t have a personal memory of 9/ 11—will understand is that, out of many, we are truly one. That was evi-dent on 9/11, and it is still true. Our partisan, political, philosophical, and regional differences come to the fore during a Presidential campaign. But these differences ultimately are dwarfed by what binds us together as Americans: our hopes for our families, our communities, our Nation, and the world. The best way for all of us to honor those who died on 9/11 is to re-member that and act accordingly—cou-rageously, generously, compas-sionately, and with resolve to defend and promote justice, freedom, and peace at home and abroad.

Mr. President, I was necessarily absent from this after-noon’s vote on confirmation of the nomination of Peter Michael McKinley to be Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the United States of America to the Federative Republic of Brazil. On vote No. 137, had I been present, I would have voted yea on the McKinley nomination. I hope the Senate will con-tinue to confirm President Obama’s highly qualified nominees in the weeks ahead.∑ f 
BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I submit to the Senate the budget scorekeeping re-port for September 2016. The report compares current law levels of spend-ing and revenues with the amounts the Senate agreed to in the budget resolu-tion for Fiscal Year 2016, the con-ference report to accompany S. Con. Res. 11, and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, P.L. 114–74, BBA 15. This infor-mation is necessary for the Senate Budget Committee to determine whether budget points of order lie against pending legislation. It has been prepared by the Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee and the Con-gressional Budget Office, CBO, pursu-ant to section 308(b) of the Congres-sional Budget Act, CBA. This is the sixth report I have made this calendar year. It is the third re-port since I filed the statutorily re-quired Fiscal Year 2017 enforceable budget limits on April 18, 2016, pursu-ant to section 102 of BBA 15, and the tenth report I have made since adop-tion of the Fiscal Year 2016 budget res-olution on May 5, 2015. My last filing can be found in the C
ONGRESSIONAL  R
ECORD on June 8, 2016. The informa-tion contained in this report is current through September 6, 2016. Tables 1–7 of this report are prepared by my staff on the Budget Committee. Only table 1, which tracks compliance with committee allocations pursuant to section 302 of the CBA, has changed from my previous report due to legisla-tive activity. Of the 16 authorizing committees in the Senate, 14 are in compliance with their allocation over the enforceable 10-year period, Fiscal Year 2017–2026. The two committees not in compliance, the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, were pushed out of compliance through passage of the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act, PROMESA, P.L. 114–187, and the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, P.L. 114–182, respec-tively. During this same period, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation reduced direct spending by $8 million over the 10-year period with the passage of the FAA Extension, Safety and Security

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5458 September 8, 2016 
Act of 2016, P.L. 114–190. In total, table 1 shows that authorizing committees are $502 million in budget authority and $483 million in outlays above al-lowable direct spending levels over the 10-year window. Tables 2–7 remain unchanged due to the legislative impasse over the Fiscal Year 2017 appropriations process. In addition to the tables provided by the Senate Budget Committee Repub-lican staff, I am submitting additional tables from CBO that I will use for en-forcement of budget totals agreed to by the Congress. Because legislation can still be en-acted that would have an effect on Fis-cal Year 2016, CBO provided a report both for Fiscal Year 2016 and Fiscal Year 2017. This information is used to enforce aggregate spending levels in budget resolutions under section 311 of the CBA. CBO’s estimates show that current law levels of spending for Fis-cal Year 2016 exceed the amounts in last year’s budget resolution by $138.9 billion in budget authority and $103.6 billion in outlays. Revenues are $155.2 billion below the revenue floor for Fis-cal Year 2016 set by the budget resolu-tion. As well, Social Security outlays are at the levels assumed for Fiscal Year 2016, while Social Security reve-nues are $23 million below levels in the budget. For Fiscal Year 2017, CBO estimates that current law levels are below the Fiscal Year 2017 enforcement filing’s allowable budget authority and outlay aggregates by $974.1 billion and $592.2 billion, respectively. The allowable spending room will be reduced as ap-propriations bills for Fiscal Year 2017 are enacted. Revenues are above the levels assumed in the enforcement fil-ing by $200 million in Fiscal Year 2017, $410 million over 5 years, and $544 mil-lion over 10 years. This is the product of revenue increases in both PROMESA, $370 million over 10 years, and P.L. 114–182, $192 million over 10 years, and an $18 million reduction in revenues over 10 years from the Com-prehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016, CARA, P.L. 114–198. Finally, So-cial Security outlays are at the levels assumed in the Fiscal Year 2017 en-forcement filing, but the enactment of CARA reduced Social Security reve-nues by $6 million over 10 years. CBO’s report also provides informa-tion needed to enforce the Senate’s pay-as-you-go rule. As part of the Fis-cal Year 2017 enforcement filing, the Senate’s pay-as-you-go scorecard was reset to zero. Since my last filing, leg-islative activity has resulted in an in-crease in the deficit of $81 million over the Fiscal Year 2016–2021 period, but deficit reduction of $61 million over the Fiscal Year 2016–2026 period. Over the initial 6-year period, Congress has en-acted legislation that increased out-lays by $491 million and revenues by $410 million. Over the 11-year period, outlays were increased by $483 million and revenues by $544 million. The Sen-ate’s pay-as-you-go rule is enforced by section 201 of S. Con. Res. 21, the Fiscal Year 2008 budget resolution. Finally, there is one new entry in the enforcement table included at the end of this submission, which tracks the Senate’s budget enforcement activity on the floor. On June 29, 2016, a 425(a)(2) unfunded-mandate budget point of order was raised against PROMESA. This point of order was waived through a motion from Senator H
ATCH by a vote of 85–13. All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years. I ask unanimous consent that the ac-companying tables be printed in the R

aAt the time of consideration, a point estimate was unavailable for the Paul amendment. However, it was estimated that it would decrease revenues below the levels assumed in the budget resolution. 
bThis amendment designated $1.1 billion in outlays as being for emergency purposes. This funding, which was not offset, would be  used to combat the Zika virus. 
cThis amendment designated $7.7 billion in outlays as being for emergency purposes. This funding, which was not offset, would be  used to extend the Veterans Choice Program. 
dIn its estimate for PROMESA, the Congressional Budget Office found that the bill would impose a number of mandates on the terri torial government of Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities. The costs of these mandates on public enti- ties would exceed the annual threshold in UMRA for intergovernmental mandates ($77 million in 2016, adjusted annually for infla tion). 
eUnless otherwise noted, the motion to waive was offered pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. 
LAUNCH OF THE OSIRIS-RE X SPACE CRAFT Mr. M
CCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to come to the Senate floor to call attention and to honor the OSI-RIS-REx spacecraft, which is scheduled to launch from Cape Canaveral, FL, to-night at 7 p.m. In the finest traditions of space ex-ploration, this spacecraft will journey on a 7-year roundtrip mission to an as-teroid that NASA has classified as ‘‘po-tentially hazardous’’ to Earth—to com-plete a survey and return to Earth with the largest sample of extraterrestrial material since the Apollo lunar mis-sions. This program will yield insights into asteroid composition and how asteroids move in space. The truth is that, de-spite the potential for large asteroids to impact the Earth in catastrophic ways, we still know relatively little about them. The OSIRIS-REx mission will shed light onto both their physical and chemical properties, which is in-formation that will be critical for pre-dicting their movements and designing strategies to prevent catastrophic as-teroid impacts to the Earth, as well as aid in the commercial exploitation of near-earth objects. The most unique aspect of the OSI-RIS-REx mission is the large and pris-tine sample of the asteroid that will be brought back to Earth, which will allow scientists to examine the com-position of an asteroid using instru-ments and techniques that are far more advanced than what could be done in space. Scientists from the University of Arizona, UA, will also examine the sample for the resources that could be mined from asteroids in the future, such as precious metals. Interestingly, medium- to large-sized space rocks might contain hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars in minerals and precious metals. Perhaps the most important aspect of this mission is the research into the origins of our universe and galaxy it will provide. The samples that the mis-sion will bring back will help begin to answer some of the most profound and fundamental questions that have in-trigued mankind since the beginning. The OSIRIS-REx mission is funded by NASA and led by UA from my own great State of Arizona. I would like to congratulate UA president Ann Weaver Hart and former president Robert Shelton for championing space explo-ration; Dr. Dante Lauretta of the UA Lunar and Planetary Laboratory for his leadership as principal investi-gator; and his team, for bringing this exciting mission to the launch stage. I understand that under the leadership of the late Dr. Michael Drake and Dr. Lauretta, UA has been working on this concept for the last 15 years. I would also like to acknowledge the other project partners, which include NASA’s Goddard Space Center; Lock-heed Martin, which built the spacecraft bus on which the various science in-struments are mounted; Arizona State University, which built an instrument on the spacecraft that will investigate mineral abundances and provide tem-perature information; KinetX Aero-space; Massachusetts Institute of Tech-nology; and United Launch Alliance I also appreciate our international collaborators, including, the Canadian Space Agency and the Centre national d’e´tudes spatiales, CNES, i.e., the French Government space agency. This mission is the latest of a long list of achievements by UA and its globally recognized space scientists. In fact, UA scientists have collaborated in every single American mission to the Moon and contributed to every mission to Mars since 1964, including serving as the lead on the Phoenix Mars Mission. With this mission, UA is expanding the boundaries of space science, includ-ing innovating in the global challenge of planetary orbital object tracking through their Space Object Behavioral Sciences, SOBS, Initiative. Further-more, I applaud UA, NASA, and Lock-heed Martin for helping maintain U.S. leadership in near-Earth space, par-ticularly at a time when the inter-national community is showing a high interest in moving into this arena. I wish the OSIRIS-REx team the best of luck for a successful launch. As the OSIRIS-REx countdown clock that has been hanging in my office for the last year gets very close to zero, I look for-ward to tuning in to NASA TV to watch history being made. Thank you.

HONORING CHARLES WATERBURY Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the exceptional serv-ice and the extraordinary life of New Hampshire firefighter Charles ‘‘Char-lie’’ Waterbury of Orford, NH. Born and raised in Orford, Charlie graduated from Orford High School in 1978. Following graduation, Charlie en-listed in the U.S. Army and served for 4 years. After returning home, Charlie continued to serve his country and joined the New Hampshire Army Na-tional Guard. After 20 years of dedi-cated service to our State and our Na-tion, Charlie rose to the rank of E–5 sergeant. Demonstrating his commitment to service, Charlie was a devoted member of the Orford community and known for his willingness to step up whenever help was needed. Prior to becoming a firefighter, Charlie served his home-town as a member of the town budget advisory committee, as a town tree warden, and, impressively, as a road agent for 17 years. Ten years ago, Charlie joined the all- volunteer Orford Fire Department, where he soon became a beloved mem-ber of the team. Orford fire chief Terry Straight described Charlie as an excel-lent public servant whom ‘‘everyone re-spected and looked up to’’ and ‘‘a great

go-to guy.’’ On Sunday, July 24, as re-ports of a brush fire in Lyme came in, Charlie rushed to the scene, as he had done so many times before, placing the safety of others first. Sadly, Charlie gave his life in the line of duty to help extinguish the fire in Lyme. We are all grateful for Charlie’s selfless service to Orford and the rest of our State. Firefighter Waterbury leaves behind a daughter, Whitney Banker; a grand-son, Arlo Austin Banker, and parents; Allan and Shirley Waterbury. We are all deeply saddened by the loss of a wonderful friend to many and an out-standing public servant, Charlie Water-bury. Charlie represented the best of our State, and I send my deepest condo-lences to Whitney, Arlo, Allan, and Shirley during this difficult time. While we mourn the loss of an extraor-dinary man, we know that he served our State, Nation, and community with honor, courage, and dedication. Charlie gave so much to New Hamp-shire and our Nation, and we are for-ever grateful for his sacrifice and serv-ice.

REMEMBERING HENRY RUEMPLER Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the life and service of my friend and former staff member Henry Ruempler, who passed away on August 29, 2016. Mr. Henry Ruempler served as staff counsel to the House Committee on Government Operations before joining my staff in 1979 as counsel and later served as legislative director. Henry worked many years in my Washington, DC, office, and was a trusted colleague and friend to those who knew him. Fol-lowing his departure from the U.S. Senate, he worked in the private sec-tor, specializing in taxation and bank-ing until his retirement in 2003. Henry’s accomplishments and service extended beyond the workforce. He was a Boy Scout leader, for which he re-ceived the Silver Beaver Award for dis-tinguished service; PTA board member; and treasurer of Northern Virginia Senior Softball. Above all, Henry was a dedicated family man. He was married for 45 years to his wife Susan. They have to two children, Kyle and Shan-non; and two grandchildren, Maryella and Charlie. For myself and all those who knew Henry, I commemorate his years of service, his friendship, and a life well lived.

ENDOCRINE SOCIETY CENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and congratulate the Endocrine Society in honor of its Cen-tennial anniversary this year. Founded in 1916, the Endocrine Soci-ety is the world’s oldest and largest professional society for endocrinologists and endocrine sci-entists, who focus their efforts on un-derstanding and caring for the large interconnected system of glands in our bodies that produce hormones needed for the daily function of our bodies. These physicians and researchers are at the core of solving the most pressing health problems of our time—from dia-betes and obesity, to infertility, bone health, and hormone-related cancers. Throughout this year, the Endocrine Society is celebrating its 100th anni-versary by focusing on endocrinology’s past contributions to science and pub-lic health, while keeping an eye on to-day’s promising research, which will lead to the discoveries of tomorrow. I am very pleased that this included holding its annual meeting and expo in Boston which drew thousands of endocrinologists from around the globe to Massachusetts. I am also pleased to note that this year the president of the Endocrine Society is Dr. Henry Kronenberg, chief of the endocrine unit at Massachusetts General Hospital, and Professor of Medicine at Harvard Med-ical School in Boston, MA. Over the Endocrine Society’s past 100 years, there have been remarkable dis-coveries and advances in biomedical re-search, but there is still much to learn. Thankfully, advances in endocrine re-search are accelerating. Today, thanks in part to funding from the National Institutes of Health, we have many doctors and scientists working to cre-ate fascinating tools to improve human health. As one example, the bionic pancreas, developed by Dr. Ed Damiano, a pro-fessor of biomedical engineering at Boston University, completely automates the process of tracking and adjusting blood sugar. This device does not cure diabetes, but it battles its greatest threat: the dramatic fluctua-tions in blood sugar that cause signifi-cant side effects and even death. I am truly appreciative of the accom-plishments of endocrinologists and en-docrine researchers—many who work, study, and practice in Massachusetts— over the past 100 years, and I am ex-cited about the future of this field and better understanding how our environ-ment impacts the way in which our hormones function and contribute to disease. I offer sincere congratulations to the Endocrine Society on their 100th anni-versary, and I look forward to seeing future advancements in the field that lead to women and men living longer, healthier lives. f 
TRIBUTE TO MAJOR WILLIAM GORBY Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, today I wish to acknowledge the service of my former defense fellow MAJ William Gorby, who is coming to the end of his assignment as part of his experience in the Army Congressional Fellowship Program. Mike joined my office in 2014, and im-mediately, his dedication, work ethic, and intelligence made him a trusted voice on my legislative team. A proud member of the West Virginia National Guard, Mike has deployed multiple times in defense of our country, and through his service, our Nation is a safer place. Most importantly, Mike is also a devoted husband and father, and I have had the pleasure of watching his family grow over the last several years. As Mike moves on to another assign-ment outside the realm of legislation, I want to extend my thanks for his serv-ice and wish him and his family contin-ued success in his future endeavors. f 
ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING HOPE FOR NEW HAMPSHIRE RECOVERY ∑Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize National Recovery Month and to applaud the accomplish-ments of a great organization in my home State: HOPE for New Hampshire Recovery. As New Hampshire battles a growing heroin and prescription opioid abuse crisis, the team at HOPE has brought a compassionate approach to caring for their fellow Granite Staters. Across our State, HOPE has opened six recovery centers in Manchester, Derry, Newport, Claremont, Concord, and Ber-lin. I was glad to join them at many of these grand opening ceremonies. These centers are important community re-sources, and I appreciate their work to reach every corner of our State. On Sunday, September 17, 2016, HOPE is hosting the Rally4Recovery NH, so that New Hampshire residents can show support for their families, friends, neighbors, and loved ones living in or seeking recovery. National Recovery Month is spon-sored by the Substance Abuse and Men-tal Health Services Administration as a means to bring greater awareness and understanding of mental and substance use disorders and to celebrate people in recovery. Ensuring support exists for policies, programs, and initiatives that can lead to long-term recovery is a critically important piece of our comprehensive response to the heroin and prescription opioid abuse epidemic. This crisis touches all of us and as a significant public health crisis; our response must be comprehensive in nature, focusing on prevention, treatment, recovery, and support for first responders, in ad-dition to working together to elimi-nate the stigma associated with addic-tion. National Recovery Month helps bring awareness to the efforts of groups like HOPE, who work in their commu-nities to provide long-term resources for individuals seeking and in recovery. We are fortunate for the dedicated work that HOPE does on a daily basis to support recovery in New Hampshire, and I am deeply grateful for their ef-forts to change the conversation around substance use disorders and show that long-term recovery is achievable.

50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NEW HAMPSHIRE COLLEGE & UNIVER-SITY COUNCIL ∑Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I wish to help commemorate the 50th an-niversary of the founding of the New Hampshire College & University Coun-cil, NHCUC. Throughout the past half century, the NHCUC has consistently endeavored to advance the interests of both public and private higher edu-cation in my home State of New Hamp-shire. Established in 1966 as a statewide consortium of both public and private higher education institutions, the council is committed to enhancing the quality of higher education in New Hampshire, offering students attending its member institutions opportunities for enriched experiences, as well as providing a foundation for enhanced communication among the member in-stitutions. The NHCUC is directed by the chancellors and presidents of the mem-ber institutions who have supported the collaborative work of the organiza-tion for 50 years. The council serves its member institutions through programs in academic affairs, admissions, library services, career services, and many other programs and initiatives in serv-ice to the students, faculty, and staff at the member institutions. In addition, the NHCUC offers an im-portant voice in advocating awareness of and appreciation for the importance of the higher education sector as a partner in growing New Hampshire’s economic prosperity, educating the next generation of skilled workers for the twenty-first century, and enhanc-ing the civic life of our State and local communities. I appreciate the work of this unique statewide higher education consortium that strives to encourage all of New Hampshire’s citizens to promote and advance both public and private higher education in the Granite State. It is my honor to recognize and congratu-late the New Hampshire College & Uni-versity Council as they reach this his-toric milestone, and I wish them many more years of success.∑

FIFTEENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FREE & CHARITABLE CLINICS ∑Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the National Associa-tion of Free & Charitable Clinics on their 15th anniversary and to recognize the outstanding work of our Nation’s 1,200 free and charitable clinics in pro-viding vital medical services to low-in-come, uninsured residents, including the eight clinics in my home State of West Virginia. West Virginia’s free and charitable clinics, with the assistance of their more than 1,000 dedicated volunteer professionals, provide health care for over 42,000 working poor of West Vir-ginia. These clinics focus on the over-all needs of patients by providing med-ical, dental, pharmaceutical, behavior health, vision, and health education services and ensure a medical home for vulnerable at-risk West Virginians. Annually, America’s 1,200 free and charitable clinics provide health care to 1.7 million people through 5.9 mil-lion patient visits. This is accom-plished through a dedicated staff and over 160,000 volunteers, including 30,000 medical providers, 21,000 nurses, and al-most 71,000 nonmedical volunteers. Free and charitable clinics do not re-ceive dedicated Federal funding. In-stead, these clinics rely heavily on pri-vate donations from individual donors, foundations, grants, and volunteers, which allow them to keep their doors open and to deliver health care to those who need it the most. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in Congress to bet-ter address the needs of the medically underserved and to increase awareness and understanding of the important work that free and charitable clinics do every day.∑ f 
TRIBUTE TO LAURANCE M. MILLER ∑Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I am pleased to share with my colleagues a remarkable achievement by a very dis-tinguished American citizen, Laurance M. Miller. On October 29, 2016, Mr. Mil-ler will have devoted over 50 years of his life to the service of his country as an officer and civil servant in the U.S. Air Force. His honorable career began when he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force on June 6, 1966, from ROTC at the Univer-sity of Akron. Miller was stationed at Chanute Air Force Base in Illinois for training as an aircraft maintenance officer and as-signed to the 526th TAC Fighter Squad-ron in 1967. In 1969, Miller received his orders to Vietnam, but the Pueblo Cri-sis diverted him to Kunsan Air Force Base in Korea, where he served as a maintenance officer for the next year and was promoted to captain. In 1970, Miller was honorably dis-charged from Active Duty, but re-mained an Air Force Reservist with the 916th TAC Fighter Squadron in Youngstown, OH, until 1977. On August 11, 1973, Miller made the best decision of his life when he mar-ried Patricia Kraus at St. Sebastian’s Catholic Church in Akron, OH. They are the proud parents of Kevin, Me-lissa, and Matthew, and now grand-parents of Ethan, Joy, Dylan, and Joshua. Miller resumed Active Duty in 1977 and was assigned to Air Force Reserve Headquarters, AFRH, at Robins Air Force Base in Georgia. During his as-signment at AFRH, he was promoted to major and honorably discharged from Active Duty in 1982. He and his family then moved to New Orleans, LA, where he was assigned to 526th TAC Fighter Squadron and the New Orleans Naval Air Station as an air reserve technician. There he had the unique distinction of serving simul-taneously as a civil servant for the Air Force, as well as an active Air Force Reservist. Miller was assigned to Air Force Ma-teriel Command, AFMC, individual mo-bilization augmentee at Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts in 1984. During this time, he continued to serve as both a civil service employee and an active Reservist for the U.S. Air Force. Mr. Laurance Miller devoted his life to the U.S. Air Force. His patriotic and unselfish commitment to his chosen branch of service and to the United States of America are extraordinary. I am honored to recognize him for a job well done, and I sincerely wish Larry and Pat happy trails as they enjoy a well-earned retirement together. ∑ f 
TRIBUTE TO TOM RUMMEL ∑Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I recognize Tom Rummel of Sanders County, who has served as sheriff since 2010. Thanks to his initiative and hard work, citizens affected by the Copper King Fire have been kept safe and up to speed on the latest fire activity. Sheriff Rummel has coordinated local law enforcement and emergency services for weeks to ensure the safety of Montanans and their property as the Copper King Fire has grown to be the largest wildfire in the State. As the fire increased in size to over 28,000 acres, Mr. Rummel implemented evacuation and pre-evacuation notices to numerous residences. In addition to phone calls, public notices around the county, and house visits, Sheriff Rummel has used Facebook to keep the community apprised of the very latest information about the fire. He has posted regular updates to the Sanders County Sheriff’s Facebook page, using the power of social media to get the word out to his community. While recent weather has tempered the spread of the Copper King Fire, Sanders County will not be completely out of the woods until we see a season- ending weather event. As Montanans continue to suffer the consequences of Federal mismanagement of our forests, it is often up to local leaders to protect our communities from wildfires. I commend Sheriff Rummel for his tireless work to keep Montanans safe and keep his community informed. All Montanans, and indeed all Americans, owe our local law enforcement and emergency responders a debt of grati-tude for their daily efforts on our be-half.∑

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5464 September 8, 2016 
from Montgomery, AL, who passed away on June 4, 2016. Doug was a good man who loved his family, his country, his many friends, and was always posi-tive and productive, and he was a good friend, adviser, and helper to me. He made his own decisions and worked hard to achieve the values he believed in even when it was not easy to do so. That determination and courage was something I appreciated and admired, as did so many. Doug and I knew each other for many years and grew up in rural Alabama not too far away from each other and at a similar time. We understood each other and shared a history of time and place. Doug was one of my favorite peo-ple. His positive spirit was contagious, as he was always thinking and always working to make America a better place. That is the definition of a pa-triot. He was a man of many talents and a successful businessman. He owned a wide variety of businesses, from res-taurants to a cosmetics line, courier service, and a car dealership. He worked particularly hard in Alabama to promote small and minority busi-nesses. I was pleased to successfully urge his appointment by President Bush to the committee overseeing the U.S. Department of Agriculture respon-sibilities in Alabama. The Alabama Farm Service Agency handles pro-grams including commodities, loans, disaster assistance, food assistance, and export credits. He had a farming background and was a valuable mem-ber of the committee, fully under-standing the needs of small and minor-ity farmers in the State. Doug will always be remembered for his love of his family, church, and fel-low man. He leaves behind his wife of 45 years, Shirley Ann Moore; his loving daughter, Carmen Moore-Zeigler; son- in-law, Henry Zeigler; a granddaughter who was the apple of his eye, Da Brianna Zeigler; and 11 brothers and sisters.∑

REMEMBERING TYREE A. RICHBURG ∑Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to remember Tyree A. Richburg of Mobile, AL. Reverend, marshal, and chief, Richburg had a wonderful life that blessed so many. He was a great law enforcement officer, starting as a patrolman for the Mobile Police De-partment, where he worked for over 40 years earning the rank of lieutenant in 1978, and then as chief of police for Prichard, AL. Following that, he was appointed as U.S. marshal for the Southern District of Alabama, where he served with distinction from 1978 to 1981. Appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, U.S. marshals stand with the U.S. attorney as the representatives for the executive branch of the government in the judi-cial districts. Marshal Richburg was supported by his fine team of deputies and staff and, under his leadership, he fulfilled his duties in an exceptional manner. In 1988, after years of dedicated serv-ice in law enforcement, he accepted a calling to ministry and in 2001 began his tenure as pastor of the Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church. Indeed, in many ways his concept of law enforce-ment was as a ministry. He was firm with lawbreakers, but he treated each one with dignity and the kindness the situation would allow. Tyree Richburg was honest, coura-geous, determined, generous, and kind. He reflected the great qualities we should all strive for. During the time I was U.S. attorney, he was a good friend and we worked together in a relation-ship of confidence and trust. His beloved wife of 63 years, Celestine Richburg, preceded him in death, but he leaves behind 4 children, 10 grand-children, 5 great-grandchildren, and many loving clergy associates and friends.∑ f

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. RUBIO: S. 3301. A bill to amend the Small Business Act to ensure small busi-nesses affected by the onset of trans-missible diseases are eligible for dis-aster relief; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I come to the floor again—I believe for the 10th time since March—to discuss the Zika virus. The first time I talked about this was back in January. There was a report out that said Zika, the disease, was being transmitted by mosquitoes and

there was an outbreak in Brazil. Imme-diately for me alarm bells went off be-cause being from Miami, FL, my home-town, if you go to the airport and look at the board, the number of flights coming from Brazil to South Florida, the numbers are high. There are dozens of flights a week back and forth. My immediate thought at that time was that this is going to be an issue for Florida and ultimately for America, given the amount of travel back and forth. I also saw the outbreak in the terri-tory of Puerto Rico, a place I have taken a tremendous interest in since my time here. As everyone knows, Puerto Rico is not officially rep-resented in this Chamber, but I, along with my colleagues Senator M
ENENDEZ  of New Jersey and Senator N
ELSON of Florida, have always looked out for the interests of the island and its people who are U.S. citizens. So knowing the link between Florida and Puerto Rico and the link between Zika and Puerto Rico, I knew as early as January that this was going to be an issue. I imme-diately talked to our Border Patrol folks and our Customs people at our airports and seaports about ensuring we are doing everything we can. In March, when the President came out in February and March and talked about the need for $1.9 billion to fight Zika, I believe I was the first Repub-lican—certainly in this Chamber—to come out in favor of that request be-cause my argument at the time was, we don’t know fully what we are deal-ing with here, but let’s get ahead of it. Let’s jump in front of it and let’s deal with it. Otherwise it will only get worse. Unfortunately, that didn’t hap-pen. In much of April and March, there was not much attention paid to this. So cases started coming up domesti-cally, mostly travel-related. The Sen-ate did move, and I am proud of the fact that after some back and forth, this place worked. We worked across the aisle, and I worked with Senator N
ELSON on his proposal and other pro-posals. In fact, I believe I am the only Member of Congress who voted in favor of every single Zika proposal because in my mind I wanted the money to flow so local governments and States could deal with it and researchers could de-velop a vaccine. We passed a law for $1.1 billion. It was a product of com-promise. It was less than what the President asked for, but it began to move. Unfortunately, the House had a different idea and this is where we are today. When we left in July, there had not been a reported case of a transmission of Zika by a mosquito, but as I warned through April, May, June, and July, it was only a matter of time. If you spent any amount of time in Florida, you know it is hot, it is humid, that it rains, and there are a lot of mosqui-toes. You have a State which is a key entry point between key areas and the continental United States and you have mosquitoes. It didn’t take a sci-entist or an expert in Zika to know the combination of those two things were going to lead to locally based trans-mission. Sadly, that is what is hap-pening. There is a neighborhood in Miami, FL, called Wynwood. This was an area that is economically depressed and it has come alive. It is a center of art. They have these murals where graffiti artists were allowed to come in and put in these extraordinary murals. It is not graffiti. It is art. It is a place where the art community is centered and has come alive with some of the best res-taurants in South Florida. This is the Wynwood community. It is a magnet for tourists. There are people who fly to Florida, and South Florida in particular, and go straight to Wynwood because they want to be in that area. It was the first area im-pacted, and the CDC came out with a warning telling people to avoid a neighborhood. This is usually the kind of advisory that goes out about avoid-ing other countries, telling Americans and travelers, specifically, to avoid a certain part of a certain neighborhood. Can you imagine the impact it had on the businesses in that community? We talked about the human toll of Zika, of the infection, and of what it does to unborn children, but there is also the economic impact of having a lead health care agency in charge of public health in America issue a warn-ing to Americans to avoid a neighbor-hood in an American city. I promise you that was not good for those busi-nesses. Some of these businesses had to close for weeks on end and days on end. Then a few weeks later we had re-ports of the disease being transmitted on Miami Beach. I don’t need to tell you about Miami Beach. Everyone knows about Miami Beach. It is the cornerstone of tourism in South Flor-ida. People come to Miami Beach from all over the world to enjoy world-class beaches, nightlife, entertainment, and restaurants. I want you to put yourself in a position of a small business owner—not just a large hotel chain, which is relevant here, but a small business owner. Imagine if you are a family who runs a restaurant on Collins Avenue in Miami Beach. You are depending your whole year, your budget and your pay-roll is built on a predictable pattern of travelers coming in the summer and coming in the fall and especially in the winter. You are estimating the number of travelers who will come in. They will leave money at these restaurants and they are going to go home. Now you have a report of these trans-missions and similar warnings as well. What you learn from this is that this Zika issue is not just a health care issue—and that is by far the primary focus of what our attention should be— but it is also an economic issue and it is hurting small businesses. It is hurt-ing the municipalities. Miami Beach as a city is going to see tax revenues go down. It is going to hurt the State of Florida because of failed tax revenue and so forth. It is going to hurt one of the engines of our tourism sector—the reports of this transmission. You know what is hurting it even worse? When people turn on the news, people are hearing there are people being infected with Zika in Florida and Congress is still haggling and fighting over it and can’t get anything done. That does not inspire confidence. So today I have filed a bill, an addi-tional bill, in addition to calling on us to move on Zika. Let me touch on this first. It is inexcusable. How did we get to this point? How did a public health crisis become a political tool to be played with back and forth? Yet that is what Washington has become, a place that has become expert at literally turning any issue into a political issue, and it has done so again with this issue. That is why people are grossed out and disgusted with American poli-tics. When they watch the news and see this fighting, they don’t get it. They understand there is this problem with Zika, and it is spreading and hurting people. We just had a case of a child born in Miami Dade County, at the Jackson Memorial Hospital—not with microcephaly but with Zika—a child, a baby, starting out life infected with Zika. They are asking: How can you guys turn this thing into a political issue? That is what Washington has done. Both parties are to blame. It took too long for some in my party to come to the realization this was impor-tant. On the Democratic side, they have come up with excuses to be against the proposal, but I will say this: The Senate did it. The Senate funded it. I think at this point, that is probably the fastest and best way for-ward, if we are serious about funding this, is to go back to what the Senate did. I continue to work with our col-leagues to make sure that is a part of whatever vehicle we use to fund the government and keep it open through most of the rest of this year. But today I filed a bill to help people being economically impacted by it. It is a bill that deals with the Small Busi-ness Administration. What it does is it basically gives the Small Business Ad-ministration the authority to give out small business loans to communities negatively impacted by health-related travel advisories issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As you know, as I said earlier, the CDC has already issued those travel advisories to Wynwood and for the South Beach areas of Miami-Dade County, but that does not mean a week from now there will not be another area added to that, including another area in your State, my colleagues. You don’t know when that is coming. So if they were hit by a storm, they would qualify for this. If they were hit by any other disaster, they would qualify for this. They have been hit by a storm. It happens to be a health care storm. It is hurting them economically. We need to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5473 September 8, 2016 
make sure they have the flexibility and the ability to provide this short-term, low-interest loans to small businesses to be able to weather this health care Zika storm. I don’t know for the life of me why anybody would be against this. I don’t know what possible way you could try to politicize it. I am not sure why any-body would object to it. My hope is, we can move quickly on this. It is impor-tant. I know there is a lot of jurisdictional pride around here and committees will say: Well, you have to come through us first because we are the chairmen and this is our committee. I hope you can make an exception on this issue be-cause these businesses are hurting. They are hurting badly because of what has happened, and it is only going to get worse for them as these reports come out. I hope we can get that passed. Here is another thing people don’t know. Our service men and women are deployed all over the world. Unlike people who travel, they don’t have a choice. When the U.S. military tells you and your de-pendents you must now go to Hon-duras, you are now going to be sta-tioned at a base in Guantanamo Bay or you are going to be stateside, but you are going to be in Puerto Rico—when they deploy you, you can’t say: Well, I am not going because there is Zika there. You have to go. We need to make sure we are protecting our men and women. According to the Pentagon, as of today, there are 81 servicemembers and 19 dependents who have tested positive for the Zika virus. Three of them, by the way, are pregnant. So I have filed a second bill to protect our service-members from Zika. It is called the Servicemembers’ Zika Protection Act. It provides U.S. troops with additional protections from the Zika virus by au-thorizing the Secretary of Defense to transfer funds within the existing De-partment of Defense medical and health research accounts in order to combat the Zika virus. I am hopeful we can unite behind that as well. With over 100 members of our military and their families already infected with Zika, we need to take specific precautions to help them and to help our foreign partners who host Americans on military bases in regions that are affected by Zika. So I am also hopeful Congress will ultimately arrive at an agreement this month to fund our Nation’s response to Zika, but also that we ensure that those being de-ployed on our behalf receive every pro-tection we can provide. So these, in addition to the broader argument about Zika, these are two commonsense approaches giving the Department of Defense flexibility to move existing money around, to pro-vide additional protections for our service men and women and their de-pendents who are being deployed and impacted by Zika. This is not a theory. We have over 100 people now, including 81 in uniform, who have been impacted by it, and 19 of their dependents, 3 of them who are pregnant. Second, the small business relief. Please put yourself in the position of a family-owned business on South Beach or in Wynwood. They are being hurt. Instead of having 50 people coming in a day, they have 5 or 10. They need help. If they had lost power or been hit by a hurricane or a tornado, this would not be an issue, but they have been hit by a tornado of a different kind, one they did not cause and they could not pre-dict and they could not insure against; that is, Zika. Let’s make sure the SBA has the flexibility to provide them their loans. So in addition to funding this—we have to get the Zika thing done, it cannot continue to languish—we have to get the SBA flexibility built into our law so these small businesses can be pro-vided the resources they need to stay open and not close down as a result of a travel advisory because of a disease being spread by mosquitoes. I think we would all agree we have to make sure we are doing everything we can to protect our men and women in uniform who are not going by choice. They are being deployed to these places where Zika is prevalent. They are being infected. There is no excuse for us to not help them as well. So these are the three things I hope we will do before Congress adjourns at the end of this month: Fund Zika fully, give flexi-bility for our small businesses that have been impacted by Zika to get SBA loans, and do everything we can by passing a law that gives the Depart-ment of Defense the flexibility they need to use existing money to protect our men and women in uniform and their families from being infected by Zika when deployed.

RECOGNIZING THE 40TH ANNIVER-SARY OF WOMEN AT THE UNITED STATES NAVAL ACAD-EMY WEEK Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consider-ation of S.

A resolution (S. Res. 550) designating the week of September 5 through September 9, 2016, as ‘‘Recognizing the 40th Anniversary of Women at the United States Naval Academy Week.’’ 
There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the resolution. Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today having submitted a resolution honoring the 40th anniversary of women attending the U.S. Naval Acad-emy in Annapolis, MD. Forty years ago, in 1975, Congress proudly author-ized women to attend military service academies. That act of Congress, cre-ated a milestone in our military his-tory, setting the national stage for women’s equality. On July 6, 1976, the very first class of women entered the U.S. Naval Acad-emy. Four years later, the graduating class of 1980, commissioned 55 women. Since then, more than 4,800 women, in-cluding this year’s graduating class of 2016, have graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy and have transcended traditional military roles for women. Women have had to fight every single day and in every single way to be able to advance ourselves. Today, women make up 27 percent of the U.S. Naval Academy’s student body, the highest in the school’s history. This year, mid-shipmen were admitted from every state in the U.S., as well as the Dis-trict of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Naval Academy continues to evolve, depict-ing our Nation’s diversity, and pro-moting equality. Our country is stronger today be-cause women have advanced in the military. There are 2.2 million women serving in our military, serving with their male counterparts in leadership capacities that now include combat oc-cupations. These strong, powerful, and intelligent women have unselfishly chosen to serve their country in a time when our Nation’s military is needed the most, and they have done so with passion, heroism and integrity. The U.S. Naval Academy was founded in 1845. A school that began with mere-ly 50 midshipman students and 7 pro-fessors now fosters a graduating class of 1,076 commissioned officers. A school rich with tradition, the Academy offers 43 different majors within 19 fields of study. The U.S. Naval Academy offers a premier education and continues to bolster some of the finest and most hardworking patrons of our society. But that society would not be complete without our women service members. When women succeed in the workplace, our economy succeeds, and our country is stronger for it. The U.S. Naval Academy has groomed trailblazers, women who have commanded in combat, women who have set standards for success, and women who have paved the way for our daughters and granddaughters. I wish to honor just a few of those trail-blazers, as we recount the importance of this 40-year revolution. In 1995, CDR Wendy Lawrence, class of 1981, became the first Navy woman in space aboard space shuttle Endeav-or. In 2006, RADM Margaret D. Klein, class of 1981, became the first woman commandant at the U.S. Naval Acad-emy. Later she served as the Chief of Staff for U.S. Cyber Command, pio-neering in the cyber field. In 2011, Marine Brig. Gen. Lori Rey-nolds, class of 1986, was the first woman to command the Marine Corps Recruiting Depot in Parris Island. Of course, we can’t celebrate the U.S. Naval Academy without celebrating

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5483 September 8, 2016 
the accomplishments of ADM Michelle J. Howard, class of 1982; who was the first African-American woman to com-mand a Navy ship. In 2014, Admiral Howard became the first woman to be-come a four-star admiral, and was then appointed the Vice Chief of Naval Oper-ations; becoming the first African- American and the first woman to hold that position. This list of accomplishments from our U.S. Naval Academy women grad-uates goes on. It is the reason I have introduced this resolution. We must ensure the legacy of this institution and the accomplishments of these amazing women are recognized and celebrated. Last May, the U.S. Naval Academy commissioned 265 women officers. These women, like their predecessors, will go on to serve in some of the most demanding assignments in the Navy, the Marine Corps, and even inter-serv-ice agencies such as the U.S. Coast Guard. They will continue to break new ground and become firsts in their fields. It is because of our Nation’s heroes we are able to stand here today, but the service of women in the military is a milestone we must honor. These women have proven equality matters. These women have proven that they can achieve anything. These women have made many sacrifices to make our country safe. We must continue to promote equal-ity and encourage women to strive for success in order to guarantee future parity. In today’s increasingly uncer-tain world, women serving in military leadership roles, are more important than ever before. Women service mem-bers are a necessity—they are dynamic, resilient leaders who inspire millions to make the world a better place. I am proud to promote and recognize such strength. As the Navy proudly proclaims, ‘‘Through Knowledge, Sea Power.’’ As dean of the Women Senators, I am here to proudly proclaim, through women’s equality, we gain knowledge and create power that is unstoppable. As a soci-ety, we must continue to promote and recognize our Nation’s heroines and their outstanding efforts for future generations. Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I fur-ther ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to recon-sider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The resolution (S. Res. 550) was agreed to. The preamble was agreed to. (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today’s R

HONORING MR. CRAIG J. ROLISH OF JOHNSTOWN, PENNSYLVANIA 
HON. KEITH J. ROTHFUS 
OF PENNSYLVANIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 8, 2016 Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Mr. Craig J. Rolish of Johnstown, Pennsyl-vania. He is an Airforce veteran who served in Vietnam as an enlisted airman, and is a 2002 recipient of the Four Chaplains Legion of Honor Award. In 1993, Craig was involved in the founding of the Veteran Community Initiatives (VCI). For the past 23 years, Mr. Rolish has been in-strumental in the growth and credibility of the VCI’s efforts to enhance the lives and well- being of veterans and their families. As the Vice President-Treasurer, and origi-nal Board Member, Mr. Rolish has been long involved in ensuring VCI assists in meeting the social and economic needs of the dis-abled, disadvantaged, physically and mentally challenged, unemployed and underemployed, and current and previously incarcerated. Craig’s dedication to veterans and their fam-ilies for more than 20 years has created a lasting legacy at VCI. Mr. Speaker, Pennsylvania values its vet-erans, and it is my great pleasure to honor the man who has spent more than two decades building an organization that provides assist-ance to those who have served in our armed military and their families.

HONORING JAMES CARMICHAEL 
HON. JAMES B. RENACCI 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 8, 2016 Mr. RENACCI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to my friend and a great American, James ‘‘Jim’’ Carmichael, of Wooster, Ohio. Our nation, the state of Ohio, and his beloved Wayne County lost a friend, a father, a hus-band, and a dedicated public servant on July 13, 2016. God, country, and family were Jim’s guiding stars. He was a man of incredible faith, integ-rity, and love. Jim served in the Ohio Army National Guard from 1959 to 1964, and from 1971 to 1979, he was the mayor of Shreve, Ohio. During this time he was president of the Wayne County Mayors Association and presi-dent of the Shreve Friends of the Library. Jim was also a member of the Shreve Police and Fire Departments. He continued his public service as a member of the Wayne County Board of Elections from 1980 to 1999, and served as the board’s chairman from 1989 to 1999; Jim also served as chairman of the Wayne County Republican Party from 1981 to 2000. In 2001, Jim was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives, an office he held until 2009. During his time in the legislature, he held a number of positions including Assistant Majority Whip, Majority Whip, and Assistant Majority Floor Leader. He also led as the Chairman of the House State Government Committee and Chairman of the Ohio House and Senate Cancer Caucus. After his tenure in the Ohio House of Representatives, Jim was elected Commissioner for Wayne County from 2009 until this year. Jim loved his com-munity. He served as a Merit Badge Coun-selor for the Boy Scouts’ Citizen in the Nation merit badge. He was also very proud to be a longtime fan of Tri-Way-Shreve School and sports, and loved to cheer on the home team. Jim is survived by his wife Carolyn, his daughters Keely and Debbie, grandchildren Matt, Lindsay, Jamie, Garrett, Grace, and Gavin; great-grandchildren, Aubrey, Gage, and Evelyn, and his sisters, Ruth Flinner and Jane Carmichael. I ask my colleagues in the House to join me in paying tribute to a reliable friend, a thought-ful lawmaker, and very simply, a good man. f 
KINGWOOD HIGH SCHOOL RUGBY 
HON. TED POE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 8, 2016 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Kingwood Girls’ Rugby Club 2015–2016 team for going undefeated in the regular season, making it to the state finals, and participating in the 2016 High School Division at the Penn Mutual Rugby Championship in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Their achievement is a testament to the dedi-cation of head coach, Josh Dill, and assistant coach, Nick Carline, and the player’s work ethic. Balancing school and athletics is not an easy task and these student athletes work hard in the classroom and continually strive to improve their craft. The families, teachers, friends, and the entire community are very proud of the Kingwood Girls’ Rugby team. It is with great pleasure to recognize the members of the 2015–2016 Kingwood Girls’ Rugby team: Amber Balow Mckenzie Borchers Isabelle Haro Ella Hurley Avery Lobusch Delanna Martin Bryanna Matschiner Monica Reescano Katie Rozum Deja Steinbrecher Sierra Titus Jennifer Villanueva Taylor Welch Tori Wilson Nick Carline (assistant coach) Josh Dill (head coach) And that’s just the way it is. GOLD STAR FAMILIES VOICES ACT SPEECH OF  
HON. JODY B. HICE 
OF GEORGIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, September 6, 2016 Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4511, the Gold Star Families Voices Act, to commemorate the missing voices of American veterans who died as a result of their wartime service or were missing in action. In 2000, Congress created the Veterans History Project at the Library of Congress to turn the memories of our vet-erans into history and to memorialize the lives of the heroes whose selfless sacrifice has contributed—and continues to contribute—to our collective understanding of who we are as Americans. After hearing of this remarkable project, my staff and I have sat down with over a dozen veterans from the 10th District of Georgia in order to properly document their brave serv-ice. These dedicated men and women in uni-form and their equally dedicated families shared their experiences, always with their pa-triotism, commitment, and sacrifice at the fore-front. Once again, I am awed by the inspirational people of the 10th District of Georgia, and I am honored to represent such heroic veterans in Congress. With the passage of H.R. 4511, we, as a Nation, commemorate the sacrifice of these families through the stories they share, aptly expanding and enhancing the collection of the Veterans History Project.

HONORING THE 25TH ANNIVER-SARY OF MACEDONIAN INDE-PENDENCE 
HON. CANDICE S. MILLER 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 8, 2016 Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Macedonian-Amer-ican community in honor of their homeland’s 25th Independence Day. The people of the Republic of Macedonia voted on September 8, 1991, to officially gain independence from the former Yugoslavia. By voting for independ-ence, the people decided that it was time for their country to forge its own democratic path and to begin a new era in their history. This 25th anniversary of their independence pro-vides us all an opportunity to recognize the Macedonian-American community’s significant contributions within the United States. But first, I would like to ask for a moment of silence for the 24 victims of devastating floods that affected Macedonia’s capital Skopje (Scop-yay) last month, which left hundreds in-jured and thousands displaced. Our own gov-ernment provided over $50,000 in aid to help these flood victims and repair schools in time for the start of the school year.

Since 2001, Macedonia has been one of the staunchest allies of the United States in the War on Terror. Macedonia was the fourth and fifth largest contributor of troops, per capita, in the mission in Afghanistan. Macedonian troops guarded American troops at the compound in Kabul. And, Macedonia welcomed 50,000 and 400,000 refugees during the wars in Bosnia and Kosovo, respectively. For a country of lit-tle over two million, Macedonia has done its fair share and deserves to be in NATO. On that note, I ask that you join me, and 35 col-leagues, in cosponsoring H. Res. 56 in sup-port of Macedonia’s NATO accession as soon as possible. With American support, Macedonia has be-come a model of stability in a region known for ethnic strife and tension. Up until earlier this year, Macedonia was struck with the un-precedented refugee crisis facing Europe, as hundreds of thousands of migrants and refu-gees fled war-torn countries in the Middle East and North Africa. In one year, an estimated one million migrants traveled through Mac-edonia, and the country’s institutions orga-nized an orderly response to the influx of peo-ple, including organizing daily trains to ferry migrants from the southern to the northern border. If the partnership between the United States and Macedonia is to remain strong, the country needs our continued support. I also use this opportunity to urge Macedo-nia’s leaders to continue strengthening their institutions and reforming its democracy and rule of law, especially following the slated De-cember 11, 2016 elections, which will prove a true test of its democracy. As a way to recognize and strengthen this strategic U.S.-Macedonia partnership, I started the first Congressional Caucus on Macedonia and Macedonian-Americans. This Caucus is a bipartisan group of members of Congress dedicated to maintaining and strengthening a positive and mutually beneficial relationship between the United States and the Republic of Macedonia, as well as advocating for the con-cerns and interests of the Macedonian-Amer-ican community in the United States. Michigan’s 10th District has one of the larg-est populations of Macedonian-Americans in the Nation. I would like to acknowledge their contributions to our District and our State, and I look forward to continuing that relationship as we deal with the problems facing our great Nation. Again, congratulations to all of Macedonian heritage for their achievements as we com-memorate this important 25th anniversary of Macedonia’s independence. Long Live Macedonia (Da Zivee Makedonija) Long Live the United States (Da Zivee Amerika)

‘‘TURN THE PAGE’’ LITERACY INITIATIVE 
HON. TED POE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 8, 2016 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, every sum-mer youth without access to books lose aca-demic skills, while those who are reading con-tinue to make progress in developing their pro-ficiency. Studies show that summer learning loss is a significant cause of the achievement gap between lower- and higher-income youth. Students from low-income households learn at the same rate as their peers while school is in session, but while middle- and upper-income students show slight gains in their reading per-formance after the summer months, lower in-come students experience a two-month loss in reading achievement. It is what teachers refer to as the ‘‘summer slide’’ or ‘‘summer setback.’’ This loss is cu-mulative: while teachers spend 4 to 6 weeks re-teaching material to the students who have fallen behind over the summer, other students are progressing with their skills. The result? By the end of the sixth grade, children who lose reading skills during the summer are on average 2 years behind their peers. Even more startling is the conclusion of University of Nevada research, which has shown that stu-dents without access to books are less likely to complete their basic education. The simple fact is that there are fewer op-portunities for daily summer reading when both parents are away at work. Without ac-cess to books, our kids fall behind. My daughter teaches English at Baylor Uni-versity. She has dedicated her life to edifying the young people of this country by instilling in them a love for reading, and for the intellectual tradition it gives them access to. This love needs to start early, and the inheritance of that tradition should be accessible to all Amer-icans. That is why I am proud of the efforts of KHOU and Star Furniture, who are rolling out a new community effort to increase the literacy rate in Houston. They are soliciting donations for the non-profit group ‘‘Books Between Kids,’’ which provides at-risk children with books that they can keep in their home. We need more programs like this in our country. f 
IN HONOR OF JAN BLACK 
HON. SAM FARR 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 8, 2016 Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to com-mend the remarkable personal and profes-sional achievements of Dr. Jan Black, a great educator, selfless activist, and dear personal friend. Jan is at the same time a model Amer-ican and a global citizen. Over the years she has devoted countless hours to local political campaigns for offices ranging from the Presi-dent and Congress to city council and school board. Equally, she has been a tireless advo-cate and traveled around the world on behalf of international education and human rights. Jan has taught for many years at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, California. She earned her BA in Art and Spanish from the University of Ten-nessee.

Jan’s international experience includes Sen-ior Associate Membership at St. Antony’s Col-lege, Oxford University; Fulbright, Mellon and other grants and Fellowships in South Amer-ica, the Caribbean, and India; on-site or short- term teaching and honorary faculty positions in several Latin American countries, and exten-sive overseas lecturing and research. She was also a Peace Corps Volunteer in Chile and a faculty member with the University of Pitts-burgh’s Semester-at-Sea program. Jan was a research professor in the Division of Public Administration, University of New Mexico, and editor and research administrator in American University’s Foreign Area Studies Division. She has also served on some two dozen international editorial and non-govern-mental organization boards and has published numerous articles and books, including most recently a 2009 book titled ‘‘The Politics of Human Rights Protection.’’ In 2011, Jan was elected to the Board of Di-rectors of Amnesty International USA, she is a member of the Advisory Boards of the Inter-national Political Science Association’s Com-mittee on Civil-Military Affairs; the Global Stud-ies Program of California State University, San Jose; and the PhD Fellowship Program of the U.S. Inter-American Foundation.

RECOGNIZING THE 90TH BIRTHDAY OF THE CITY OF MIAMI SPRINGS 
HON. MARIO DIAZ-BALART 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 8, 2016 Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the city of Miami Springs on the oc-casion of its 90th birthday. Miami Springs was founded in 1926 by avia-tion pioneer Glenn H. Curtiss. Since that time, Miami Springs has grown to be home to 14,000 Floridians who prize the town for its small-town feel and civic amenities. Miami Springs has been distinguished with several awards. In recognition of the historic nature of the town and numerous buildings and memorials that illustrate Florida history, the city was designated a ‘‘Preserve America Community’’ by former First Lady Laura Bush in 2008. Today, visitors and residents can tour over twenty historic sites. Additionally, Miami Springs has been certified as a Tree City USA since 1993. For 90 years, Miami Springs has profited from and contributed to the community sur-rounding Miami International Airport. The city is a vibrant part of South Florida, and con-tinues to be a wonderful place to live, raise a family, and open a business. I am proud to have collaborated with the thriving City of Miami Springs, and look forward to partnering with its leaders for many years to come. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to pay tribute to the City of Miami Springs on this auspicious milestone, and I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing this exceptional city.

HONORING EAGLE SCOUT REECE O’CONNOR 
HON. PETER J. ROSKAM 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 8, 2016 Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to recognize Reece O’Connor, an exceptional and accomplished young man from the Sixth District of Illinois. Reece is a senior at Hinsdale Central High School and has not only earned the rank of Eagle Scout but has earned every single merit badge the Boy Scouts of America have to offer. This achievement represents many years of diligence and personal determination in sup-port of the ideals of scouting. What makes this achievement even more impressive is the fact that Reece did not join Boy Scouts until the 7th grade. Even with the late start, Reece made it his goal to ‘‘catch up’’ to the rest of his scout mates—and ultimately he surpassed his goal. While the Scouts only offer 136 merit badges, he currently has 138 badges. The Boy Scouts frequently add new badges and retire old ones for special occasions; for example Reece earned several badges that were only offered during the Scouts’ 100th anniversary. Accord-ing to a spokesman for the Boy Scouts of America Reece’s success is ‘‘an extremely rare achievement.’’ Reece’s Eagle Scout project was also an impressive accomplishment. In 2013, the sum-mer before he started high school, he orga-nized a shoe drive and collected more than 1,000 pairs of shoes. These shoes were sent to people in Oklahoma displaced by torna-does, and to refugees in Nicaragua and Rwanda. Reece is a testament to the Boy Scouts organization and all that it stands for. Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring Reece for his remarkable achievements. 11TH ANNUAL NATIONAL NIGHT OUT IN THE CITY OF BULVERDE, TEXAS ON OCTOBER 4, 2016 HON. LAMAR SMITH 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 8, 2016 Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, National Night Out is an annual community-building campaign that promotes police-community partnerships and neighborhood camaraderie in order to make our neighborhoods safer. The City of Bulverde, which is located in the 21st Congressional District in Texas, facilitates Na-tional Night Out as a unique opportunity to join with thousands of other communities across the country in promoting cooperative, police- community crime prevention efforts. Congratulations to the City of Bulverde as it marks its 11th consecutive year participating in this important event with the Bulverde Po-lice Department. Each year, community partici-pation has increased. In 2015, Bulverde placed 2nd in Texas in the National Night Out Awards Program and 14th in the U.S. in their population category. Thanks go to the citizens of Bulverde as they join the Bulverde Police Department and the National Association of Town Watch in supporting the Annual National Night Out on October 4, 2016.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF ST. JOHN THE BAPTIST FIRE CHIEF SPENCER CHAUVIN 
HON. CEDRIC L. RICHMOND 
OF LOUISIANA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 8, 2016 Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and service of St. John the Baptist Fire Chief Spencer Chauvin. Chief Chauvin lost his life on August 28th after being struck by a charter bus while responding to a car accident. From the time he was a teenager, Chauvin knew that he wanted to serve his community by following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather who both served as firefighters. At the age of 14, Chauvin became a volunteer firefighter with the St. John the Baptist Parish Westside Volunteer Fire Department. He continued to show his dedication to serv-ice by working as an EMT for Acadian Ambu-lance then later receiving his Associate’s De-gree in Fire Science. In 2004, Chauvin joined the St. John the Baptist Fire Department full- time where he then became District Chief. After 40 years of service, Chief Chauvin leaves behind a legacy that will resonate for years to come. My deepest condolences and prayers are with Chief Chauvin’s family, his fellow firefighters, and especially his two young children. FL INVENTOR HALL OF FAME 2016 HON. GUS M. BILIRAKIS

CITY OF BRONSON’S SESQUICENTENNIAL CELEBRATION 
HON. TIM WALBERG 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 8, 2016 Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the City of Bronson’s Sesqui-centennial celebration. The city of Bronson—located in the heart of Branch County—was first incorporated as a village in 1866 under the name Bronson’s Prairie. Named for Jabez B. Bronson, who was the first settler to the area and later the first village postmaster, Bronson was officially chartered as a city in 1934. Known as the ‘‘Gladiolus Capital of the United States,’’ Bronson grows the finest gla-diola flowers along with other diverse agricul-tural commodities on over 300 local farms. The city is also home to a strong industrial base, with a mixture of precision metal ma-chining, tool and die, and automotive assem-bly, among numerous other manufacturing shops. With its many lakes and trails, farmer’s mar-kets, and concerts in the park, Bronson is busy with countless activities for all. Its yearly Polish Festival attracts visitors from throughout the region, featuring Polish food, vendors, crafters, and a parade. A gem of the community—the Bronson Pub-lic Library—remains as one of the few remain-ing Carnegie Libraries still in its original unaltered configuration. It is truly an honor to commemorate this ex-citing celebration for the people of Bronson— where family, friends, and neighbors proudly come together to make the community a spe-cial place to call home. Congratulations to the citizens of Bronson as they celebrate 150 years. f 
THANKING TINA HANONU FOR HER DEDICATED SERVICE TO THE HOUSE 
HON. CANDICE S. MILLER 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 8, 2016 Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge and thank Ms. Tina Hanonu, who, after 31 years of dedicated service to the United States House of Rep-resentatives, retired August 5, 2016. Tina began her career in 1984 serving as an advisor and consultant to Representative Connie Morella and went on to become a sen-ior systems administrator for Representative Sherwood Boehlert. Recognizing her technical know-how and proven ability to provide seam-less customer solutions in the IT field, Ms. Hanonu was hired by the House’s Chief Ad-ministrative Officer as a systems administrator for House Information Resources. During her tenure with House Information Resources, Ms. Hanonu was promoted multiple times and took on several important roles, including the Direc-tor of Technology Support, Assistant Chief Ad-ministrative Officer and then finally the Senior Advisor for the Transition to the 115th Con-gress. Having worked in various capacities on the Hill, Tina developed a comprehensive under-standing of the House’s complex IT needs and worked tirelessly to serve the House commu-nity. Tina’s colleagues at the CAO and the countless congressional offices she worked with over the course of her three-decade ca-reer, not only praised her many skills, but also her upbeat attitude, positive approach to every problem and strong work ethic that cultivated strong relationships between Member offices and administrative House organizations. Ms. Hanonu’s supervisor, Chief Information Officer Catherine Szpindor, praised Tina’s ‘‘deep commitment to the House and genuine love for the role she played in supporting the Member, Committee, and Leadership offices and CAO offices over her 31 year tenure.’’ Tina once said that despite her many years working on the Hill, she would get ‘‘goosebumps every day’’ when she saw the Capitol Dome. The privilege of working here at the Capitol was not lost on Ms. Hanonu and it showed every day. Mr. Speaker, I think it’s clear that those who worked with Ms. Hanonu considered it a privilege to call her a colleague and a friend. On behalf of the U.S. House of Representa-tives, I personally congratulate Tina on her re-tirement, and thank her for her outstanding dedication and contributions to this institution.

RECOGNIZING TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INCORPORATED 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 8, 2016 Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to applaud the work of Texas Instruments Incorporated and to rec-ognize the important contributions they have made to accelerate U.S. innovation and in-crease access to high-quality science, tech-nology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education in my home state of Texas. Texas Instruments was founded in 1951, when Cecil H. Green, J. Erik Jonsson, Eugene McDermott, and Patrick E. Haggerty reorga-nized Geophysical Service Incorporated after the company had produced the world’s first commercial silicon transistor. They evolved the business from a company primarily serving the oil and gas industry to a semiconductor manu-facturer. As an organization fundamentally built by engineers and scientists, research and development has always been a top priority. Sincere in their desire to invest in innovation and education in their own community, the founders helped establish the University of Texas at Dallas in 1969 with the vision of cre-ating a local science, technology, and re-search institution. Over the years, the leadership of Texas In-struments has not lost the vision of the found-ers. They have continued a commitment to im-proving STEM education in Texas and cre-ating high-skilled jobs across the nation by in-vesting in the surrounding community and schools and by maintaining manufacturing fa-cilities within the United States. In early August 2016, Texas Instruments and the Texas Instruments Foundation an-nounced a commitment of $5.4 million to the advancement of STEM education in public schools, with an emphasis on creating oppor-tunities for girls and minorities. The majority of this contribution will be distributed to North Texas schools, including $1.7 million for Southern Methodist University to train a large new cadre of middle school science teachers. An additional $2 million will support the profes-sional development of math and science teachers as well as teacher training for Ad-vanced Placement courses through the proven National Math and Science Initiative. Mr. Speaker, Texas Instrument’s generous 2016 contribution to STEM education is testa-ment to their unwavering 65-year commitment to the Dallas area and to our nation. Their philanthropic history represents the best of what can be accomplished in partnership be-tween companies and their local communities. I am proud to honor Texas Instruments today, and I look forward to all they will continue to do in the future.

HON. NORMA J. TORRES 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 8, 2016 Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Rialto Unified School District (USD) on their 125th anniversary. For 125 years, the Rialto USD has taken part in edu-cating our children and fostering the bright leaders of tomorrow. Rialto USD services a diverse population of approximately 25,500 students, with more than 2,700 district employees. Presently, the Dis-trict has three comprehensive high schools, one adult education school, one continuation high school, 5 middle schools, 19 elementary schools, and 20 preschools. Not only is the Ri-alto USD the largest employer of the City, but they are always looking for ways to give back to their community. They embrace a vision of providing an education that prepares all stu-dents for their future. They pursue a mission to provide high levels of instruction for all stu-dents and to inspire every student to set goals and maximize their potential. In 2010, Rialto USD inaugurated the ‘Cesar Chavez/Dolores Huerta Center for Education,’ a new professional development center and location for community events. Under the leadership of Dr. Cuauhte ´moc Avila, the District’s first Latino school chief, Ri-alto USD has received several awards includ-ing state academic, athletic, and fine arts awards. In 2015, Dollahan and Myers Elemen-tary Schools in Rialto were honored as the California ‘Gold Ribbon Schools’ which recog-nizes outstanding educational programs and practices. For their many contributions to the greater community of Rialto, I would like to recognize the Rialto Unified School District for their 125 years of service to the 35th District. f 
HONORING DR. JUAN QUINTANA, DNP, MHS, CRNA, PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF NURSE ANESTHETISTS 
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY 
OF ILLINOIS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 8, 2016 Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Dr. Juan Quintana, DNP, MHS, CRNA. Dr. Quintana will soon complete his year as national president of the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists (AANA) whose headquarters are located in my district. I am proud that Dr. Quintana was elected as 2015–2016 president, and I want to congratulate him on his year of leadership of this prestigious national organization. Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs) are advanced practice registered nurses who administer approximately 43 mil-lion anesthetics to patients each year. They work in every setting where anesthesia is de-livered, including the Veteran Health Adminis-tration, Department of Defense, hospital sur-gical suites, obstetrical delivery rooms, ambu-latory surgical centers, and the offices of den-tists, podiatrists, and specialty surgeons. They also provide acute and chronic pain manage-ment services to patients in need of such care. CRNAs provide anesthesia for all types of surgical cases and are the sole anesthesia providers in many rural hospitals. The president of Sleepy Anesthesia, an an-esthesia practice founded in 1999, Dr. Quin-tana has been practicing anesthesia since 1997. Graduating with a Doctor of Nursing Practice degree from Texas Christian Univer-sity in 2009, Dr. Quintana is a leader in the area of education and evaluation of cost-effec-tiveness and efficiency. A highly sought-after lecturer, he has been invited to speak at hos-pitals and numerous anesthesia meetings on the state and national levels about the busi-ness of anesthesia, cost effectiveness of best anesthesia practice models, cost effectiveness of anesthesia professionals, and anesthesia billing and compliance. In 2010, Dr. Quintana became the first CRNA to serve on the Medicare Evidence De-velopment and Coverage Advisory Council (MEDCAC), an independent body that pro-vides the Medicare agency guidance and ex-pert advice on the science and technology af-fecting healthcare delivery. Dr. Quintana, is also an educator, ex-officio faculty to the Texas Christian University (TCU) Doctor of Nursing Practice program, and ad-junct faculty to TCU’s Nurse Anesthesia Pro-gram, both in Fort Worth, Texas. Dr. Quintana resides in Winnsboro, Texas. During his AANA Presidency, Dr. Quintana has been a prominent advocate before federal agencies and with members of Congress for nurse anesthetists and the patients they serve so well. He has worked tirelessly to improve veterans’ access to care through recognition of CRNAs and other advanced practice reg-istered nurses as Full Practice Authority Pro-viders in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), promote anesthesia patient safety and the value of CRNAs to our healthcare system, ensure proper implementation of the provider non-discrimination provision of the Affordable Care Act, and obtain appropriate recognition of the full scope of CRNA practice including pain management and related services in the Medicare system. I extend my sincere congratulations to Dr. Quintana today on a job well done. His service to the AANA, our veterans, and patients is deeply appreciated, and his commitment to guaranteeing access to high quality health care nationwide is commendable. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing his nota-ble career and outstanding achievements.

INTRODUCTION OF THE LIMITING INHUMANE FEDERAL TRAPPING (LIFT) FOR PUBLIC SAFETY ACT 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 8, 2016 Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing legislation to severely restrict the use of inhumane body-gripping traps on certain public lands and by certain public offi-cials. Countless dogs, cats, and wild animals are injured and killed each year in body-grip-ping traps such as leg and foothold, Conibear, and snare traps. These traps are used by fed-eral agencies, state and local governments, private entities, and individual trappers to catch creatures for their fur, keep animals away from livestock and crops, and even for recreational purposes. Unfortunately, body- gripping traps subject captured animals to in-tense pain—sometimes for hours or even days—before they may eventually die from de-hydration, injuries, predation, or when a trap-per eventually finds them. Furthermore, these traps are non-selective in their victims, and

may capture and even kill non-target species such as pets and other companion animals, particularly if set in popular areas. There are many effective non-lethal methods that can be deployed in place of these cruel traps. Wildlife Services, a federal agency notorious for its secrecy and use of inhumane animal management techniques, is responsible for the death or capture of thousands of animals per year in cruel body-gripping traps, often used as a first resort. Wildlife Services also advises and enters into contracts and cooperative agreements with state and local governments, as well as with private entities, to kill animals using these traps. Other federal agencies, too, use body-gripping traps to control animal spe-cies—too often without attempting more hu-mane, effective, and non-lethal control options first. This bill will severely limit Wildlife Serv-ices’ and other agencies’ ability to deploy or counsel others to deploy cruel body-gripping traps, increasing transparency for this agency and ensuring that taxpayer dollars are prioritized for nonlethal methods of control. Although trapping is regulated at the state level, federal land management agencies have oversight of where and when trapping occurs on federal land. Unfortunately, federal agen-cies have limited data showing where traps are deployed on public lands, thereby pro-longing the suffering of trapped animals and leaving the public to learn about traps only when pets and humans are injured. The bill tackles this issue as well, making sure that federal agencies in the Departments of Agri-culture and Interior do a better job of regu-lating trapping by non-federal entities on public lands, thereby limiting cruelty and protecting public safety. In Oregon and across the country, there have been too many concerning examples of wild animals suffering and pets falling victim to these traps. This bill complements efforts by other colleagues in the House and Senate to crack down on the use of body-gripping traps, in light of the growing public acknowledgement that we should not and cannot continue to en-dorse the widespread use of these inhumane devices.

BIG BEAR CITY COMMUNITY SERV-ICES DISTRICT CELEBRATES 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. PAUL COOK 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 8, 2016 Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of the Big Bear City Community Services District (BBCCSD) 50th anniversary. BBCCSD hosted a special ceremony on Mon-day, August 1, 2016 during their regularly scheduled board meeting to mark this special occasion. BBCCSD was formed in 1966 to provide water, solid waste, and sewer services to resi-dents of Big Bear City and East Valley. As the representative of Big Bear City in the U.S. House of Representatives, I’d like to con-gratulate BBCCSD Board President Paul Terry, Board Vice President John Green, Board Member Karyn Oxandaboure, Board Member Larry Walsh, and Board Member Al Ziegler. In addition, I’d like to recognize past and current BBCCSD employees for their con-tributions to the residents of Big Bear City and surrounding communities. f 
CAPE LOOKOUT LIFE SAVING STATION 
HON. WALTER B. JONES 
OF NORTH CAROLINA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 8, 2016 Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, commencing first in 1848, the United States Life Saving Service was a federal government agency that grew out of private and local humanitarian efforts to create and man rescue stations along the coast. These outposts were often remote. The men stationed there took great pride in their deep commitment to save the lives of ship-wrecked mariners and passengers, often against overwhelming odds. In 1874, life sav-ing stations were added along the coast of Maine, Cape Cod, and the famed Outer Banks of North Carolina. In 1878, this network of sta-tions was formally organized as a separate agency of the United States Department of the Treasury. In 1915, the Service formally merged with the Revenue Cutter Service to form the United States Coast Guard. These lonely, isolated outposts were always manned by the bravest of men who knew no fear, and who were dedicated to their sworn duty of res-cuing seamen in distress. Their motto was ‘‘to always go, but not always return’’. Even now, many stories are told about the daring rescues by such men, some admittedly embellished a bit for literary interest. Proudly beat the hearts today of all who can call themselves their de-scendants. One of the most notable of these rescues occurred on a cold, blustery winter’s night in February of 1905. The three-masted schooner, Sarah D. J. Rawson, was two days out of Georgetown, South Carolina and bound for New York with a full cargo of lumber. While running under reefed sails in a heavy winter squall on February 8, she ran up hard aground on Cape Lookout Shoals at approxi-mately 5:00 PM. Managing as best he could under extreme conditions, the captain gave or-ders to take in all canvas and prepare for the worst. While the brave crew performed its work, a Norwegian seaman—Jacob Hansen— was swept overboard to his death, his body given up to the shoals. The violent onslaughts of the treacherous waves continually broke over the ship eventually carrying away her spars, deckhouses, running rigging, and life boat, her cargo of lumber likewise being scat-tered like match sticks among the unforgiving seas. Positioning themselves among the high-est points of her masts, the crewmen did the best they could to preserve their lives while hoping and praying throughout the night that help would soon arrive, but no doubt fearful of a bad ending to their ordeal. The following morning broke with a thick mantle of fog enshrouding the sea. While scanning the ocean at approximately noon of the 9th, the duty watchman of the Cape Look-out life saving crew who was posted atop the watch tower spotted the uppermost mast heads of the Rawson through the fog bank. Realizing the ship was in dire distress, he im-mediately called forth his fellow life savers from their barracks. Though many had high fe-vers and suffering from the flu, all leapt into action according to their rigorous training and hastened to the shore with their mule drawn wagon and such other equipment as they knew would be required. The surf boat was then launched through breaking seas, and with all hands aboard, they began to row the nine mile journey through the shoal waters to the stricken ship. Arriving on the scene about 4 PM, the life savers found themselves seri-ously surrounded and endangered by floating wreckage and lumber being cast about in the waves. As night was setting in, orders were given to stand away a bit and wait for more fa-vorable sea conditions. With anchor set, these crewmen spent the entire night in the freezing cold huddled together in their little boat, await-ing the morning hour when seas would sub-side and be more in their favor for a rescue attempt. Throughout the night, the surf men suffered greatly from exposure, fatigue, and hunger, but none failed or faltered to perform their sworn duty as life savers. At about 1 PM of the 10th, and with their hopes encouraged and renewed, the life sav-ers were able to commence a rescue attempt due to better conditions of wind and tide, and so they approached the Rawson close enough to lay in amongst the nearby wave troughs and cast over their ‘‘heaving line’’ to the deck of the ship. With the first attempt successful, the first fortunate seaman tied the rope around his waist, jumped into the sea, and was pulled to the safety of the life boat. His companions followed his example, and one by one in turn, all hands were rescued in like fashion. Once all were brought aboard, the life savers began the long, exhausting pull back to the shore, now loaded with the weight of fourteen men— eight life savers and the six rescued seamen. The savers gave up their oil skins and wrapped those and other garments about the huddled, suffering seamen so they could bet-ter endure the perils of the freezing weather. The crew of the Rawson had been forty- eight hours without food or water. The life sav-ers had spent twenty-eight hours in their cramped, open boat being cast about in the treacherous seas without food or sufficient warmth, uncertain whether a successful res-cue could even be achieved, given the per-ilous conditions. Upon their return to the shore, the Rawson seamen were given food and shelter at the station and eventually re-turned to their families and employers through intermediary assistance. The fate of the Sarah D. J. Rawson and her crew would never have been known but for the unflinching heroism of the crew of the Cape Lookout Life Saving Sta-tion. Each member was subsequently awarded the Gold Lifesaving Medal for extreme and selfless service in this famous rescue. All had admirably performed their sworn duty in the face of incredible obstacles and in the highest traditions of the Life Saving Service. A more complete report of the Rawson rescue ap-pears at: http://www.coastalguide.com/helms-man/rawsonrescue.shtml. The names of the members who were at-tached to the Cape Lookout Station and par-ticipated in this rescue are: William H. Gaskill (the ‘‘Keeper’’), Kilby Guthrie, Walter M. Yeo-mans, Tyre Moore, James W. Fulcher, John E. Kirkman, Calupt T. Jarvis, and Joseph L. Lewis, some of the bravest ‘‘Tar Heel’’ sons ever hatched out of Carteret County homes. During World War II, the U.S. Government made a request of these men to return their gold medals to support the war effort. The

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 8, 2016 Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to ac-knowledge the eight Loudoun County students selected by the Claude Moore Charitable Foundation to be a part of the 2016 Future Leaders Program. I would like to personally commemorate Gabby Lewis, Ryan Wells, Maria Fernando Pen˜a, Matthew Eberhart, Oriella Meija, Jasmine Lu, Devin MacGoy, and Madison Ojeda, each of whom has proven to be both outstanding students and remarkable people. They truly embody the very best of this nation’s values through their continued hard work and commitment to excellence in education. Loudoun County has continually provided a top notch learning environment with numerous opportunities and programs above and beyond its expectations, which has cultivated many young leaders like the ones I am recognizing today. These future leaders have developed amiable qualities similar to those of our na-tion’s leaders. This recognition is a clear testa-ment to the outstanding works these exem-plary individuals exhibit and they are deserv-ing of recognition. Mr. Speaker, it brings me immense pride to recognize such a fine group of students, and I sincerely hope that we all can live up to their remarkable example. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating them and I wish them the best of luck and continued success in their futures.

IN RECOGNITION OF STATER BROS. 80TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. NORMA J. TORRES 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 8, 2016 Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Inland Empire based supermarket chain Stater Bros. on their 80th year anniver-sary and their commitment to provide value, quality, and friendly service to families all across Southern California. On August 17, 1936, the first Stater Bros. store was opened in the San Bernardino County by two World War II veteran brothers, Cleo & Leo Stater. The company has become the largest privately owned chain of super-market stores in Southern California and is the largest private employer in both San Bernardino County and Riverside County. Stater Bros. currently operates 168 super-markets with approximately 18,000 members working as part of the Stater Bros. family. As a company that was founded by veterans, nearly 2,000 employees have served or con-tinue to serve in multiple branches of our armed forces. Stater Bros. advances the leg-acy of its founders by continuing to give back to the communities it serves. Stater Bros. is among the top 100 privately owned businesses in the country and it is a valued and valuable member of the commu-nity. They have provided funding to countless local organizations benefitting hunger relief, children’s well-being, education, health care, and help for our nation’s veterans. This in-cludes support for organizations such as Feeding America, Toys for Tots, the Children’s Fund, and the ‘Believe Walk’ to fight cancer. Their generosity has garnered Stater Bros. several honors and recognitions such as the Donor of the Year award from Feeding Amer-ica’s Riverside/San Bernardino chapter for leading efforts to donate over 3 million pounds of food to local food charities each year. Stater Bros. also received the Best Emissions Rate award from the U.S. Environmental Pro-tection Agency for helping remove nearly 40 million pounds of waste from landfills each year through their Green Waste Composting Program. Because they go above and beyond to serve their community, I would like to recog-nize and congratulate Stater Bros. on their 80th Anniversary. f

IN RECOGNITION OF BURR GRAY 
HON. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN 
OF MARYLAND  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 8, 2016 Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the remarkable service of Burr Gray to our community. Burr has served as the President of the Cabin John Citizens As-sociation in Cabin John, Maryland for 20 years. He was elected to lead the Association in 1997 and has served the Cabin John com-munity with vision and distinction ever since. Burr is an exemplar of what it means to be engaged in a community. In 1997, at the be-ginning of his first term, Burr encouraged members of the Cabin John community to be-come volunteers, to be active in its Citizens Association, and to participate in the first Cabin John Stream Cleanup. Thanks to Burr’s leadership, the Cabin John Stream Cleanup is now a community tradition that keeps this wa-terway to the Potomac River and, ultimately, the Chesapeake Bay, clean. Burr also encour-aged community members to support Friends of Cabin John Creek, a coalition of neighbor-hood community organizations working to curb stormwater runoff. Burr brought the community’s love for the Potomac River to a new level when he began the Cabin John Regatta in 1999. This annual canoe trip has increased respect for the River within the community and allows members of the community to enjoy the natural beauty of Cabin John. Burr’s other endeavors are numerous and include an annual community blood drive, plans for a playground at the Clara Barton Community Center, and formation of Friends of the Clara Barton Community Center. The list goes on and on. In 2008, Burr spearheaded the neighbor-hood effort to celebrate the 400th Anniversary of Captain John Smith’s voyage on the Poto-mac River in 1608. This event brought the community together and led the Citizens Asso-ciation to publish Cabin John: Legends and Life of an Uncommon Place. Burr has served on the Boards of the Poto-mac Conservancy and Glen Echo Park. He also spearheaded efforts to preserve Gibson Grove, a cemetery for freed slaves. These ef-forts led to the restoration of the area and a historical panel to highlight the significance of the site. Over the last two decades, Burr has put the needs of the Cabin John community first and has personified Cabin John’s traditions of service and leadership. I ask my colleagues to join me in expressing our deepest gratitude and appreciation to Burr Gray for his 20 years of creative and visionary service to the com-munity. f

with Bud and Michele and changed the course of their lives, This tireless couple went on to found Saint Paul-based Global Volunteers. This non-profit sends as many as 2,500 volunteers each year to 100 communities in 20 countries around the world. Bud and Michele understood that for programs like theirs to work, change had to come from within the developing communities. By building local partnerships, Global Volun-teers has made strides in agriculture, edu-cation, and public health care, impacting thou-sands of lives. Before Bud co-founded Global Volunteers, he was already acting as a community leader in Minnesota. Bud worked on the campaigns of Senators Eugene McCarthy and George McGovern. After law school, Bud represented the people of Minnesota in the State Legisla-ture, where he served on the education, agri-culture, and financial institutions committees. Later, he became the Assistant Commissioner for the Minnesota Department of Natural Re-sources. In 2009, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack appointed Bud as the U.S. Department of Ag-riculture’s Deputy Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services (FFAS). In this role, Bud coordinated the international ele-ments of the FFAS mission. Keeping with his past international development work, at the USDA Bud was also able to provide food aid as well as technical assistance to foreign countries in times of need. In his 70 years, Bud has come to exemplify the term ‘‘global citizen’’. From his leadership at home in Minnesota to the countless lives Bud and Michele have improved around the world, Bud represents the positive change a person can make in the world. Here is to a happy birthday for Bud, and for many more years of family, health, and happiness.

THE CENTENNIAL OF THE CRE-ATION OF THE UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMIS-SION 
HON. SANDER M. LEVIN 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 8, 2016 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the centennial of the creation of the United States International Trade Commis-sion. As Ranking Member of the Committee on Ways and Means, the committee that over-sees the Commission, I want to congratulate the Commission on this anniversary and the Commission’s staff who do important work. Congress has tasked the Commission with a number of important roles, including admin-istering U.S. trade remedies laws in a neutral and objective fashion, maintaining the har-monized tariff schedule, and determining whether foreign goods violate U.S. intellectual property laws or are otherwise unfairly traded. Congress has also called upon the Commis-sion to independently investigate and analyze a wide range of issues related to international economics. The Commission’s role in this re-gard is highlighted by the lack of detailed anal-ysis on many international economic issues that impact the lives of American workers and families. The impact of U.S. trade agreements is not a hypothetical issue, and we cannot simply assume that the benefits of trade will outweigh its costs or that those who benefit will compensate those who lose. We need new models and new thinking regarding how we analyze the impact of international trade, and it is important that the Commission be a leader in that regard. I look forward to working with the Commis-sion, as it begins its second century of work, to ensure that the analysis of international trade addresses 21st century economic issues. f 
MR. GEORGE PIRO 
HON. LEE M. ZELDIN 
OF NEW YORK  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 8, 2016 Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay a special tribute to Mr. George Piro, who passed away on July 23, 2016, at the age of 95. George’s story is unlike any other. When he answered his country’s call to duty and en-listed in the U.S. Army in January of 1942 dur-ing World War II, he could have never envi-sioned the trials and tribulations that would await him just a year later. In September 1943, on his ninth combat mission, George was forced to parachute from a B–24 Liberator after it was shot down in the mountains about 80 miles east of Rome. When they made land-fall, they were unfortunately taken by the local police and found themselves continually on the move from one POW camp to the next until they arrived at Stalag Luft 1, where they would spend the remainder of the war as pris-oners. George and his fellow service members were finally liberated on April 30, 1945, the same year he returned to Bellport, NY. In 1946, he married Madeleine Myers, whom he had met prior to enlisting, and started working at the local post office. In addition to all he managed to accomplish as a service member and in his personal life; he was also a charter member of the VFW in East Patchogue, NY. George is survived by his brother, daughter, two grandchildren, four great-grandchildren, and two great-great grandchildren. I would like to take this opportunity to thank George for his years of dedication and service to our country and community. What he had to endure as a POW cannot be summarized in a few words; however it is important we honor these types of individuals as best we can. It is my hope that many will follow in his footsteps and give back to our country as graciously as he did. People like him are a rare breed and they help make not only our country, but our world a much safer and better place.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE AND DEDICATION OF THE MEMBERS AND VOLUNTEERS AT GLEANING FOR THE WORLD, INC. 
HON. ROBERT HURT 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 8, 2016 Mr. HURT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I submit these remarks to recognize the service and dedication of the members and volunteers at Gleaning for the World, Inc. Gleaning for the World is a non-profit, hu-manitarian aid organization that provides life- saving supplies and equipment to those in need at home and abroad. From its begin-nings in the basement of its founder, Rev-erend Ronald Davidson, the organization ex-panded to an ever-growing facility in Concord, Virginia and now serves more than 55 coun-tries. Gleaning for the World currently utilizes over 2,100 local volunteers and expects that number to increase to over 4,000 with the re-cent addition of its new Volunteer Center. The organization prides itself on operating innovatively and efficiently. Forbes Magazine recognized Gleaning for the World four of the last five years as ‘‘The Most Efficient Large Charity in America.’’ Rather than serving as a stand-alone charity, it partners with churches and other charitable organizations to coordi-nate and maximize the strengths of all for the common good. Over the course of 17 years, Gleaning for the World saved over 35 acres of landfill space by repurposing products for hu-manitarian purposes. For every dollar donated, it places $103 worth of supplies domestically and $212 worth of supplies internationally. Gleaning for the World serves as a first re-sponder non-profit for emergencies in the United States and provides water and other critical supplies within hours of natural disas-ters at home. Recently, the organization served as a critical resource in its own back-yard following devastating tornado damage in Appomattox County. Gleaning for the World continues that role to this day as a long-term relief coordinator for Appomattox County. I ask the Members of this House of Rep-resentatives to join with me in thanking Glean-ing for the World, Reverend Ronald Davidson, and all of its members and volunteers, for its unwavering, dedicated service at home and abroad. f 
IN TRIBUTE TO RICHARD MASLOWSKI 
HON. GWEN MOORE

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 8, 2016 Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Richard Maslowski who has served as the City of Glendale, Wisconsin’s City Ad-ministrator since 1980. After 36 years of ex-emplary service to the City of Glendale, he re-tired effective on August 31, 2016. Richard Maslowski may well be the longest-serving city administrator in the State of Wisconsin and is a native of South Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He held similar positions in West Bend and Butler prior to assuming the Glendale City Adminis-trator position. Richard Maslowski has been a trans-formative figure for the City of Glendale, Wis-consin. He leaves behind a city that has un-dergone major positive changes due in large part to his broad influence and great leader-ship. When Richard Maslowski started working as Glendale’s City Administrator, the commu-nity’s most visible properties were Bayshore Mall and Jos. Schlitz Brewing Co.’s massive grain elevator. More than three decades later, the mall has been redeveloped as the mixed- use Bayshore Town Center, while a business park has replaced the grain elevator.

Under Mr. Maslowski’s direction, Glendale created its first tax incremental financing (TIF) district in 1981, for a hotel project; eight more districts followed during his tenure. The nine commercial developments developed during Mr. Maslowski’s tenure utilizing the city’s TIF district authority include: hotels, business parks, apartments and the conversion of Bayshore Mall into Bayshore Town Center being the largest TIF project. Mr. Maslowski always found a way to move the project forward. I was proud to work with Richard Maslowski to obtain a federal grant to help finance an off-ramp from I–43 to Bayshore’s main parking structure on N. Port Washington Road. At the time, I obtained the funds I did not represent Glendale in Con-gress but had previously represented Glendale in Wisconsin’s State Senate. I knew the area well and knew what it represented for the fu-ture of the City of Glendale and for this devel-opment, Bayshore Town Center, which opened in 2006. Mr. Maslowski has been an innovator, he was among the first to utilize TIFs for environ-mental cleanup costs. In 1992, Glendale used a TIF for environmental cleanup costs, an un-usual tactic then but is now commonplace, to convert a closed hotel, built on the site of a former dump, into a new Hotel complex. Glen-dale also became perhaps the first city in Wis-consin where the developer/company paid the costs upfront for environmental cleanup. The company later received property tax rebates to compensate it for the environmental cleanup costs. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize Mr. Richard Maslowski. He leaves big shoes to fill and a rich legacy of innovation, creativity, growth and sustainability for the City of Glen-dale. Mr. Maslowski has many skill sets and is always professional. However, I believe per-haps his strongest ability is bringing the right people together at critical times to complete a project and ultimately recreate a city. He is a true trailblazer. The citizens of the Fourth Con-gressional District, the State of Wisconsin and the nation have benefited tremendously from his dedicated service. I am honored for these reasons to pay tribute to Mr. Richard Maslowski.

HONORING NASA’S LAUNCH OF THE OSIRIS-REX 
HON. RAU´L M. GRIJALVA 
OF ARIZONA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 8, 2016 Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of NASA’s launch of the spacecraft OSI-RIS-REx to the asteroid Bennu. I am ex-tremely proud that Tucson is once again a key player in a critical NASA mission, as it was with the Mars Phoenix Lander mission a few years ago, and many others throughout our Nation’s history. In a seven-year roundtrip mission, OSIRIS- REx will journey to an asteroid that NASA has classified as ‘‘potentially hazardous’’ to Earth to complete a survey and return with the larg-est sample of extra-terrestrial material since the Apollo lunar missions. This program will yield insights into asteroid composition and how asteroids move in space. The most unique aspect of the OSIRIS-REx mission is the large and pristine sample that will be brought back to Earth, which will allow sci-entists to research the origins of our universe and galaxy and help us answer some of the most profound and fundamental questions that have intrigued mankind since our beginnings. We will be able to examine the composition of the asteroid using instruments and techniques that are far more advanced than those in space, including the potential for resources that could be mined from asteroids. The OSIRIS REx mission is funded by NASA and its science is led by the University of Arizona (UA). I would like to congratulate Dr. Dante Lauretta of the UA Lunar and Plan-etary Laboratory for his leadership as principal investigator and, along with his team, for bringing this exciting mission to the launch stage. I understand that Dante has been work-ing on this concept for the last 15 years, and I greatly look forward to celebrating even more milestones with his team as the mission pro-gresses. This mission is the latest in a long list of achievements by scientists at the University of Arizona in my home district. In fact, UA sci-entists have collaborated in every single American mission to the Moon and Mars since 1964, including serving as the lead on the Phoenix Mars Mission. I look forward to an-nouncing the next big milestone in Aug. of 2018, when the spacecraft will rendezvous with the asteroid called ‘‘Bennu’’ to begin sur-veying it before taking a sample and returning to Earth by 2023. In the meantime, the Univer-sity of Arizona will house mission control, as it did for the Phoenix Mars mission, continuing to involve undergraduate and graduate stu-dents in the research, which will help cultivate the next generation of STEM leaders—many of whom will be from my home state of Ari-zona. I wish the OSIRIS REx team the best of luck in their historic mission and congratulate them in their profound success. f 
HONORING HELEN LANDERS 
HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH 
OF FLORIDA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 8, 2016 Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I, along with Representative W
ASSERMAN SCHULTZ , Rep- resentative H
ASTINGS , and Representative F
RANKEL , rise today to honor the life and leg-acy of Helen Landers, who passed away on September 4, 2016. We commend Mrs. Landers’ decades of service to Broward Coun-ty and offer our sincerest condolences to her loved ones on her passing. Helen Landers served as Broward County Historian for over twenty years until her retire-ment at the age of 90. With her knowledge of the region and passion for history, she edu-cated South Floridians young and old about our rich heritage. Through her participation in historical events like Pioneer Days, she fos-tered a love of learning about the past. Helen Landers also dedicated much of her life to helping women empower women. She was a member of the Broward County Wom-en’s Hall of Fame, a founding member of the Broward County Women’s History Coalition, Chair of the Broward County Commission on the Status of Women 1989, and served on the National Board of Directors of the American Association of University Women. She advo-cated remarkably for women’s rights and pas-sage of the Equal Rights Amendment. Through her archival work and community service, Helen Landers preserved the stories of how South Florida came to be the home we know and love today. Her many contributions to our community will never be forgotten. It is with gratitude that we remember her life of service in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD .

HONORING MARION ASHEN LUSARDI 
HON. CANDICE S. MILLER 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 8, 2016 Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Marion Ashen Lusardi, or Midge as she is known to many. Midge is a longtime Michigan resident and a community treasure. Midge is the wife of Dr. Bob Lusardi, whom she married in 1970, and the proud mom of Matthew and Gregory. She graduated from St. Mary’s College in Indiana with a Bachelor of Arts in 1973 and received her Master’s degree in Library Science from Wayne State Univer-sity in 1991. She worked tirelessly as a Librar-ian at the Troy Public Library for several years before becoming the Director of the Chester-field Township Library, where she has served for the past 20 years. Throughout her time at the Chesterfield Township library, she secured over $1.2 mil-lion in awards and grants, which have pro-vided innumerable resources to our local com-munity. She is also the recipient of several awards, including the State Librarian’s Citation of Excellence Awards from the Library of Michigan. She also chaired the Michigan Li-brary Association’s Public Policy Committee in 2002. In addition to her service at the library, she has been a member of many community orga-nizations that have all been proud to have her input and positivity. She has promoted a love of reading and learning throughout the 10th District of Michigan, and, although she is retir-ing from her current post at the Chesterfield Township Library, I have no doubt that she will continue to serve our community in countless ways. Mr. Speaker, I believe we can all agree that providing our children and our communities with invaluable educational resources is a noble pursuit, and Midge has been a diligent example of this. I ask that my colleagues join me today in honoring Midge for her contribu-tions to the 10th District of the great State of Michigan, our children, and the future of this country.

HONORING MAJ. RAYMOND WINDMILLER 
HON. JIM COOPER 
OF TENNESSEE  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 8, 2016 Mr. COOPER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Maj. Raymond Windmiller on his re-tirement from the United States Army. Ray enlisted in the Army in 1989. After com-pleting Basic Combat Training, Advanced Indi-vidual Training and Airborne School, he was stationed with the 82nd Airborne Division in Fort Bragg, NC. Ray has served our nation honorably over his long and distinguished ca-reer spanning numerous assignments here and abroad, most notably two deployments to Iraq and one to Afghanistan. A decorated combat veteran and infantryman, Ray has earned dozens of awards, including a Bronze Star. I was fortunate to have Ray on my staff as an Army Congressional Fellow in 2012. His hands-on field and training experience and in- depth knowledge of national security affairs assisted me greatly in my role as a senior member of the House Armed Services Com-mittee. Mr. Speaker, Ray has dedicated himself to the United States Army every day for 27 years. I want to thank Ray, his wife, Amy, and their children, Hailey and Alex; they have served our community and made many sac-rifices for our country. Ray represents the very best of our Armed Forces, and I wish him all the best in his future endeavors. f
