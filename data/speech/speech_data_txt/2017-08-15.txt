TRIBUTE TO ROSELLE KINMAN 
HON. DAVID YOUNG 
OF IOWA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 15, 2017 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Roselle Kinman of Corning, Iowa for being honored with the 100 Great Nurses of Iowa Award. On the Great Nurses of Iowa website it states, ‘‘We have all met at least one out-standing nurse whose courage, competence, and commitment to patients and the nursing profession stand out above all others. Each year, the 100 Great Iowa Nurses program asks for patients, coworkers, friends, and fam-ily members to nominate an outstanding nurse for recognition.’’ Roselle was chosen because of her compassionate service to her patients. She strives for quality care and encourages other members of her team to do the same. She is a dedicated, well-respected, and valued employee in Catholic Health Initiatives surgical department. Mr. Speaker, Roselle’s efforts embody the Iowa spirit and I am honored to represent her and Iowans like her, in the United States Con-gress. I ask that all of my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating Roselle for her achieve-ments and in wishing her nothing but contin-ued success.

THE CITY OF BUENA VISTA, VIRGINIA 
HON. BOB GOODLATTE 
OF VIRGINIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 15, 2017 Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, For 125 years, the city of Buena Vista, Virginia, has stood at the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains by the Maury River. Though Buena Vista has seen many changes during this time, I have always known this community to be home to hardworking people who are eager to wel-come a neighbor and lend a helping hand. The city’s origins can be traced back to the opening of a simple tannery by Benjamin Moomaw. In the early days, the community was known by several names, including Green Forest—a fitting name given the beautiful sur-rounding landscape. On February 15, 1892, Buena Vista was granted its city charter. Buena Vista is well-known for a number of outdoor recreation opportunities, like the 315- acre Glen Maury Park. Glen Maury Park hosts numerous music events each year, including the Maury River Fiddlers’ Convention and the annual Beach Music Festival. Buena Vista is also an Appalachian Trail community and a welcome respite for many through hikers. Whether giving a lift to an AT hiker or wel-coming fiddlers to the competition stage, Buena Vista residents take pride in their city. Community is built and evidenced by the spirit of volunteerism which reigns across many projects and programs that benefit both resi-dents and visitors, like arts promotions, beau-tification efforts, and local endeavors to protect historic structures. Education has long been a hallmark of life in Buena Vista. The campus of Southern Vir-ginia University, a private, 4-year liberal arts college, is located in the city. I would be re-miss if I didn’t mention that Buena Vista is also home to Parry McCluer High School, the Fighting Blues! Generations of former students come together during each sports season to support their team with resounding, ‘‘Go, Blue’’ cheers. Academic success is celebrated as well, not only by parents but by the commu-nity, witnessed by the multitude of academic scholarships presented to PMHS graduates each year. The annual Labor Day Parade is a true Buena Vista tradition. Since the initial Labor Day Parade held in the early 1970s, folks from across the Commonwealth have gathered to watch as the parade marched down Magnolia Avenue from downtown Buena Vista to Glen Maury Park. It’s traditionally known as the kickoff to the political season leading up to the November elections, and I always look forward to the parade and the many friends I see along the way. The city of Buena Vista is a special place to me. After marrying my wife of more than 40 years, Maryellen, we both worked in the Buena Vista community. Maryellen was a sec-retary at First National Exchange Bank, and I painted school buses at the Bluebird Factory. We will never forget our experiences there. The city has also endured several horrific flooding events over the years. Working with its partners, the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United States Army Corps of Engi-neers, Buena Vista implemented the James R. Olin Flood Control Project, and it was my pleasure to lend a hand in that effort. Through it all, the city of Buena Vista has remained steadfast for 125 years. I am proud to represent Buena Vista.

HONORING THE 377TH AIR BASE WING, AIR FORCE GLOBAL STRIKE COMMAND, KIRTLAND AIR FORCE BASE 
HON. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM 
OF NEW MEXICO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 15, 2017 Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratu-late the 377th Air Base Wing, Air Force Global Strike Command, Kirtland Airforce Base, for earning the 2016 Air Force Outstanding Unit Award. The award recognizes the exceptional service of the 377th Air Base Wing from Janu-ary 1, 2016, to December 31, 2016. The 377th Air Base Wing accomplished a number of achievements during 2016. The air base wing provided comprehensive combat preparedness and superior installation support to 22,000 airmen and more than 110 mission partners. The airmen executed 71 ground mis-sions, moving 765 assets and ensuring global strategic deterrence. The air base wing made progress to miti-gate a 40-year-old environmental calamity by installing the first extraction well in December of 2016. The temporary treatment system was implemented in June 2016 and treated 17 mil-lion gallons of contaminated water, removed nearly seven grams of ethylene dibromide (EDB), and protected 36.7 million gallons of water. The permanent treatment system has treated 235.5 million gallons of water and re-moved 69.1 grams EDB as of July 31, 2017. The air base wing also developed a 25-year strategic roadmap that included $110 million in upgrades to the Kirtland Underground Muni-tions Maintenance and Storage Complex that houses the Department of Defense’s largest stockpile of Protection Level One assets. In addition, the air base wing expanded its tribal relations program. Air base leaders worked in collaboration with state Native American tribes to create a Memorandum of Understanding which protects tribal cultures by allowing tribes to request that the military air crews avoid low-level flights above sacred areas or religious events. The air base wing was active in assisting local fire departments fight the Dog Head Fire that burned 17,000 acres of land and threat-ened four communities. With Kirtland Air Force Base’s help, they saved approximately 37,000 homes. Last, in celebration of the 75th Anniversary of Kirtland Air Force Base, the air base wing hosted an air show for the first time in five years to commemorate the occasion. The air show was hosted in coordination with more than 20 organizations, 1,200 volunteers, and more than 50,000 spectators in the audience. Additionally, service members visited elemen-tary schools to discuss the air base wing’s his-tory and the military’s commitment to the country and local surrounding community of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Those are only a few of the achievements that prove the excellence of the 377th Air Base Wing. I am confident that the achieve-ments of the 377th Air Base Wing will be a lasting positive impact in our community. f

HONORING THE 20TH ANNIVER-SARY OF MI SUEN˜O WINERY 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 15, 2017 Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mi Suen˜o Winery and owners Rolando Herrera and Lorena Robledo Herrera upon the occasion of their twentieth Anniversary of producing excellent wines. Rolando Herrera and Lorena Robledo were both born in Mexico. Their families immigrated to the Napa Valley to seek better lives and op-portunities for their children. Lorena’s family taught her to tend vines and grow grapes, and Rolando was able to study enology and viticul-ture at UC Davis. When the couple met, ‘‘it seemed like fate.’’ Rolando and Lorena founded Mi Suen ˜o Winery in 1997, the same year that they were married. Together they have built their dream winery with love, passion and deep under-standing of the art of growing exceptional grapes and creating award-winning wines. As Rolando says, ‘‘farming and making wine is not science, it’s experience.’’ Rolando and Lorena believe that creating truly unique wines requires careful attention to every stage of the winemaking process, from start to finish. From choosing the right plot of earth, to personally planting the vineyards and selecting the most attentive distributors, Rolando and Lorena have created a truly ex-ceptional business and product. The White House recognized the quality of their wines by pouring three different Mi Suen˜o wines at state dinners. Earlier this year, the Smithso-nian Institution honored them at their Fifth An-nual Winemakers’ Dinner. This month Rolando, Lorena and all their children will gather to celebrate their twentieth Anniversary. Rolando and Lorena have devel-oped different single-vineyard, barrel-selected wines named after each of their six children. Their brave story of immigration, incredible hard work and passion is a perfect example of what it means to live the American Dream. Mr. Speaker, Mi Suen˜o Winery has been producing quality wine for the past 20 years. I am proud to have such a hardworking family living in our community. It is fitting and proper that we honor them here today. f 
H.R. 339, THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS ECONOMIC EXPANSION ACT 
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO SABLAN 
OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Tuesday, August 15, 2017 Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my col-leagues for understanding that my bill, H.R. 339, as amended by the Senate, was time- critical and for acting swiftly upon this meas-ure on Friday, August 11. H.R. 339, the Northern Mariana Islands Economic Expansion Act, was intended to pro-vide one-time relief to the economic disruption that occurred in my district, when a surge of Chinese construction workers used up one- third of the available Commonwealth-only Transitional Worker permits for fiscal year 2017. This left many of our local businesses, small and large, in the lurch. These busi-nesses have foreign workers on their staff, who know the business and upon whom em-ployers rely, for whom fiscal year 2017 permits became unavailable as a result of the Chinese surge. There is an annual limit on the number of these Commonwealth-only Transitional Worker, or CW–1, permits, which are specific and unique to the Marianas. For fiscal 2017, 12,998 were available. H.R. 339 provides 350 more to help out the businesses caught in this bind. Had the Senate acted more quickly and had the Senate not decided to reduce the number of additional permits to 350, more local busi-nesses could have been assisted. But the leg-islative process is collaborative and delibera-tive; and I respect that. I can say that there are 306 permits that were scheduled to expire in August and Sep-tember. So by providing an additional 350 per-mits, H.R. 339, as amended, matches up against that remaining need. I also note that the Senate amendment takes the current permit system in a new di-rection by designating that at least 60 of the additional permits for fiscal 2017 must be used for workers in healthcare and at least 10 for power plant operators. These occupational categories are critical to public health and safety. It well may be that in the future any foreign worker permits, specific to the Mari-anas, will also have to begin to be prioritized to ensure that the most value is added to the Marianas economy by the permitted workers. Although H.R. 339 provides one-time relief to an immediate shortage of permits, there is further intent. The bill contains two provisions that will make the problem we are fixing now less likely to recur in future. First, and most importantly, the bill in-creases the fee that employers pay, as part of the permit process, that goes to training U.S. workers to fill the jobs currently held by foreign workers in the Marianas. Had the Marianas been less dependent on foreign workers, this year’s crisis would have been proportionally less intense. So, we must continue to focus on adding U.S. workers to the economy. The fee increase is from $150 per annual permit to $200. And the increase is perma-nent. It does not apply solely to fiscal 2017, as is the case with the extra permits. It is the in-tention of the legislation that the fee increase apply to petitions filed on or after the date of enactment, not to petitions previously filed. Since the beginning of the transitional work-er program, these fees have provided about $10 million to the Commonwealth of the North-ern Mariana Islands government and been dis-tributed to educational institutions. Over the same period of time, about 1,200 U.S. workers have been added to the local labor force. I un-derstand from testimony of the Government Accountability Office to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in April of this year, that some $3 million of the collected fees remain unused. Effective and prompt use of the U.S. worker training funds are goals I believe should be part of the consideration for future legislation. I introduced in the 113th Congress, H.R. 2200, a bill that would have required the Common-wealth provide to the Secretary of Homeland Security a plan for the expenditure of these funds with a specific, numerical goal for job placement of U.S. workers. My legislation also required a biennial report by the Comptroller General on whether this goal had been met. That legislation did not make it to the finish line here in Congress; however, along with the allocation of permits for specific, high-value occupations, setting performance goals for the U.S. worker training fund is a policy I believe should be a part of our future considerations. The second provision intended to prevent a recurrence of the current crisis bars the use of the CW–1 permit for new workers in construc-tion occupations. Existing construction compa-nies with foreign workers, who have been in their employ prior to fiscal year 2016, will be able to continue renewing the CW–1 permits of those specific individual workers. There are between 1,000 and 1,500 such individuals, I understand. Approval for a CW–1 permit for an individual in a construction occupation may not be granted, if the individual was not pre-viously approved for a CW–1 permit before October 1, 2015. And no approvals for initial grant of CW–1 status to individuals in con-struction occupations, as defined in H.R. 339, may be issued, regardless of whether the em-ployer previously petitioned for an employee in such occupation or whether that petition had been approved. This provision, too, is to be continuously effective beyond fiscal year 2017. To avoid unnecessary economic disruption, implementation of the provision barring use of CW–1 permits for construction occupations is intended to apply to pending petitions and to petitions filed on or after the date of enact-ment. This division created by H.R. 339 between legacy and new workers will allow our existing construction companies to continue meeting the demand for housing and other buildings that still remains because of the destruction caused by Typhoon Soudelor in 2015 and, also, results from the overall improvement in the Marianas economy. Enactment of H.R. 339 does not mean, however, that the Marianas economy will not have access to construction workers to sup-plement the local labor force. New hires for construction of developments such as the ho-tels and resorts now on the drawing boards in the Marianas will be—preferably—local, U.S. workers. Alternatively, however, these devel-opments may use visa categories other than

the CW–1 to supply foreign workers. In U.S. Public Law 113–235 Congress provided the Marianas with access to an unlimited number of H–2B visas, which are specifically intended to address any temporary need for workers, such as occurs when a new hotel is built. In fact, in order to be eligible to apply for the CW–1 permit, applicant businesses must at-test that no other visa category is available. In light of the unlimited number of H–2B visas available and because the current problem stems from the use of CW–1 permits for tem-porary construction workers, I have on numer-ous occasions requested that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services confirm that these attestations are accurate. Enactment of H.R. 339 makes matters simpler: construction occu-pations are no longer eligible for CW–1 per-mits with the exception of renewals of permits first issued prior to fiscal 2016. Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to provide this statement of legislative intent today to the record on H.R. 339. And thanks, again, to all my colleagues who made it pos-sible to move forward with the Northern Mar-iana Islands Economic Expansion Act.

I also thank the Irish Immi-gration Center of Philadelphia for working closely with Barbara during her tenure to en-sure a positive and productive relationship be-tween Ireland and the Philadelphia region. Irish-American relations have never been stronger. This bond is due in no small part to Barbara’s tireless efforts to foster meaningful connections between U.S. localities and Ire-land. I hope she leaves the United States with fond memories, as I know she leaves her many friends and colleagues with their own fond memories of Barbara. I wish her well as she returns home and moves on to her next venture.
