Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge and speak in support of my friends in Texas and Florida who are currently fighting and recovering from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. While my thoughts and prayers go out to all those affected, I am also reminded of the courage and resilience Americans display in these trying times. I am especially proud of my State of Kansas’ National Guard, who has assembled and are currently assist-ing those affected. Airmen in the 184th Intelligence Wing out of McConnell Air Force Base, Wichita, Kansas, are currently con-ducting incident awareness and assess-ment activities in both Texas and Flor-ida. They are compiling information by analyzing video footage and imagery of the affected areas, pinpointing where immediate assistance is required. Additionally, soldiers from the 69th Troop Command in Topeka are also ad-vising senior National Guard leaders to ensure the National Guard is successful in their response efforts and critical in-formation is effectively communicated to the public. I am incredibly proud of the National Guard and all Kansans who are cur-rently helping our neighbors in Florida and Texas in multiple capacities. It is incredibly empowering to watch Amer-icans come together during these try-ing times and lend a hand to the most in need. ACKNOWLEDGING THE MANY AGRICULTURAL  
PRODUCERS ACROSS KANSAS  
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the many agri-cultural producers across Kansas who work tirelessly to keep the very heart of our Nation beating. I represent the largest agriculture-producing district in the country, and over recess I spent a great deal of time traveling 2,000 miles and holding some 10 farm bill lis-tening sessions to find out exactly how we in Congress can best serve the needs of our producers. On one of my farm bill listening tours, I was reminded of just how im-portant the farm bill is to my district and countless others across the Nation. We must protect our farmers and ranchers, especially in this depressed agriculture economy. Farming is one of the riskiest, high-tech, most intri-cately complicated businesses out there. As a member of the House Agri-culture Committee, I look forward to working with my colleagues to take the voice of American farmers and translate it into an appropriate and well-defined farm bill. We must send the message to our farmers and small communities that we will continue to support them and ensure that their livelihoods are protected. To do this, we must increase flexi-bility and make sure that crop insur-ance is available to all those who need it most. Crop insurance doesn’t just protect the farmers, it protects the loan at the local bank, it protects downtown communities like yours and mine, it protects the co-ops, and it pro-tects Main Street, America. America is protected by crop insurance. I firmly believe it is our duty to make sure that those who put food on our tables aren’t struggling to put food on theirs. f

Your healing presence continue to imbue the lives of those who were per-sonally assaulted on that momentous day, and ease the mourning of those who lost their loved ones. We ask Your continued blessing on those whose lives have been disrupted by so many natural disasters: hurri-canes, ongoing fires, and their aftermaths. May the efforts of so many to help them recover and establish themselves be a hopeful beginning of many months of work and rebuilding thanks to the efforts of so many Amer-icans and good neighbors. Through all this, bless the Members of this people’s House with the wisdom and perseverance they need to attend the pressing needs of the Nation.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Com-mittee on Ways and Means and the Committee on the Budget be dis-charged from further consideration of the bill (H.R. 3732) to amend section 1113 of the Social Security Act to pro-vide authority for increased fiscal year 2017 and 2018 payments for temporary assistance to United States citizens re-turned from foreign countries, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen-tleman from Washington? There was no objection. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 3732 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-resentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Emergency Aid to American Survivors of Hurricanes Irma and Jose Overseas Act’’.

CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN TERRORIST ATTACKS— MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 115–67) The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-fore the House the following message from the President of the United States; which was read and, together with the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and ordered to be printed: To the Congress of the United States: Section 202(d) of the National Emer-gencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1622(d), provides for the automatic termination of a na-tional emergency unless, within 90 days of the anniversary date of its dec-laration, the President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect be-yond the anniversary date. Consistent with this provision, I have sent to the Federal Register the enclosed notice, stating that the emergency declared in Proclamation 7463 of September 14, 2001, ‘‘National Emergency by Reason of Certain Terrorist Attacks,’’ is to continue in effect beyond September 14, 2017. The threat of terrorism that resulted in the declaration of a national emer-gency on September 14, 2001, continues. The authorities that have been invoked under that declaration of a national emergency continue to be critical to the ability of the Armed Forces of the United States to perform essential mis-sions in the United States and around the world to address the continuing threat of terrorism. For these reasons, I have determined that it is necessary to continue in effect the national emergency declared on September 14, 2001, in response to certain terrorist at-tacks. DONALD J. T RUMP .T

.S5085 Vol. 163 WASHINGTON, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 2017 No. 146 
Senate 
The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was called to order by the President pro tempore (Mr. H
ATCH ). 
f 
PRAYER The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-fered the following prayer: Let us pray. Eternal God, our shelter and shield, today we remember 9/11. As we recall the tragedy, infamy, and heroism of that day, we better understand that freedom isn’t free. We remember how the pain united us so that we knew we were not hyphenated Americans but one people. Infuse us in these conten-tious times with a similar spirit of one-ness, inspiring us to work for the well- being of all people. Lord, we are grateful for the protec-tion You have provided us for the 16 years since that calamitous day. May we continue to trust You to be our ref-uge for the future of this land we love. Continue to use our lawmakers as in-struments of Your peace as they strive to make justice roll down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream. We pray in Your strong Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The President pro tempore led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Repub-lic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
MOMENT OF SILENCE IN REMEM-BRANCE OF THE LIVES LOST IN THE ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Senate will ob-serve a moment of silence in remem-brance of the lives lost in the attacks of September 11, 2001. (Moment of silence.) RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. YOUNG ). The majority leader is recog-nized. 
f 
REMEMBERING SEPTEMBER 11 AND HURRICANE IRMA DIS-ASTER RELIEF Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, today we opened the Senate with a mo-ment of silence. We remember all those lost 16 years ago on September 11, 2001, the day that changed our Nation in profound ways. It wrenched our hearts with grief. It opened our eyes to cruel threats from afar. But it could neither extinguish the basic decency that unites us as a people nor the common humanity that defines us as a nation. It could not stop first responders from rushing toward danger to save others. It could not stop Americans from donating to strangers in need or volunteering their time to help. It could not stop the people of our coun-try from being who they are: kind, car-ing, compassionate. It is the same spirit we see again in response to Hurricane Harvey. It is the same spirit that is giving hope to those in the path of Hurricane Irma. Al-though the full extent of Irma’s impact will not be known for some time, it is clear that this intense storm is causing widespread damage, and it is clear that the recovery will require a massive un-dertaking. Our thoughts are with those in the areas affected by Irma. We are again prepared to play our role in the recovery. Congress passed a critical downpayment on disaster relief last week. If more assistance is re-quired due to Irma, we are ready to do what is needed. What is most important, I think, is the knowledge that the American peo-ple and our first responders will again be there to reach out to do whatever is needed to help. That is especially true on a day like today. We will never forget the thousands of innocent lives taken from us 16 years ago. We will never forget the heroism of our first responders and the compas-sion of our neighbors, nor will we for-get the thousands of men and women who have stood guard to protect us every day since. f 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL Mr. M
CCONNELL. Mr. President, our servicemembers voluntarily put their lives on the line to protect us, and, in return, we must keep our commit-ments to them. Today we will begin de-bate on the National Defense Author-ization Act, the bill that allows Con-gress to authorize resources, capabili-ties, and the pay and benefits our men and women need to perform their mis-sions. For more than five decades, Congress has acted every year to fulfill this re-sponsibility by passing the Defense au-thorization bill. We will have our op-portunity to do so again this week. This legislation, which was reported out of committee unanimously, will signal support for our servicemembers with more of the capabilities they need to be successful against an array of threats all across the globe. After years of failed defense policy under the previous administration, this year’s NDAA will make significant and necessary strides toward keeping America safer. It will do so by author-izing the beginning steps to rebuild our military, to invest in modernization, and to restore readiness; by reforming the Pentagon and reducing waste; by restoring missile defense and respond-ing to cyber threats; and by reviving troop morale with a pay increase they deserve and continued reform of the benefits that they and their families rely on. I think it is fair to say that no Sen-ator understands the importance of this legislation quite like Senator

MCCAIN, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. His commitment to our Nation’s heroes is unfailing, which is why, amidst his own battles, Chairman M
CCAINhas returned to the Senate to manage this bill and see it through passage. We are all proud to have him with us now. As we begin considering this bipar-tisan defense authorization, Members from both sides will have opportunities to work with Senator M
CCAINand to offer amendments. Ultimately, we will keep working to find consensus so that we can pass this critical defense legis-lation without further delay.

REMEMBERING SEPTEMBER 11 Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, 16 years ago today, my city, our country, changed forever. On September 11, 2001, our country was attacked; the World Trade Center towers fell; the Pentagon was in flames; and the smoke rising from an empty field in Pennsylvania reminded us that as cataclysmic as the attack was, the conspirators had planned even greater destruction. It was a day of fear and helplessness, of phones ringing endlessly—when they worked—husbands calling wives, wives calling husbands, folks in search of brothers, sisters, neighbors, and col-leagues. I will never forget the next day. President Bush provided a plane so that Senator Clinton and I could fly back to New York. The smell of death was in the air. Lined up outside before you entered into the grounds where the Twin Towers were, were hundreds of people with little signs with pictures: Have you seen my father Jim? Have you seen my daughter Mary? That will stay with me forever. More than 3,000 souls were taken from us—a guy I had played basketball with in high school, a businessman who had helped me on my way up, a fire-fighter with whom I had done blood drives. It was one of the bloodiest days on American soil since the Civil War. On September 12, 2001, I called on Americans to wear the flag in a sign of solidarity. Every day since, I have worn this flag in remembrance of those who were lost and those brave souls who died rushing to the towers to find those who still might be alive. God willing, I will wear it every day of my life for the rest of my life. September 11 was one of those before- and-after moments. Nothing has been the same since. We awakened to a new manner of evil that had previously been beyond our imagination. But on this day, as we solemnly re-member those who were taken from us, let us also remember what that day re-vealed about us. ‘‘On a normal day, we value heroism because it is uncom-mon,’’ wrote Nancy Gibbs of Time Mag-azine 3 days after the attack. ‘‘On Sept. 11, we valued heroism because it was everywhere.’’ Firefighters and police and union workers searched, undaunted, through dust and smoke, through fire and ash, for citizens who might still be alive, trapped in the rubble. Average Ameri-cans pulled the wounded to safety. Folks from coast to coast lined up for blood drives and pooled their money for donations. I will never forget the picture of a man who owned a shoe store two blocks north of the towers and was giv-ing out shoes to everyone because they didn’t have theirs on as they rushed to get out of the towers—just a small act of charity and selflessness. It was re-peated over and over again because those kinds of acts are deep in the American soul. This morning I came from the 9/11 Memorial in New York City. Where once there were mighty towers, now there are two deep scars in the Earth. But all around the memorial, New York City is alive and thriving. In the days after, they wrote it off. They said that no one would live south of Canal or Chamber Street, companies would flee, and New York’s greatest days were over. But we New Yorkers are a tough breed. We rebuilt. We came back stronger. On this day, we should always re-member that beside our distinctive spirit of independence, resilience, and uncommon heroism are essential parts of the American character. I do have to say how proud I am of my city. Downtown is bustling, and 50,000 people live there who didn’t live there before. Businesses have relo-cated. It is a new ‘‘in’’ area. Bin laden is gone. The evil men with him are gone. We thrive. God bless America.

HURRICANE IRMA DISASTER RELIEF Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, as Hurricane Irma continues to buffet Florida, our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Florida and the rest of the Southeast that is in the storm’s path. The Democratic caucus and I stand ready to work with the majority leader and his caucus, members of the administration, and officials in Florida to provide them with the resources and aid they need. Just as we were able to speedily pass an aid package after Harvey, I expect we will come together to support res-cue and recovery efforts in the wake of Hurricane Irma and in some of the other disasters, particularly the fires out west.

NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this week we will begin consideration of the National Defense Authorization Act, as we do each year. As usual, there are hundreds of amendments that have al-ready been filed and a whole lot of tough issues to consider. We Democrats want to work in a constructive and productive manner to process as many of these amendments as possible and work through even the most difficult of issues. I know that Chairman MCCAINand Ranking Member R
EEDhave an excel-lent working relationship, as well as a great deal of respect for one another. I hope they can build a strong managers’ package that will be acceptable to both sides. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA-TION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018—MOTION TO PROCEED The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will re-sume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 2810, which the clerk will report. The legislative clerk read as follows: 
Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 175, H.R. 2810, a bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2018 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for military con-struction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes.

Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, when we finish this period of morning business, which is open to speeches and state-ments on many different topics, we will then go to the Defense authorization bill. Our process in the Senate is to au-thorize spending and then to appro-priate the money for the actual spend-ing. Occasionally, those two things are in sync, but many times they are not. I am afraid that what we face today is uncertainty. Senator M
CCAIN, who is the chairman of the defense authorization com-mittee, will bring his proposal to the floor, but it is at a spending level that is not allowed by current law. The Budget Control Act will not allow Sen-ator M
CCAINor the Senate to spend at

the level at which he wants to spend. I can make a good argument that the statutory level we are required to hold to is inadequate to our national de-fense. If we are honest about taking care of the problem, we not only have to pass this authorization bill, but we have to change the Budget Control Act so that we can put more money into our national defense. That debate will get started this week. It is near and dear to Senator M
CCAIN’s heart. He works hard on it each year with Sen-ator J
ACK REED, a Democrat from Rhode Island. There will be many amendments con-sidered, I am sure, during the course of this week on Defense authorization. 
DACA  
Mr. President, what I come to the floor to speak to as in morning busi-ness is not that issue; it is the issue of DACA and the Dreamers. It was just 6 days ago that the announcement was made by Attorney General Jeff Ses-sions that he was going to rescind the DACA Program. A quick history. Sixteen years ago, I introduced a bill called the DREAM Act. The DREAM Act was written to take care of young people who, by their parents, were brought to the United States as infants and toddlers and young boys and girls and who grew up in this country. They did not get into trouble with the law. They finished school and always thought that they were going to be Americans and that they would use their education and their skills to build lives in this coun-try. However, because their parents ei-ther came here undocumented or did not file the appropriate papers, these young people are literally without a country. The country they grew up in does not accept them under the law. So 16 years ago I introduced the DREAM Act and said: Let’s take care of this problem. These young people, as it was through no fault of their own, should be given a chance to stay in this coun-try and be part of its future. I passed it in the Senate, and I have seen it passed in the House. We have never quite been able to bring it to-gether in any one year and have it pass both Chambers, so it is not the law of the land. Sixteen years ago, I intro-duced it, and it is still not the law of the land. In the meantime, Senator Obama, my colleague in the Senate, cosponsored the DREAM Act and then got a pro-motion. As President of the United States, I asked him: Can you do some-thing to protect these young people from being deported? He said that he would, so by Execu-tive order, he created something known as DACA, the DACA Program, by which young people come forward, turn themselves in, register with the United States, pay a filing fee to cover all of the costs of the process, and go through a criminal background check. If they are approved and cleared, for 2 years, they can stay in the United States without having the fear of being deported, and they are allowed to work. Then, 2 years later, it is renew-able. Over the years President Obama had done that, 780,000 young people signed up, went through the back-ground check, and were approved under DACA. Last week, President Trump, through his Attorney General, announced that he was going to rescind the DACA Pro-gram. So the 780,000 young people have their futures in doubt. They do not know which way they are going to turn. This creates serious problems, as you might imagine. The young people who are affected by it are affected emo-tionally—I would be, too—because they do not know what is going to happen next. They do not know whether they are going to be allowed to stay in this country, whether they will be deported from this country, or whether they will be able to work legally. They are wait-ing for Congress to give the answer, and the President says he is waiting for Congress to give the answer. Last Friday, I went back to Chicago, which I am honored to represent in the Senate, and I visited Loyola Univer-sity’s School of Medicine. It is known as the Stritch School of Medicine. At the outset, let me say how proud I am to represent the city and espe-cially to represent Loyola University. Here is what they did in their med-ical school when President Obama cre-ated DACA. They said: We will open up competition for our medical school to include those who are protected by DACA. We will not give them special slots, and we will not give them a quota. They can compete with every-body else who wants to go to our med-ical school. Do you know what happened? At the end of the day, 32 of those DACA appli-cants scored so high that they were ac-cepted at Loyola’s Stritch School of Medicine. They are now in 2 or 3 dif-ferent years of classes. It is amazing. Many of them, from all over the United States, grew up without having legal citizenship status and always dreamed of being doctors, but it was impossible. They knew that no medical school would accept them. And Loyola said: We will accept you, and they got their chance—32 of them. There is more to the story, as these young people do not qualify for any government assistance from the Fed-eral Government. Because they are un-documented, they do not qualify for Pell grants, and they do not qualify for Federal Government loans. Medical school is expensive. How are they going to do it? They worked their way through college, paying out of their own pockets. How are they going to pay for medical school? Our State, the State of Illinois, under Governor Pat Quinn and renewed under Governor Rauner, created a loan program for them from which they could borrow money from the State. But there was a catch: For every year they borrowed money to go to medical school at Loy-ola, they had to pledge that they would give 1 year of service, of their lives, as doctors in underserved communities in our State. They did it. Thirty-two of them signed up for it. I am very proud to say that the program has been a ter-rific success in our State. They are just extraordinary, along with the other students at the medical school. They are special people. They come from all over the world, and they are all in this similar predicament, but until last week, they were protected by DACA. What happens when you take away the DACA Executive order, which President Trump said he will do over the next 6 months? There is a special challenge here. After they finish 4 years of medical school, these students apply for residencies, whereby they pursue their specialties, whatever they might be. A residency is work experi-ence for all of these medical students. Through some university, they will be working as residents at hospitals, working long hours while pursuing their dreams of being doctors and spe-cialists. Here is the problem: With DACA’s being gone, they no longer have the legal right to work in the United States. What does that mean? They cannot apply for residencies. This is the end of it, the end of their medical education. It stops right there. What-ever their ambitions might be, whether it is surgery or psychiatry, they cannot go forward without DACA. It really puts a burden on us in Con-gress to decide what we are going to do, doesn’t it? Are we going to pass a law that finally, once and for all, de-fines the legal status of these young people—not just for these medical stu-dents but for hundreds of thousands of others who are working? They are engi-neers. They are teachers. They are working in so many different areas, and they want to continue being part of this country. I am encouraged that we have a bi-partisan response. My colleague Sen-ator L
INDSEY GRAHAM , a Republican from South Carolina, is my lead co-sponsor on this year’s version of the Dream Act. We currently have three other Republican Senators who have joined as cosponsors from across the United States—Senator M
URKOWSKI  from Alaska, Senator F
LAKE from Ari-zona, and Senator G
ARDNER from Colo-rado. We hope others will join them. If we get the critical 60 votes in the Sen-ate—60 sponsors or 60 who will pledge to vote for it—we can pass the Dream Act once and for all and take care of the concerns of the medical students I mentioned and so many others across this country. I have come to the floor over the last few years and told the stories of the Dreamers. I think these stories have created good impressions in people’s minds about who these young people are and what they can do for the future of the United States. I would like to do that again today. This is Harminder Saini. Harminder was 6 years old when his family moved

to the United States from India. He grew up in Queens in New York City. He was a typical American kid—played sports and went to the park every day. Harminder’s dream was to serve his country as a soldier in the U.S. Army. In his words, he simply wanted to give back. Harminder was a born leader, and in high school, he was active in student government and was ultimately elected class president. He first learned that he did not have legal immigration status when he was in high school and he could not get a driver’s license. They explained to him that he did not have the necessary legal documentation to be in this country. He was brought here as a kid and is growing up. He is now a student at Hunter College at the City University of New York and is working toward his bachelor’s degree in history. Thanks to DACA, he is fulfilling his dream. Last year, he was able to enlist in the Army through the Military Ac-cessions Vital to National Interest Pro-gram, known as MAVNI. This photo is from his enlistment ceremony. The MAVNI Program allows immi-grants with skills that are vital to our national interests to enlist in the Armed Forces. More than 800 DACA re-cipients with these skills—the people whom I described earlier—have joined America’s military. They really want to be part of our country. Now, some Trump administration of-ficials claim that DACA recipients are taking away jobs from Americans. But Harminder and hundreds just like him have skills that our military couldn’t find in the general population they were recruiting from. Harminder, along with many other Dreamers, is now waiting to ship out for basic training. He continues his undergraduate studies and is working full time while waiting for a chance to volunteer to serve America in the military. Harminder said: 
All I want to do is serve. I want to do my part to give back to this country because it allowed me to serve. 
Harminder and other Dreamers have so much to give to America, but with-out DACA—without the Dream Act— Harminder and hundreds of other im-migrants with skills that are really im-portant to our national interests will have to leave the Army. They want nothing more than to serve our coun-try. They are prepared to die for our country. What more can we ask? But, instead, there are those who would say that they should leave, that they should be deported. One of the President’s former staff advisers, in a ‘‘60 Minutes’’ show last night, said those exact words: They should just leave. I don’t think America would be a stronger country if Harminder left. I don’t think our military would be stronger without his contribution and service to our country. He should be part of America, and we can do some-thing about it. A friend of mine recently went to the University of Notre Dame to visit with the administration there—represented by the Presiding Officer—in the State of Indiana. It is my understanding that they have some 68 DACA recipients at Notre Dame University. There is hard-ly a university in this country that doesn’t have DACA-eligible young peo-ple who are going to school there. Re-member, they don’t qualify for any Federal assistance for education, at all, because they are in an undocumented status, but they are working their way through. They are borrowing the money. They are working jobs to make sure that they reach a point where they have a future. Now it is up to us. We have to decide what we are going to do. Senator GRA-
HAM, my cosponsor of the Dream Act, said a week or so ago, when we intro-duced the bill, that the moment of reckoning is coming. That moment is not only coming. It arrived last Tues-day. We need Republican leaders to join us to help make the Dream Act the law of the land. Otherwise, what will happen to these young people? As for this Senator, I have made this a major part of my public career. I feel a special kinship with these young peo-ple. Yesterday was Mexican Independ-ence Day in Chicago. What a parade there was. It must have gone on for 2 miles. It felt like it. There were more people than you could imagine coming out with their families—people of Mexican heritage who are now part of Chicago, part of Illinois, and part of the United States. As I was marching down the street, there was a young lady and a couple of her friends walk-ing next to me wearing princess crowns, and I started talking to them. It turned out that two of the young girls were born in the United States. The third was born in Mexico, and she is a DACA recipient. She is going to school. She thanked me for the DACA Program and said: I hope you can make it a reality again. We have that obligation. We have that responsibility. We need to step up with this broken immigration system and make certain that, at the end of the day, we have done everything in our power to give these young people like Harminder and hundreds of thou-sands just like him a chance to be part of America’s future. 
REMEMBERING SEPTEMBER 11  
Mr. President, let me just close with a brief statement. I listened to my col-league and friend Senator S
CHUMER  speak in very touching terms about this anniversary which we observe today—the 16th anniversary of 9/11. I can recount where I was and what I re-member, as I have before on the floor, but I will not. I will just say that it changed America in so many different ways. As I went through airport security this morning at O’Hare, which I do every single week. I thought to myself that 16 years ago it would have been unthinkable that we would put pas-sengers—every single one of them— through this kind of security process. But that is the reality of life in a world that is dangerous, life in a world where we want to protect innocent people from the 9/11s of the future that are being plotted and planned by our en-emies around the world. I think of those whose lives were lost on 9/11. I think of those who risked their lives. I think of those whose lives will never be the same because of that day. It is a reminder to all of us to thank God that we live in this great country, to remember our history well, to honor the men and women in the military, and the men and women in law enforce-ment and in medicine, who stepped up that day in a heroic way, and to make sure that we do everything in our gen-eration so that no future generation has a similar experience. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. HURRICANE IRMA  
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as we saw yesterday, Mother Nature once again has crippled part of our Nation. Hurricane Irma made landfall on Sun-day, hitting the Lower Keys of Florida and then moving up the State’s west-ern coastline. Like Hurricane Harvey in my home State of Texas, the devas-tation in places like Marco Island and Orange County means tough days and long nights ahead for the residents there. My prayers, like those of so many others, go out to those who have been impacted by this devastating storm, in-cluding those who evacuated safely but will soon travel back to Florida, find-ing that everything they had is gone as a result of the storm. As Irma continues to affect Florida and the southeastern United States, we stand ready to support the people in those States just like so many did for us in Texas with Hurricane Harvey. 
REMEMBERING SEPTEMBER 11  
Mr. President, on another separate note, as we all have seen and recall, today is the solemn anniversary of a day that has had an even more pro-found impact on our country than the recent storms. September 11 will al-ways be remembered as the day that never quite goes away, the day that re-mains a reminder of what can be taken from us in the blink of an eye. I have always said that it is etched in my memory like only one other event in my lifetime, and that was in 1963 with the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. I remember where I was and what I was doing at that time when I first heard about it. Of course, I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing when I learned of the

terrible events of 9/11. I was on the telephone talking to a colleague of mine when my wife said: You need to see what is happening on the tele-vision. I turned on the TV just in time to see the second plane hit the towers in Manhattan. Yes, it was 16 years ago that 19 Is-lamic terrorists snuck into our country in defiance of our laws and attended flight schools in defiance of all pro-priety. Sixteen years ago today, they hijacked four commercial planes full of innocent passengers and, at 8:46 a.m. on Tuesday morning, flew the first one di-rectly into one of the tallest buildings in our largest city in the United States. Seventeen minutes later—the event, which my wife directed my attention to on the TV set—the second plane hit, and shortly thereafter, flight 77 slammed into the western wall of the Pentagon, and Flight 93 crashed in Pennsylvania. Thanks to the heroic ac-tions of passengers on Flight 93, that plane could have very well headed here to Washington and crashed into the Capitol, taking who knows how many lives along with it. As it was, 3,000 people were killed that day, and afterward almost 300 mil-lion U.S. citizens saw the world anew through fresh eyes. The terrorists must have thought they could bring our Na-tion down, topple it as they did the twin towers, but they badly miscalcu-lated. They were wrong. An America shocked was an America strengthened. America is sometimes called the slum-bering giant which, once awakened, is a fearsome thing to behold, and that is exactly what happened after 9/11. After we all took many deep breaths and thanked God for what was left, we stood up and we fought back, united. We primarily did that through our military—the core of our national de-fense—those who took the fight to al- Qaida in places like Afghanistan but also all the rest who surrounded and supported our Armed Forces and intel-ligence personnel every step of the way. Sixteen years later, we continue to confront new terrorist threats and ad-just to new geopolitical realities. I re-call the statement of the former Direc-tor of National Intelligence, who said, after 50 years in the intelligence com-munity, he had never seen a more di-verse array of threats confronting America than he did at that time, and nothing has changed in that respect, which is why today America must maintain a sense of vigilance, a sense of purpose, and a sense of moral clarity regarding evil in all of its novel forms. We must also ask if we are still standing behind our Armed Forces the way we committed to do following the terrible events of 9/11. We must make sure our military servicemembers have everything they need because to do otherwise is to shirk our duty and to forget how our national security is ul-timately achieved. One way we uphold that responsi-bility is through the National Defense Authorization Act. If passed, this would mark the 55th year it is signed into law. Later today, we will vote to take up this legislation, and I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting that vote. The Defense authorization bill en-sures that crucial Department of De-fense programs are continued and es-tablishes how our military funds will be spent. The version of the bill which has been reported out of committee helps reverse the readiness crisis cre-ated by the previous administration. In the words of my friend, our colleague from Texas, M
ACTHORNBERRY , chair-man of the House Armed Services Com-mittee, ‘‘We have too few planes that can fly, too few ships that can sail and too few soldiers who can deploy.’’ That sums up the situation exactly. The Defense authorization bill exem-plifies our commitment to reverse this downward trend. I don’t know why it is that America tries to cash the peace dividend at every turn when we have no peace, but that is what has hap-pened. Although the hole the previous administration placed us in is deep, this bill authorizes the funds necessary to begin restoring readiness, rebuilding capacity, and modernizing military in-frastructure. I was recently at Sheppard Air Force Base in Wichita Falls, TX, the base which trains half of all Air Force pilots in the country. They told me one of the biggest problems they have is recruit-ing and retaining pilots for the U.S. Air Force. While people will accept lower wages for military service be-cause they believe in serving the coun-try, if, because of cuts in funding for the Air Force and for the military, they simply can’t fly like they need to in order to be ready for the next fight, many of them get discouraged and are tempted to go to work in the private sector where they can earn more money. So we need to make sure our troops—all of our Armed Forces—have the readiness capability, and we need to fund that appropriately. This bill will authorize appropria-tions for personnel and equipment, in-cluding aircraft made in my home State—the Osprey, made in Amarillo, TX, and the F–35 made in Fort Worth. Finally, the Senate version will also authorize critical funding to increase maritime capacity as well. Back in the 1980s, the Navy had about 600 ships; today, we have 277, less than half. It is crucial that we procure ships, aircraft, and munitions, continue to develop our new military technology on our exist-ing platforms and in the evolving cyber domain, and reduce our shortfall in end strength—that we do all of those things. These steps will provide our servicemembers with the training and equipment necessary to defeat ISIS, al- Qaida, and terrorist and state actors that threaten the United States and our way of life. Perhaps even more significant, in terms of the threat to the United States and world peace, sending a mes-sage to Vladimir Putin and the Russian Federation that America is no longer in retreat, but America can be relied upon as a strong partner, and Amer-ica’s leadership role in world affairs will be reestablished, will send a very important message of deterrence to the bullies, the tyrants, and the authori-tarians around the world; to China, an-other major threat to international se-curity and peace that is being so ag-gressive in not only developing arms that allow it to project power to dif-ferent parts of the Pacific and beyond but threatens maritime transit and safe travel through places like the Strait of Malacca, where so much international trade and national secu-rity travel occur. Our colleagues in the House have passed their version of the Defense au-thorization, and now it is our job to get it done. By passing a strong defense bill and authorizing the sort of re-sources our military needs in order for America to maintain its leadership role in the world and provide a credible threat to deter aggression on the part of our adversaries, we will leave our Nation and the world a safer place and better off. It is one small way today that we can honor the memory of those we lost 16 years ago. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.

REMEMBERING SEPTEMBER 11 AND RECOGNIZING  
STRATCOM  
Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, 16 years after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, our Nation unites once again to honor the Americans killed on that horrific day. Our minds are filled with the haunting images of the burning towers, the crumbling structure of the Pentagon, and the smoking field in Pennsylvania. That dark day drastically changed the course of our Nation, and we will al-ways remember where we were when we first heard the news that our coun-try was under attack. But 9/11 did not change who we are or the values we hold so dear. Amid the heartbreak and devastation, our citi-zens showed abounding courage, kind-ness, and love of country. In New York City, Arlington, and the scarred field in Shanksville, American flags were placed atop the rubble as symbols of determination in the face of evil. We will always remember the innocent lives lost in the attacks, and we will forever be grateful for the brave first responders who ran toward danger to help those in need. We should also remember the signifi-cant work of the men and women of the U.S. Strategic Command in Nebraska

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5090 September 11, 2017 
during this national emergency. Today, I want to recognize and honor what happened at STRATCOM on 9/11. On that fateful day, STRATCOM’s staff at Offutt Air Force Base, along with military personnel at several other U.S. bases, woke up expecting to strategize a response to a major attack against the United States. Days ear-lier, they had begun Global Guardian, an annual training exercise performed by the U.S. Strategic Command, the Air Force Space Command, and NORAD. The main purpose of the exer-cise was to test the military’s com-mand and control procedures in the event of nuclear warfare. Leaders at STRATCOM learned dur-ing breakfast that a plane had struck the World Trade Center. When the sec-ond plane hit shortly thereafter, they understood that this had not been an accident. America was under attack. The Global Guardian’s fictional exer-cise was quickly canceled, and the men and women of STRATCOM responded to the day’s events happening in the real world. After the FAA ordered every plane in the United States to be grounded, STRATCOM monitored the landings of thousands of civilian air-craft. Using a screen on the wall of the command post, they worked to identify which planes had been hijacked, know-ing that finding these dangerous nee-dles in the haystack of America’s com-mercial airline industry could be the difference between safety and catas-trophe. As the day unfolded, STRATCOM leadership received a 30-minute notice that the secure location the President would be using was going to be Offutt Air Force Base. Nebraska was ready to protect the President. Escorted by two F–15 fighters, Air Force One landed around 1:50 p.m. ADM Richard Mies, in charge of the Stra-tegic Command at the time, picked up President Bush in his car and drove to STRATCOM’s underground command post. STRATCOM staff quickly briefed the President and established a secure video link that allowed him to speak with the National Security Council and other senior officials. For 2 hours Ne-braska served as the center of Amer-ica’s national defense before President Bush returned to Washington, and we did it well. Nebraska is honored to host the U.S. Strategic Command Global Operations Center, and we are proud of the excel-lent work they did during the attacks of 9/11 to protect our country. Year after year, this day is a re-minder of tragedy and tears, but we should also recall the strength and re-solve of the citizens of the greatest country on Earth. Though the threats to our way of life have and will con-tinue to evolve, our enduring commit-ment to defending freedom will never waver. Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. M
CCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. M
ORAN ). Without objection, it is so or-dered. Mr. M
CCAIN. Mr. President, I will ad-dress the Senate on the issue of the Na-tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-ator is recognized. Mr. M
CCAIN. Mr. President, today, our Nation commemorates the 16th an-niversary of the terrorist attacks that took the lives of thousands of innocent Americans. We all join in solemn re-membrance of the victims, and our hearts go out to their families. September 11 is a fitting day for the Senate to begin the consideration of the Defense authorization bill. The an-niversary of those horrific terrorist at-tacks should serve as a reminder of the reason brave, young Americans are currently deployed around the world, fighting on behalf of freedom. I urge my colleagues to keep in mind the meaning of this day throughout the consideration of this important legisla-tion, which will provide our men and women in uniform the resources, equip-ment, and support they need to keep our Nation safe. I would like to extend my apprecia-tion to the majority leader for his will-ingness to move expeditiously to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 and for his leadership. I would also like to thank the Armed Services Committee ranking member, the Senator from Rhode Island, for his hard work on the NDAA. I remain ap-preciative of the thoughtfulness and bi-partisan spirit with which he ap-proaches national security issues. The fact is, the NDAA is a piece of legislation in which this body—Mem-bers on both sides of the aisle—can and should take enormous pride. Not only does this legislation provide our men and women in uniform with the re-sources they need and deserve, but it is a product of an open and bipartisan process that represents the best of the U.S. Senate. The Senate Armed Services Com-mittee passed the fiscal year 2018 NDAA unanimously by a vote of 27 to 0. I repeat. The Defense authorization bill was passed by a unanimous vote of 27 to 0. That means all 14 Republican members and the 13 Democratic mem-bers of the committee voted in favor of this legislation. During the markup, the committee considered and adopted 277 amendments that were offered by both Republicans and Democrats. Now we hope to consider the legisla-tion under an open amendment process on the floor, which will allow all Sen-ators to have their voices heard. This process, which is exactly how legisla-tion is supposed to make its way through the Senate, has become dis-appointingly rare. For too long, par-tisanship and politics have triumphed over principle and policy. This legisla-tion is an opportunity for us to reverse that trend and restore regular order in the U.S. Senate. The need for this legislation is self- apparent to anyone who is paying at-tention to today’s world. With global terrorist networks, increasing great power competition with Russia and China, malign Iranian influence that is spreading across the Middle East, a North Korean dictator who is racing to acquire missiles that can hit the United States with nuclear weapons, the threats to our national security have not been more complex or daunting than at any time in the past seven decades. We must also remember that we are a nation at war, with brave young men and women who are deployed in Af-ghanistan, Iraq, and around the world. The NDAA is legislation that will de-liver to our Armed Forces the re-sources, equipment, and training they need to meet the increasingly complex challenges of today’s world, and it will begin the process of rebuilding our military after years of devastating de-fense cuts. Let me point out what happens as a result of these mindless defense cuts, which every military leader has de-scribed as devastating to our ability to defend this Nation. Let me just remind you of the hard truth. The state of our military is eroding. We saw disturbing evidence of this reality over the sum-mer as 42 servicemembers tragically perished in accidents during routine—I emphasize routine—training oper-ations. On June 17, seven sailors were killed when the USS Fitzgerald collided with a containership off the coast of Japan. On July 10, a Marine KC–130 crashed in Mississippi and killed all 16 troops on board. On August 21, 10 sailors perished when the USS McCain collided with a tanker near Singapore. On August 25, an Army Black Hawk helicopter went missing during a training mission off the coast of Yemen, and one soldier died. Just last week in Nevada, two Air Force A–10 aircraft crashed into each other. Thank God the pilots were safe-ly ejected, but the planes were lost—at a cost of over $100 million. For the two Pacific Fleet naval collisions, ship re-pairs are estimated to cost more than a half a billion dollars. The lives lost in each of these incidents were priceless. Over the past 3 years, a total of 185 men and women in uniform have been killed in noncombat accidents. During the same time, 44 servicemembers were killed in combat. The bottom line is, we are killing more of our own people in training than our enemies are in combat, and that did not happen by ac-cident. It is a problem that is caused by this mindless sequestration and a lack, frankly, of appreciation by Mem-bers of this body and the other one of what the needs are of the men and women who are serving. It is about time that we started listening to our

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5091 September 11, 2017 
military leadership who are saying that if we do not change what we are doing in the next 5 years, our en-emies—our adversaries—will catch up with us. This legislation authorizes a base de-fense budget that, together with the administration’s request of $8 billion for other defense activities, supports a total defense budget of $640 billion in funding for the Department of Defense and the national security programs of the Department of Energy. The legisla-tion also authorizes $60 billion for over-seas contingency operations. In total, the NDAA supports a national defense topline of $700 billion. This funding is critical to begin ad-dressing the readiness shortfall and modernization crisis caused by the self- inflicted wounds of the Budget Control Act, sequestration, and repeated con-tinuing resolutions. We need look no further than recent headlines, as I mentioned, of fatal incidents during routine training operations for evi-dence of the deteriorated state of our military. These ship collisions and aviation ac-cidents are taking the lives of our serv-icemembers at an alarming rate. In fact, in the last 3 years, we have killed four times as many of our own soldiers in peacetime training operations than our enemies have in combat. While there is plenty of responsibility to go around, we cannot ignore Congress’s role. Years of budget cuts have forced our military to try to do too much with too little. Meanwhile, our adversaries are in-vesting heavily in their own militaries, developing future warfare capabilities intended to erode our military advan-tage. Simply put, we cannot wait any longer to recapitalize our forces and re-store our capabilities. Another important aspect of the NDAA is that it builds on the reforms this Congress has passed in recent years. By continuing important efforts to reorganize the Department of De-fense, spur innovation and defense technology, and improve defense acqui-sition and business operations, the NDAA seeks to strengthen account-ability and streamline the process of getting our warfighters what they need to succeed. At the same time, it prioritizes accountability from the De-partment and demands the best use of every taxpayer dollar. The NDAA will also improve the quality of life for our men and women in uniform and those who support them. The legislation authorizes a 2.1- percent pay raise for our troops. It im-proves military family readiness and supports the civilians and contractors who work together with our Armed Forces to achieve the mission. Finally, the NDAA provides nec-essary assistance for our allies and partners around the world who are dedicated to advancing the cause of freedom, deterring the aggression of our adversaries, and defeating the scourge of terrorism. These are the reasons why this legis-lation is more vital than ever. Congress’s most important constitu-tional responsibility is providing for the common defense. Consideration of the National Defense Authorization Act each year is one of the ways that we live up to that duty. I guess we are going to have cloture on this bill. We don’t need it. We shouldn’t have to have it. We should move immediately to this legislation. Those who want to impose blockades to moving forward, to allowing other Members to have their amendments proposed and voted on, are doing the men and women who are serving our Nation a great disservice. The world is in more turmoil than it has been in 70 years. We cannot waste precious time and effort because one Senator has one amendment and he or she is then will-ing to block the whole process. Let’s not do that this year. We can get around it. But what it does is deprive other Members of their ability to de-bate and have votes on their issues. So I hope my colleagues, once we vote for cloture, will agree to move for-ward with the bill. We can finish in the next couple of days, and we can give the American people and the men and women who defend this Nation a prod-uct we can be proud of. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

CONGRATULATING MISS AMERICA 2018 , CARA  
MUND  
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the new Miss America. That is Cara Mund, a former intern in my office up until the end of last year. Last night she made history and be-came the first Miss North Dakota to win the title of Miss America.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5092 September 11, 2017 
My wife Mikey and I were watching the pageant on TV and cheering for Cara throughout the competition. We, like North Dakotans across our State, were very excited when she was crowned Miss America. The amazing thing is that she had actually tried four times to win the Miss North Da-kota pageant. She won the Miss North Dakota pageant on her fourth try, and then she went on to win the Miss America pageant. It is just an amazing story of somebody who decided she were going to accomplish a goal and did so. It is truly amazing and inspira-tional to anyone who sets out to achieve something really worthwhile, and it shows what determination can do. Cara is truly impressive, and we are so proud to have her representing North Dakota and, of course, now the entire Nation as Miss America. Fol-lowing graduation from Brown Univer-sity with a degree in business, entre-preneurship, and organizations, Cara served as an intern here in my Wash-ington, DC, office. She did a tremen-dous job. As I say, she was with us for half of last year. So she started about midyear and finished up at the end of the year. Again, she did tremendous work for us, and we are so appreciative of having her with us. While only 23, she has a long history of public and community service. For the past 10 years, she has organized the annual Make-a-Wish fashion show, which has raised more than $78,500 to make dreams come true for more than 20 kids who have faced life-altering conditions. It is only fitting that after spending so much of her life making others’ dreams come true, Cara’s own dreams were made a reality last night. She is so well-deserving of the title, and I know that continued service to others and public service will be part of her life’s work. She is going on to law school at Notre Dame after, of course, taking a year as Miss America and touring around the country and doing what I know will be a fabulous job as Miss America. Then she wants to go on to law school at Notre Dame, where she has already been accepted. I know she has a real interest in pub-lic service and maybe even some day running for Governor or another elec-tive office. I have no doubt that what-ever she decides to do, she will be suc-cessful, and, more importantly, she will do a great job for others. She will do a great job for many other people. She has such a good heart, and she is such a great young person—exactly the kind of person that we need out there helping face the challenges we face as a nation, setting a great example, and doing things for so many others that makes such a difference in their lives. She is well-deserving of the title. She represents our State so well, and we have no doubt that she will continue to make us proud as Miss America. Congratulations, again, to Miss America 2018, Cara Mund. She is fan-tastic. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.

REMEMBERING DAVID ‘‘TED’’ EYRE Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to one of Utah’s great public servants, a loving hus-band, father, and grandfather and a re-markable leader, David ‘‘Ted’’ Eyre. Sadly, Ted recently lost his battle with cancer. He leaves behind a grieving community that he served for many years as mayor of Murray City. Ted had a strong, yet kind demeanor that inspired others to work hard and do what was best for their community. As mayor, he made a tremendous im-pact on the infrastructure and neigh-borhoods of Murray City, a thriving community tucked into the Salt Lake Valley. Ted was able to accomplish many im-portant things for the local commu-nity, including: improving Murray Park, the heart of the city; acquiring the historic Murray Theater, Murray Chapel, and Murray Mansion that will serve as gathering places for years to come; expanding Fashion Place Mall and the University of Utah Midvalley Health Center; acquiring properties in the downtown redevelopment area for a new city hall and fire station; and adopting a new general city plan. Ted had two great passions—aviation and people. Both interests guided him in his decisions throughout his life. He received a degree in aviation science at San Bernardino Valley College. As a young man, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and served in the Vietnam war flying a U–21 Ute transport aircraft in the aviation division of the signal corps. After his military service, he continued his love of flying and ex-celled as an airline pilot for 30 years for Western and later Delta Airlines, serving as captain for much of that time. On January 7, 2014, Eyre was sworn in as the mayor of Murray City, quickly endearing himself as a capable leader who valued the input of all and who fought hard to prepare the community for the future. Mayor Eyre left an in-delible imprint on the city he led and the citizens he served. Throughout his life, Eyre not only distinguished himself as a talented pilot, courageous soldier, and devoted public servant, he also became a friend to all he came into contact with and was a beloved husband, father, and grandfather. I am grateful for the op-portunity to pay tribute to a great man, his life, and the example he leaves behind. His influence will be felt for generations to come.

The proposed sale of TOW 2A, TOW 2B, TOW BB missiles, and technical support will advance Bahrain’s efforts to develop an inte-grated ground defense capability. Bahrain will use the capability as a deterrent to re-gional threats and to strengthen its home-land defense. This sale will also improve interoperability with United States and re-gional allies. Bahrain will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed forces. The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military bal-ance in the region. The principal contractor will be Raytheon Missile Systems, Tucson, Arizona. There are no known offset agreements proposed in con-nection with this potential sale. Implementation of this proposed sale will require the U.S. Government or contractor representatives to travel to Bahrain for mul-tiple periods for equipment deprocessing/ fielding, system checkout and new equip-ment training. There will be no more than two contractor personnel in Bahrain at any one time and all efforts will take less than two weeks in total. There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-fense readiness as a result of this proposed sale. TRANSMITTAL NO . 16–35 Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act, as amended Annex Item No vii (vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 1. The Radio Frequency (RF) TOW 2A Mis-sile (BGM–71E–4B–RF) is a direct-attack mis-sile designed to defeat armored vehicles, re-inforced urban structures, field fortifications and other such targets. TOW missiles are fired from a variety of TOW launchers used by the U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps, and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers. The TOW 2A RF missile can be launched from the same launcher platforms as the ex-isting wire-guided TOW 2A missile without modification to the launcher. The TOW 2A missile (both wire & RF) contains two track-er beacons for the launcher to track and guide the missile in flight. Guidance com-mands from the launcher are provided to the missile by a RF link contained within the missile case. The hardware, software, and technical publications to be provided with the sale are UNCLASSIFIED. The highest level of classified information authorized for released through the sale of the TOW 2A is SECRET. 2. The RF TOW 2B Aero Missile (BGM–71 F– 3–RF) is a fly-over-shoot-down missile de-signed to defeat armored vehicles. TOW mis-siles are fired from a variety of TOW Launchers in the inventories of the U.S. Army, the U.S. Marine Corps, and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers. The TOW 2B Aero RF missile can be launched from the same launcher platforms as wire-guided TOW 2B and TOW 2B Aero missiles without modi-fication to the launcher. The TOW 2B missile (both wire-guided & RF) contains two track-er beacons for the launcher to track and guide the missile in flight. Guidance com-mands from the launcher are provided to the missile by an RF link contained within the missile case. The hardware and technical publications to be provided with the sale are UNCLASSIFIED. Software algorithms for the system are classified SECRET. The high-est level of classified information released through the sale of the TOW 2B is SECRET. 3. The RF TOW Bunker Buster (BB), BGM– 71–Fl–RF is a variant of the TOW 2A that re-places the TOW 2A warhead with a high ex-plosive blast-fragmentation warhead. This bulk charge warhead is effective against re-inforced concrete walls, light armored vehi-cles, and earth and timber bunkers. Guid-ance commands from the launcher are pro-vided to the missile by an RF link contained within the missile case. The hardware, soft-ware, and technical publications to be pro-vided with the sale are UNCLASSIFIED. The highest level of classified information re-leased through the sale of the TOW 2B is SE-CRET. 4. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements of these variants, the information could be used to develop countermeasures that might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with similar or advanced capabilities. 5.

TRIBUTE TO PETER WOLD ∑Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the Boys and Girls Clubs of Central Wyoming’s 2017 honoree, Peter Wold. Since 1978, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Central Wyoming has been working to make a positive difference in the lives of children. Their mission is to in-spire all youth, especially those who need them the most, to reach their full potential and to be productive, respon-sible, and caring citizens. Their activi-ties provide the children in our com-munity with a sense of competence, usefulness, and belonging. The Boys and Girls Clubs of Central Wyoming is grateful for Peter’s contributions to their critically important mission. On September 20, 2017, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Central Wyoming will be hosting the 19th Annual Awards and Recognition Breakfast. Every year at this event, the Boys and Girls Clubs honors a member of the community who has made outstanding contribu-tions to both their organization and the city of Casper. It is a wonderful celebration. Peter Wold is a perfect honoree because of his commitment to the youth across the State of Wyo-ming. Peter is a successful businessman, philanthropist, and family man. He is a native of Casper, WY. Peter attended Colorado State University and earned a bachelor of science degree in biological science. He started his career at a trout farm in Idaho and later became one of the most influential landmen in the State of Wyoming. Peter followed in his father John Wold’s footsteps at Wold Oil Properties, a family owned and operated oil and gas company char-acterized by consistency and western values. Since 1993, he and his brother Jack Wold have owned and managed the company. Peter is currently the President of Wold Energy Partners and CEO of Wold Oil Properties. Throughout his career, Peter gained valuable experience and knowledge of Wyoming industries, businesses, and communities. Since 1979, he has been managing member of Hole-in-the-Wall Ranch. Peter was a representative on the Bureau of Land Management’s Na-tional Public Lands Advisory Council. Previously, Peter served as the chair-man of the board of directors of the Wyoming Enhanced Oil Recovery Com-mission and a member of the board of directors of the Independent Petroleum Association of Rocky Mountain States. He is an active member of the Wyo-ming Association of Professional Landmen and the American Associa-tion of Professional Landmen. Peter Wold also served on the corporate boards of Arch Coal Corporations and Oppenheimer Funds. The Wold family has a proud tradi-tion of public service and helping the people of Wyoming. Peter represented Natrona County in the Wyoming House of Representatives from 1989 to 1992. His passion to give back and sense of duty to the people of Wyoming was in-stilled in him by his father, John Wold. John Wold served in the Wyoming House of Representatives from 1957 to 1959 and the U.S. House of Representa-tives from 1969 to 1971. He was the first professional geologist in the U.S. Con-gress. Peter’s son Matthew continued the family tradition of public service when he interned in my Washington, DC, office during the summer of 2007. Peter Wold continues to devote his time, talents, and resources to help promote programs that develop the mental and physical well-being of youth across Wyoming. In addition to supporting the Boys and Girls Clubs, Peter Wold is also a member of the board of trustees for the YMCA of Natrona County. He played an integral role in getting a new facility to serve the needs of the children, families, and members of the Casper community. Through his work with the Wold Foun-dation, Peter supports numerous projects and programs aimed at assist-ing Wyoming youth, such as the Natrona County School District His-tory Day competition and the Little Hands Casper arts education program. His generosity to youth organizations will ensure the future of Wyoming is strong and vibrant. Peter Wold and his family truly rep-resent the strong Wyoming values of hard work, generosity, and compassion. Peter Wold and his wife, Marla, have three children, Abbie Long and her husband Steve, Matthew Wold and his wife Katie, and Joe Wold and his wife Chelsey, as well as four grandchildren, Hayden, Harper, Ellie, and Annie. Cas-per and Wyoming are a better place thanks to the contributions of this ex-ceptional family. It is with great honor that I recog-nize this outstanding member of our Wyoming community. My wife, Bobbi, joins me in extending our congratula-tions to Peter Wold for receiving this special award.∑

TRIBUTE TO DR. DONALD F. BOESCH ∑Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Dr. Donald F. Boesch, who is stepping down as president of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, UMCES, a position he has held for the past 27 years. Since 1990, Dr. Boesch has led an in-stitution with an excellent reputation for Chesapeake Bay science to global prominence in coastal watershed science and its application, building highly capable research facilities at each of the UMCES’s four laboratories. Since 2008, he has also served as vice chancellor for environmental sustain-ability for the University System of Maryland. During Dr. Boesch’s tenure, UMCES went through remarkable trans-formations. Research grants more than tripled and significantly diversified with multiple agency and private and philanthropic sponsors. This allowed UMCES scientists to expand their re-search into new and emerging topics critical to understanding Maryland’s environment. He also initiated the In-tegration and Application Network, which is responsible for the annual ‘‘re-port card’’ on the Chesapeake Bay, to inspire and produce timely syntheses on critical environmental issues and identify practical and effective solu-tions to the bay’s problems. Thanks to Don’s unstinting passion and dedication to environmental issues, UMCES has had a profoundly positive impact on improving the health of Maryland’s environment, playing a major role in the university’s mission to enhance the quality of life in Maryland and our region. UMCES has become recognized as the State’s foremost research authority on envi-ronmental matters that are critical to Maryland and the Nation, from enhanc-ing the health of the Chesapeake Bay to restoring our State’s oyster popu-lation. Don Boesch has been an extremely ef-fective leader of people. He worked with the University of Maryland Balti-more County and the University of Maryland, Baltimore to form a novel research partnership, the Institute of Marine and Environmental Tech-nology, located on Baltimore’s Inner Harbor. He spearheaded the effort to design and construct the state-of-the- art research vessel Rachel Carson to help understand and monitor the Chesapeake Bay and coastal Atlantic Ocean. He led UMCES, a longtime part-ner in graduate education and class-room instruction with the University of Maryland, to receive accreditation to award joint graduate degrees in en-vironmental science. Don has been involved in research on the Chesapeake Bay for more than 35 years, becoming one of the Nation’s most widely recognized and respected experts in applying science to public policies for the protection, sustainable use, and restoration of coastal eco-systems. He has been an official adviser to Federal agencies, the Chesapeake Bay Program, and five Maryland Gov-ernors. He is a member of the Gov-ernor’s Chesapeake Bay Cabinet. He has also served as chair of the Ocean

Studies Board of the National Academy of Sciences and member of the Na-tional Academies Committee on Amer-ica’s Climate Choices. In 2007, he won the ‘‘Award for Lifetime Leadership in Ecosystem Restoration, National Con-ference on Ecosystem Restoration.’’ In 2010, President Barack Obama ap-pointed Don to the National Commis-sion on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. In 2015, he earned the ‘‘Admiral of the Chesapeake Award,’’ which was presented to him by the Governor. Don’s interest in coastal watershed science probably came naturally; he was born and raised in New Orleans, and he received his B.S. in biology from Tulane University in 1967. He went on to earn a Ph.D. in oceanog-raphy from the College of William & Mary in 1971. He was awarded a Ful-bright postdoctoral fellowship to study in Australia and then spent 8 years on the faculty at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science. From 1980 to 1990, he served as the first executive director of the Louisiana Universities Marine Con-sortium and worked as a professor of Marine Science at Louisiana State University. He returns to the gulf coast frequently to lead task forces and sci-entific panels on gulf ecosystem pro-tection and restoration. Dr. Donald F. Boesch has had an ex-emplary career at the intersection of science and public policy. He has been incredibly helpful to me and the rest of the Maryland congressional delegation; we have all valued his wise counsel. I am comforted by the fact that, while Don is stepping down as president of UMCES on September 17, he will join the faculty and focus his energies on completing several research publica-tions. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in congratulating Don on this milestone event and thanking him for his extraordinary contributions to un-derstanding and protecting our envi-ronment.∑

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS The following petitions and memo-rials were laid before the Senate and were referred or ordered to lie on the table as indicated: 
POM–82. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States Congress to take such actions as are necessary to de-velop, implement, and enforce additional safeguards, policies, and procedures that will significantly enhance airport safety; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. H
OUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 1 Whereas, according to the United States Department of Transportation’s Bureau of Transportation Statistics, United States air-lines and foreign airlines serving the United States carried over eight hundred ninety-five million passengers in 2015; and Whereas, airports contribute significantly to local, national, and global economies and provide jobs and fuel trade for economic de-velopment; and Whereas, approximately forty percent of all tourists travel by air, forty-five million tons of freight are transported annually by air, and fourteen million jobs around the world are tied to air travel, which heavily contribute to economic advancement; and Whereas, there are over nineteen thousand airports serving the United States with seven commercial service airports located in the state of Louisiana; and Whereas, safety and security are of great concern and are key influencing factors when people select a mode of transportation and a travel destination; and Whereas, on a daily basis, the lives of countless airline passengers are dependent upon the implementation of safety regula-tions adopted to protect the public interest both in the air and at the airport; and Whereas, while significant measures have been taken to enhance airport and traveler safety and security professionals are focused on extensive security investments to protect airports and civilians from threats, consider-able vulnerabilities still remain; and Whereas, public areas of an airport, such as the baggage claim and ticket areas, remain vulnerable because the focus of security is primarily devoted to screening passengers to keep flights safe; and Whereas, the perceived weaknesses of an airport can be transformed into potential strengths with appropriate security solu-tions; and Whereas, as security systems become more reliable, competitively priced, and advanced, and there is better integration of products from various equipment manufacturers, se-curity challenges can be overcome with ef-fective solutions; and Whereas, in addition to detection and mon-itoring of movement prior to accessing the terminal of airports, perimeter security could be used to control, manage, and verify a high volume of traffic at the initial point of contact at an airport; Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions as are nec-essary to develop, implement, and enforce additional safeguards, policies, and proce-dures that will significantly enhance airport safety; and be it further Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States of America and to each member of the Louisiana con-gressional delegation. POM–83. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States Congress to take such actions as are necessary to con-tinue to provide appropriate and sufficient funding for the National Sea Grant College Program, including that for Louisiana Sea Grant; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. H
OUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 66 Whereas, the National Sea Grant College Program, a network of thirty-three sea grant colleges and universities, was created in 1966 by the United States Congress in the Na-tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-tion within the United States Department of Commerce; and Whereas, the colleges and universities des-ignated under the National Sea Grant Col-lege Program were so designated because they were involved in scientific research, education, training, and extension projects and programs that were aimed at preserva-tion and practical development of coastal re-sources, including those along the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Great Lakes; and Whereas, the Act that created the National Sea Grant College Program stated that the program was to support education, research, and extension by ‘‘Encouraging and devel-oping programs consisting of instruction, practical demonstrations, publications, and otherwise, by sea grant colleges and other suitable institutes, laboratories, and public and private agencies through marine advi-sory programs with the object of imparting useful information to persons currently em-ployed or interested in the various fields re-lated to the development of marine re-sources, the scientific community, and the general public.’’; and Whereas, in 1978, Louisiana Sea Grant, lo-cated at Louisiana State University, was designated as the thirteenth sea grant col-lege and in its most recent program review conducted by the National Sea Grant Office of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-ministration was rated as ‘‘. . . exceeds ex-pectations by a substantial margin in some areas/aspects.’’; and Whereas, Louisiana Sea Grant, similar to the agricultural extension or ‘‘county agent’’ program of the United States Department of Agriculture, provides many educational and support services to local coastal commu-nities and businesses, including our state’s commercial fishermen; and Whereas, in 2015, Louisiana Sea Grant ac-tivities in the state resulted in $17.7 million in economic benefits, the establishment of nearly one hundred twenty businesses, and the educational experiences of nearly twen-ty-nine thousand students in our elementary and secondary schools; and Whereas, Louisiana Sea Grant was also able to assist twenty-four communities in the development and implementation of sus-tainable economic and environmental prac-tices to the benefit of those communities and their citizens; and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5103 September 11, 2017 
Whereas, Louisiana Sea Grant has been a part of the first response to many coastal crises including hurricanes, floods, and even the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster, and the Louisiana Sea Grant has been an essential part of the short-term and long-term recov-ery from those disasters by local coastal communities; and Whereas, Louisiana Sea Grant annually reaches more than twenty-five thousand of our state’s kindergarten through twelfth grade schoolchildren through professional development for teachers and development of student coastal stewardship activities and has supported more than twelve hundred graduate and undergraduate students in their quest for applicable degrees and re-search opportunities, furthering the mission of Louisiana Sea Grant to impart ‘‘. . . use-ful information to persons currently em-ployed or interested in the various fields re-lated to the development of marine re-sources, the scientific community, and the general public’’; and Whereas, one of the programs slated to be cut by $30 million in the Fiscal Year 2018 President’s budget request is the National Sea Grant College Program with an addi-tional Fiscal Year 2019 budget proposal that would eliminate funding for the Sea Grant program entirely; and Whereas, the Fiscal Year 2018 proposed cut would eliminate the remaining budget for the National Sea Grant College Program this year and, if adopted, would terminate the National Sea Grant Office on the day such a budget cut became effective; and Whereas, Louisiana Sea Grant provides vital services to the state of Louisiana and its citizens through the scientific research, education, training, and extension projects and programs that are aimed at preservation and practical development of coastal re-sources and the loss of these services would deal a devastating blow to communities al-ready stressed due to the magnitude of coastal loss and repeated natural disasters, such as hurricanes and flooding: Therefore, be it Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions as are nec-essary to continue to provide appropriate and sufficient funding for the National Sea Grant College Program, including that for Louisiana Sea Grant; and be it further Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States of America and to each member of the Louisiana con-gressional delegation. 
POM–84. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States Congress and the Louisiana Congressional Delegation to take such actions as are necessary to rec-tify the revenue sharing inequities between coastal and interior energy producing states and to ensure the dependability of such rev-enue sharing, to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. H
OUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 101 Whereas, since 1920, interior states with mineral production in the United States have been privy to a revenue sharing agree-ment with the federal government that al-lowed those states to keep fifty percent of the revenues generated in their states from mineral production on federal lands within their borders, including royalties, severance taxes, and bonuses; and Whereas, coastal states with onshore and offshore oil and gas production were not in-cluded in that revenue sharing agreement and therefore face inequities under the fed-eral energy policies because those coastal states have not been party to this same level of revenue sharing partnership with the fed-eral government; and Whereas, coastal energy producing states have a limited partnership with the federal government that allows them to retain very little revenue generated from their offshore energy production and transportation, and activities associated with energy that are produced and transported for use throughout the nation; and Whereas, in 2006 the United States Con-gress passed the Gulf of Mexico Energy Secu-rity Act (GOMESA) from which the state of Louisiana will begin receiving revenue shar-ing payments from mineral production in the Gulf of Mexico in 2017; an Act that calls for a sharing of thirty-seven and five tenths per-cent of coastal production revenues with four gulf states with a cap of $500 million per year; and Whereas, according to the most recent data from the United States Energy Informa-tion Administration, Louisiana, including its state waters, is the ninth largest producer of oil in the United States while if offshore oil production from federal waters is included, it is the second largest oil producer in the country; and from wells located within the state boundaries including the state waters, Louisiana is the fourth largest producer of gas in the United States while if gas produc-tion from federal offshore waters in the Gulf of Mexico is included, it is the second largest gas producer in the United States; and Whereas, with eighteen operating refin-eries in the state, Louisiana is second only to Texas in both total number of refineries and total refinery operating capacity, ac-counting for nearly one-fifth of the nation’s total refining capacity; and Whereas, Louisiana contributes to the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve with two facilities located in the state con-sisting of twenty-nine caverns capable of holding nearly three hundred million barrels of crude oil; and Whereas, with three onshore liquified nat-ural gas (LNG) facilities and others already permitted, more LNG facilities than any other state in the country, and the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, the nation’s only deep-water oil port, Louisiana plays an essential role in the movement of natural gas from the United States Gulf Coast region to markets throughout the country; and Whereas, it is apparent that Louisiana plays an essential role in supplying the na-tion with energy and it is vital to the secu-rity of our nation’s energy supply, roles that should be recognized and compensated at an appropriate revenue sharing level; and Whereas, the majority of the oil and gas production from the Gulf of Mexico enters the United States through coastal Louisiana with all of the infrastructure necessary to receive and transport such production, infra-structure that has for many decades dam-aged the coastal areas of Louisiana, an im-pact that should be compensated through ap-propriate revenue sharing with the federal government; and Whereas, because Louisiana is losing more coastal wetlands than any other state in the country, in 2006 the people of Louisiana over-whelmingly approved a constitutional amendment dedicating revenues received from Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas ac-tivity through GOMESA to the Coastal Pro-tection and Restoration Fund for the pur-poses of coastal protection, including con-servation, coastal restoration, hurricane pro-tection, and infrastructure directly impacted by coastal wetland losses; and Whereas, the state of Louisiana has devel-oped, through a science-based and stake-holder-involved process, a ‘‘2017 Comprehen-sive Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast’’ which identifies and prioritizes the most effi-cient and effective projects in order to meet the state’s critical coastal protection and restoration needs and has received many ac-colades from the country’s scientific commu-nity; and Whereas, the Coastal Protection and Res-toration Authority is making great progress implementing the projects in the ‘‘Com-prehensive Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast’’ with all available funding, projects that are essential to the protection of the in-frastructure that is critical to the energy needs of the United States; and Whereas, the federal budget proposal re-leased on May 23, 2017, recommends the com-plete elimination of the revenue sharing pay-ments under the GOMESA Act, in effect ne-gating the long-fought-for agreement that our congressional delegation along with the delegations from the other Gulf of Mexico states had entered into with the federal gov-ernment to compensate those states for the infrastructure demands and damages; and Whereas, in order to properly compensate the coastal states for the infrastructure de-mands that result from production of energy and fuels that heat and cool the nation’s homes, offices, and businesses and fuel the nation’s transportation needs, revenue shar-ing for coastal states needs to at least be at the same rate as interior states that produce oil, gas, and coal. Therefore, be it Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby memorialize the United States Congress and the Louisiana Congressional Delegation to take such actions as are nec-essary to treat oil and gas production in the Gulf Coast states in a manner that is at least equal to onshore oil, gas, and coal produc-tion in interior states for revenue purposes; and to rectify the revenue sharing inequities between coastal and interior energy pro-ducing states in order to address the nation-ally significant crisis of wetland loss in the state of Louisiana; and be it further Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby memorialize the United States Congress and the Louisiana Congressional Delegation, along with the delegations from the other Gulf of Mexico states, to ensure that the agreement codified through the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA) remains in place and that the Gulf Coast states receive their anticipated revenue sharing payments during Fiscal Year 2017– 2018 as outlined in the Act; and be it further Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States of America and to each member of the Louisiana Con-gressional Delegation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5104 September 11, 2017 
Whereas, Beginning in 1921, and many times since, the California Legislature has enacted laws that withdrew certain offshore areas from oil and gas leasing, and by 1989 the state’s offshore oil and gas leasing mora-torium was in place; and Whereas, In 1994, the California Legislature made findings in Assembly Bill 2444, Chapter 970 of the Statutes of 1994, that offshore oil and gas production in certain areas of state waters poses an unacceptably high risk of damage and disruption to the marine envi-ronment; and Whereas, In the same bill, the Legislature created the California Coastal Sanctuary Act, which included all of the state’s un-leased waters subject to tidal influence and prohibited new oil and gas leases in the sanc-tuary, unless the President of the United States has found a severe energy supply interruption and has ordered distribution of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the Gov-ernor finds that the energy resources of the sanctuary will contribute significantly to al-leviating that interruption, and the Legisla-ture subsequently amends Chapter 970 of the Statutes of 1994 to allow that extraction; and Whereas, Section 18 of the federal Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. Sec. 1331 et seq.) requires the preparation of a na-tionwide offshore oil and gas leasing pro-gram that sets a five-year schedule of lease sales implemented by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management within the United States Department of the Interior; and Whereas, Consistent with the principles of Section 18 and the resulting regionally tai-lored leasing strategy, the current exclusion of the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf from new oil and gas development is consistent with the longstanding interests of Pacific coast states, as framed in the 2006 West Coast Governors’ Agreement on Ocean Health adopted by the Governors of Cali-fornia, Washington, and Oregon; and Whereas, In November 2016, the federal Bu-reau of Ocean Energy Management released a final 2017–2022 leasing program that con-tinues the moratorium on oil and gas leasing in the undeveloped areas of the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf; and Whereas, Governor Brown, in December 2016, requested that then President Obama permanently withdraw California’s Outer Continental Shelf from new oil and gas leas-ing, and along with previous California Gov-ernors, has united with the Governors of Or-egon and Washington in an effort to commit to developing robust renewable energy sources to reduce our dependence on fossil fuel and help us reach our carbon emission goals; and Whereas, The California Legislature has led the nation with its landmark climate change legislation, requiring ambitious greenhouse gas emission reductions of a 40- percent emissions reduction below 1990 levels by 2030, and achieving a renewables portfolio standard of 50 percent by 2030; California must lead the nation in fostering the transi-tion away from offshore fossil fuel produc-tion to protect both our climate and oceans from the damaging impacts of climate change, which will affect all life on earth for generations to come; and Whereas, President Trump’s proposed five- year National Offshore Oil and Gas Leasing Program represents a renewed call for open-ing offshore areas for drilling and for lifting moratoriums on energy production in federal areas, that could lead to more oil spills, in-creased dependence on fossil fuel, and more damaging impact from climate change; and Whereas, The California Legislature con-siders new oil and gas development offshore of the Pacific coast to be a threat to the na-tion’s economy and national security, and to the state’s ambitious renewable energy goals; and Whereas, The California Senate has pre-viously adopted Senate Resolutions 35 and 44 in 2017, which support the current federal prohibition on new oil or gas drilling in fed-eral waters offshore California, oppose at-tempts to modify the prohibition, and defend the United States’ National Marine Sanc-tuaries; and Whereas, Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke took action on June 29, 2017, to open up a 45-day public comment period for a new five-year National Offshore Oil and Gas Leas-ing Program on the Pacific coast’s Outer Continental Shelf pursuant to President Donald J. Trump’s Executive order on Amer-ican energy that was issued on April 28, 2017; and Whereas, Despite the Trump administra-tion’s assertion of support for the program from state and local governments, the States of Washington, Oregon, and California have been consistently united in their opposition to any new oil and gas activities off their coasts, which has resulted in the exclusion of the Pacific coast’s Outer Continental Shelf from any National Outer Continental Shelf Program since the 1989–1992 program; now, therefore, be it Resolved by the Senate of the State of Cali-fornia, That the Senate strongly urges the President and the Congress of the United States to permanently safeguard and protect the Pacific coast’s Outer Continental Shelf from new oil and gas leasing, and declares the Senate’s unequivocal support for the cur-rent federal prohibition on new oil or gas drilling in federal waters offshore of the Pa-cific coast, its opposition to the proposed five-year National Offshore Oil and Gas Leas-ing Program on the Outer Continental Shelf or any attempts to modify that prohibition, and its determination to consider any appro-priate actions to maintain the current prohi-bition; and be it further Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit a copy of this resolution to the Na-tional Program Manager of the federal Bu-reau of Ocean Energy Management as the public comment of the Legislature in opposi-tion to the proposed new five-year National Offshore Oil and Gas Leasing Program on the Outer Continental Shelf; and be it further Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate transmit copies of this resolution to the President and the Vice President of the United States, to the Governor of California, to the Majority and Minority Leaders of the United States Senate, to the Speaker and the Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives, to each Senator and Representative from California in the Congress of the United States, to the Sec-retary of the United States Department of the Interior, to the Director of the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, and to each member of the California State Senate and Assembly. 
POM–86. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislative Assembly of the Common-wealth of Puerto Rico requesting the Comp-troller General of the United States comply with the provisions of Section 411 of Public Law 114–187, known as the ‘‘Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Sta-bility Act,’’ in order to conduct and submit to the United States Congress an audit of the public debt of the territory of Puerto Rico; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Re-sources. S. C
ON. RES. 17 
STATEMENT OF MOTIVES  The Government of Puerto Rico is under the control of the ‘‘Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act’’ (PROMESA), passed on June 30, 2016. Said federal statute provides for the creation of a Fiscal Oversight Board to assist the Govern-ment of Puerto Rico in managing its public finances and enable Puerto Rico to regain access to capital markets. During the floor debate on PROMESA, it was made clear that the intent of said fed-eral measure was to provide for the restruc-turing of the debt without favoring any spe-cific creditor. To achieve this, the aforemen-tioned federal legislation requires trans-parent audits along with annual fiscal and budget plans, and the temporary stay of liti-gations, to allow the Fiscal Oversight Board a space for carrying out voluntary negotia-tions. Thus, it was made clear that Puerto Rico’s debt would be audited. In the words of Congressman Ryan: ‘‘Congress and the Presi-dent will appoint the members of this board. It will audit Puerto Rico’s books and make sure the restructuring is open and fair [...].’’ In light of such reality and as part of said processes and the approval of PROMESA, Section 411 was incorporated, directing the Comptroller General of the United States to submit reports on the public debt of the ter-ritory, that is, Puerto Rico, within a year of enactment, and thereafter not less than once every two years. Said report would include the historical levels of public debt, current amount and composition thereof, and future projections of each territory’s public debt. It should also include the historical levels of each territory’s revenue, current amount and composition of each territory’s revenue, and future projections of each territory’s revenue. Moreover, the report shall state the drivers and composition of the public debt as well as the ability of each territory to repay its public debt. To fulfill said undertaking, the Government of Puerto Rico would pro-vide the Comptroller General with any infor-mation necessary to carry out said statutory task. The approval of PROMESA and Section 411 invalidated the functions of the Commission for the Comprehensive Audit of the Public Credit (hereinafter, the Commission) created under Act No. 97–2015, to set a fiscal and fi-nancial restructuring process in motion in order to audit the entire public debt of Puer-to Rico. Consequently, the Commission’s purpose became redundant, entailing super-fluous public spending. The objectives of the Commission were considered even during the incorporation of Section 411 to PROMESA. For such reason, upon the enactment of said federal statute, it was clearly stated in Section 413 that the functions of the Commission would be inde-pendent to those provided in PROMESA. Furthermore, it was stated that ‘‘ [...]  this particular amendment does not override the authority of the oversight board.’’ There-fore, given the fiscal situation facing the Is-land, it would be contradictory to allocate resources and efforts, when the provisions of PROMESA require an audit conducted by the Comptroller General of the United States. Consequently, and in accordance with PROMESA’s provisions, the Comptroller General of the United States is entrusted with the audit Puerto Rico’s debt, including the historical levels, current amount and composition thereof in the best interest of the People of Puerto Rico. Thusly, we obtain an independent and transparent evaluation of accountability that may be free from col-lateral attack and that may be effectively used by the Fiscal Oversight Board in car-rying out the task entrusted thereto under PROMESA. Be it Resolved by the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico: Section 1.—The Comptroller General of the United States is hereby required to comply with the provisions of Section 411 of Public Law 114–187, known as the ‘‘Puerto Rico

POM–87. A resolution adopted by the Gen-eral Assembly of the State of New Jersey op-posing the President of the United States’s nomination for Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and urging the United States Congress to op-pose the nomination, to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. A
SSEMBLY RESOLUTION NO. 211 Whereas, Created in the wake of elevated concern about environmental pollution, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was established on December 2, 1970 to consolidate in one agency a variety of federal research, monitoring, standard- setting, and enforcement activities to ensure protection of the environment and public health; and Whereas, With a stated mission to protect the environment and human health, the EPA, since its inception, has been working for a cleaner, healthier environment for the American people; and Whereas, The EPA’s primary focus has al-ways been, and should be, protecting resi-dents of this country from threats to their air, water, and health, not serving as an ad-vocate for the interests of the very indus-tries that it is charged with regulating; and Whereas, President Trump nominated Scott Pruitt, the attorney general of the oil and natural gas-intensive state of Oklahoma, to serve as Administrator of the EPA; and Whereas, Mr. Pruitt has spent much of his energy as attorney general fighting the very agency he is being nominated to lead, and according to a biography publicly available on the website of the Oklahoma Office of the Attorney General, Mr. Pruitt ‘‘is a leading advocate against the EPA’s activist agenda’’; and Whereas, As Oklahoma Attorney General, Mr. Pruitt has engaged in lawsuits opposing EPA’s policies aimed at protecting air qual-ity and water quality, including being part of the coalition of state attorney generals suing the EPA over its Clean Power Plan, which is aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector, its regulations seeking to curtail emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, from the oil and natural gas sector, and its regula-tion concerning the definition of ‘‘Waters of the United States,’’ which defines the rivers, streams, lakes, and marshes that fall under the protection of the EPA and the United States Army Corps of Engineers; and Whereas, According to numerous press re-ports, President Trump has said ‘‘For too long, the Environmental Protection Agency has spent taxpayer dollars on an out-of-con-trol anti-energy agenda that has destroyed millions of Jobs’’; and Whereas, Strong environmental standards that protect public health and the environ-mental resources of this country are not con-trary to a strong economy and the creation of jobs; and Whereas, The Sierra Club, the nation’s largest environmental organization, released the following statement about the nomina-tion. ‘‘Having Scott Pruitt in charge of the U S. Environmental Protection Agency is like putting an arsonist in charge of fighting fires He is a climate science denier who, as Attorney General for the state of Oklahoma, regularly conspired with the fossil fuel in-dustry to attack EPA protections. Nothing less than our children’s health is at stake . . .’’; and Whereas, Instead of nominating a person who seeks to promote the lobbying agenda of special interests and believes that strong en-vironmental protections are obstacles that should be dismantled, the President should nominate a person who is guided by science and will work to ensure that residents of this country have clean air to breathe, clean water to drink, clean soils on which to live and play, and jobs that do not endanger their public health and safety; and Whereas, In order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the country’s residents and its natural resources, it is altogether fit-ting and proper for this House to object to the President’s nomination of Scott Pruitt as Administrator of the United States Envi-ronmental Protection Agency: Now, there-fore, be it Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1. This House strongly opposes President Trump’s nomination of Scott Pruitt as Ad-ministrator of the United States Environ-mental Protection Agency and urges the United States Congress to oppose this nomi-nation, 2. Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the General Assembly to the President of the United States, the President of the United States Senate, the Senate Ma-jority Leader, the Senate Minority Leader, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives, and each member of Congress elected from the State of New Jersey.

H
OUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 97 Whereas, the flooding of August 2016 was declared a state and national disaster result-ing in the loss of life and destruction of prop-erty; and Whereas, the Comite River Diversion Canal Project remains incomplete twenty-five years after its authorization and if com-pleted could have substantially reduced flood stages by as much as five feet and mitigated the devastation caused by the floods; and Whereas, approximately $117 million of local, state, and federal funding has been in-vested in the project; and Whereas, the state of Louisiana anticipates receiving Hazard Mitigation Grant Program funding from the Federal Emergency Man-agement Agency as a result of the flood and the national declaration of emergency; and Whereas, the flood of 2016 has shown the urgent need to complete the project as a means to protect life and property in the fu-ture as citizens impacted by the flood rebuild their homes and lives: Therefore, be it Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions as are nec-essary to complete the Comite River Diver-sion Canal Project; and be it further Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions as are nec-essary to authorize the use of Hazard Mitiga-tion Grant Program funds to complete the construction of an authorized United States Army Corps of Engineers project under the current emergency rules and circumstances; and be it further Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States of America and to each member of the Louisiana con-gressional delegation. POM–89. A resolution adopted by the Gen-eral Assembly of the State of New Jersey urging the United States Senate not to enact H.R. 1628, the ‘‘American Health Care Act of 2017’’, to the Committee on Finance. A
SSEMBLY RESOLUTION NO. 252 Whereas, the Patient Protection and Af-fordable Care Act (ACA), which was signed into law on March 23, 2010, established a comprehensive series of health insurance re-forms designed to make universal, quality, affordable health coverage available to all Americans while ending certain common health insurance industry practices that lim-ited access to coverage; and Whereas, since its enactment, the ACA has helped reduce the number of people without health insurance through the use of tax sub-sidies, coverage mandates, and expansions to Medicaid. In New Jersey alone, an additional 480,000 people obtained coverage under the Medicaid expansion, and the uninsured rate in the State was reduced to 8.7 percent, rep-resenting a 34 percent decrease in the unin-sured population between 2013 and 2015: and Whereas, on March 20, 2017, H.R.1628, the American Health Care Act of 2017 (AHCA), sometimes known as ‘‘Trumpcare,’’ was in-troduced in the United States House of Rep-resentatives. On May 4, 2017, the House voted to pass the bill; and Whereas, on March 23, 2017, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the AHCA would result in an additional 24 million people being without health insurance by 2026, as compared with the uninsured rate under the ACA. Although the House of Representatives amended the bill prior to passage, the membership did not wait for a new CBO score before holding a vote, suggesting the House passed the bill without the benefit of an impartial analysis of its potential effects; and Whereas, as passed by the House of Rep-resentatives, the AHCA would eliminate many of the provisions of the ACA that were designed to expand access to health insur-ance, including rolling back the Medicaid ex-pansion; and Whereas, in its current form, Trumpcare would revise the way tax subsidies are struc-tured and allow states to opt out of certain ACA protections designed to prevent certain industry practices that limited access to health care for women and individuals with preexisting conditions; and Whereas, specifically, under the current version of the AHCA, states would be allowed to opt out of the requirement that all health insurance policies include coverage for es-sential health benefits, including emergency services, habilitative and rehabilitative serv-ices, inpatient care, outpatient care, mater-nity and newborn care, mental health and addiction treatment, lab tests, preventative care, prescriptions, and pediatric services; and Whereas, before enactment of the ACA, women who wanted coverage for maternity

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5106 September 11, 2017 
and newborn care were frequently charged premiums and deductibles that nearly matched the out of pocket costs for those services. Experts predict that, in states that opt out of the maternity and newborn care coverage requirement, women will again be charged significantly higher rates for this coverage; and Whereas, the nation is currently in the midst of an opioid addiction epidemic that has caused overdose and mortality rates to skyrocket. Efforts to address and curtail opioid addiction could be significantly ham-pered in states that opt out of mandatory coverage for mental health and addiction treatment; and Whereas, prior to enactment of the ACA, insurers denied coverage to people with pre-existing conditions or charged them signifi-cantly higher premiums and deductibles; 35 states and the federal government created high risk pools to attempt to provide cov-erage to these individuals, however, the pools were expensive to operate and required significant governmental subsidies. Even with the subsidies, the pools were generally unable to provide coverage to everyone with a preexisting condition, and many pools im-plemented waiting lists, annual and lifetime limits on coverage, high deductibles, and waiting periods before coverage began; and Whereas, in its current form, Trumpcare would replace coverage protections for peo-ple with preexisting conditions with the same high risk pools that failed in the past. According to an analysis published by Avelere, the $23 billion included in the Trumpcare plan to fund the pools would cover approximately five percent of the 2.2 million people with preexisting conditions; the Commonwealth Fund estimates that high risk pools will require $178 billion in funding each year to coves everyone with a preexisting condition; and Whereas, New Jersey Policy Perspective predicts that rolling back the Medicaid ex-pansion will eliminate coverage for 562,000 people in New Jersey, and permanent struc-tural changes to Medicaid will jeopardize coverage for an additional 1.8 million State residents, including seniors, people with dis-abilities, and children; and Whereas, under the AHCA, it is estimated that a total of 1.25 million New Jersey resi-dents will be uninsured by 2020. This would be an increase of 127,000 over the number of uninsured people prior to the enactment of the ACA, and includes 86,000 people who had coverage under Medicaid prior to enactment of the ACA, but are expected to lose coverage because the State will not be able to replace lost federal funding; and Whereas, it would cost New Jersey an esti-mated $8.8 billion over the next decade to maintain Medicaid coverage at the expanded levels, assuming there is no increase in en-rollment; and Whereas, according to New Jersey Policy Perspective, caps on Medicaid spending under Trumpcare will cost New Jersey $30 billion in federal funds and potentially result in tens of thousands of lost jobs; and Whereas, the AHCA is expected to increase out-of-pocket health care costs by an aver-age of $2,740 per year for each of the 250,000 New Jersey residents who purchase insur-ance through the ACA marketplace; and Whereas, although the AHCA would pro-vide 250 New Jersey millionaires with a fed-eral tax break averaging $57,000 per year, it is expected to increase federal taxes by 30 percent for middle and lower income New Jerseyans; and Whereas, the Center for American Progress conservatively estimates that it will cost $790 million per year to provide health cov-erage for the 37,000 New Jerseyans with a preexisting condition. Currently, the AHCA would allocate an average $353 million to each state, leaving New Jersey with a $437 million funding gap, the 11th highest in the nation; and Whereas, numerous health care groups have expressed opposition to the AHCA, in-cluding the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, and the American Diabetes Association; and Whereas, an increase in the number of un-insured individuals will likely increase costs for hospitals, which are required to treat anyone who presents at the emergency de-partment, regardless of their coverage sta-tus. In New Jersey, expanded Medicaid cov-erage under the ACA resulted in $400 million in cost savings from payments to hospitals to offset the cost of caring for individuals without insurance. These gains are likely to be erased under Trumpcare to its current form; and Whereas, if enacted, the AHCA will elimi-nate health security for millions of Ameri-cans, particularly older adults, women, and individuals with preexisting conditions. The United States Senate has both the oppor-tunity and the responsibility to stop this dis-astrous legislation from becoming law; Now, therefore, be it Resolved, by the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1. The General Assembly of New Jersey re-spectfully urges the United States Senate not to enact H.R. 1628, titled the American Health Care Act of 2017. 2. Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the General Assembly to the President and Vice President of the United States, the Majority and Minority Leaders of the United States Senate, the Speaker and Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives, and every member of the Congress of the United States elected from the State of New Jersey.

O. 1833 Whereas, Fossil fuels, including coal, nat-ural gas, and oil, currently meet more than three quarters of primary global energy de-mand around the world and in the United States; and Whereas, According to the International Energy Agency, under current energy and environmental policies, fossil fuels will con-tinue to play a role of this magnitude for the next quarter century or more; even assuming global adoption of policies consistent with the IEA’s ‘‘climate-stabilizing’’ 450 Scenario, more than half of total worldwide and U.S. energy demand would still be met by fossil fuels in 2040; and Whereas, The U.S. Department of Energy has reported that ‘‘carbon capture, utiliza-tion, and storage technologies provide a key pathway to address the urgent U.S. and glob-al need for affordable, secure, resilient, and reliable sources of clean energy’’; environ-mental advocates who recognize the value and enduring role of fossil fuels as an essen-tial source of energy have come to support the accelerated development and broad de-ployment of carbon capture technologies for fossil fuels as part of a sustainable energy fu-ture; similarly, fossil energy advocates who have recognized the role carbon capture can play in creating new opportunities support the development and deployment of carbon capture technologies for fossil fuels; and Whereas, The United States and Texas have abundant supplies of fossil energy, the production and use of which provide impor-tant economic, energy, and national security benefits to our nation and our state; Texas is the nation’s largest producer of natural gas, oil, lignite coal, and fossil fuels in total, and it has the nation’s largest proved reserves of both natural gas and oil, as well as the ninth-largest recoverable reserves of coal; it is the nation’s largest consumer of coal for electricity generation and the largest con-sumer of natural gas for both electricity gen-eration and industrial use; 77 percent of the electricity generated in Texas is produced from the use of fossil fuels; and Whereas, Reliable and affordable elec-tricity is vital to economic growth and job creation and to the well-being of all citizens; according to the U.S. Department of Energy, ‘‘A diverse portfolio of energy resources is critical to U.S. energy and national policy . . . being more robust and resilient in com-parison to a system that is heavily depend-ent on a limited set of energy resources . . . [and] helps insulate the economy from cer-tain risks, including price volatility and risks from supply disruptions’’; and Whereas, Texas is a leader in the research and development of technologies that pro-vide clean, safe, and reliable power genera-tion, and it is committed to continued re-search and development of carbon reduction strategies for fossil fuels, including existing and emerging CCUS technologies such as ge-ological sequestration, mineral carbonation, and the beneficial use of captured carbon di-oxide; and Whereas, In Texas, many academic, pri-vate, and governmental initiatives and insti-tutions are engaged in efforts to address the environmental, health, and economic im-pacts of energy production and use through collaborations on applied CO2 research, prac-tical applications, workforce development, and public education; among them are the Petra Nova Project at the W. A. Parish Elec-tric Generating Station in Fort Bend Coun-ty, the Texas Clean Energy Project in Ector County, the NET Power project in Harris County, the Energy and Environment Initia-tive at Rice University, the Texas Carbon Management Project, and the Gulf Coast Carbon Center at The University of Texas at Austin; and Whereas, Legislation was introduced in the 114th U.S. Congress to enhance and extend current federal tax incentives, under Section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code, that sus-tain and promote such collaborations and en-courage private industry in energy genera-tion, manufacturing, and agriculture to adopt and deploy existing and emerging technologies that increase carbon capture, utilization, and storage; environmental and energy advocates have come together in sup-port of this legislation in a groundbreaking coalition of environmental advocacy groups, labor unions, and energy producers from the coal, oil and gas, ethanol, and algae-biomass industries; moreover, the legislation has re-ceived strong bipartisan support in both the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives; and Whereas, Congress and the president are also currently considering a large-scale fed-eral infrastructure initiative to strengthen our nation’s transportation, public works, and energy infrastructure, which could also serve as a vehicle for advancing ‘‘jobs-ready’’ carbon capture projects; the U.S. Depart-ment of Energy has determined that ‘‘a com-bination of tax incentives and research, de-velopment, demonstration, and deployment

A
SSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 8 Whereas, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are the foundation of the income and health security of older Americans, younger Americans with permanent and se-vere disabilities, and American families, whose economic circumstances preclude them from purchasing health insurance in the private market; and Whereas, Social Security is our nation’s most important source of retirement in-come, providing more than half the income of two-thirds of senior beneficiaries and vir-tually all the income of one-third of them; its most important source of disability in-surance; and its most important life insur-ance program; and Whereas, Social Security and Medicare are the foundations of income and health secu-rity for older Californians and those with se-vere work disabilities, providing monthly cash benefits and health insurance to over 5.5 million residents, including almost 4 mil-lion retired workers and over 700,000 disabled workers; and Whereas, Social Security is the single most important source of life insurance for Cali-fornia’s children, which currently provides a virtually guaranteed income to over 350,000 children throughout our state; and Whereas, Social Security prevents more than 1.9 million Californians from living in poverty; and Whereas, Social Security is even more im-portant to rural Californians, one in 4 of whom received benefits in 2014, than to met-ropolitan Californians, one in 7 of whom re-ceived benefits; and Whereas, Social Security benefits annually contribute over $80 billion to our state’s economy; and Whereas, Social Security provides benefits to over 9 million veterans nationwide, which is about 4 out of every 10 veterans; and Whereas, Our nation is facing a retirement income crisis as the result of the decline of traditional pensions, the failure of 401(k) bal-ances, and the stagnation or even decline in many areas of home equity and earnings, all of which have caused many workers to fear that they will never be able to retire and maintain their standard of living; and Whereas, 47 percent of elderly Californians are struggling just to make ends meet and more than half of working Californians will not have saved enough to be able to main-tain their standard of living in retirement; and Whereas, Improving Social Security bene-fits is a solution to the retirement crisis; as well as to other serious problems such as ris-ing income and wealth inequality; and Whereas, Social Security’s funding is inde-pendent of that of the rest of the federal gov-ernment, and has never contributed to, and by law can never contribute to, the federal deficit; and Whereas, Social Security in fact had a sur-plus of $2.8 trillion at the end of 2015 that is expected to grow to $2.9 trillion by 2020; and Whereas, Social Security has sufficient re-sources to meet all its obligations through 2034 and has dedicated revenues that would meet three-quarters of promised benefits thereafter; and Whereas, Social Security’s funding short-fall after 2034 is modest: about half the cost of the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003; and Whereas, There are many policy options available to Congress to close Social Secu-rity’s long-term funding gap and to improve its benefits, including eliminating or in-creasing the cap on earnings subject to the payroll tax, or gradually increasing the con-tribution rate from 6.2 percent to 7.2 percent, or subjecting investment income to Social Security contributions, or treating contribu-tions to all salary reduction plans like 401(k) plans as covered earnings for Social Secu-rity, or by dedicating revenues from progres-sive taxes like the estate tax or a financial transactions tax to pay part of the future cost of Social Security; and Whereas, According to a multigeneration study conducted by the National Academy of Social Insurance, 77 percent of Americans (69 percent of Republicans, 84 percent of Demo-crats, and 76 percent of Independents) agree that it is critical to preserve Social Security for future generations even if it means in-creasing taxes paid by working Americans, and there is even greater multipartisan sup-port (71 percent of Republicans, 92 percent of Democrats, and 84 percent of Independents) for preserving it by increasing taxes paid by wealthier Americans; and Whereas, Medicare has provided health care in retirement since 1965 and in dis-ability since 1972 to several generations of American workers; and Whereas, Medicare now covers over 5.6 mil-lion Californians, providing over $50 billion in benefits to California’s senior and disabled beneficiaries in 2009 (22 percent of all health spending in the state); and Whereas, Medicare insures these people, who represent the part of our population with the highest health care costs, at a frac-tion of the administrative costs of private health care plans; and Whereas, Medicare has controlled its costs of care better than private insurance plans; and Whereas, Other nations, which essentially have Medicare for all of their citizens, are able to provide high-quality health care at a fraction of the cost and with better health care outcomes; and Whereas, Current proposals in Congress to radically reduce Medicare to a ‘‘premium support’’ or ‘‘voucher’’ program and to fur-ther privatize the system would result in in-creased health care insecurity and costs for seniors and disabled beneficiaries and reduce the ability of our government to contain our nation’s overall health care expenditures, which currently equal 17.8 percent of our gross domestic product (GDP), by far the highest relative cost of any industrialized nation (the euro area’s costs are about 8 per-cent); and Whereas, Medicaid is our nation’s most im-portant source of long-term care, as well as vital insurance for our most vulnerable sen-iors, children, and people with disabilities, providing health coverage to over 74 million people; and Whereas, Medicaid provides health cov-erage to over 12 million Californians whose economic circumstances preclude them from participating in the private health care in-surance system, yet who need and deserve medical treatment as much as any American in better economic circumstances; and Whereas, Current Congressional proposals to limit federal Medicaid funding through the use of block grants to the states threaten to severely limit Medicaid’s ability to pro-vide adequate health care coverage to the most vulnerable among us; and Whereas, Our Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid systems are fundamental to protecting against risks to which all Califor-nians are subject; and Whereas, Our Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid systems give expression to widely held values, including caring for our families, our neighbors, and ourselves, per-sonal responsibility, hard work, and personal dignity; now, therefore, be it Resolved by the Assembly and the Senate of the State of California, jointly, That the Legis-lature opposes cuts to and proposals to pri-vatize Social Security, Medicare, and Med-icaid and calls on our state’s Representatives in Congress to vote against cuts and pro-posals to privatize and to support legislation to improve and expand these systems to strengthen their protections; and be it fur-ther Resolved, That the Legislature calls on the President of the United States to honor his campaign promise not to cut these programs, to veto any legislation to do so, and to work with Congress to expand and improve these programs; and be it further Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the As-sembly transmit copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, and to each Senator and Rep-resentative from California in the Congress of the United States.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATES5108 September 11, 2017 
Whereas, Each year, Texas sends about 36 percent of the state’s total exports to Mex-ico, and in 2015, exports to Mexico totaled nearly $92.5 million; goods exported to Mex-ico include computer and electronic prod-ucts, petroleum and coal products, chemi-cals, machinery, and transportation equip-ment, all of which are produced by industries that supply hundreds of thousands of jobs to the Lone Star State; and Whereas, Since the ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994, the export of U.S. goods to Mexico has risen 325 percent, while imports into the United States from Mexico have increased 458 percent; in 2012, Americans spent $277.5 billion for goods from Mexico, and Mexico is America’s third-largest supplier of oil, after Canada and Saudi Arabia; additionally, near-ly half of the tomatoes and two-thirds of the mangoes consumed in the United States come from Mexico; and Whereas, The importance of this trade to Texas border cities, counties, and businesses is very significant, and disruption to inter-national commerce would be economically damaging; and Whereas, Mexico is the largest trading partner of Texas and the third-largest of the United States, and it is imperative that our federal government take proactive steps to strengthen ties with Mexico and build bridges of economic opportunity that will benefit Texas and the entire nation: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representa-tives of the 85th Texas Legislature hereby urge the United states Congress to recognize the importance of trade between Texas and Mexico and foster international commerce; and, be it further Resolved, That the chief clerk of the house forward official copies of this resolution to the president of the United States, to the president of the Senate and the speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States Congress, and to all the members of the Texas delegation to Congress with the request that this resolution be entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial to the Congress of the United States of America.

OUSE RESOLUTION 281 Whereas, the United States has long sup-ported a negotiated settlement leading to a sustainable two-state solution with the democratic, Jewish state of Israel and a de-militarized, democratic Palestinian state living side-by-side in peace and security, and Whereas, since 1993, the United States has facilitated direct, bilateral negotiations be-tween both parties toward achieving a two- state solution and ending all outstanding claims, and Whereas, it is the long-standing policy of the United States that a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will only come through direct, bilateral negotiations between the two parties, and Whereas, it was the long-standing position of the United States to oppose and, if nec-essary, veto United Nations Security Council resolutions dictating additional binding pa-rameters on the peace process, and Whereas, it was also the long-standing po-sition of the United States to oppose and, if necessary, veto one-sided or anti-Israel United Nations Security Council resolutions, and Whereas, the United States has stood in the minority internationally over successive administrations in defending Israel in inter-national forums, including vetoing one-sided resolutions in 1995, 1997, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, and 2011 before the United Nations Se-curity Council, and Whereas, the United States recently signed a new memorandum of understanding with the Israeli government regarding security assistance, consistent with long-standing support for Israel among successive adminis-trations and Congresses and representing an important United States commitment to-ward Israel’s qualitative military edge, and Whereas, on November 29, 2016, the United States House of Representatives unani-mously passed House Concurrent Resolution 165, expressing and reaffirming long-standing United States policy in support of a direct, bilaterally negotiated settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and in opposition to United Nations Security Council resolu-tions that impose a solution to the conflict, and Whereas, on December 23, 2016, the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations disregarded House Concur-rent Resolution 165 and departed from long- standing United States policy by abstaining and permitting United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 to be adopted under Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter, and Whereas, the United States’ abstention on United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 contradicts the Oslo Accords and its as-sociated process that is predicated on resolv-ing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict between the parties through direct, bilateral negotia-tions, and Whereas, United States Security Council Resolution 2334 claims that ‘‘the establish-ment by Israel of settlements in the Pales-tinian territory occupied since 1967, includ-ing East Jerusalem, has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under inter-national law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-State solution and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace,’’ and Whereas, by referring to the ‘‘4 June 1967 lines’’ as the basis for negotiations, United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 ef-fectively states that the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem and the Western Wall, Judaism’s holiest site, are ‘‘occupied territory,’’ thereby equating these sites with outposts in the West Bank that the Israeli government has deemed illegal, and Whereas, passage of United Nations Secu-rity Council Resolution 2334 effectively le-gitimizes efforts by the Palestinian Author-ity to impose its own solution through inter-national organizations and unjustified boy-cotts or divestment campaigns against Israel by calling ‘‘upon all States, bearing in mind paragraph 1 of this resolution, to distin-guish, in their relevant dealings, between the territory of the State of Israel and the terri-tories occupied since 1967:’’ and will require the United States and Israel to take effective action to counteract the resolution’s poten-tial harmful impacts, and Whereas, United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 did not directly call upon Palestinian leadership to fulfill their obliga-tions toward negotiations or mention that part of the eventual Palestinian state is cur-rently controlled by Hamas, a designated terrorist organization, and Whereas, United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 sought to impose or unduly influence solutions to final-status issues and is biased against Israel: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of Florida, That the Florida House of Representatives finds: (1) The passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 undermined the long-standing position of the United States to oppose and veto United Nations Security Council resolutions that seek to impose solu-tions to final-status issues or are one-sided and anti-Israel, reversing decades of bipar-tisan agreement. (2) The passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 undermines the pros-pect of Israelis and Palestinians resuming productive, direct, bilateral negotiations. (3) The passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 contributes to the politically motivated acts of boycotting, di-vesting from, and sanctioning Israel and rep-resents a concerted effort to extract conces-sions from Israel outside of direct, bilateral negotiations between the Israelis and Pal-estinians, which must be actively rejected. (4) Any future measures taken by any or-ganization, including the United Nations Se-curity Council, to impose an agreement or parameters for an agreement will set back the peace process, harm the security of Israel, contradict the enduring bipartisan consensus on strengthening the United States-Israel relationship, and weaken sup-port for such organizations. (5) A durable and sustainable peace agree-ment between Israel and the Palestinians is only possible with direct, bilateral negotia-tions between the parties resulting in a Jew-ish, democratic state living next to a demili-tarized Palestinian state in peace and secu-rity. (6) The United States government should work to facilitate serious, direct, uncondi-tional negotiations between the parties to-ward a sustainable peace agreement.

Be it further Resolved That copies of this resolution be presented to the President of the United States, the President and Secretary of the United States Senate, the Speaker and Clerk of the United States House of Representa-tives, and the Israeli Embassy in Wash-ington, D.C. for transmission to the proper authorities of the State of Israel as a tan-gible token of the sentiments expressed here-in.

POM–97. A resolution adopted by the Gen-eral Assembly of the State of New Jersey condemning the United States Executive Order concerning immigration and the firing of the Acting Attorney General, and sup-porting legal action by other states against the immigration ban; to the Committee on the Judiciary. A
SSEMBLY RESOLUTION NO. 138 Whereas, President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order on January 27, 2017 selec-tively banning entry of immigrants and non-immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days; suspending ref-ugee admission for 120 days; and barring all Syrian refugees from entering the United States indefinitely; and Whereas, the ban reportedly has resulted in individuals with legal resident status and valid visas being denied entry into the United States, many of whom have been trapped overseas and separated from their families; and Whereas, those reportedly denied entry in-clude children, students and professors of United States institutions of higher edu-cation, employees of United States corpora-tions, and Iraqis who have worked with the United States military against militant ex-tremist groups in their own country; and Whereas, the states of Washington and Minnesota have challenged the ban in federal court on the grounds that it violates the equal protection, establishment, and due process clauses of the United States Con-stitution and the federal Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965; and Whereas, Judge Robart of the Federal Dis-trict Court in Seattle, Washington issued a temporary nationwide restraining order halting the President’s Executive Order; and Whereas, President Trump’s reaction was to immediately ridicule the Judge referring to him as a ‘‘so-called Judge’’; and Whereas, the President’s action disrespects the separation of powers which forms the basis of our government; and Whereas, more than 15 Attorneys General have filed an amicus brief supporting the court’s temporary stay against the Execu-tive Order; and Whereas, nearly 100 United States corpora-tions have filed an amicus brief opposing the President’s immigration ban, arguing that American workers and the economy will suf-fer; and Whereas, the President of the United States fired the Acting Attorney General of the United States for refusing to defend the Executive Order, as she was not convinced the Executive Order was lawful, and as such, not consistent with her responsibility to up-hold the laws of the United States; and Whereas, firing the Acting Attorney Gen-eral for upholding her oath of office sends a negative message to top-level federal Execu-tive Branch employees, likely having a chilling effect on their willingness to speak truth to power and uphold their responsibil-ities; and Whereas, the immigration ban is arbi-trarily directed at those adhering to one spe-cific religion, violating one of the United States Constitution’s most fundamental te-nets, the freedom of religion; and Whereas, the United States has always been a nation that welcomes and protects those seeking to practice their religious be-liefs without fear of government interference or persecution; and Whereas, the United States is a nation of immigrants, built by those seeking a better life for themselves, their families, and gen-erations to follow; and Whereas, the State of New Jersey, home to Ellis Island, celebrates the diversity of our residents and takes pride in the contribu-tions made to our great State by immi-grants, past and present, who came to our shores ‘‘yearning to breathe free’’; and Whereas, a brief has been filed by former Central Intelligence Agency and Department of State officials countering the President’s national security arguments, claiming the ban ‘‘could do long-term damage to our na-tional security and foreign policy interests, endangering U.S. troops in the field and dis-rupting counterterrorism and national secu-rity partnerships. It will aid ISIL’s propa-ganda effort and serve its recruitment mes-sage by feeding into the narrative that the United States is at war with Islam. It will hinder relationships with the very commu-nities that law enforcement professionals need to address the threat’’; and Whereas, approximately 900 United States Department of State diplomats have signed a dissent memo opposing the President’s ban as it ‘‘stands in opposition to the core Amer-ican and constitutional values that we, as federal employees, took an oath to uphold’’; and Whereas, the memo cautions that the ban ‘‘will immediately sour relations’’ with gov-ernments that are ‘‘important allies and partners in the fight against terrorism, re-gionally and globally’’; and Whereas, in addition to the ban being ill- conceived and mean-spirited, the processes associated with the ban were mismanaged, including the reported failure to allow for legal review by the Department of Homeland Security; and Whereas, the mismanagement extended to the implementation of the ban which re-sulted, in part, in individuals being detained in airports across the country and, despite an order to do so by a New York District Judge, the federal government has yet to produce a list of these individuals; now, therefore, be it Resolved, By the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1. This House condemns the Executive Order signed by President Trump suspending immigration for 90 days from seven Muslim- majority countries; suspending all refugee admissions into the United States for 120 days; and indefinitely barring all Syrian ref-ugees from entering the United States. 2. This House condemns the firing of the Acting Attorney General for refusing to en-force the ban which she deemed unlawful. 3. This House extends its support to the states of Washington and Minnesota in their legal fight against the President’s immigra-tion ban. 4. This House urges the New Jersey Attor-ney General to join his fellow Attorneys General in their amicus brief supporting a federal district court’s stay of the ban. 5. Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the General Assembly to the President and Vice President of the United States, the Majority and Minority Leader of the United States Senate, the Speaker and Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives, every member of Con-gress elected from New Jersey, and the New Jersey Attorney General. POM–98. A resolution adopted by the Sen-ate of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania urging the United States Congress to reau-thorize the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment to prevent the United States Department of Justice from spending funds to interfere with the implementation of state medical mari-juana laws; to the Committee on the Judici-ary. S
ENATE RESOLUTION NO. 36 Whereas, The Rohrabacher-Farr amend-ment prevents the United States Department of Justice from spending funds to interfere with the implementation of state medical marijuana laws; and Whereas, The Rohrabacher-Farr amend-ment does not change the status of mari-juana with respect to Federal law; and Whereas, The Rohrabacher-Farr amend-ment states, ‘‘None of the funds made avail-able in this Act to the Department of Justice may be used, with respect to any of the States of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Cali-fornia, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Ken-tucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massa-chusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wis-consin, or with respect to either the District of Columbia as Guam, to prevent any of them from implementing their own laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana’’; and Whereas, On December 16, 2014, the Rohr-abacher-Farr amendment was initially signed into Federal law as part of an omni-bus spending bill; and Whereas, On December 18, 2015, the Rohr-abacher-Farr amendment was reauthorized as part of the fiscal year 2016 Federal omni-bus appropriations bill; and Whereas, In September 2016, the Rohr-abacher-Farr amendment was reauthorized again as a part of a short-term spending bill; and Whereas, The Rohrabacher-Farr amend-ment must be reauthorized each fiscal year in order to remain in effect; and Whereas, The Rohrabacher-Farr amend-ment expires on April 28, 2017; therefore be it Resolved, That the Senate of the Common-wealth of Pennsylvania urge the Congress of the United States to reauthorize the Rohr-abacher-Farr amendment to prevent the United States Department of Justice from spending funds to interfere with the imple-mentation of state medical marijuana laws; and be it further Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the President of the United States, the presiding officers of each house of Con-gress and to each member of Congress from Pennsylvania.

POM–101. A resolution adopted by the House of Representatives of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States Congress to take such actions as are nec-essary to investigate the current condition of economic development in the State of Louisiana concerning the Revitalizing Auto Communities Environmental Response Trust’s fulfillment of fiduciary duties re-garding the former General Motors Shreve-port plant and operations; to the Committee on the Judiciary. A R
ESOLUTION  To memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions as are necessary to in-vestigate the current condition of economic development in the state of Louisiana con-cerning the Revitalizing Auto Communities Environmental Response Trust’s (hereinafter ‘‘RACER Trust’’) fulfillment of fiduciary du-ties regarding the former General Motors Shreveport plant (hereinafter ‘‘GM-Shreve-port plant’’) and operations. Whereas, perpetual declining sales and em-ployment loss led to the 2009 bankruptcy of the General Motors Corporation, and by 2012, a complete cessation of automobile manufac-turing at the former GM-Shreveport plant, which for more than thirty years was a gen-erator of jobs and economic opportunity in the state of Louisiana; and Whereas, the bankruptcy of General Mo-tors was not an ordinary business bank-ruptcy; rather, it was orderly and structured in a way to facilitate General Motors’ ability to be absolved of certain environmental and tax liabilities; and Whereas, this included a cash infusion from the federal government to the benefit of General Motors, and General Motors’ con-sideration for the properties left behind to be leveraged in the public’s general and equi-table interests, with such interests defined and directed toward the replacement of lost jobs; and Whereas, according to a Report to Congres-sional Committees issued by the United States Government Accountability Office, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) ‘‘provided unprecedented support to two of the nation’s three largest auto manufactur-ers—General Motors and Chrysler—after de-teriorating economic conditions resulted in a dramatic decline in auto sales and signifi-cant financial losses to these companies’’; and Whereas, ‘‘through the Automotive Indus-try Financing Program (AIFP) under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), Treasury committed $62 billion to help GM and Chrysler continue operating while re-structuring into more viable companies’’; and Whereas, the website of the RACER Trust explains that after the bankruptcy of Gen-eral Motors, ‘‘the RACER Trust was created in March 2011 by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court’’ and equipped with ‘‘nearly $500 mil-lion...received at the time of the Trust’s es-tablishment’’ to ‘‘clean up and position for redevelopment the properties and other fa-cilities owned by the former General Motors Corporation’’; and Whereas, such properties and facilities to be included for clean up and revitalization necessarily include the former GM-Shreve-port plant; and Whereas, during February 2013, the RACER Trust and Elio Motors entered into a Pur-chase and Sale Agreement whereby Elio Mo-tors was expected to acquire from the RACER Trust all of the property, both mov-able and immovable property, relative to the former GM-Shreveport plant; however, Elio Motors purchased only the movable property and as such, entered into a Security Agree-ment with the RACER Trust in the amount of twenty-three million dollars to acquire the movable property; and Whereas, circumstances changed regarding the sale of all of the former GM-Shreveport plant to Elio Motors; instead, the immovable property of the plant was purchased by the Caddo Parish Industrial Development Board; and Whereas, at the request of the Caddo Par-ish Industrial Development Board, a parent company known as Industrial Realty Group first purchased the immovable property of the former GM-Shreveport plant and imme-diately resold this same property to the Caddo Parish Industrial Development Board; and Whereas, the Caddo Parish Industrial De-velopment Board then leased the immovable property back to Industrial Realty Group; and Whereas, as the lessee and property man-ager of the former GM-Shreveport plant, In-dustrial Realty Group next subleased a por-tion of the plant to Elio Motors; and Whereas, Elio Motors assumed the plant as a sublessee during the latter part of 2013 and was expected to manufacture automobiles, stimulate economic growth, and create ap-proximately one thousand five hundred jobs by the end of 2015; and Whereas, since 2013 and currently, Elio Mo-tors is not engaged in automobile manufac-turing at the former GM-Shreveport plant, and as a result, related economic develop-ment and stimulated growth in this state have not materialized as projected and de-sired; and Whereas, with the present and future state of the former GM-Shreveport plant subject to the direction and actions of Industrial Re-alty Group and Elio Motors, the House Com-mittee on Commerce was interested to hear the testimony of certain stakeholders to identify and expound upon the cir-cumstances, challenges, and barriers sur-rounding automobile manufacturing and the anticipated accompanying job growth; and Whereas, pursuant to House Resolution No. 37 of the 2016 Second Extraordinary Session, the House Committee on Commerce met in Shreveport, Louisiana, on October 26, 2016, to do all of the following: (1) Study the state of the automotive man-ufacturing industry in the state of Louisiana since the onset of the most recent worldwide economic turndown that began in 2008. (2) Investigate and report on the activities of the RACER Trust in the state of Lou-isiana.

(3) Tour and assess the current condition and circumstances of any Louisiana based properties either currently or previously under the control and supervision of the RACER Trust in the state of Louisiana. (4) Take testimony from local, regional, and state officials and economic develop-ment stakeholders regarding barriers and ob-stacles impacting the ability to effectively market facilities either currently or pre-viously under the control of the RACER Trust; and Whereas, though representatives were present to testify, the representatives were not parties to nor directly privy to the proc-ess of negotiations between the RACER Trust, Industrial Realty Group, the Depart-ment of Economic Development, the Caddo Parish Commission, and the Caddo Parish In-dustrial Development Board; and Whereas, the RACER Trust’s commitment of the former GM-Shreveport plant to Indus-trial Realty Group and Elio Motors is a mat-ter of vital concern regarding the economic development in this state, not solely due to the lack of automobile manufacturing on be-half of Elio Motors, but because prior to this divestment, in a letter dated November 14, 2013, the Department of Economic Develop-ment and the North Louisiana Economic Partnership expressed concern to the RACER Trust regarding the transaction; and Whereas, despite the value of the assets en-compassed within the former GM-Shreveport plant, the RACER Trust is believed to have provided the Caddo Parish Commission with only the following two options in consider-ation for the eventual fate of the former GM- Shreveport plant: (1) Committal of the former GM-Shreve-port plant to Industrial Realty Group. (2) Complete demolition of the plant; and Whereas, it is a matter of state interest and concern that the prospect of the former GM-Shreveport plant’s demise may have ac-tually been a false threat used as a catalyst to urge the Caddo Parish Commission and other local and state economic development officials to support and commit the former GM-Shreveport plant into the contractual care of Industrial Realty Group and Elio Mo-tors; and Whereas, the assets of the former GM- Shreveport plant possess great potential to be a source of real opportunity for economic growth and job creation in Louisiana, but al-though publicly owned, no provisions or mechanisms for federal or local oversight are in place to rectify this agreement made in furtherance of the state’s economic develop-ment that has not materialized to provide an economic benefit to this state; and Whereas, in light of the dire circumstances surrounding the former GM-Shreveport plant, the state is compelled, and requests the United States Congress in its constitu-tional power, to investigate the process of negotiations which resulted in Industrial Re-alty Group’s and Elio Motors’ attainment of the former GM-Shreveport plant, per the rec-ommendation of the federally created RACER Trust: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representa-tives of the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby memorialize the United States Con-gress to take such actions as are necessary to investigate the current condition of eco-nomic development in the state of Louisiana, relative to the RACER Trust’s fulfillment of fiduciary duties concerning the former GM- Shreveport plant and operations; and be it further Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States of America and to each member of the Louisiana con-gressional delegation.

OINT RESOLUTION NO. 2 Whereas, The Constitution of the United States has been, since its creation in 1787, the bulwark of American liberty and strength. It was the first written national Charter to clearly set forth the respective duties and powers of the Chief Executive, the Legislature, and the Judiciary, and is the basis of America’s checks and balances sys-tem of government, assuring the rule of the majority while protecting the rights of the minority. It provides for the peaceful resolu-tion of our basic political disputes and al-lows for an orderly succession of political leaders without bloodshed or revolution; and Whereas, Since its ratification, the Con-stitution has been amended 27 times, each time by the proposal of an amendment by the Congress, often on initial petition by the states and always with subsequent ratifica-tion by the requisite number of state legisla-tures. Despite wrenching debate, political turmoil, and many grave political and eco-nomic problems—including the Great De-pression—our nation has not had another Constitutional Convention since 1787; and Whereas, The first Convention was called to make revisions to the Articles of Confed-eration and decided instead to discard that governmental system altogether and create an entirely new and extremely different one. In recent years, we have heard such diverse proposals as the elimination of portions of the Bill of Rights or granting the President the power to dissolve Congress; and Whereas, Although historical records maintained by the State and the Library of Congress are incomplete and in some in-stances unclear as to the final disposition of legislation proposed by the General Assem-bly to initiate a call to Congress for a Con-stitutional Convention, it is reported that the Maryland General Assembly has passed several such calls for a Constitutional Con-vention since the 1930s These calls include: (1) House Resolution (1939) (unconfirmed) calling for limitations on the federal taxing power; (2) House Joint Resolution 40 (1964) calling for standards concerning the size and boundaries of congressional districts; (3) Senate Joint Resolution 1 (1965) calling for legislative autonomy concerning the appor-tionment of State legislative bodies; (4) Sen-ate Resolution 47 (1973) (unconfirmed), a me-morial from the Senate of Maryland calling for the allowance of school prayer in public schools; and (5) Senate Joint Resolution 4 (1975) calling for a balanced federal budget. It is generally believed that these calls never expire, and current generations are now bound by decisions made in a different time and culture. The need to advance these var-ious policy reforms should be debated anew, and not bind future generations without any consideration; now, therefore, be it Resolved, By the General Assembly of Maryland, That this body does hereby re-scind, repeal, cancel, void, nullify, and super-sede any and all prior applications by the General Assembly to the Congress of the United States of America to call a conven-tion to propose amendments to the Constitu-tion of the United States of America, wheth-er or not the calls are confirmed by the his-torical records maintained by the State or the Library of Congress, pursuant to the terms of Article V thereof, regardless of when and regardless of whether such applica-tions were for a more limited convention to propose one or more amendments regarding one or more specific subjects and purposes or for a general convention to propose an un-limited number of amendments upon an un-limited number of subjects; and be it further Resolved, That the General Assembly urges the legislatures of each and every state which has applied to Congress to call a con-vention for either a general or limited Con-stitutional Convention to repeal and with-draw such applications; and be it further Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be forwarded by the Department of Legislative Services to the Honorable Lawrence J.

The need to advance these var-ious policy reforms should be debated anew, and not bind future generations without any consideration; now, therefore, be it Resolved by the General Assembly of Mary-land, That this body does hereby rescind, re-peal, cancel, void, nullify, and supersede any and all prior applications by the General As-sembly to the Congress of the United States of America to call a convention to propose amendments to the Constitution of the United States of America, whether or not the calls are confirmed by the historical records maintained by the State or the Li-brary of Congress, pursuant to the terms of Article V thereof, regardless of when and re-gardless of whether such applications were for a more limited convention to propose one or more amendments regarding one or more specific subjects and purposes or for a gen-eral convention to propose an unlimited number of amendments upon an unlimited number of subjects; and be it further Resolved, That the General Assembly urges the legislatures of each and every state which has applied to Congress to call a con-vention for either a general or limited Con-stitutional Convention to repeal and with-draw such applications; and be it further Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be forwarded by the Department of Legislative Services to the Honorable Lawrence J. Hogan, Jr., Governor of Maryland; the Hon-orable Thomas V. Mike Miller, Jr., President of the Senate of Maryland; and the Honor-able Michael E. Busch, Speaker of the House of Delegates; and be it further Resolved, That certified copies of this Joint Resolution be sent by the Secretary of State to: (1) the Honorable Michael R.

POM–104. A resolution adopted by the Gen-eral Assembly of the State of New Jersey op-posing action by the President of the United States to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy, to the Committee on the Judiciary. A
SSEMBLY RESOLUTION NO. 210 Whereas, New Jersey has long been a wel-coming home for immigrants from around the world and appreciates the valuable con-tributions immigrants make to our State and our nation; and Whereas, New Jersey’s immigrant popu-lation includes undocumented immigrants who have come to the United States in pur-suit of the American dream and to build a better life for themselves and their families, and Whereas, Many of these families include children who were brought to New Jersey at a very young age and were raised and edu-cated in the State, and Whereas, In 2013, the New Jersey Legisla-ture passed Senate Bill No. 2479, informally referred to as the New Jersey Dream Act, to ensure that these children have access to af-fordable higher education by allowing them to qualify for in-State tuition rates at public institutions of higher education, and Whereas, The New Jersey Dream Act bill, in its original form, also permitted these students to apply for State student financial aid programs; and Whereas, Governor Chris Christie condi-tionally vetoed the New Jersey Dream Act based on his objections to the section of the bill that allowed undocumented students to participate in State student financial aid programs, and asked the Legislature to re-move that provision; and Whereas, The Legislature, in order to pro-vide tuition equality for these students, con-curred with the terms of Governor Christie’s conditional veto, and Whereas, Without eligibility for State stu-dent financial aid programs, many of these students need to work to afford the cost of a college education, and Whereas, As a result of Governor Christie’s conditional veto and in order to continue their pursuit of higher education, many of these students registered with the federal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, a policy implemented under President Barack Obama’s Adminis-tration. Under DACA, the federal govern-ment agreed to exercise its prosecutorial dis-cretion to defer deportation of undocu-mented immigrants brought to the United States as children and allowed these stu-dents to qualify for employment authoriza-tion in the United States, and Whereas, President Donald Trump was sworn into office on January 20, 2017 and is expected to rescind DACA, exposing these students to the threat of immediate deporta-tion, and Whereas, Such action by President Trump would punish young men and women who fol-lowed the proper course of action in reg-istering for DACA so that they could pursue their higher education, and Whereas, These students have spent their formative years in the United States and know only America as their home, pay taxes and contribute to our economy as hard- working employees, and add rich diversity to our schools through class participation and campus programs; and Whereas, Rescinding the DACA policy would deprive the State of the many con-tributions of these students: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, By the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1. This House opposes any action by Presi-dent Donald Trump to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy. 2. This House further urges Governor Chris Christie, given that his conditional veto of the New Jersey Dream Act bill led many of these students to register for DACA, to use all power within his means to urge President Trump to leave DACA intact so that these New Jersey students are not subject to im-mediate deportation to a country they have never known and so that these students may continue to work and pursue their higher education 3. Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the General Assembly to the President and Vice-President of the United States, the Governor of this State, the Ma-jority and Minority Leaders of the United States Senate, the Speaker and Minority

(2) The DNI report stated, ‘‘[The Depart-ment of Homeland Security] assesses that the types of systems Russian actors targeted or compromised were not involved in vote tallying.’’. (3) On January 10, 2017, the DNI stated, in testimony before the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate, ‘‘We can say that we did not see evidence of the Russians alter-ing vote tallies.’’. (4) On March 20, 2017, FBI Director James Comey stated, in testimony before the Per-manent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives, ‘‘We also, as a government, supplied information to all the states so they could equip themselves to make sure there was no successful effort to affect the vote and there was none, as we said earlier.’’. (5) The DNI, in coordination with the Cen-tral Intelligence Agency, the FBI, and the National Security Agency, judged that Rus-sia’s intelligence services conducted cyber operations against targets associated with the 2016 United States presidential election. (6) The DNI assessed that the Russian Gov-ernment’s campaign aimed at the United States election featured— (A) disclosures of data obtained through Russian cyber operations; (B) intrusions into United States state and local election boards; and (C) overt propaganda. (7) Russia’s use of public disclosures of Russian-collected data during the United States election was unprecedented. (8) The DNI, in coordination with the Cen-tral Intelligence Agency, the FBI, and the National Security Agency, assessed that Russia will apply lessons learned from its Putin-ordered campaign aimed at the United States presidential election to influence fu-ture elections worldwide, including against United States allies and their election proc-esses. (9) In May 2016, Germany’s domestic intel-ligence agency assessed that hackers linked to the Russian Government had targeted Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Demo-cratic Union party and German state com-puters. (10) The head of Germany’s foreign intel-ligence service, Bruno Kahl, later asserted that Germany had ‘‘evidence that cyber-at-tacks are taking place that have no other purpose than to elicit political uncertainty. The perpetrators are interested in delegitimizing the democratic process as such, regardless of who that ends of helping. We have indications that [the attacks] come from the Russian region.’’ In November 2016, German Chancellor Merkel, said, ‘‘such cyber-attacks, or hybrid conflicts as they are known in Russian doctrine, are now part of daily life and we must learn to cope with them’’. (11) On May 9, 2017, Admiral Michael Rog-ers, United States Cyber Command com-mander and Director of the National Secu-rity Agency, testified before the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate that the United States surveilled Russian hackers at-tack French computer systems as the French election approached. In his testimony, Rog-ers said, ‘‘We had talked to our French coun-terparts prior to the public announcements of the events that were publicly attributed this past weekend, and gave them a heads up, ‘Look we’re watching the Russians, we’re seeing them penetrate some of your infra-structure.’.’’. (12) In February 2017, the United Kingdom’s Defence Secretary Fallon stated that— (A) all North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries must support reform ‘‘to make NATO more agile, resilient, and better configured to operate in the contemporary environment including against hybrid and cyber-attacks’’; and (B) ‘‘NATO must defend itself as effec-tively in the cyber sphere as it does in the air, on land, and at sea.’’.

SEC. ll. REPORT ON UTILIZATION OF SMALL BUSINESSES FOR FEDERAL CON-TRACTS. 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress finds that— (1) since the passage of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (Public Law 112–25; 125 Stat. 240), many Federal agencies have started favoring longer-term Federal contracts, including multiple award contracts, over direct indi-vidual awards; (2) these multiple award contracts have grown to more than one-fifth of Federal con-tract spending, with the fastest growing multiple award contracts surpassing $100,000,000 in obligations for the first time between 2013 and 2014; (3) in fiscal year 2017, 17 of the 20 largest Federal contract opportunities are multiple award contracts; (4) while Federal agencies may choose to use any or all of the various socio-economic groups on a multiple award contract, the Small Business Administration only exam-ines socio-economic performance through the small business procurement scorecard and does not examine potential opportuni-ties by those groups; and (5) Congress and the Department of Justice have been clear that no individual socio-eco-nomic group shall be given preference over another.

SEC. lll. REPORT ON BUDGET REQUESTS FOR FUNDING FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE FOR OVERSEAS CONTIN-GENCY OPERATIONS. 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress makes the fol-lowing findings: (1) In a January 18, 2017 report issued by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) on the Department of Defense’s Over-seas Contingency Operations, the GAO found that the criteria developed in 2010 by the Of-fice of Management and Budget (OMB) in collaboration with the Department of De-fense (DoD) for determining whether items belonged in the base budget or in OCO were outdated. (2) The GAO also found that these outdated criteria did not address the full scope of ac-tivities included in DoD’s fiscal year 2017 OCO budget request. (3) According to the GAO, DoD officials agree that updated guidance is needed, but noted that OMB deferred the decision to up-date criteria until the new administration was in place in 2017 (4) The GAO also found that, without re-evaluating and revising the criteria, decision makers may be hindered in their ability to set priorities and make funding trade-offs. (5) In response to these findings, the GAO recommends that DOD, in collaboration with OMB, reevaluate and revise the criteria for determining what can be included in DOD’s OCO budget requests; and that DOD develop a complete and reliable estimate of enduring OCO costs to report in future budget re-quests. (b) REPORT .—At the same time as the sub-mittal to Congress of the budget of the President for fiscal year 2019 pursuant to sec-tion 1105 of title 31, United States Code, the Secretary of Defense shall, with the concur-rence of the Director of the Office of Man-agement and Budget, submit to the congres-sional defense committees a report setting forth the following: (1) The criteria used by the Department of Defense to determine whether funds re-quested for the Department for a fiscal year for purposes of the budget of the President for the fiscal year (as so submitted) are to be requested as funds for the Department for programs, activities, and operations for the fiscal year for overseas contingency oper-ations.

Congress makes the following findings: (1) According to the Asia-Pacific Maritime Security Strategy issued by the Department of Defense in August 2015, ‘‘Although the United States takes no position on com-peting sovereignty claims to land features in the region, all such claims must be based upon land (which in the case of islands means naturally formed areas of land that are above water at high tide), and all mari-time claims must derive from such land in accordance with international law.’’. (2) According to the annual report of the Department of Defense to Congress on the military power of the People’s Republic of China submitted in April 2016, ‘‘Throughout 2015, China continued to assert sovereignty claims over features in the East and South China Seas. In the East China Sea, China continued to use maritime law enforcement ships and aircraft to patrol near the Senkaku (Diaoyu) Islands in order to chal-lenge Japan’s claim. In the South China Sea, China paused its land reclamation effort in the Spratly Islands in late 2015 after adding more than 3,200 acres of land to the seven features it occupies in the archipelago. Al-though these artificial islands do not provide China with any additional territorial or mar-itime rights within the South China Sea, China will be able to use them as persistent civil-military bases to enhance its long-term presence in the South China Sea signifi-cantly.’’. (3) On May 30, 2015, at the Shangri-la Dia-logue of the International Institute for Stra-tegic Studies, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter stated that ‘‘with its actions in the South China Sea, China is out of step with both the international rules and norms that underscore the Asia-Pacific’s security archi-tecture, and the regional consensus that fa-vors diplomacy and opposes coercion’’. (4) On July 24, 2015, Admiral Harry Harris, Jr., noted at a forum in Colorado that each year more than $5,300,000,000,000 in global sea-based trade passes through the South China Sea. (5) On June 4, 2016, at the Shangri-la Dia-logue, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter stated: ‘‘[T]he United States will stand with regional partners to uphold core principles, like freedom of navigation and overflight and the peaceful resolution of disputes through legal means and in accordance with international law. As I affirmed here last year, and America’s Freedom of Navigation Operations in the South China Sea have demonstrated, the United States will con-tinue to fly, sail and operate wherever inter-national law allows, so that everyone in the region can do the same.’’. (6) On July 12, 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration’s Tribunal organized pursuant to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea issued its unanimous award in the arbitration instituted by Republic of the Philippines against the People’s Repub-lic of China. The Tribunal noted that its award is final and binding under that Con-vention. (7) Also according to the award, the Tri-bunal ‘‘concluded that, to the extent China had historical rights to resources in the waters of the South China Sea, such rights were extinguished to the extent they were incompatible with the exclusive economic zones provided for in the Convention. The Tribunal concluded that there was no legal basis for China to claim historic rights to re-sources within the sea areas falling within the ‘nine-dash line’.’’. (8) Also according to the award, the Tri-bunal ‘‘held that the Spratly Islands cannot generate maritime zones collectively as a unit. Having found that none of the features claimed by China was capable of generating an exclusive economic zone, the Tribunal found that it could—without delimiting a boundary—declare that certain sea areas are within the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines, because those areas are not overlapped by any possible entitlement of China.’’. (9) Also according to the award, the Tri-bunal ‘‘found that China had violated the Philippines’ sovereign rights in its exclusive economic zone by (a) interfering with Phil-ippine fishing and petroleum exploration, (b) constructing artificial islands and (c) failing to prevent Chinese fishermen from fishing in the zone. The Tribunal also held that fisher-men from the Philippines (like those from China) had traditional fishing rights at Scar-borough Shoal and that China had interfered with these rights in restricting access. The Tribunal further held that Chinese law en-forcement vessels had unlawfully created a serious risk of collision when they physically obstructed Philippine vessels.’’. (10) On July 12, 2016, the Ministry of For-eign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China issued a statement that China ‘‘de-clares that the [Tribunal] award is null and void and has no binding force. China neither accepts nor recognizes it. . . . China’s terri-torial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea shall under no circumstances be affected by those awards. China opposes and will never accept any claim or action based on those awards.’’. (11) On July 12, 2016, the Government of the People’s Republic of China issued the fifth statement in the name of that Government since 1979 that—

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S5149 September 11, 2017 
(A) stated that the People’s Republic of China has sovereignty over the 4 rocks and shoals in the South China Sea; (B) claims internal waters, territorial seas, contiguous zones, one or more exclusive eco-nomic zones, and a continental shelf based on that sovereignty claim; and (C) continues to claim historic rights in the South China Sea. (12) On July 12, 2016, Assistant Secretary of State and Department of State Spokesperson John Kirby noted that the ‘‘United States strongly supports the rule of law. We support efforts to resolve territorial and maritime disputes in the South China Sea peacefully, including through arbitration. . . . we urge all claimants to avoid provocative state-ments or actions. This decision can and should serve as a new opportunity to renew efforts to address maritime disputes peace-fully.’’. (13) On July 13, 2016, the Vice Foreign Min-ister of the People’s Republic of China, Liu Zhenmin, said that declaring an air defense identification zone in the South China Sea would depend on the threat China faces and stated that ‘‘[i]f our security is threatened, we of course have the right to set it up’’. (14) On July 18, 2016, the People’s Libera-tion Army Air Force of the People’s Republic of China stated that it had conducted a ‘‘combat air patrol’’ over the South China Sea and that it would become ‘‘regular prac-tice’’ in the future. A spokesperson stated that the People’s Liberation Army Air Force ‘‘will firmly defend national sovereignty, se-curity and maritime interests, safeguard re-gional peace and stability, and cope with various threats and challenges’’. (15) On August 2, 2016, the Supreme Peo-ple’s Court of the People’s Republic of China issued a judicial interpretation that people caught illegally fishing in Chinese waters could be jailed for up to one year. (16) In the Agreement concerning the Ryu-kyu Islands and the Daito Islands with Re-lated Arrangements, signed at Washington and Tokyo June 17, 1971 (23 UST 446), be-tween the United States and Japan (com-monly referred to as the ‘‘Okinawa Rever-sion Treaty’’), the United States agreed to apply the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security, with Agreed Minute and Exchanges of Notes (11 UST 1632), signed at Washington January 19, 1961, between the United States and Japan, to the area covered by the Oki-nawa Reversion Treaty, including the Senkaku Islands. (17) In April 2014, President Barack Obama stated, ‘‘The policy of the United States is clear—the Senkaku Islands are administered by Japan and therefore fall within the scope of Article 5 of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mu-tual Cooperation and Security. And we op-pose any unilateral attempts to undermine Japan’s administration of these islands.’’. (18) In February 2017, President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe issued a joint statement that ‘‘affirmed that Article V of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security covers the Senkaku Islands’’.

personal property located at the installation, if any, that the entity desires to be retained at the installation for reuse or redevelop-ment of the installation. (E) This paragraph shall not apply to any personal property located at an installation to be closed or realigned under this subtitle if the property— (i) is required for the operation of a unit, function, component, weapon, or weapons system at another installation; (ii) is uniquely military in character, and is likely to have no civilian use (other than use for its material content or as a source of commonly used components); (iii) is not required for the reutilization or redevelopment of the installation (as jointly determined by the Secretary and the rede-velopment authority); (iv) is stored at the installation for pur-poses of distribution (including spare parts or stock items); or (v)(I) meets known requirements of an au-thorized program of another Federal agency for which expenditures for similar property would be necessary; and (II) is the subject of a written request by the head of the agency.

(4)(A) The Secretary may transfer real property and personal property located at a military installation to be closed or re-aligned under this subtitle to the redevelop-ment authority with respect to the installa-tion for purposes of job generation on the in-stallation. (B) The transfer of property located at a military installation under subparagraph (A) may be for consideration at or below the es-timated fair market value or without consid-eration. The determination of such consider-ation may account for the economic condi-tions of the local affected community and the estimated costs to redevelop the prop-erty. The Secretary may accept, as consider-ation, a share of the revenues that the rede-velopment authority receives from third- party buyers or lessees from sales and long- term leases of the conveyed property, a por-tion of the profits obtained over time from the development of the conveyed property, consideration in kind (including goods and services), real property and improvements, or such other consideration as the Secretary considers appropriate. The transfer of prop-erty located at a military installation under subparagraph (A) may be made for consider-ation below the estimated fair market value or without consideration only if the redevel-opment authority with respect to the instal-lation— (i) agrees that the proceeds from any sale or lease of the property (or any portion thereof) received by the redevelopment au-thority during at least the first seven years after the date of the initial transfer of prop-erty under subparagraph (A) shall be used to support the economic redevelopment of, or related to, the installation; and (ii) executes the agreement for transfer of the property and accepts control of the prop-erty within a reasonable time after the date of the property disposal record of decision or finding of no significant impact under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.). (C) For purposes of subparagraph (B)(i), the use of proceeds from a sale or lease described in such subparagraph to pay for, or offset the costs of, public investment on or related to the installation for any of the following pur-poses shall be considered a use to support the economic redevelopment of, or related to, the installation: (i) Road construction. (ii) Transportation management facilities. (iii) Storm and sanitary sewer construc-tion. (iv) Police and fire protection facilities and other public facilities. (v) Utility construction. (vi) Building rehabilitation. (vii) Historic property preservation. (viii) Pollution prevention equipment or facilities. (ix) Demolition. (x) Disposal of hazardous materials gen-erated by demolition. (xi) Landscaping, grading, and other site or public improvements. (xii) Planning for or the marketing of the development and reuse of the installation. (xiii) Adaptation for and mitigation of nat-ural disasters. (D) The Secretary may recoup from a rede-velopment authority such portion of the pro-ceeds from a sale or lease described in sub-paragraph (B) as the Secretary determines appropriate if the redevelopment authority does not use the proceeds to support eco-nomic redevelopment of, or related to, the installation for the period specified in sub-paragraph (B). (E)(i) The Secretary may transfer real property at an installation approved for clo-sure or realignment under this subtitle (in-cluding property at an installation approved for realignment which will be retained by the Department of Defense or another Fed-eral agency after realignment) to the rede-velopment authority for the installation if the redevelopment authority agrees to lease, directly upon transfer, one or more portions of the property transferred under this sub-paragraph to the Secretary or to the head of another Federal agency. Subparagraph (B) shall apply to a transfer under this subpara-graph. (ii) A lease under clause (i) shall be for a term not to exceed 50 years, but may provide for options for renewal or extension of the term by the agency concerned. (iii) A lease under clause (i) may not re-quire rental payments by the United States.

Exercise of the authority provided by this clause shall be made in consultation with the redevelop-ment authority concerned. (v) Notwithstanding clause (iii), if a lease under clause (i) involves a substantial por-tion of the installation, the agency con-cerned may obtain facility services for the leased property and common area mainte-nance from the redevelopment authority or the redevelopment authority’s assignee as a provision of the lease. The facility services and common area maintenance shall be pro-vided at a rate no higher than the rate charged to non-Federal tenants of the trans-ferred property. Facility services and com-mon area maintenance covered by the lease shall not include— (I) municipal services that a State or local government is required by law to provide to all landowners in its jurisdiction without di-rect charge; or (II) firefighting or security-guard func-tions. (F) The transfer of personal property under subparagraph (A) shall not be subject to the provisions of subchapters II and III of chap-ter 5 of title 40, United States Code, if the Secretary determines that the transfer of such property is necessary for the effective implementation of a redevelopment plan with respect to the installation at which such property is located. (G) The provisions of section 120(h) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9620(h)) shall apply to any transfer of real property under this paragraph. (H) The Secretary may require any addi-tional terms and conditions in connection with a transfer under this paragraph as the Secretary considers appropriate to protect the interests of the United States. (5)(A) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), the Secretary shall take such ac-tions as the Secretary determines necessary to ensure that final determinations under paragraph (1) regarding whether another Federal agency has identified a use for any portion of a military installation to be closed or realigned under this subtitle, or will accept transfer of any portion of such installation, are made not later than 180 days after the date of approval of closure or realignment of that installation. (B) The Secretary may, in consultation with the redevelopment authority with re-spect to an installation, postpone making the final determinations referred to in sub-paragraph (A) with respect to the installa-tion for such period as the Secretary deter-mines appropriate if the Secretary deter-mines that such postponement is in the best interests of the communities affected by the closure or realignment of the installation. (C)(i) Before acquiring non-Federal real property as the location for a new or replace-ment Federal facility of any type, the head of the Federal agency acquiring the property shall consult with the Secretary regarding the feasibility and cost advantages of using Federal property or facilities at a military installation closed or realigned or to be closed or realigned under this subtitle as the location for the new or replacement facility. In considering the availability and suit-ability of a specific military installation, the Secretary and the head of the Federal agen-cy involved shall obtain the concurrence of the redevelopment authority with respect to the installation and comply with the rede-velopment plan for the installation. (ii) Not later than 30 days after acquiring non-Federal real property as the location for a new or replacement Federal facility, the head of the Federal agency acquiring the property shall submit to Congress a report containing the results of the consultation under clause (i) and the reasons why mili-tary installations referred to in such clause that are located within the area to be served by the new or replacement Federal facility or within a 200-mile radius of the new or re-placement facility, whichever area is great-er, were considered to be unsuitable or un-available for the site of the new or replace-ment facility. (6)(A) The disposal of buildings and prop-erty located at installations approved for closure or realignment under this subtitle shall be carried out in accordance with this paragraph. (B)(i) Not later than the date on which the Secretary of Defense completes the final de-terminations referred to in paragraph (5) re-lating to the use or transferability of any portion of an installation covered by this paragraph, the Secretary shall— (I) identify the buildings and property at the installation for which the Department of Defense has a use, for which another Federal agency has identified a use, or of which an-other Federal agency will accept a transfer; (II) take such actions as are necessary to identify any building or property at the in-stallation not identified under subclause (I) that is excess property or surplus property; (III) submit to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and to the redevel-opment authority for the installation (or the

election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow—the Russians have used similar tac-tics and techniques across Europe and Eur-asia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Rus-sia’s senior-most officials could have author-ized these activities’’. (2) On January 6, 2017, a unanimous report from the United States intelligence commu-nity, including the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Of-fice of the Director of National Intelligence, assessed that Russia President Putin ‘‘or-dered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election’’ and that ‘‘Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process’’. (3) The Russian Federation has conducted similar influence campaigns in European countries designed to undermine the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the European Union (EU), and other democratic institutions of free societies, and violated the sovereignty and territorial integrity of European countries such as Ukraine and Georgia through the use of force. (4) Aggressive operations by the Russian Federation and its proxies to influence, interfere with and undermine the core insti-tutions and processes of democratic and free societies, including elections and inde-pendent media, pose a threat to the national security of the United States, to the trans-atlantic relationships, and to the multilat-eral institutions underpinning the global order, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union.

(c) S
TRATEGY REQUIRED .— (1) S
TRATEGY .—Not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to the appro-priate committees of Congress a comprehen-sive strategy to counter the threat of malign influence by the Russian Federation. (2) S
COPE OF STRATEGY .—The strategy re-quired by paragraph (1) shall include actions as follows: (A) To identify and defend against the threat of malign influence by the Russian Federation, including— (i) the use of misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda in social and traditional media; (ii) corrupt or illicit financing of political parties, think tanks, media organizations, and academic institutions; and (iii) the use of coercive economic tools, in-cluding sanctions, market access, and dif-ferential pricing, especially in the energy sector. (B) To deter, and respond when necessary, to malicious cyber activities by the Russian Federation, including through the use of of-fensive cyber capabilities consistent with the policy specified in section 1621. (C) To promote the core values and prin-ciples of the United States, enhance the transatlantic relationship, strengthen good governance and democracy among our Euro-pean allies and partners, and further integra-tion into multilateral institutions underpin-ning the global order, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Euro-pean Union. (3) E

(B) S
ECURITY MEASURES .—Actions to counter the use of force, coercion, and other hybrid warfare operations of the military, intelligence, and other security forces of the Russian Federation, including the following: (i) Actions to build the military presence and capabilities of military and security forces of the United States and European al-lies and partners to deter and respond to ag-gression by the Russian Federation. (ii) Actions to improve indications and warnings, and capabilities to identify and at-tribute responsibility for the use of force, co-ercion, or other hybrid warfare operations by the Russian Federation. (iii) Actions to support North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies and non-North Atlantic Treaty Organization partners in maintaining their sovereignty and terri-torial integrity. (C) I
NFORMATION OPERATIONS .—Actions to counter information operations of the Rus-sian Federation, including the following: (i) Actions to identify and attribute malign disinformation, active measures, propa-ganda, and deception and denial activities of the Russian Federation in the United States and Europe, through traditional and social media.

(iii) Actions to strengthen the effective-ness of and fully resource the Global Engage-ment Center to carry out its purpose speci-fied in section 1287(a)(2) of National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (22 U.S.C. 2656 note) to lead, synchronize, and coordinate efforts of the Federal Govern-ment to recognize, understand, expose, and counter propaganda and disinformation ef-forts by the Russian Federation, other for-eign governments, and non-State actors.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
(a) F INDINGS .—Congress finds the following: (1) The crime of human trafficking involves the exploitation of adults through force, fraud, or coercion, and children for such purposes as forced labor or commercial sex. (2) Reliable data on the prevalence of human trafficking in the United States is not available, but cases have been reported in all 50 States, the territories of the United States, and the District of Columbia. (3) Each year, thousands of individuals may be trafficked within the United States, accord-ing to recent estimates from victim advocates. (4) More accurate and comprehensive data on the prevalence of human trafficking is needed to properly combat this form of modern slavery in the United States. (5) Victims of human trafficking can include men, women, and children who are diverse with respect to race, ethnicity, and nationality, among other factors. (6) Since the enactment of the Trafficking Vic-tims Protection Act of 2000 (Public Law 106–386; 114 Stat. 1464), human traffickers have launched increasingly sophisticated schemes to increase the scope of their activities and the number of their victims.

HONORING THE 130TH ANNIVER-SARY OF FIRST AFRICAN METH-ODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH 
HON. JUDY CHU 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 11, 2017 Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 130th Anniversary of First African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church in Pasadena, California, for their proud history and countless contributions to our com-munity. Established in 1887, just one year after the founding of the City of Pasadena, First AME Church was organized at the home of Joseph Holmes, the first black settler in the city. The church became one of the first places where African Americans in the area could come to-gether as a community. This was not without its challenges, as the small church faced hos-tility and opposition from their neighbors, forc-ing the congregation to move frequently before finally finding a long-term home in 1913. With this stability, First AME became a mainstay in the community and a catalyst for social change in Pasadena throughout the 20th Century. As a leader in the African Amer-ican community’s fight for racial equality, First AME was instrumental in efforts to deseg-regate Pasadena public schools, integrate the city’s public workforce and main public pool, and in founding the Pasadena chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Today, First AME continues its proud tradi-tion of service to the community—hosting events to feed the hungry, house the home-less, provide job training, and collect clothing for those in need, all while offering a safe place for congregants to come together in worship. On this momentous anniversary, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating First AME Church of Pasadena and its congregants for 130 years of proud service to their congregants and community.

COMMEMORATING THE 200TH ANNI-VERSARY OF NEW PARIS, OHIO 
HON. WARREN DAVIDSON 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 11, 2017 Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I recognize and celebrate the 200th Anniversary of New Paris, Ohio. The bicenten-nial celebration is a historical benchmark for New Paris, as well as the State of Ohio. In the 1800s, pioneers from Kentucky trav-eled north in covered wagons and settled in a valley 50 miles west of Dayton, Ohio, on the border of Indiana. There, they built family homes and a local church. In 1817, founders James Fleming and Andrew Ireland named the town ‘‘New Paris’’ after the City of Paris in Bourbon County, Kentucky. Songwriter Ben-jamin R. Hanby made New Paris known throughout the entire country after he com-posed the Christmas song, ‘‘Up On the House Top’’ in 1864. The first school opened in 1818, and its first newspaper was established in 1844. By 1865, New Paris’ 650 residences were very involved in agriculture and developed cotton mills, tanneries, pork-packing plants and had a meat market. Over the past 200 years, New Paris, Ohio has developed a rich heritage and a high level of community involvement that would make its forefathers proud. I ask my colleagues in the House to join me in congratulating the citi-zens, elected officials and businesses in New Paris on their rich history, and bright future ahead. f 
HONORING THE 20TH ANNIVER-SARY OF THE STAFFORD AND FRIGO RADIO SHOW 
HON. ERIC A. ‘‘RICK’’ CRAWFORD 
OF ARKANSAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 11, 2017 Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, today I would like to honor the 20th Anniversary of Trey Stafford and Jim Frigo’s Stafford and Frigo Radio Show on KDXY 104.9 The Fox in Jonesboro, Arkansas. In 1971, Trey Stafford started his radio ca-reer at KPCA–AM in Marked Tree, Arkansas, and for the last 46 years he has dedicated his life to entertaining radio listeners exclusively in our home state. Similarly, Jim Frigo started his own radio ca-reer in 1977 at KAWW–AM in Heber Springs, and this year marks his 40th year on the air-waves exclusively in Arkansas. Back in 1997, KDXY radio station in Jonesboro changed its format to country music and became known in the community as 104.9 The Fox, and ever since the station has been a mainstay of northeast Arkansas radio. On September 15, 1997, Trey Stafford and Jim Frigo teamed up with the late Mark Ford to form the Stafford, Frigo and Ford Radio Show on KDXY 104.9 The Fox. After Mark Ford’s untimely death in November, 2004, Trey Stafford and Jim Frigo continued on with the show as Stafford and Frigo. September 15, 2017 will mark 20 years that Trey Stafford and Jim Frigo have been on the same radio show continuously, now known as Stafford and Frigo. In those 20 years, Stafford and Frigo has become the premiere talk show in Jonesboro, and for their commitment to each other, their city, and indeed our entire region, please join me in honoring their past two decades on the air. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018 SPEECH OF  
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Thursday, September 7, 2017 
The House in Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3354) making ap-propriations for the Department of the Inte-rior, environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and for other purposes: 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, thank you for this opportunity to speak in support of the Jackson Lee Amendment and to commend Chairman C
ALVERT and Ranking Member M
CCOLLUM for their leadership in shepherding this bill to the floor. Among other agencies, this legislation funds the U.S. Forest Service, the National Park System, and the Smithsonian Institution. Most Americans do not know that this bill also funds a very special program, the Na-tional Recreation and Preservation. Mr. Chair, the Jackson Lee Amendment is simple but it sends a very important message from the Congress of the United States. The Jackson Lee Amendment provides: Sec.__. None of the funds made available by this Act for the ‘‘DEPARTMENT OF INTE-RIOR—NATIONAL PARK SERVICE—NA-TIONAL RECREATION AND PRESERVA-TION’’ may be used in contravention of sec-tion 461 of title 16, United States Code. And 16 U.S. Code § 461 provides that: It is declared that it is a national policy to preserve for public use historic sites, buildings, and objects of national significance for the in-spiration and benefit of the people of the United States. This is important, especially as it relates to National Heritage Areas (NHAs). NHAs both preserve our national heritage and provide economic benefits to communities and regions through their commitment to herit-age conservation and economic development. Through public-private partnerships, NHA entities support historic preservation, natural resource conservation, recreation, heritage tourism, and educational projects. Leveraging funds and long-term support for projects, NHA partnerships generate increased economic impact for regions in which they are located. In 2012, a nationally respected consulting firm (Tripp Umbach) completed a comprehen-sive economic impact study of six NHA sites in the Northeast Region that also included an extrapolation of the economic benefit of all 49 NHA sites on the national economy. The annual economic impact was estimated to be $12.9 billion. The economic activity supports approxi-mately 148,000 jobs and generates $1.2 billion annually in Federal revenues from sources

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1194 September 11, 2017 
such as employee compensation, proprietor income, indirect business tax, households, and corporations. The study quantified the economic impacts of individual NHAs based upon a case study approach and found that the economic impact of the three National Historic Areas in Arizona, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania showed: 1. Essex National Heritage Area (MA) gen-erates $153.8 million in economic impact, sup-ports 1,832 jobs, and generates $14.3 million in tax revenue. 2. Oil Region National Heritage Area (PA) generates $21.2 million in economic impact, supports 314 jobs, and generates $1.5 million in tax revenue; and 3. Yuma Crossing National Heritage Area (AZ) $22.7 million in economic impact, sup-ports 277 jobs, and generates $1.3 million in tax revenue. Mr. Chair, as I said there are 49 NHA across the nation but, surprisingly, none in my state of Texas. We hope to rectify this in the not too distant future. Texas is the largest and second most popu-lous state in the nation and has a unique story in American history with its diverse geographic landscape, natural resources, and population. From Galveston’s port, East Texas’ farms and forestry, and the Buffalo Soldiers, Texas has a rich multi-cultured heritage and history. To honor Texas’ heritage, I will be working with my colleagues to establish the ‘‘Emanci-pation Trail National Heritage Area Corridor’’ that stretches across historically significant and landmark sites from Galveston to Houston and East Texas into Central Texas. The Emancipation Trail National Heritage Area will be a corridor focusing on and high-lighting the area’s rich history and culturally significant events, places, and natural sites, as well as roadways, businesses, residential and farm districts that unite Texas’ heritage from the first settlers to modern times. Mr. Chair, as we approach the 51st anniver-sary of the passage of the 1966 National His-toric Preservation Act, we want to preserve and unite the legacy stories of some of our state’s most revered sites. Currently underway in Houston is the revital-ization of the historic Emancipation Park, a pivotal site in the state’s social and cultural development and African American legacy. The future Emancipation Park, when brought to fruition and designated as a part of the proposed Emancipation Trail National Her-itage Corridor, represents a unique opportunity to tell a comprehensive story about the great State of Texas. Of course, there is much work to do to bring this project to fruition, including necessary rec-lamation and restoration operations in areas adversely affected by Hurricane Harvey. That is why H.R. 3686, the Hurricane Har-vey Supplemental Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2017, which I introduced earlier this week allocates $800 million to the National Park Service Historic Preservation Fund. To conclude, National Heritage Areas (NHAs) are both a good investment and na-tional treasure providing economic benefits to communities and regions through their com-mitment to heritage conservation and eco-nomic development. For all these reasons, Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of the Jackson Lee Amendment. I thank Chairman C
ALVERT and Ranking Member M
CCOLLUM for their work in putting together this legislation. PERSONAL EXPLANATION HON. DANIEL WEBSTER

COMMEMORATING THE 26TH ANNI-VERSARY OF MACEDONIA’S INDEPENDENCE 
HON. DAVID A. TROTT 
OF MICHIGAN  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 11, 2017 Mr. TROTT. Mr. Speaker, today, I, along with Macedonian Caucus co-chairs Represent-atives D
INGELL and B OYLE , rise to recognize the 26th anniversary of Macedonia’s inde-pendence. On September 8, 1991, the people of the Republic of Macedonia voted to end their centuries-long struggle for a free, inde-pendent and sovereign Macedonian Republic in Southeast Europe. Macedonian Independ-ence Day provides us with an opportunity to reflect on the Macedonian-American commu-nity’s substantial contributions within the United States. This month will also mark the 22nd year of full diplomatic relations between the United States and Macedonia. We extend our congratulations to all of Macedonian herit-age for their accomplishments as we com-memorate this anniversary of Macedonia’s independence. As a critical ally, we under-scored the importance of supporting this young democracy. Therefore, we include in the R
ECORD the following letter to Secretary of State Tillerson: 
DEARSECRETARY TILLERSON : As members of the Macedonia Caucus and friends of Macedonia, together with our part-ners in NATO and the EU, we have been closely watching the developing political sit-uation in Macedonia. As Macedonia con-tinues on a path toward a stronger future, we see a tremendous opportunity to further pro-mote a strong relationship with this key Balkan ally. Since the establishment of full diplomatic relations in 1995, the United States of Amer-ica has readily supported Macedonia’s aspi-rations for full integration into Euro-Atlan-tic institutions, and remains committed to helping Macedonia strengthen its democratic foundations. A vibrant, multi-cultural coun-try, Macedonia has a positive future ahead, and we look forward to engaging with Mac-edonia to ensure that it realizes this poten-tial. Despite common interests and a growing security and economic partnership, the last time a Secretary of Defense visited Mac-edonia was a decade ago, and it’s been al-most 15 years since a Secretary of State vis-ited Skopje. With Macedonia beginning a crucial portion of its contemporary history, and non-state and state actors like Russia looking to exploit and influence vulnerable countries in the region, the dynamics in the Balkans present an exceptional opportunity to show Macedonia that the United States of America recognizes the value of strength-ening this relationship. As you work to develop the European pol-icy of the administration, we hope that you will see it is in the best interests of the United States to further our relationship with Macedonia, as we strive for a safer and freer world. We stand ready to assist you in your efforts to actively promote this bilat-eral relationship. Thank you for your prompt attention to this important matter and we look forward to your leadership on this issue. f CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF JOHN D. LOCKHART 
HON. TED LIEU 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 11, 2017 Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of Mr. John D. Lockhart (known as Jack)—patriot and public servant, loving father, grandfather and great- grandfather—who passed away on October 24, 2015. Mr. Lockhart cared deeply for his family, friends and community. His personality and presence are sorely missed and will never be forgotten. Mr. Lockhart was born in 1934 in Staten Is-land, New York. He attended Port Richmond High School where he played on the baseball team. He studied at St. John’s University in Queens. He also served in the U.S. Army Re-serves. In 1959, Mr. Lockhart joined the Fire De-partment of the City of New York (FDNY), be-ginning a 24-year career as a first responder assigned to Engine Co. 10/Ladder Co. 15 in Lower Manhattan. He retired in 1983. In addition to his public service, Mr. Lockhart was also a successful businessman who owned his own company and was the re-cipient of numerous building awards on Staten Island. He could build or fix just about any-thing. He enjoyed working on cars, a skill he spent many weekend hours passing on to his sons. Mr. Lockhart was an avid sports fan and cheered for the St. Louis Cardinals and the New York Giants. In his free time, he played baseball and football in adult leagues and was a fixture on the FDNY championship softball team. Upon his retirement, Mr. Lockhart man-aged the Renaissance Knights softball team in Manchester, New Jersey. In life, Mr. Lockhart exemplified the defini-tion of dedication to his family. He was a con-stant source of love and wisdom for his family and friends. In 1958, while spending time on the beach, Mr. Jack Lockhart spotted Ms. Joan Pucillo. Pretending to injure his ankle, Mr. Lockhart was able to chat Ms. Pucillo up when she went to check on him. They went on to fall in love and were married for 57 years. Jack and Joan raised five wonderful children—David, Deirdre, Christopher, Greg, Stephen, ten grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

In closing, Mr. Speaker, I recall the words of novelist George Eliot, ‘‘The growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts.’’ Mr. Lockhart didn’t make history, but he certainly grew good and kindness in the world as a public servant, businessman, friend and family man. And so, I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in recognizing Mr. Jack Lockhart’s exem-plary life.

IN HONOR OF THE 75TH ANNIVER-SARY OF AMERICAN LEGION WARREN M
CKEON POST 587 
HON. TOM McCLINTOCK 
OF CALIFORNIA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 11, 2017 Mr. M
CCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of American Legion Warren McKeon Post 587 as its members celebrate the 75th Anniversary of their charter in Foresthill, California. The American Legion was first incorporated by Congress in 1919 as a patriotic veterans organization dedicated to continued devotion of America’s service members and veterans. Hundreds of local American Legion posts around the country strengthen our nation one community at a time, and the Warren McKeon Post is no exception to that standard. The American Legion Warren McKeon Post 587 was founded on September 11, 1942— just nine months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The Post is named in honor of Warren Alexander McKeon, who was raised at Yankee Jim’s, located three miles from Foresthill, CA, and served in the 26th Infantry Regiment, 1st Division in World War I. Private McKeon was killed in action on July 18, 1918 and buried at Oise-Aisne American Cemetery in France. The Post’s 160 members serve a number of different charities including the Veterans Home of California, Travis Air Force Base Fisher House, American Legion Boys State, and Boy Scouts of America, in addition to sending care packages for troops deployed overseas. To honor the sacrifices made by the men and women who have put themselves in harm’s way to defend our nation, American Legion Warren McKeon Post 587 has built a veterans monument in front of the Foresthill Veterans Memorial Hall. The monument, to be dedicated on September 11, 2017, will serve as a permanent reminder of our nation’s sac-rifice in the pursuit of a free and prosperous democracy. Mr. Speaker, the significance of this day is lost on no one. Not only is September 11th the 75th anniversary of the chartering of American Legion Warren McKeon Post 587, it also marks 16 years since the deadliest terror attack on American soil. The monument will commemorate the her-oism, selflessness, devotion and patriotism of the men and women of our nation who an-swered the call when our nation needed their service. Mr. Speaker, our veterans deserve to know their contributions will never be forgotten, and it is my privilege to rise in recognition of the efforts of American Legion Warren McKeon Post 587 to honor those who stepped forth from the safety of hearth and home and into mortal peril to protect their fellow citizens. f 
IN REMEMBRANCE OF THOSE LOST AND THOSE WHO GAVE AND RISKED THEIR LIVES DURING THE TERRORIST ATTACKS LAUNCHED AGAINST THE UNITED STATES ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 11, 2017 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, on this, the 16th anniversary of the attack launched against the United States on September 11, 2001, I rise to remember the victims of that horrific tragedy and those first-responders who risked, and in too many cases, sacrificed their lives to rescue the occupants of the besieged World Trade Center Towers. The morning of September 11, 2001 is, and will always be, a day like no other. It is a day all living Americans will remember because not since Pearl Harbor had there been such a dastardly and deadly attack on American soil. As I stand here today, my heart still grieves for those who perished on flights United Air-lines 93, American Airlines 77, American Air-lines 11, and United Airlines 175. When the sun rose on the morning of Sep-tember 11, none of us knew that it would end in an inferno in the magnificent World Trade Center Towers in New York City and the Pen-tagon and in the grassy fields of Shanksville, Pennsylvania. I stand here remembering those who still suffer, whose hearts still ache over the loss of so many innocent and interrupted lives. My prayer is that for those who lost a father, a mother, a husband, a wife, a child, or a friend will in the days and years ahead take comfort in the certain knowledge that they have gone on to claim the greatest prize, a place in the Lord’s loving arms. And down here on the ground, their memory will never die so long as any of the many of us who loved them lives. Mr. Speaker, as hard as it is to believe, out of a tragedy so overwhelming and horrific, something good and great emerged in the aftermath of September 11. On that day there were no Republicans or Democrats. There were no Northerners or Southerners or West or East Coasters. We were not Red State or Blue State. We were all simply Americans. On that day, we were united in our shock and anger and sadness. We were united in our resolve to defend our country and protect the freedoms that have made America the greatest country in the history of the world. We lit candles, held hands, helped neigh-bors, and prayed for our country and its lead-ers. A united America can never be defeated as Operation Enduring Freedom showed. The brave and valiant armed forces of the United States swiftly toppled the Taliban and liberated Afghanistan. As President George W. Bush announced to the American people and to the world: ‘‘Whether the terrorists are brought to justice or justice is brought to the terrorists, justice will be done.’’ And though he ran and hid for almost ten years, Osama bin Ladin could not hide forever and evade the long arm of American justice, which, under the leadership of President Barack Obama, caught up with him on May 2, 2011. Mr. Speaker, Americans take care of their own. Americans cherish freedom. Americans cherish liberty. And Americans want peace. Not just for themselves alone, but all per-sons in every corner of the globe. Mr. Speaker, ensuring that America is safe and secure and protected from another attack on American soil is the least we owe to the heroic passengers on Flight 93 and to the brave firefighters of the FDNY and officers of the NYPD and the officers and civilians we lost in the Pentagon who gave faithful service to our nation. I believe all Americans want their country to remain safe, free, and invulnerable to another cowardly attack like the one we witnessed six-teen years ago today. We owe that much to the Americans who lost and gave their lives. We owe it to them to ensure that their chil-dren and loved ones will never again experi-ence such pain, suffering, and loss. We can do this. We must do this. After all, we are Americans.

A 9/11 MEMORIAL IN COLTS NECK, NEW JERSEY 
HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH 
OF NEW JERSEY  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 11, 2017 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, ev-eryone remembers where they were and what they were doing on September 11, 2001—I was in Washington chairing a Veteran’s Affairs hearing—when a group of cowards hijacked airliners in order to perpetrate the worst act of terrorism in American history. No one remembers the shock, horror and numbing sorrow more, however, than the fami-lies and close friends of the victims. Because it was a surprise attack, there was no chance to fight back that day although when New Jersey’s Todd Beamer and other passengers learned what happened to the Twin Towers, Todd famously said ‘‘let’s roll’’ and attacked the terrorists on board the flight that crashed in a Pennsylvania field to pre-clude another jet from being used as a mis-sile.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1196 September 11, 2017 
Who can forget the courageous first re-sponders running up the stairs of burning buildings—with total disregard for their own safety—saving some at the expense of their own lives. On the morning of 9/11, I got a mere glimpse—I say again a glimpse—into the sense of horror suffered by the victim’s fami-lies when I couldn’t reach my own brother Tom—an American Airlines 757 Captain who often piloted Flight 11 from Logan to LA, the flight that crashed into the North Tower. Stuck in traffic within sight of the burning Pentagon, cell phones were all but gridlocked. At noon, I got through. He and his flight at-tendant wife Sandy were safe but were in an-guish because they knew the pilots and crew on board Flight 11. For the families of the victims—and I got to know and work with several including Kathy Wisniewski who lost her husband and today works on my staff, the Jersey Girls and The-resa Velardi, the news that day was absolutely devastating. Both then—and now 16 years later—words are still inadequate to convey our empathy for those who died and for the victim’s families. For many, their faith in God has helped them survive and overcome. Yet for 16 years, the families have had to endure their loss and a broken heart. Which reminds me of that haunting song in Les Miserables after one of the main char-acters loses many of his friends in a battle at a barricade: 
There’s a grief that can’t be spoken There’s a pain goes on and on; Empty chairs and empty tables . . . Where my friends will meet no more . . . 
Yes, empty chairs and empty tables in New Jersey and elsewhere but those chairs and ta-bles are not empty in heaven. Yesterday, I attended a 9/11 memorial in Colts Neck, New Jersey. Theresa Velardi, who lost her dad, Paul James Furmato, on Sep-tember 11, was eloquent in her moving state-ment, which I include in the R
ECORD : 
I have not spoken at a memorial like this before, so I hope you will all bear with me as I try to get through this. First, I want to thank Lillian for giving me the opportunity to speak today. I would like to thank every-one who takes care of this memorial and the township of Colts Neck for providing me with a place to come to remember and to be with my Dad. And I also want to thank all of you for coming out today and always keep-ing the families and first responders of 9/11 in your hearts and your prayers. My father, Paul James Furmato, was an institutional sales trader and a Vice- Presi-dent at Cantor Fitzgerald. He was taken away from me 16 years ago and my entire family dynamic was changed. I remember waking up morning after morning watching my mother fight back her tears and try her best to raise 3 children on her own. I remem-ber waking up every day after the twin tow-ers crashed wondering, ‘‘does this mean Dad is really never coming home?’’ I remember being a Girl Scout in Colts Neck and having to skip Father-Daughter dances because my father was murdered. I remember hoping and praying, even years later, that my Dad would come walking through the door one day and that this was all a really horrible dream. But it wasn’t a dream. And my family would be changed forever. The entire coun-try would be changed forever. You don’t re-member much from when you were 6, but you never forget the feeling of losing a fa-ther. You never forget the pain, the devasta-tion, or the confusion. And it wasn’t just my family. Families from around the country lost loved ones. There was true devastation felt all around after the twin towers fell. The country went into a state of shock. But shortly thereafter, something incred-ible happened. We came together. We united with those around us and worked towards re-pairing New York City, repairing broken families, and repairing the damage in our hearts. In this country, we support each other. In Monmouth County, we support each other. And in my hometown Colts Neck, we support each other. This community picked each other up off the ground. I remember Cedar Drive Middle School teachers and Conover Road Elementary School teachers showing up at my house days after with food and condolences. All types of Colts Neck residents showed up at my door to lend my mom the support and prayers she truly need-ed. As devastating as 9/11 was for my family and for our entire community, it reminded all of us to help each other and look out for one another. It reminded us that no matter how bad things may get, there is always a better tomorrow. No matter what age we are or what troubles we face, we can overcome. We can fight through it and we can work to-gether to rebuild. My father’s life was taken from him at 37 years old. My mother lost her husband, her soul mate after spending 17 years with him. She was left with heartbreak and three chil-dren at impressionable ages. Yet she contin-ued to wake up every morning to provide and to care for her children. She refused to let the hatred of others consume her own heart and mind. I grew up watching a woman never give up and I knew I wanted to follow in her footsteps. I am 22 years old. I’m a college graduate from Fordham University with a double de-gree in Philosophy and Political Science. I run an office as the Executive Director at the Monmouth County Republican Com-mittee. I am working towards my J.D. at Seton Hall Law School on the weekends. I live on my own and I try my very best to bal-ance everything going on in my life. I strive every single day to make my Father proud in Heaven. When life becomes overwhelming or stressful or it all just feels like too much, I come here and I sit right on that bench with Paul James Furmato’s name on it. I sit here with my Father beside me. Just this past week, my world felt like it was caving in. But I came here and I sat with my Dad. I prayed I was making him proud in Heaven and I promised him yet again that I will con-tinue to work hard every single day to be the best daughter I can be no matter what life throws my way. At times, life gets difficult. I have seen that and experienced that first hand. We see heartbreak and disasters like the storms passing through Texas and Florida just this past week. The only thing we can do when life hits us hard is overcome. We have to re-flect on tragedies like 9/11 and allow them to help us grow. f 
REINFORCING EDUCATION AC-COUNTABILITY IN DEVELOP-MENT ACT 
SPEECH OF  
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Friday, September 8, 2017 Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this vital agreement brokered be-tween the President and Congressional lead-ers. This is a must pass bill to bring much- needed relief to those devastated by Hurri-cane Harvey and those who will be hit by Hur-ricane Irma. Indeed, it allows for a short-term extension of the debt ceiling to avoid default and keeps our government functional at a time of natural disaster and ongoing crisis. Thank you to the President and our Leader-ship for pulling the nation back from the brink again. I hope that it will bring a return to bipar-tisan compromise and regular order. We must move away from the destabilizing cycle of moving from one manufactured crisis to the next, with no adopted budget for FY 2018 re-sulting in arbitrary spending allocations passed down from the Majority’s Leadership. Congress should provide the American peo-ple with a 2018 final budget to assure a gov-ernment funded at a level that provides sta-bility and security. Let’s put politics aside and pass this bill. Then, let us embark on bipartisan negotiations to develop a new budget agreement which al-lows for adequate caps for both defense and non-defense spending. I urge my colleagues to support this pack-age for the benefit of our nation. f 
NEW YORK TIMES OP-ED BY GOV-ERNOR CHRISTINE TODD WHIT-MAN 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 11, 2017 Ms. M
CCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, former Envi-ronmental Protection Agency Administrator Christine Todd Whitman wrote recently in The New York Times about ‘‘the dangerous polit-ical turn of an agency that is supposed to be guided by science.’’ Governor Whitman, a Republican who served as EPA Administrator under President George W. Bush, has a stark warning about the direction the Agency is taking under Presi-dent Donald Trump and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt: ‘‘Policy should always be rooted in unbiased science. The EPA is too important to treat like a reality TV show. People’s lives and our country’s resources are at stake.’’ Mr. Speaker, I include in the R
ECORD the entirety of Governor Whitman’s op-ed in The New York Times, ‘‘How Not to Run the E.P.A.’’: 
I have been worried about how the Envi-ronmental Protection Agency would be run ever since President Trump appointed Scott Pruitt, the former attorney general of Okla-homa, to oversee it. The past few months have confirmed my fears. The agency created by a Republican president 47 years ago to protect the environment and public health may end up doing neither under Mr. Pruitt’s direction, As a Republican appointed by President George W. Bush to run the agency, I can hardly be written off as part of the liberal re-sistance to the new administration. But the evidence is abundant of the dangerous polit-ical turn of an agency that is supposed to be guided by science. The E.P.A.’s recent attack on a reporter for The Associated Press and the installation of a political appointee to ferret out grants containing ‘‘the double C-word’’ are only the latest manifestations of my fears, which

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD —Extensions of RemarksE1197 September 11, 2017 
mounted with Mr. Pruitt’s swift and legally questionable repeals of E.P.A. regulations— actions that pose real and lasting threats to the nation’s land, air, water and public health. All of that is bad enough. But Mr. Pruitt recently unveiled a plan that amounts to a slow-rolling catastrophe in the making: the creation of an antagonistic ‘‘red team’’ of dissenting scientists to challenge the conclu-sions reached by thousands of scientists over decades of research on climate change. It will serve only to confuse the public and sets a deeply troubling precedent for policy-mak-ing at the E.P.A. The red-team approach makes sense in the military and in consumer and technology companies, where assumptions about enemy strategy or a competitor’s plans are rooted in unknowable human choices. But the basic physics of the climate are well understood. Burning fossil fuels emits carbon dioxide. And carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that traps heat in the atmosphere. There is no de-bate about that. The link is as certain as the link between smoking and cancer. A broad consensus of scientists also warn of the influence of the warming climate on extreme weather events. Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, the enormous wildfires in the Western United States and widespread flood-ing from monsoons in Southeast Asia are po-tent reminders of the cost of ignoring cli-mate science. As a Republican like Mr. Pruitt, I too em-brace the promise of the free market and worry about the perils of overregulation. But decisions must be based on reliable science. The red team begins with his politically pre-ferred conclusion that climate change isn’t a problem, and it will seek evidence to justify that position. That’s the opposite of how science works. True science follows the evi-dence. The critical tests of peer review and replication ensure that the consensus is sound. Government bases policy on those re-sults. This applies to liberals and conserv-atives alike. There are two sides, at least, to most polit-ical questions, and a politician’s impulse may be to believe that the same holds true for science. Certainly, there are disputes in science. But on the question of climate change, the divide is stark. On one side is the overwhelming consensus of thousands of sci-entists at universities, research centers and the government who publish in peer-reviewed literature, are cited regularly by fellow sci-entists and are certain that humans are con-tributing to climate change. On the other side is a tiny minority of contrarians who publish very little by com-parison, are rarely cited in the scientific lit-erature and are often funded by fossil fuel in-terests, and whose books are published, most often, by special interest groups. That Mr. Pruitt seeks to use the power of the E.P.A. to elevate those who have already lost the argument is shameful, and the only outcome will be that the public will know less about the science of climate change than before. The red-team idea is a waste of the govern-ment’s time, energy and resources, and a slap in the face to fiscal responsibility and responsible governance. Sending scientists on a wild-goose chase so that Mr. Pruitt, Rick Perry, the energy secretary, who has endorsed this approach, and President Trump can avoid acknowledging and acting on the reality of climate change is simply unjustifiable. And truly, it ignores and dis-tracts from the real imperative: developing solutions that create good jobs, grow our economy, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prepare for the impacts of climate change. Policy should always be rooted in unbiased science. The E.P.A. is too important to treat like a reality TV show. People’s lives and our country’s resources are at stake. Mr. Pruitt should respect his duty to the agen-cy’s mission, end the red team and call on his agency’s scientists to educate him. No doubt they’re willing and eager to impart the knowledge they’ve dedicated their lives to understanding. If this project goes forward, it should be treated for what it is: a shameful attempt to confuse the public into accepting the false premise that there is no need to regulate fos-sil fuels. f 
RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF FALL-EN MISSISSIPPI SOLDIER ARMY FIRST LIEUTENANT (1LT) DON-ALD CLAYTON CARWILE 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 11, 2017 Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in memory of Army First Lieuten-ant (1LT) Donald Clayton Carwile who paid the ultimate sacrifice while defending our great nation on August 15, 2008, during Operation Enduring Freedom. 1LT Carwile was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 506th Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Di-vision (Air Assault), Fort Campbell, Kentucky. 1LT Carwile was killed when his vehicle was struck by a roadside bomb and then attacked by insurgents with small arms fire and rocket- propelled grenades in Wardak Province, Af-ghanistan. Army Private First Class (PFC) Paul E. Conlon, Jr. of Somerville, Massachu-setts was also killed. 1LT Carwile enlisted in the Army shortly after he graduated from Lafayette High School. Following a three-year enlistment, he returned home to his family after the death of his stepmother. During that time, he served as a police officer at the Batesville Police Depart-ment and later, at the Oxford Police Depart-ment. While he was working in law enforce-ment, 1LT Carwile earned his degree in crimi-nal justice at the University of Mississippi. In 2006, 1LT Carwile re-enlisted in the Army and qualified for Officer Candidate School, where he was commissioned as an infantry of-ficer. He was assigned as a platoon leader in the 101st Airborne Division. His wife, Jennifer, was asked about her husband’s experience in the Army by the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal. ‘‘He cared so much about the men in his platoon,’’ Jennifer said. ‘‘He always said his first goal was to bring his men home, and his second, only after that, was to come home himself.’’ In 2016, the House and the Senate ap-proved legislation I introduced to honor 1LT Carwile. H.R. 5309, designates the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 401 McElroy Drive in Oxford, Mississippi as the Army First Lieutenant Donald C. Carwile Post Office Building. Family, friends, emer-gency responders, and local officials came to the dedication ceremony held in April 2017. 1LT Carwile distinguished himself as a lead-er in the Army which earned him many awards. He received the Bronze Star Medal, the Purple Heart, Combat lnfantryman Badge, Air Assault Badge, Parachutist Badge, Army Commendation Medal, Army Achievement Medal, Good Conduct Medal, Global War on Terrorism Medal, and the Army Service Rib-bon. 1LT Carwile is survived by his wife, Jen-nifer; two daughters, Avery Claire and Eliza-beth Reese; and his parents, Dennis and Judy Carwile. 1LT Carwile is a hero. We will never forget his sacrifice to protect our freedoms in this great nation. It is important to honor notable Mississippians who are willing and proud to pay that price. Everyone who passes through the doors of the post office will be reminded of a soldier who loved his country. f 
IN MEMORY OF GENE SULLIVAN 
HON. ERIC A. ‘‘RICK’’ CRAWFORD 
OF ARKANSAS  
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  Monday, September 11, 2017 Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the life of a great man from my home state of Arkansas, Gene Sullivan. But I want to admit that I have struggled to come up with the right words because Gene had achieved excellence in areas that are dif-ficult to describe adequately. First, Gene loved his Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and was a shining light to all with whom he came into contact. There are countless stories of Gene, without seeking attention, taking time out of his busy schedule to visit those who had fallen ill, offering financial help to someone in need, or lending whatever type of helping hand that was needed. The list of water resource projects that ben-efited from Gene’s steady hand is far too long to list. However, just recognition was be-stowed upon him last year when the Arkansas Association of Conservation Districts inducted Gene into the Hall of Fame. Finally, Gene was known for being an opti-mist. Keep in mind, Mr. Speaker, that this could be the single biggest understatement ever made before Congress. A mutual friend once commented that it would be hard to fath-om a more tireless optimist. There is no doubt in my mind that Gene derived his indefatigable optimism from his personal relationship with, and faith in, Christ. If there is one thing in life about which I have no doubt, it is that when Gene arrived at the Pearly Gates of Heaven, he was greeted with, ‘‘Well done, good and faithful servant.’’
