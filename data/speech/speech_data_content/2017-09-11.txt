Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge and speak in support of my friends in Texas and Florida who are currently fighting and recovering from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. While my thoughts and prayers go out to all those affected, I am also reminded of the courage and resilience Americans display in these trying times. I am especially proud of my State of Kansas’ National Guard, who has assembled and are currently assisting those affected. Airmen in the 184th Intelligence Wing out of McConnell Air Force Base, Wichita, Kansas, are currently conducting incident awareness and assessment activities in both Texas and Florida. They are compiling information by analyzing video footage and imagery of the affected areas, pinpointing where immediate assistance is required. Additionally, soldiers from the 69th Troop Command in Topeka are also advising senior National Guard leaders to ensure the National Guard is successful in their response efforts and critical information is effectively communicated to the public. I am incredibly proud of the National Guard and all Kansans who are currently helping our neighbors in Florida and Texas in multiple capacities. It is incredibly empowering to watch Americans come together during these trying times and lend a hand to the most in need. ACKNOWLEDGING THE MANY AGRICULTURAL  
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the many agricultural producers across Kansas who work tirelessly to keep the very heart of our Nation beating. I represent the largest agricultureproducing district in the country, and over recess I spent a great deal of time traveling 2,000 miles and holding some 10 farm bill listening sessions to find out exactly how we in Congress can best serve the needs of our producers. On one of my farm bill listening tours, I was reminded of just how important the farm bill is to my district and countless others across the Nation. We must protect our farmers and ranchers, especially in this depressed agriculture economy. Farming is one of the riskiest, hightech, most intricately complicated businesses out there. As a member of the House Agriculture Committee, I look forward to working with my colleagues to take the voice of American farmers and translate it into an appropriate and welldefined farm bill. We must send the message to our farmers and small communities that we will continue to support them and ensure that their livelihoods are protected. To do this, we must increase flexibility and make sure that crop insurance is available to all those who need it most. Crop insurance doesn’t just protect the farmers, it protects the loan at the local bank, it protects downtown communities like yours and mine, it protects the coops, and it protects Main Street, America. America is protected by crop insurance. I firmly believe it is our duty to make sure that those who put food on our tables aren’t struggling to put food on theirs. f

May the efforts of so many to help them recover and establish themselves be a hopeful beginning of many months of work and rebuilding thanks to the efforts of so many Americans and good neighbors. Through all this, bless the Members of this people’s House with the wisdom and perseverance they need to attend the pressing needs of the Nation.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Emergency Aid to American Survivors of Hurricanes Irma and Jose Overseas Act’’.

CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN TERRORIST ATTACKS— MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 115–67) The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following message from the President of the United States; which was read and, together with the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and ordered to be printed: To the Congress of the United States: Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1622(d), provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, within 90 days of the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date. Consistent with this provision, I have sent to the Federal Register the enclosed notice, stating that the emergency declared in Proclamation 7463 of September 14, 2001, ‘‘National Emergency by Reason of Certain Terrorist Attacks,’’ is to continue in effect beyond September 14, 2017. The threat of terrorism that resulted in the declaration of a national emergency on September 14, 2001, continues. The authorities that have been invoked under that declaration of a national emergency continue to be critical to the ability of the Armed Forces of the United States to perform essential missions in the United States and around the world to address the continuing threat of terrorism. For these reasons, I have determined that it is necessary to continue in effect the national emergency declared on September 14, 2001, in response to certain terrorist attacks. DONALD J. T RUMP .THEWHITE HOUSE , September 11, 2017.
