Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, our Nation has a lot of issues on its plate. We have to stabilize healthcare. We need an infrastructure plan that creates millions of goodpaying jobs. We need to deal with the hurricanes and the aftermath not just in Texas and Florida, but also in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. We have a huge problem with North Korea and nuclear weapons, and that is just for starters. So what did President Trump spend his weekend doing? Fixing healthcare for tens of millions of people? No. Lobbying for a robust jobcreating infrastructure plan? No. Sending aid to Puerto Rico? Not that either. Deescalate the situation in North Korea? Well, actually, quite the opposite. No. President Trump spent his weekend doing one of his favorite things: attacking Americans and various groups on his favorite medium: Twitter. His most recent attack: NFL players who use their constitutional right to freedom of speech to protest. But they are not the only ones and the only group being attacked. Back in July, The New York Times found that President Trump was on track to insult 650 people, places, and things on Twitter by the end of his first term. Well, 2 months later, he is certainly still at it. Instead of attacking our Nation’s problems, he is attacking us. Let’s take a quick look at some of the people and groups he has attacked both as a candidate and President. On this board we have just a handful of the people, places, and things President Trump has insulted, and if we were going to list them all, we would probably have to have dozens of poster boards. Here is a sampling: JOHNMCCAINand JEFF FLAKE ; Barack Obama; Hillary Clinton, even though the election happened a year ago; the media from The ‘‘failing’’ New York Times and the Amazon Washington Post to individual reporters like Katy Tur and Mika Brzezinski; ObamaCare; Hamilton, the Broadway musical; Jeff Sessions, his own Attorney General; the Emmys; Nordstrom; the Russian investigation; Rosie O’Donnell; the Paris climate agreement; Meryl Streep; Mexicans; protesters; fake news; John Oliver; Mark Cuban; Snoop Dogg; and this weekend, the NFL and its players. The list goes on and on. Well, it is actually easier to name the people and things that President Trump has not attacked than all of the ones that he has. So I came up with a very small list of people or groups that he has not attacked after several extensive Google searches. First, I don’t think the President has attacked the barbershop quartet singing organization: the Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing, also known as SPEBSQSA. To the best of my knowledge, he has never attacked them, so maybe he is a fan of barbershop crooners. Although it is fairly recent, pumpkin spice lattes. I know they just came out. It is a sign of fall, but so far there is no Twitter traffic from Trump attacking these tasty treats. Finally, these very fine people President Trump hasn’t attacked nearly enough: the Klan, neoNazis, and other White supremacists. Instead of being the attacker in chief, President Trump is supposed to unify the Nation, but all he does is divide us. His job is to work for the American people, to deliver on the promises and actually help Americans. Here are the issues we need help with: stabilize the Affordable Care Act to ensure tens of millions of people keep their coverage, and don’t just sabotage the marketplace. We need goodpaying jobs and better wages for the American people. We need a job and infrastructure plan like the President promised, but we have yet to see. We need trade agreements that work for American workers. Again, another promise we have had with no tangible results. And we need aid for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands after last week’s devastating hurricanes, much of what has yet to materialize. Mr. President, while you are so busy tweeting about the NFL, you attack a 
Black man for nonviolence more severely than White supremacists for violence. Look, taking a knee may have started as a protest about racial inequality, about behavior by some in law enforcement discriminating against others in this country, but unarmed people of color are being killed simply for the color of their skin. I think today taking a knee is becoming a broader sign of patriotism and respect for our country, for a country that can be even greater for every one of its citizens. It respects the lives lost for those in this country to fight for its ideals, which include nonviolent protests. It is a sign of love of country, a country with a promise that has to be for everyone regardless of the color of their skin. I join so many now in the NFL and elsewhere in taking a knee for the America that we all aspire it to be. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President and to direct their remarks to the Chair. 
b1015 APPLAUDING PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR HIS COMMENTS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. MOONEY ) for 5 minutes. Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud President Trump for his comments last week which criticized the few NFL players who have chosen to kneel in protest during our national anthem. The President is right to publicly object to this disrespect to our flag and Nation. While we can disagree on politics and policies, we should not denigrate our flag and our national anthem. I must mention that most NFL players stood in respect for the flag. It is just a few who didn’t, who gave them a bad name and the sport a bad name. In response to President Trump’s criticism, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell called the President’s remarks divisive. I would respond to Mr. Goodell that it is you and your players who disrespect our flag and our national anthem who are being divisive. The President defending our flag is not divisive. My father and thousands of other Americans fought under our flag in the jungles of Vietnam. Young men and women have died recently in service to our flag in Iraq and Afghanistan. In my house, we honored our flag not only because of my father’s service, but because of the deep sense of patriotism my parents instilled in me. My mother, Lala Suarez Mooney, was born and raised in Fidel Castro’s Cuba, where she and other members of her family were thrown into jail for opposing Castro’s Communist regime. When she was 20, my mother escaped Cuba and fled to America with barely a penny to her name. My mom and millions of other immigrants leave the flags of these other countries—brutal dictatorships, Communist regimes, and other oppressive regimes—to come to America to live under our flag. All Americans, whether you came as an immigrant or you were born here, you stay to live under this flag. If you don’t like it, you don’t have to stay. You can go. No one is making you stay. We love this flag. Listening to my parents’ inspiring stories, I knew from a young age that I absolutely believed in the American ideals of liberty as set forth by our Founding Fathers. It is with this same sense of honor and patriotism that I support President Trump in calling for all NFL players to honor our flag and remember what has made our country great. For a few hours many Sundays, I usually enjoy time with our son watching our favorite football teams battle on the gridiron. We root for different teams. As a nation, we forget about our political and other differences and come together to enjoy the sport of football. By these few players wrongly deciding to turn the game into a political statement, we lose that moment of national unity and respect for our country. Sports have always been a unifying factor and a chance for the Nation to come together. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, owners, coaches, and a few players are showing a lack of respect for our Nation and her military who gives them the freedom to play football. As the men and women of our armed services face challenges at home or abroad, we should put our differences aside and unite around our flag as a beacon of hope and understanding. I certainly respect anyone’s right to protest peacefully and the right of an NFL team owner to discipline disorderly conduct or rude behavior. Sadly, three NFL teams did not even leave the locker room to hear the playing of our national anthem. Just one person on those three teams, Pittsburgh Steeler Alejandro Villanueva, came out of the tunnel of the locker room. You can see other people standing back there in the tunnel. He came out of the tunnel of the locker room to honor our country. Villanueva is a West Point graduate, former Army Ranger, and Bronze Star recipient. He knows the value of our flag. Sadly, instead of receiving the praise he deserved, many in the media attacked him. Even his coach, Mike Tomlin, said that when Alejandro Villanueva came out of that tunnel, he was ‘‘not respectful of our football team.’’ Not respectful of the team? Really, Coach? How about respect for the flag? How about our country which soldiers die for and the flag that allows you to play that football game? Unbelievable. I hope all the young people out there look at Alejandro Villanueva as a beacon of honor and duty to his country above himself. Professional athletes in this Nation, whether they like it or not, are an example for our young people. They should stop injecting antiAmerican politics into sports. I applaud, again, President Trump for standing up for our flag and our national anthem. All NFL athletes should stand together and do the same. f 
PRIORITIZING PUERTO RICO The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. GUTIE´RREZ ) for 5 minutes. Mr. GUTIE´RREZ. No, Mr. President, Puerto Rico is not doing well. We don’t need to be reminded of the debt. We should remind ourselves of our responsibility to the 3.4 million people of the island nation of Puerto Rico. They are suffering greatly. Mr. Speaker, the people of Puerto Rico need our immediate and sustained help. We all know that flooding, destruction, and complete elimination of the power grid for the whole island are among the consequences of Hurricane Maria, but this is no ordinary hurricane, and it hit at no ordinary time. Mr. Speaker, we need all hands on deck to make sure rescuing Puerto Rico becomes our number one priority. Immediate needs must be met—fresh water, food, medicine, shelter, and fuel—but we need sustained investment and cooperation with the island’s government and its people to make Puerto Rico livable again. Like a lot of Americans, I have watched with increasing horror and panic as the Governor of Puerto Rico, the mayor of San Juan, and ordinary Puerto Ricans have pleaded for more help. The work of first responders and our military has been heroic, but the island needs more. Onethird of the doctors— over 5,000—have left the island of Puerto Rico in the last 10 years. Hospitals have no doctors in some cases. Nurses, fuel, and medicine are running out at the hospitals that remain open. This is a public health crisis and should be declared a health emergency by the Federal Government. Puerto Rico has been in an economic crisis for years. Five thousand people flee Puerto Rico every month—before two hurricanes hit—leaving behind many old, many young, the very poor, the very sick, and the very vulnerable. There is no food in supermarkets. We need an airlift. We need an effort the scale of Dunkirk. We know the U.S. is capable. We can invade foreign countries with hundreds of thousands of troops, flawless communications, food, and security. We need the same effort now. We need the Federal Government to go all in to rescue Puerto Rico from a humanitarian crisis which is developing. Welcome other nations if they want to help, Mr. President, like Cuba, that has offered doctors and other emergency assistance. But what I fear is 
that the Federal Government is not stepping up as fully and as quickly as we must. I remember, in this body, when the legislation to take over the Puerto Rican government and put in place a junta or control board was working its way through Congress—the PROMESA bill. What was the main selling point for the bill? Vote for PROMESA because it will not cost us a penny. So that is where this Congress and the Federal Government start from: not wanting to spend what needs to be spent or do what needs to be done. We need to waive cost sharing that could charge—would charge—Puerto Rico for a percentage of the relief and rescue help they are receiving today. Puerto Rico is broke, and they cannot borrow because the government—our Federal Government—has said it cannot. This Congress has said it cannot. So they can’t set their own budget and spending priorities, which have all been taken away from them. So the U.S. Government should start by waiving those costsharing requirements and suspend the Jones Act permanently or for a substantial period— at least a decade—to help in the recovery. Since it was imposed on Puerto Rico, the Jones Act has cost the Puerto Rican consumers more than all the money owed to Wall Street and the debt, yet the President reminds us of the debt. Let the ships flow as quickly and as cheaply from wherever they may come because this is an emergency. Let’s be clear: with or without hurricanes, the electrical grid, the roads, ports, public safety, and public health system are close to collapsing. So this emergency can not just be treated by Congress, the President, FEMA, and other agencies as just another storm. Mr. Speaker, I have asked the Speaker of the House and the Democratic leader to form a delegation and send Members to Puerto Rico so they can see for themselves how dire things are. I am leaving on Friday to go there, and I am hoping other Members will join me. I have family who needs help, so I am headed there to do what I can do. But, most importantly, I am committed to shining a spotlight on the people of Puerto Rico so that they are neither out of sight nor out of our minds. We need to make them the priority in this moment of great need and in this moment of national disaster. 
MAKING CLEAN WATER A TOP PRIORITY The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. EMMER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the city of St. Cloud for taking care of our community’s drinking water. St. Cloud’s safe drinking water comes from the mighty Mississippi, and its pure form is thanks to projects like the Northwest Regional Treatment System, the Northeast Sump Manholes, as well as the Northeast St. Cloud Water Quality Project, the city’s newest water purifying project. To put the effectiveness of these projects in perspective, the Northeast St. Cloud Water Quality Project stops 10,200 pounds of sediment and 20 pounds of phosphorus from entering the Mississippi every year. Because of the commitment to the health and safety of the city’s water supply, last month St. Cloud was awarded the Source Water Protection Award. It is an honor to represent a city that takes the health of its citizens so seriously. Congratulations to the city of St. Cloud and everyone responsible for the city’s water supply. A NATIONAL AWARD FOR A LOCAL BUS DRIVER  
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate St. Cloud Metro Bus driver Todd DeZurik for his first place finish at the 2017 National Community Transit Roadeo, which was recently held in Detroit, Michigan. This competition gives drivers from all over the Nation the chance to take part in a little healthy competition and exhibit their talent by driving through a timed obstacle course that imitates reallife situations and difficult scenarios that can occur on the road. Todd has participated in this competition before, taking third place last year and second place in 2012. This year was Todd’s year, as he took first place against 82 other drivers. Congratulations, Todd. I am glad to know we have skilled drivers like you on our roads safely transporting the members of our community. Keep up the great work. 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize one of Minnesota’s finest military families who fought during our Nation’s darkest hour. I would especially like to remember one family member who made the ultimate sacrifice and who, after more than a half century, will finally be returned and laid to rest in his beloved home State. Quentin, Earl, and Harold Gifford all bravely served our Nation during World War II. While Earl and Harold made it home safely, Quentin, who served on the USS Oklahoma, died in the attack on Pearl Harbor. For 75 years, Quentin remained in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, until this year, when his remains were finally identified. The identification of Quentin has brought relief and closure to his family, who never forgot the brother they lost. The Giffords are happy to have the chance to give Quentin the memorial he deserves. Mr. Speaker, I speak for all Minnesotans when I say we are happy to finally welcome home a hero like Quentin. 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the hardworking folks from my district who have been selected as this year’s Minnesota Farm Families. The Minnesota Farm Families program is a longstanding tradition in our State, having taken place for the past 30 years. This program honors the families who have dedicated their lives to agriculture. They are chosen because of their exceptional contribution to advance Minnesota’s agriculture industry. This year, five families from my district were selected for their agricultural contributions to our State. They include Jim and Sally Myers from Anoka County, Rick and Marlene Schlichting from Benton County, Curt and Joni Hedtke from Carver County, the Bahnemann Family Stock Farm in Washington County, and the Kreitlow and Ford family from Wright County. Farming is not just a profession for these families, it is a way of life. Their hard work and the hard work of families like them make agriculture one of the primary drivers of Minnesota’s economy. Congratulations to the 2017 Minnesota Farm Families. Thank you so much for everything you do. f 
b1030 DEFEND, DENOUNCE, AND ANNOUNCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ALGREEN ) for 5 minutes. Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today and stand at the podium designated for Republicans, but I rise not as a Democrat or a Republican. I rise today, Mr. Speaker, not as a Liberal or a Conservative. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a proud American: a person who believes in his country, who salutes the flag, says the Pledge of Allegiance, and sings the national anthem. I rise today, Mr. Speaker, to make comments that I never thought I would have to make in the well of the House of Congress. I rise today to defend, denounce, and announce. Mr. Speaker, I rise to defend any mother who has been called a dog because her son engaged in peaceful protest. I rise, Mr. Speaker. I rise today, Mr. Speaker, to defend any son who is called the son of a dog because he engaged in peaceful protest. I rise, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I rise to denounce these comments that have been made because they have brought discourse to a new low. Mr. Speaker, this is a level of indecency that is unbecoming of the Presidency. Mr. Speaker, I rise to say to the world that this is not what America is all about: calling people SOBs. We know what a ‘‘B’’ is. It is a dog. Mr. Speaker, I rise because my heart tells me that I must do something. Mr. Speaker, I denounce the comments that were made, and I rise to announce that next week I will bring a privileged resolution before the Congress of the United States of America. 
I will stand here in the well of the Congress, and I will call for the impeachment of the President of the United States of America. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. 
ESCALATING THREAT FROM NORTH KOREA The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. COMER ) for 5 minutes. Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about an issue that my constituents in the First District of Kentucky are following closely: the escalating threat from North Korea. The world has watched as the North Korean dictator, Kim Jongun, has built up his country’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles programs over the past several years. Just this month, North Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test—the largest one yet. This followed a series of missile tests that led U.S. intelligence analysts to conclude that the Kim regime is on the verge of developing a reliable intercontinental missile capable of carrying a nuclear weapon, a feat that officials previously did not expect would be possible for several more years. Clearly, this rogue state is moving full steam ahead toward its goal of becoming a nuclear power that cannot only threaten our allies and territories in the region, but also the American mainland. I have the utmost confidence in our military leaders, and I trust Secretary Mattis when he says that our existing missile defense systems have what it takes to keep our country safe from the North Korean threat. The American people can feel safe and secure, knowing that our military is protecting them and that their Representatives in Congress, like myself, are ready to provide whatever funding is needed to support the development and deployment of missile defense technology, both now and in the future. That being said, it is simply unacceptable to allow a leader like Kim Jongun, who shows no regard for international norms or human rights, to gain valuable leverage and deterrent capability as a nucleararmed state. I was encouraged to hear our Commander in Chief speak out forcefully against the ‘‘forces of destruction’’ that are gathering power in our world in his address to the United Nations last week. President Trump has made it clear to North Korea that denuclearization is the only path forward, and he has successfully mobilized the international community to impose strong sanctions that will help deprive the Kim regime of the resources it needs to continue its rush to nuclear weapons. This is a critical step forward, but make no mistake: the nuclear advancements that North Korea has been allowed to achieve in recent years pose a very serious threat to our Nation, our allies, and the international community overall. That is why we must stand firm now and be prepared to do whatever is necessary to protect our national security and that of our allies, including military action. I am proud that Congress is doing its part to support the Trump administration’s efforts to counter the North Korean threat, including passing sanctions legislation that was enacted into law in August; and the North Korean Human Rights Reauthorization Act, which passed the House yesterday. We must continue to stand united, both as a country and with our international partners, to send a clear message to North Korea that its hostile behavior must end and that it must never be allowed to threaten the world with nuclear weapons. 
EVERY PERSON COUNTS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. KENNEDY ) for 5 minutes. Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, in this country, we do not retreat. We may stumble and we may struggle, but we press on. Time and again, our greatest challenges have delivered our crowning achievements: the New Deal, the 19th Amendment, the GI Bill, the Civil Rights Act, and marriage equality. The tougher the moment, the more we demand of ourselves; the bigger and bolder we demand to dream for a fairer, more just nation, for an America where every person counts, where every voice matters, where we are all treated with a decency and a dignity that we deserve, where every American family has access to quality, affordable, accessible healthcare. Right now, this week, we must fight harder than before to say: Not this bill, not this time. Not this copout, not this retreat, not this white flag. The latest version of TrumpCare is an admission that the wealthiest Nation on Earth will not, by choice, care for all its citizens; that a child in Texas or Massachusetts with pediatric cancer deserves treatment, but not both; that a grandmother in Maine or Oklahoma deserves longterm care, but not both; that a young man in Georgia or West Virginia suffering from substance use disorder can be treated, but not both. This version of TrumpCare, worse than those before it, pits State against State, American against American. It is up to every single one of us here today to say: Not this—not in my country, not on our watch. In our Nation, every person counts. 
HONORING LEWIS DONELSON The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. KUSTOFF ) for 5 minutes. Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a very good friend of mine, Lewis Donelson of Memphis, Tennessee. This October, ‘‘Lewie,’’ as most call him, is turning 100 years old, and I cannot be more proud to celebrate with him. Lewie is a brilliant lawyer who has practiced law for almost 70 years. He founded one of our Nation’s largest law firms with Senator Howard Baker, now called Baker Donelson. But Lewie’s impact extends far beyond his legal accomplishments. Lewie was one of the founders of the Shelby Republican Party, and he was instrumental in building the party throughout the entire State of Tennessee. In 1968, Lewie helped establish the very first Memphis City Council at the height of the civil rights movement and played a significant role in resolving the sanitation strike led by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. He led the charge for peaceful integration and legal equality in Memphis. Lewie served as Tennessee’s commissioner of finance for thenGovernor LAMAR ALEXANDER . He was chairman of the Board of The Med in Memphis and served on the board of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, also in Memphis. Amazingly, through all of this, Lewie taught his Sunday school class at Idlewild Presbyterian for more than 60 years. Lewie is a visionary and a leader. He is bold and not afraid to do the right thing. Roberta and I are so glad to call Lewie our friend, and we cannot wait to celebrate his 100 remarkable years. 
HEALTHCARE ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. RUIZ) for 5 minutes. Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, the Graham Cassidy bill is the worst version of TrumpCare yet. By block granting healthcare, this bill puts healthcare on the chopping block. In order to make ends meet, States will have to change their eligibility criteria, meaning millions more left uninsured. They will have to cut certain benefits and expensive coverage like perhaps cancer treatment or that extra stay in the hospital. They will have to reduce reimbursements for hospitals, clinics, and doctors. That is a big, disproportionate cut to those healthcare providers, especially in rural and underserved communities. This means that millions more will be uninsured and hardworking families will be forced to pay more out of pocket for healthcare. This also means that patients with preexisting conditions will be priced out of their healthcare and pay more out of pocket for higher premiums and higher deductibles. They will have to pay for needed care that will no longer be guaranteed coverage under essential healthcare benefits. Furthermore, 
older Americans will be faced with paying higher premiums under the bill’s age tax. We cannot let this bill become law. We cannot allow patients, families, seniors, and those who have diabetes and chronic illnesses like asthma, COPD, or obesity to be left to fend for themselves. That is not the America that we know. That is not the values that we share. We don’t believe that healthcare is a commodity only for those that can afford it. Those who can’t afford healthcare will have to fend for themselves, simply because they can’t afford it. We believe that we all have a responsibility for health as a common good, with a social responsibility to make sure that our neighbors and our communities are well, that our neighbors’ kids are free from infections that can spread to other kids. That is why we have strong vaccination programs. Health is, fundamentally, a human right. The rest of the world sees it that way, so why not America, the leaders of our globe. We must and we can do better. To my Republican colleagues, I know that passing a bill is important politically because you campaigned on this for the past 8 years. I understand that you have a lot of pressures from donors. Just think about patients. Do the right thing. Put politics aside. Let’s heed the words of Senator MCCAIN. Let’s come back to regular order. Let’s figure out what we can do together to fix and improve on the Affordable Care Act to bring down premiums and bring down the cost of healthcare and medicines and make sure that we expand coverage to more people and not take away coverage for millions of people. Let’s put people above partisanship. Let’s put solutions above ideology. Let’s do the right thing. Let’s come together and help pragmatically improve healthcare for millions of Americans. 
CONGRATULATING WAYNE MARSHFIELD ON HIS RETIREMENT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York (Mr. FASO) for 5 minutes. Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize the commitment and dedication of Wayne Marshfield, who just recently retired after 50 years of hard work with the Delaware County Electric Cooperative. Over the course of his career, Wayne has supported the Cooperative’s central mission of providing reliable and affordable energy services to families throughout its entire service area. b1045 Wayne’s leadership and penchant for innovation have significantly enhanced the Cooperative’s operations in our upstate communities. For example, Wayne developed the service location system, which greatly improved his company’s service mapping, allowing us to greater respond to emergencies and needs of the community. In addition, he implemented the smart meter to modernize the area’s outage alerts. We thank Wayne Marshfield for his indispensable 50 years of service at the Delaware County Electric Cooperative, and also his 20 yearsplus service as Hamden’s town supervisor. Wayne has always gone above and beyond to ensure affordable and reliable power to our local homes and businesses. Mr. Speaker, I salute Wayne Marshfield. NORTHERN COLUMBIA LIONS CLUB 70TH  
Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Northern Columbia Lions Club, which will soon celebrate its 70th anniversary on September 30 of this year. Based in Valatie, New York, this Lions Club International post has a long history of extending a helping hand to neighbors in need. Its members practice charitable leadership, living out the Lions Club motto: ‘‘Where there’s a need, there’s a Lion.’’ This year alone, the Northern Columbia Lions Club has hosted vision screening tests for preschoolers, held a successful eyeglass drive for people in underdeveloped countries, refurbished benches in Chatham’s Callan Memorial Park, and awarded scholarships to local collegebound students. I thank our past and present members of the Northern Columbia Lions Club for their 70 years of dedication to a better Columbia County and a better world. 
KNEELING IN RECOGNITION OF THE GLORY OF OUR NATION The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) for 5 minutes. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, last evening, I took to kneeling on this floor in recognition, first of all, of the glory of this Nation, the pride that I have in representing the Nation in faraway places as a Member of Congress, and visiting heads of states, and visiting with the people of other countries who have such an admiration for the purity of our freedom. I also take great pride in Texas being a State that is home to any number of military bases and reservists and Active Duty and veterans. We interact all the time. Our military liaison in my office is a veteran of the Iraq and Afghan wars. There is no lacking in sense of pride, and not one of us remembers missing the national anthem and the Pledge of Allegiance as children growing up in our daily activities as we went to school. But I also have come to understand what those symbols mean. They are not just cloth or music. They, in fact, represent ideals and values, and many people interpret them in different ways. I abhor spitting or burning or destroying of the flag. I have not done any of those. Colin Kaepernick’s kneeling in the early months past was no disrespect of his love of this country, but a recognition that people were hurting and people were losing their lives, and we needed to reform systems of justice to be able to respond to the grieving mothers who lost children, in many instances—I would say all the instances—that we can recall of the recent 2 years, unnecessarily. It did not mean that we did not have, again, the greatest respect for our men and women in blue. I will take no backseat to my honoring them, fighting for them, working alongside them during Hurricane Harvey, thanking them for the first responders and enormous work they did, working alongside them as we rescued a group of individuals in a church who have fled for their lives during Hurricane Harvey. We must understand each other as people, and it is unfortunate that the Commander in Chief has taken to a distraction that wants to peel away our unity and report in the news: They like it, don’t they? He is really, working for his base. I don’t know anything about a base. I know about Americans. I see them all the time, and they don’t look like me. They disagree with me. They have different opinions. I still respect that opinion, but I do believe that we can all come together. That knee was in respect of Colin and the young men who have now successfully taken to their knees, and the owners. Yes, I know that what they have done does not feed people; does not work on your retirement; does not get us something better than the GrahamCassidy bill, which will destroy and undermine healthcare for millions of Americans, those with preexisting diseases, those who suffer from the lack of income, and those who need good healthcare—the very promise that was made by the President and all of us as Members of Congress that there should be some structure. There is no structure in the Graham Cassidy bill. All it does is throw it over to the State and say: If you don’t have the money, forget about it. Don’t worry about them. Take the money and give tax cuts to the rich. That is not the American way. I rise today to say that I remain on bended knee in spirit with all of those young men. I look forward to working with the NFL and all the sports as we explain that these young men are vital parts of the community. Thank you to J.J. Watt and the Texans and all of those who have contributed. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, now, what is the most important message? My people are suffering—and my constituents—still in Texas. They are suffering in Florida. They are suffering now extraordinarily in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Your eyes should burn and your hearts should be struck by the absolute 
humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico. As I listened to my colleagues this morning as I was coming to this floor already on these issues, they pierced my heart even more because Puerto Rico is under water. The disease is rising. People with medicine are losing it because they do not have refrigeration, yet the idle talk and idle hands of the administration are, in fact, not doing anything sufficient enough to save those lives. I, too, have people in my district who are unhoused, but I am here because we are unified, and we must be able to speak about the whole of America. I have been to Puerto Rico on a number of issues. I know the leadership of the former Congressperson, and I believe that it is high time—if this is water that Hurricane Harvey was, imagine the disease of being hit by 155 miles per hour. It is now time to put a military czar in Puerto Rico. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Send the C–130s, send the ships, help these people be rescued. This is a disgrace. I am talking about foolishness. Be a leader and be the Commander in Chief and stop all of this. When are we going to get the kind of leader that is deserving of the American people? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Ms. JACKSON LEE. I am sick and tired of it. I want a President. I do not want the person that fools around while people are dying. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman is no longer recognized. Ms. JACKSON LEE. * * * The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. 
REMOVE TAXEXEMPT STATUS OF PROFESSIONAL SPORTS LEAGUES The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. GAETZ ) for 5 minutes. Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, I cannot believe what I just heard on this floor. Kneeling as a sign of respect? I don’t recall my Democratic colleagues kneeling when former President Obama would come to address this body. They stood as a sign of respect. That is what we do in this country, Republicans and Democrats, for our flag, for our anthem. That is why I joined so many Americans in anger and disgust when I saw NFL players, multimillionaires, kneeling during the national anthem, and it is such an overgeneralized indictment. If people have a problem with police brutality or the criminal justice system, there are venues for discussion, even for protest that highlight and isolate those issues for an adult in a responsible discussion. When people kneel during our national anthem, they don’t simply indict the issue with which they take some particular grievance. They indict our country, our servicemembers, our first responders, our Founding Fathers, and the principles that made this country great. But, see, this freedom that we enjoy also includes the freedom of speech, the right of our citizens to express themselves even when we find that expression offensive. It is a fundamental constitutional right, yet nowhere in the Constitution does it say that hardworking Americans have to subsidize or create special carveouts and exemptions for conduct that they find unpatriotic. Unfortunately, today, the Tax Code gives special breaks to sports leagues. Some swamp creature of yesteryear cleverly defined sports leagues as tax exempt trade organizations. The public pays 70 percent of the cost of NFL stadiums. Taxexempt sports leagues generate $2 billion in revenue, yet the Tax Code gives them special treatment, gives them a special break that small businesses in my district don’t get. That is unfair. It is outrageous that we take money away from hardworking Americans to subsidize professional sports at all. The return on investment is negative. I have heard these arguments in my home State of Florida: Oh, these sports clubs create jobs and revenue and economic activity. Look, every economic analysis showed that this is a negative return on investment, a loser for taxpayers, and corporate welfare at its worst. The Internal Revenue Code must be amended to remove the taxexempt status for professional sports leagues permanently. I am glad that the NFL voluntarily gave up their status, but we should make this change permanent and we should make it the law. In the coming days and weeks, we will be discussing tax relief to lift up the middle class. I support wholescale, bold, conservative tax reform; but we have an opportunity in this tax bill to send an even more profound message: In America, if you want to play sports, you are free to do so. You are also free to protest. You are welcome to do both, but you should do it on your own time and on your own dime. 
DREAM ACT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. COSTA ) for 5 minutes. Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about three issues that are very important to my district and the Nation. First, I want to talk about the immigration policy or the lack of an immigration policy that we have in this country; a, in essence, broken immigration system. For years I have been saying that we need to fix it, and we need to do that in a bipartisan way because it is the only way we are going to be successful. I supported bipartisan efforts in 2013, the legislation that came out of the Senate by a vote of 68–13. Prior to that, I supported President Bush’s efforts and, more recently, President Obama’s efforts; but, unfortunately, we have not been successful through these efforts. That is why today I think we need to be focusing on at least one segment that would have been addressed if, in fact, we fix this broken immigration system. And that is those DREAMers, those young people covered under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that was initiated by President Obama that is now going to expire. These people came here at the average age of 6 years. Most of them don’t know the country they came from. Most of them consider themselves, in essence, Americans. They are going to school. They are in our military service. They are serving in many different ways. They have jobs. They are part of families in which some are here legally and some are not. You are talking about breaking up families. Yesterday I signed a discharge petition to bring to the House floor the bipartisan, bicameral Dream Act, which will permanently protect these DREAMers by offering them a path to earned citizenship, not amnesty. I will continue to do everything in my power to bring the Dream Act to the House floor for a vote and to work then, after that, for comprehensive immigration reform, which is what we really need to do so that we don’t keep up ending back here like a continued broken record. I want our DREAMers to know that many of us in Washington and across the Nation stand with them. The overwhelming majority of Americans believe that we ought to fix this. And I hope, before the end of this year, in a bipartisan fashion, we will do just that. CONGRATULATING SLOANE STEPHENS WINNING  
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, about a month ago, we had the United States tennis championship, and I would be remiss if I didn’t congratulate Sloane Stephens on her winning the U.S. Open in tennis earlier. b1100 Many of you may not realize, but she came from the San Joaquin Valley, from the area that I represent in California, and we are proud of her. She did, after all, start playing her tennis in Fresno, where she lived until she was 10 years old. But her win makes many of us in America proud, as she showed the world a level of hard work, determination, and grit rarely seen on the tennis court. Ms. Stephens had to fight her way back to the court after a stress fracture and surgery in January that took her out of training and completely off of her feet and off of the tennis court. And then she came back—and, wow, did she come back—to beat the world’s best, including one of her heroines, 
Venus Williams, to become the Women’s Singles U.S. Open champion. We are so proud of you. I also want to thank Ms. Stephens for all that she has done in the valley because she has never forgotten where she came from, where her mother raised her, contributing to the tennis programs at EdisonBethune Charter Academy in Fresno, which introduces young children to the sport of tennis, and also to help expand tennis programs at other local elementary and middle schools throughout the Fresno County Office of Education. A real shoutout for Sloane Stephens and the incredible accomplishment at this year’s United States tennis championship for the United States Open. Congratulations. 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, lastly, I would like to turn to something that has been important not only in California, but across the country and around the world, and it also puts smiles on people’s faces. For over 250 years, California has been producing the best wine, I think, in the world. California is the fourth largest producer of wine. This is, in large part, due to a lot of hard work, innovation, and craftsmanship of the State’s 4,700 vintners and almost 6,000 growers. They make a difference every day, and they do it not before its time. Roughly 24 million people visit California’s wine regions each year, making our State the most visited State for food and winerelated activities. We are, after all, the number one agricultural State in the Nation, not only in wine production, but half of the Nation’s fruits and vegetables, number one in citrus production, number one in milk production, number one in almonds and pistachios, and the list goes on and on and on. So as we near the end of California Wine Month this year, I would like to take a moment to celebrate our vintners, growers, farm workers—without the farm workers, we couldn’t make this wine possible—and all those who contribute to this industry that provides healthy food as a part of a healthy diet that we all deserve and enjoy. 
TERM LIMITS The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH ) for 5 minutes. Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of legislation that an overwhelming number of Americans—75 percent, in fact—not only support but demand of this body. The issue is term limits. The time is now. It has become more and more transparent to Hoosiers back home that this city, and even sometimes this building, no longer reflects the ideals, the morals, and the values that they share in their communities. The people demanded representation that truly represents their interests. They are tired of elected officials being seduced by the trappings of their office, forgetting the reason they were sent to this hallowed Chamber. Ultimately, the American people have seen that many Members vote in consideration of sometimes interests that are divergent from theirs back home. Since I first entered public life, I have been a vocal proponent of term limits. I believe that in order for this body to truly serve the people back home, the hardworking Hoosiers every day trying to make ends meet, that they need to be responsive to those people, they need to listen to those people, and, ultimately, they need to relate to those people. Yet, the American people are not the only ones calling for term limits. As we all can remember, President Trump crisscrossed this great Nation, sharing his vision on how he could make America great again. He agreed with the chorus of American voices that were calling for term limit legislation for the United States Congress. I support President Trump’s agenda in term limits. Mr. Speaker, I have heard the voices of Hoosiers back home who desperately wish to see this legislation passed, who desperately want to see their Representatives representing their interests and their values. That is why, as one of my first actions as a Member of this body, I wrote legislation that would sponsor a constitutional amendment levying term limits on Members of Congress. Additionally, I have cosponsored every piece of term limits legislation that reflects actual term limits that is available in this body. Furthermore, I so strongly believe in this issue that I went door to door during the course of my campaign handing out term limits pledges that I would sign personally at the over 15,000 doors that I have knocked on during the course of my elected official office. I have continued to sign those term limits, talking to each one about how we can ensure that their interests and their values are fully represented here. Now, the positions that we hold here in this Chamber are not bequeathed to us by status, by lineage, or by heritage, but, rather, the positions we hold— every single one of us—are based on the ideas that we presented to the American public and based on the values that the American public said they wanted represented. I want to make sure that we continue year in and year out to be responsive to those ideas and to be responsive to those values. Too frequently, I hear in my district that they feel like Washington, D.C., has values that are inconsistent with theirs. That the toxic environment they sometimes believe that exists in Washington, D.C., hasn’t gotten them the results that they have demanded election after election. Now, I am an old business guy, a manufacturing guy by trade, so I always think about how the process of creating policy could be better, not just fixing the policies at the end of the line, because no one would run a manufacturing business where you have a process and then you just fix the widgets at the end of the line. But, instead, they would focus on how we manufacture policy in a better way. The American people and Hoosiers back home have said how they think we could manufacture policy in a better way. They have said that they want to see terms limits legislation passed so that the manufacturers of policy will reflect their values, will reflect their concerns, and will reflect what they live, breathe, and feel every single day. What I hear, when I go back home and travel my district every single weekend, is that Washington, D.C., has become flooded with selfinterests— selfinterests that drive the boat forward instead of American interests propelling us forward into better and better policy. I think the quickest way to correct that failure here in D.C. is to consider and pass term limits. When 74 percent of Americans agree—that is not 74 percent of one side of the aisle or 74 percent of the other side of the aisle, but that is 74 percent of Americans agree on something—then I think in a democracy that something should get done. The Framers of our Constitution did not intend for Members of this body to remain seated for 20, 30, 40, or even 50 years, but rather they fundamentally believe that government should be designed, one of the people and for the people, to experience regular turnover. Ultimately, the greatness of this country has always rooted in the American people themselves, and I want to get more of those American people up here serving in elected office. f 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess until noon today. Accordingly (at 11 o’clock and 8 minutes a.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1200 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. BOST) at noon. 
PRAYER Reverend William Lynn Nash, Glad Tidings Pentecostal Church, Mangham, Louisiana, offered the following prayer: Our eternal God, may divine direction be upon the Members of the people’s House. The psalmist pleaded for Thy saving health among the nations. May the 
Representatives from Chicago to San Francisco, from New York to New Orleans, O God, be granted the wisdom of Solomon and the strength of the great apostle Paul. May the anointing of Thy Holy Ghost bless this body, from committee rooms where compromise is made, to this very floor, may grace and peace become our banner. Forgive us, O Lord, of backsliding. Empty out our arrogance. Fill the Members of Congress with the very best of heavenly manna. Repair the breach, and may the House of Adams, Lincoln, and Rayburn become renewed with the best fruits of labor. Lead this House to the mountaintop of victory today, so that 100 years from this very day, it may be said: It was good to have been here. I pray in the name of Jesus. Amen. 
THE JOURNAL The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has examined the Journal of the last day’s proceedings and announces to the House his approval thereof. Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Journal stands approved. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the Speaker’s approval of the Journal. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8, rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. DAVIS) come forward and lead the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mrs. DAVIS of California led the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. f 
WELCOMING REVEREND WILLIAM LYNN NASH The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. ABRAHAM ) is recognized for 1 minute. There was no objection. Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce Brother Bill Nash, a great friend who delivered the opening prayer this morning, and what a prayer it was. Brother Nash’s wife founded Glad Tidings Pentecostal Church near my home in Mangham, Louisiana. In the 15 years since he founded his church, Brother Nash has been active in the community. He is the deputy sheriff chaplain for Richland Sheriff’s Department. He was named an honorary chaplain of the Louisiana Legislature in 2014. Brother Nash is a true country evangelist and has been delivering sermons since he was 15 years old. Mr. Speaker, we appreciate the opportunity for him to offer the prayer this morning, and we thank him for all he has done for Louisiana. f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call for an end to the dangerous war of words between President Trump and North Korean officials. Provoking Kim will not make us any safer. It will only raise the temperature on an already volatile situation. As everyone in this Chamber knows, a conflict on the Korean Peninsula would be catastrophic. Let me be clear: a war with North Korea would put millions of lives at risk, and the threat of nuclear weapons only heightens tensions. Diplomacy is the only answer. However, President Trump’s rhetoric has destabilized us over our process and stopped it before it could even begin. This administration needs to end the name calling and saber rattling. President Trump must deescalate his rhetoric before it is too late. Direct talks remain our best chance of resolving this conflict peacefully. We must also remind the President that he does not possess the power to declare war without congressional approval. It is up to Congress, not the White House, to debate and vote on military action. Congress must immediately vote on Representative LIEU’s no first use bill, H.R. 669, to prevent the President from unilaterally authorizing a nuclear strike. Mr. Speaker, it is clear to everyone that there is no military solution to this crisis. 
HONORING ANGELA M CQUEEN, A TRUE HERO (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Angela McQueen, whose actions saved the lives of Mattoon High School students after a student gunman opened fire in the cafeteria. Angela tackled the student, eventually disarming and holding the assailant on the ground until police arrived. Angela taught math and physical education in Mattoon, Illinois, for over a decade. She is an Illinois native and graduated from Marshall High School, where she was a standout high school basketball player. She then attended Eastern Illinois University, earning a bachelor’s degree in mathematics and physical education and her master’s in education administration. Angela became a teacher because she wanted a platform to be able to make the world a better place. She is highly involved in the Mattoon community and is a member of B.I.O.N.I.C., Believe It Or Not I Care teacher’s program, founded in 2014 and funded by the Rotary Club. She is also part of the school’s grief support research team. I honor Angela McQueen’s dedication to her students’ safety and her courageous actions in the face of adversity. If she had not selflessly acted, the situation could have been much worse. Mr. Speaker, Angela McQueen is a true hero and deserves nothing less than our highest admiration. 
PUERTO RICO AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS ARE IN CRISIS (Mr. SOTO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, first, to the President: Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands are in crisis. People are dying, and the time for action is now. Send our ships. Send our planes. Send our soldiers and our personnel over. We need water and food and medicine. These are Americans, and we can’t turn our backs on them. To Mr. Speaker: We need a FEMA supplemental package without delay, and include not only Texas and Florida, but the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with the same funding per capita as the States. They need resources just like our great State of Florida. To the Governors in many States from whom folks from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands will seek refuge in the meantime: Be prepared—your schools, your hospitals, shelters. Families in these areas, open your homes to our friends and to your neighbors. The United States Government must act with urgency beginning today. 
PRESIDENT TAKES NEW DIRECTION (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the President is doing what he was elected to do—call it shaking up the system, putting the brakes on the bureaucracy, or creative deconstruction. Our country simply cannot continue on the same course: where the government increases the debt by hundreds of billions of dollars every year; where hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants cross our border annually, insulting those who play by the rules and wait their turn in line; where political correctness limits freedom of speech, especially for conservatives. The liberal media is trying to shut down this Presidency because they oppose everything President Trump is trying to do. Mr. Speaker, in this great conflict, the American people and our democracy could be the casualties. 
OPPOSE GRAHAMCASSIDY (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the millions of Americans whose health coverage is once again being threatened by efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The American people have spoken. They do not want repeal. They certainly do not want the ACA replaced by GrahamCassidy, the latest, cruelest version of TrumpCare. Nearly every health organization in America, from the insurance providers to doctors, to hospitals, to patient advocacy groups, oppose GrahamCassidy because it will result in skyrocketing premiums and copays and loss of coverage for millions of Americans, particularly older Americans who need the care most. It is time to abandon the rhetoric of repeal and replace and to work together to stabilize our healthcare markets. Senators MURRAY and A LEXANDER  were working together on a bipartisan bill to fix the ACA before the Republican majority abandoned their efforts for GrahamCassidy. Mr. Speaker, I hope we return to bipartisan efforts as soon as possible to stabilize markets and improve access to healthcare for all Americans. 
PREPARE FOR FUTURE NATURAL DISASTERS (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the first responders and utility workers, the linemen who have been vital in helping prepare for and recover from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. The road to full recovery will be a long one for many of us, our neighbors as well, who experienced catastrophic losses, and we must continue to support those in need. I encourage my constituents to visit my Facebook page to learn more about FEMA resources. I also believe now is the time to encourage all Americans to be properly prepared for future natural disasters. I have introduced the SHELTER Act, which would provide individuals and businesses with a tax credit for 25 percent of qualified hurricane and tornado mitigation property expenditures. It is $5,000 a year. So again, this tax credit, this bill will incentivize Americans to take action now in preparation for future disasters. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage. 
HELP THE DREAMERS (Mr. AGUILAR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Speaker, last week, when I was home in my district, I hosted an event called DREAMers Demand Answers. It was an opportunity for DREAMers in my community to come and have a conversation with me in the wake of the President’s decision to rescind DACA, to let me know what questions and concerns they had so that I could come back here and pass those concerns along to my colleagues here in Congress. Of all the questions, one really stood out to me: Can you help us? I was especially struck by this question because the answer is yes. Yes, I can help them; and, yes, we in this body can help them. By passing the bipartisan Dream Act, we can help these young people. We help them stay in their homes. We can help them keep their jobs. We can help them keep their families together. This is not a hard question to answer. These are young people who grew up here that are as American as any one of us in this room, and they aren’t asking for much. Mr. Speaker, I am on the floor today to ask my colleagues on the other side: Please help them. Join me in supporting the bipartisan Dream Act. f 
b1215 HIGHLIGHTING EFFECTIVE FOREST MANAGEMENT (Mr. GIANFORTE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, imagine if the entire State of Delaware burned. That is the scope of what has burned in Montana this year—1.25 million acres of our beautiful State. I have been on the ground at five fires this summer and I have seen firsthand the result of failing to manage our forests—over 1 million acres have burned, livelihoods threatened, wildlife habitats destroyed, and dangerous air quality in our communities. I have also seen effective forest management. Last week, I went into the field with BLM officials to see a forest they manage. When BLM treated a forest, an approaching fire dropped into the underbrush and was quickly extinguished. All trees in the treated forest lived, but trees in the untreated forest died and it won’t recover in our lifetime. We need to be proactive and start managing our forests again. Wellmanaged forests are healthier forests with more wildlife, more hunting, more goodpaying jobs for Montanans, and, importantly, our wildfires are less severe. On the heels of the catastrophic fires this summer, now is the time to enact real reform and start managing our forests again. 
PUERTO RICO RELIEF (Mrs. DAVIS of California asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.) Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I received a heartfelt letter from a constituent expressing her frustration with the dire crisis in Puerto Rico. She described the panic of not being able to reach her family on the island. She said: ‘‘It is becoming an island of chaos and sadness. I am helpless here in Chula Vista. I cannot contact my family. We need Congress to send more relief. We Puerto Ricans are American citizens, whether people remember it or not.’’ 
As we speak, Puerto Rico remains without power, communication lines are down, and a major dam could burst. We are proud of how Americans came together for Texas and Florida. Let’s not abandon Puerto Rico. We must act now. We are seeing a major humanitarian crisis unfold on U.S. soil. Mr. Speaker, is there any reason why U.S. citizens are being ignored in these times of desperate need? We must help Puerto Rico now. 
THE GREAT LAKES RESTORATION INITIATIVE (Mr. MOOLENAAR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. MOOLENAAR. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to thank all of the Members who voted to support the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. In the appropriations legislation the House passed 2 weeks ago, we included $300 million in the fiscal year 2018 budget for protecting our Great Lakes. The Great Lakes are a critical resource and an essential part of Michigan’s outdoor heritage. They are enjoyed by millions of Americans from across the country, and they are a unique ecosystem with onefifth of the world’s freshwater. They are also a major trade route and they form an international border. There is a Federal role for protecting the Great Lakes, and by working with public and private organizations like Michigan’s universities and Ducks Unlimited, the GLRI does vital work to protect the Great Lakes and the streams, rivers, and wetlands that flow into them. Again, I want to thank all of my colleagues for their support of this critical program. 
NATIONAL HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH (Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize National Hispanic Heritage Month. Each year, Americans observe National Hispanic Heritage Month from September 15 to October 15 to celebrate the contributions of Americans of Hispanic descent to our Nation’s diverse history and culture. Our central Washington communities are blessed to include a growing number of Hispanic Americans, and I have witnessed firsthand the many ways Hispanic Americans strengthen our communities and our way of life. Hispanic Americans have greatly contributed to our country’s history. These Americans have enhanced our economy through entrepreneurship, and many have served our Nation honorably in the U.S. Armed Forces. America is truly the world’s melting pot where people of diverse backgrounds and cultures come together as one people united by shared values. We cherish our unity and diversity. In the upcoming month, we will celebrate Hispanic Americans’ patriotism and the traditions they add to American culture. Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring National Hispanic Heritage Month. f 
CENTRAL ARKANSAS VETERANS HEALTHCARE SYSTEM HELPS HOUSTON (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, over the past few weeks we have seen the unity, courage, and kindness the American people offered to those affected by the destruction caused by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and now Maria. Today I would like to take a minute and acknowledge the Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System in Little Rock, where employees extended help to assist with incoming calls from the VA in Houston, Texas. All calls were forwarded to Arkansas during the relief efforts. While the Little Rock VA usually takes in 200 to 300 calls a day, in the days following the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, our VA team in Little Rock averaged 2,900 calls a day from those seeking refuge and help. Employees worked 8hour shifts to provide 24/ 7 service. I thank these Arkansans in the Central Arkansas VA for helping our neighbors in Texas in their time of need. 
TAX REFORM (Mr. LAHOOD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, over the past three decades, our Federal Tax Code has ballooned to 74,000 pages filled with loopholes for special interests. Moreover, the Federal tax system has become too complicated for hardworking taxpayers to navigate alone. Since joining Congress, I have traveled all across my district meeting with people and businesses who have all made it clear that our current tax system needs change. Small businesses like Vaughan & Bushnell Manufacturing in Bushnell, Illinois, want a simpler Tax Code that lowers rates and closes loopholes so they can invest in innovation, higher wages, and more jobs. Middle class families across Illinois have told me how a simpler Tax Code would mean more money in their pockets to save and spend. Earlier this year, it was estimated that our House blueprint for tax reform would save the median Illinois family over $5,000 in taxes every year. We can all agree that our system needs work, and this week we will take the necessary first steps towards fixing it. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join in this effort to make our system work for everyday Americans, not special interests. f

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. HASTINGS ), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 533 provides for the consideration of two bills which were reported by the House Ways and Means Committee. For the first bill, H.R. 2792, the Control Unlawful Fugitive Felons Act of 2017, the rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Ways and Means. The rule waives all points of order and makes in order no further amendments to the legislation. However, the minority is afforded the customary motion to recommit. For H.R. 2824, the Increasing Opportunity and Success for Children and Parents through EvidenceBased Home Visiting Act, the rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided between the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Ways and Means. The Rules Committee made in order four amendments to H.R. 2824, one Republican amendment, two Democratic amendments, and one bipartisan amendment. Finally, the rule provides for the customary motion to recommit with or without instructions. H.R. 2792, the Control Unlawful Fugitive Felons Act of 2017, amends the Social Security Act to give the Social Security Administration the necessary tools to prevent Federal benefits and payments from being made to persons who are actually on the run from the law. Many people might hear this and think: Why would the government ever continue to pay someone who is actively fleeing from law enforcement? It is a legitimate question, and it has an unfortunate answer. In 1996, President Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act into law. One major provision of this reform bill was a restriction on the ability of fugitive felons and probation and parole violators from receiving Social Security benefits. b1230 Similar provisions have been included in other Federal entitlement programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. This policy was expanded in 2004, with the passage of the Social Security Protection Act. However, subsequent to the passage of these commonsense reforms, several judges in cases from the mid2000s ruled that the Social Security Administration’s interpretation of these provisions was too broad and limited the Social Security Administration’s ability to curtail payments to three narrow categories of fugitives, namely: escape, flight to avoid prosecution or confinement, and flight escape. The bill before the House today, H.R. 2792, would restore Congress’ original intent to the reforms passed under both Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush. Specifically, H.R. 2792 would prohibit an individual who is the subject of an outstanding arrest warrant for a felony or parole violation from receiving monthly Social Security income payments. This applies only to felony charges or a crime carrying a minimum term of 1 year or more in prison. This legislation would not punish individuals convicted of a misdemeanor, such as outstanding parking tickets. In fact, some people have falsely claimed that. Individuals who have potentially committed a felony or a parole violation should not be able to use taxpayer dollars to evade capture. Providing the Social Security Administration with the tools in H.R. 2792 is a commonsense way to show that the Federal Government is sincere in its commitment to being a good steward of Federal taxpayer dollars. The Social Security benefits can be restored once the individual resolves the outstanding issues related to his or her warrant or parole violation. I want to thank the gentlewoman from South Dakota, KRISTI NOEM, for her work on this legislation, and I urge Members of the House to support this worthy bill. The second bill in today’s rule, H.R. 2824, the Increasing Opportunity Through EvidenceBased Home Visiting Act, extends funding for the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, which is more commonly referred to as MIECHV. The Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program is an important program that provides lowincome families with opportunities to receive homevisiting services to help support a child’s first years. These services range from prenatal care to early childhood services and allow for children to grow up in healthy homes. As not only a physician but a physician who specialized in obstetrics and gynecology, I did spend 25 years working with pregnant women and families to help ensure that all mothers could deliver and raise healthy children. As an OB/GYN, I know the best way to ensure that a child succeeds is to invest in longterm services and to ensure that the child receives access to appropriate care. Because of the NurseFamily Partnership’s work, 90 percent of all babies who are supported by the organization are born full term, 95 percent of those babies receive all their immunizations by 24 months, and nearly 89 percent of those mothers breastfeed their newborns. These are important milestones for newborn children that can have lasting impacts on their health for the rest of their lives, and it is important that we support initiatives that support vital, lifesaving programs like these. Furthermore, the program succeeds by not only supporting the health and wellbeing of children, but by supporting pregnant women and mothers as well. In my home State of Texas, the reported incidence of maternal mortality has increased in recent years, in part, as the State has collected more comprehensive data on causes of death up to a year after childbirth. 
While no amount of maternal mortality is ever acceptable, the new data has shown us that the causes for maternal mortality in the State have shifted away from those traditional acute cases that I was familiar with during my residency back in the 1970s. There were illnesses such as pregnancyinduced hypertension, hemorrhage, and infection during pregnancy. Now it is different. We have cardiac disease, suicide, and opioid overdose, which oftentimes occurs in the months after childbirth. By supporting children in their first years, MIECHV can not only help children live healthy lives, but help mothers live healthy lives as well, so that they can continue to be there for their children. The MIECHV Program and organizations like the NurseFamily Partnership succeed because they identify families in need that do not have readily available care and work to provide services in home settings. Families cannot raise healthy children without access to care. When families cannot find providers in their area, MIECHV grant recipients are there to provide that support. H.R. 2824 builds upon the successes of the MIECHV Program by tailoring the program to ensure that it can continue to help families that truly need the help. For example, H.R. 2824 requires for States receiving MIECHV grants to conduct statewide needs assessments by 2020, in order to reaffirm which populations and communities should receive these services. The last time such an assessment was required was in 2010. As the needs of populations of States have evolved over these past 10 years, so should the program as well. It is important to ensure that tax dollars continue to be invested efficiently, and this bill ensures that MIECHV can continue to do so. Additionally, H.R. 2824 provides additional opportunities for States to promote quality and enhanced outcomes. The bill updates the program by allowing for States to promote models that will have greater impact on multiple sites and locations, thus expanding the reach of grants and providing States with the opportunity to reimburse grant recipients based on the quality and outcomes associated with their programs. I certainly want to thank members of the Ways and Means Committee for the work they have put into this bill. It is a smart bill that continues a Federal program for lowincome families that actually has evidence of its effectiveness and, furthermore, links future funding to the assurance of greater costeffectiveness. This program serves as a model for Federal programs to help lowincome families and children. I want to thank Chairman SMITH and Chairman B RADY  for their efforts on this bill. For these reasons, I encourage everyone in this body to support this rule and the underlying bill today. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to debate the rule for consideration of H.R. 2824, the Increasing Opportunity Through EvidenceBased Home Visiting Act; and H.R. 2792, the Control Unlawful Fugitive Felons Act of 2017. The first measure, H.R. 2824, reauthorizes the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, or MIECHV, and provides pregnant women and families access to resources to improve maternal and child health and promotes child development. I am glad to see this bill getting the attention that I think we all agree it deserves, considering the important role the program plays in all of our communities. However, my concern is that, once again, we are witnessing my Republican friends take a policy that should garner broad, bipartisan support and instead scuttle the effort by playing politics. H.R. 2824’s State matching provision is a threat to the core existence of this program. Because of this change from the past authorization, I fear that many States will lose Federal funding and will be forced to cut off home visiting services altogether. Where do you propose poorer States with lower investments in home visiting get the money to meet the matching requirements? Then, Mr. Speaker, what about Tribal programs? They are especially vulnerable to the devastation that will be wrought by making them come up with a 30 percent match. Native American communities struggle enough, as it is, without having to put up with these absurd requirements. I do compliment Mrs. NOEMfor fighting along with our colleague on the Rules Committee, TOMCOLE, for a 5 year hiatus before they would have to make the match. But as one who represents two Tribes, the Seminoles and the Miccosukees, I don’t even think, after 5 years, their vulnerability to devastation is going to be avoided. Mr. Speaker, I ask: Why are my Republican colleagues again choosing to abandon bipartisanship in favor of partisan politics? Our goals should be to reauthorize the vital program, not change longestablished and successful policies that will hurt the most vulnerable in our country. This program, as traditionally reauthorized, puts families first in order to strengthen communities and improve outcomes for kids and their families. Without the MIECHV Program, atrisk families will suffer. I strongly support moving quickly to reauthorize this program before it expires on September 30, 2017. But adding a provision that will make it impossible for many States to fully participate in this program is not only not the way forward, it is downright dangerous. The second measure is H.R. 2792. It is a sidecar bill, as its only purpose in being considered is to offset the cost of the MIECHV Program. H.R. 2792 would reinstate an old, failed policy that had damaging effects for many seniors and people with disabilities by taking away Supplemental Security Income benefits from every individual who has an outstanding felony warrant, regardless of the seriousness of the alleged violation, the age of the warrant, or the condition of the recipient. Mr. Speaker, over 110 national, State, and local organizations have warned that H.R. 2792 is a cruel bill that could have catastrophic consequences for some of our most vulnerable citizens. Everyone can agree that dangerous criminals should not receive public benefits while fleeing justice. In fact, the Social Security Administration already provides regular notification to law enforcement of any beneficiary who has an outstanding warrant. This bill, on the other hand, despite its title, would harm seniors and people with severe disabilities, not felons. Mr. Speaker, a larger issue at hand is not simply the dangerous policy changes in the first bill, nor the failed unnecessary policy found in the second, but rather the partisan manner in which these bills are being considered, especially in the face of the laundry list of items that this body needs to urgently address in a bipartisan manner. We do not have the luxury of time to debate the majority’s attempts to legislate failed and dangerous policies that will threaten families. We should be acting in the most exigent fashion to address issues such as ascertaining the full scope of Hurricane Maria’s devastation on Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and what we need to do to make our brothers and sisters in those areas whole again. We should not be spending our time taking a partisan approach to a program that provides pregnant women and families access to resources to improve maternal and child health. Rather, we should be working across the aisle to address the real pressing issues facing our country. b1245 Congress should be addressing the plight of the millions of American citizens living in total devastation in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Five days after Hurricane Maria decimated what Hurricane Irma had spared, 15,000 people remain in government shelters, thousands of homes are destroyed, roads are blocked, bridges buckled, and a dam in Puerto Rico is on the edge of collapse, threatening the lives of nearly 70,000 people with flash flooding. Two hospitals in the Virgin Islands have been destroyed, and lest I 
not mention that we have not dealt adequately with what is required in Texas and in southwest Louisiana and in Florida. Today, in my office, numerous representatives of government officials and organizations came to present issues concerning ongoing matters having to do with their concerns in our area. The Speaker of the House and the chairman of appropriations were with several of us in the Florida delegation last week to review and view the damage that has occurred in the Keys. And here we are, rather than dealing with a humanitarian crisis as towns are left without fresh water, power, and fuel, we are dealing with a dangerous bill that will address vulnerable people in a negative way. Officials reported that 1,360 of Puerto Rico’s 1,600 telephone cell towers are down. The same holds in the Virgin Islands. With 85 percent of aboveground and underground phone and internet cables knocked out—the same in the Virgin Islands—officials still had not had communication with 9 of the 78 municipalities. It has been difficult or nearly impossible for individuals to reach or connect with their loved ones. Let me make something very clear that many Members of the House do not understand. Everybody cries that FEMA should do all of the things that we would want it to do as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, but FEMA today is dealing with 30 disasters in this country. I sat here a moment ago and heard our colleague from Montana describe over a million acres of fire ongoing there. In southern California, there is an extraordinary fire that is taking place in that particular area. This devastation, these disasters as in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and elsewhere are only cracks of the service of the long todo list that Congress is confronted with. The list is long and time is short. In addition to the MIECHV program, which the majority has decided to undermine here today, at the end of the week, the Children’s Health and Insurance Program—CHIP, the Children’s Health and Insurance Program—Medicare provisions, and the Community Health Centers Fund all expire without any discussion at all in this House. We are leaving not only our constituents, young and old, and the American people in a quandary about their health insurance or treatment facilities, but adding unnecessary anxiety to their lives. Mr. Speaker, I would argue that the snowball is only going to grow with the end of the calendar year looming right around the corner. Let me just remind my colleagues in the majority what needs to be addressed by December 8: reauthorizing the National Flood Insurance Program—I don’t know what that was yesterday that they were trying to do with the FAA authorization—an absolute necessity in the wake of these devastating storms; keeping the government open and EPA pesticide registration fees. And by the end of the year, we must also act to reauthorize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA, which we now know plays a critical role in the fundamental aspects of our democracy. The Affordable Care Act’s annual fee on health insurance providers needs to be addressed, important for the health of the marketplace, and the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund financing rate. Now, Democrats stand ready to work in a bipartisan fashion to address each and every one of the matters that I just talked about, and all of them must pass pieces of legislation. What we are witnessing today is a clear indication that my Republican friends do not share the same spirit, but would rather play politics. Let me just add one little bit about that. In the other body, the United States Senate, we saw an example of partisan politics play out to its extreme, and it is not likely that there is going to be an important measure dealing with the healthcare of Americans coming from the United States Senate back to this body that passed something that was an awful bill earlier in the year. But what did it do? It caused LAMAR ALEXANDER and PATTY MURRAY , who were working on bipartisan measures, to stop their bipartisan efforts so that we could go forward in the Senate on a partisan measure that is going nowhere. People sent us here to work together. They did not send us here to be partisan in every one of our moves. What we are witnessing here today is another example of partisanship. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. Mr. Speaker, I want to talk again just for a minute about the second bill in today’s rule, H.R. 2824, the Increasing Opportunity and Success for Children and Parents through Evidence Based Home Visiting Act, that does extend funding for the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program. I just wanted to talk for a minute about some of the results that we have seen in these program grants and, at this point, reference my home State of Texas to see how they have performed. The NurseFamily Partnership is a communitybased home services group that supports pregnant women and new mothers in the DallasFort Worth area. They have used grants from this program to support women through both the promotion of preventive and prenatal services for pregnant women, like connecting women to physicians, helping them get medications, and through the utilization of risk reduction services such as smoking cessation. Again, I tell you this to reiterate that these are good programs. This is a good program that we are reauthorizing today and it is worthy of our attention and support. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleague will support the DelBene amendment, which will eliminate the matching funds for Tribes altogether. I mentioned that earlier. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DEGETTE ), my good friend. Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I associate myself with his remarks about everything we need to do by the end of the fiscal year, which is the end of this week; in particular, reauthorization of CHIP that has helped so many millions of kids get health insurance and get the care that they need. I rise today, though, to talk about the MIECHV bill, which is up today, and to express my deep disappointment that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have chosen to walk away from yet another opportunity to work on a bipartisan basis. We could extend this program on a bipartisan basis just the way we started it. It is really a success story. The evidencebased models are proven to deliver results for kids and families in every single State. Investments in MIECHV are investments in the success of America’s children and their futures. Peerreviewed evidence proves that MIECHV leads to improvements in health outcomes for mothers and babies, school achievement, parenting practices, and overall early childhood development. On top of all that, MIECHV is a great return on investment for Federal dollars. For example, for every Federal dollar in the NurseFamily Partnership, we get $5.70 in return. Sadly, this bill that the House is considering today would set MIECHV back. The partisan proposal would make it more difficult for MIECHV models in all of our States to continue their success stories. Under current law, MIECHV only has enough funding to reach 6 percent of eligible families. But instead of working together to help the program reach more children, this bill curtails the reach. It cuts the funding and, as my ranking member said, it imposes a harmful Statematching requirement that could force some of these home health visit programs to shut down altogether. It is really a shame that when you are talking about healthy starts for kids, we can’t work together on both sides of the aisle. I would hope we would defeat this legislation and come back and do what we have done before on this program, work together to have a robust piece of legislation. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. It is shameful that President Trump would end the DACA program without a single thought to the consequences 
this decision would have on the 800,000 young lives this program protects. Do the American people even want DACA to end? The answer is clearly no. According to a Politico/Morning Consult poll: ‘‘Support for allowing these immigrants to remain in the United States spans across party lines: 84 percent of Democrats, 74 percent of Independents, and 69 percent of Republicans think they should stay.’’ Congress must act to protect our DREAMers. Well, Mr. Speaker, here is our chance to rectify President Trump’s heartless decision and restore the American people’s faith in us. If we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer an amendment to the rule to bring up H.R. 3440, the Dream Act. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation would help thousands of young people who are Americans in every way except on paper. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the RECORD , along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, through the Chair, I would advise my friend from Texas that I have no further speakers and that I am prepared to close. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. We stand here today with a todo list a mile long, and we don’t have much time to cross items off that list. By kicking the can down the road on nearly every past piece of legislation, this Republican majority has shown itself completely unable to govern. They have abdicated their duty to the American people to accomplish even the most basic of legislative tasks: passing a budget. Without Democratic help, they wouldn’t be able to even keep the lights on. My sincere hope is that the next time we meet we will take up legislation that provides some muchneeded relief to our brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, as well as my home State of Florida and Texas and southwest Louisiana; and address the other disasters that are occurring throughout our country, more specifically having to do with wildfires in Montana, in Oregon, and in California; and that we will begin the process of addressing every single one of the needs of this Nation, particularly its health and its healthcare in a bipartisan way. My colleagues on this side of the aisle stand ready to do so. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the rule. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. b1300 Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today’s rule provides for consideration of two important pieces of legislation to restore sanity to the administration of the Social Security program and to provide critical tools for disadvantaged homes in helping families raise their children with the best possible practices. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman BRADY , Mrs. N OEM, and Mr. S MITH for the work on each of their respective pieces of legislation, and I urge Members of this body to support both bills and the rule which will provide for their consideration. The material previously referred to by Mr. HASTINGS is as follows: 
ANAMENDMENT TO H. R ES. 533 O FFERED BY  MR. HASTINGS  At the end of the resolution, add the following new sections: SEC4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. 3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment of status of certain individuals who are long term United States residents and who entered the United States as children and for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the fiveminute rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill. SEC. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 3440. 
THEVOTE ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION : WHAT ITREALLY MEANS  This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House should be debating. Mr. Clarence Cannon’s Precedents of the House of Representatives (VI, 308–311), describes the vote on the previous question on the rule as ‘‘a motion to direct or control the consideration of the subject before the House being made by the Member in charge.’’ To defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker’s ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ‘‘the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes the control of the resolution to the opposition’’ in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (RIllinois) said: ‘‘The previous question having been refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first recognition.’’ The Republican majority may say ‘‘the vote on the previous question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.’’ But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, page 135). Here’s how the Republicans describe the previous question vote in their own manual: ‘‘Although it is generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of amendment.’’ In Deschler’s Procedure in the U.S. House of Representatives, the subchapter titled ‘‘Amending Special Rules’’ states: ‘‘a refusal to order the previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further debate.’’ (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ‘‘Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate thereon.’’ Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only available tools for those who oppose the Republican majority’s agenda and allows those with alternative views the opportunity to offer an alternative plan. Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. 
HOUR OF MEETING ON TOMORROW Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 4 of rule XVI, I move that 
when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 3 p.m. tomorrow. The motion was agreed to. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘nay’’ on rollcall No. 532. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the resolution. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. This is a 5minute vote. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were—ayes 230, noes 190, not voting 13, as follows:

PERMISSION FOR MEMBER TO BE CONSIDERED AS FIRST SPONSOR OF H.R. 296 Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I may hereafter be considered to be the first sponsor of H.R. 296, a bill originally introduced by Representative Chaffetz of Utah, for the purposes of adding cosponsors and requesting reprintings pursuant to clause 7 of rule XII. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. 
INCREASING OPPORTUNITY AND SUCCESS FOR CHILDREN AND PARENTS THROUGH EVIDENCE BASED HOME VISITING ACT 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 2824. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Nebraska? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 533 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 2824. The Chair appoints the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. ROBY) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. b1347 
Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 2824) to amend title V of the Social Security Act to extend the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, with Mrs. ROBYin the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. SMITH) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. DANNY K. D AVIS) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nebraska. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 2824, the Increasing Opportunity and Success for Children and Parents Through EvidenceBased Home Visiting Act. This bill would reauthorize the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, known as MIECHV, for 5 years and make sure the program continues to focus on results. I would like to note, this bill represents the first full reauthorization proposal Congress has considered for this program. The Ways and Means Human Resources Subcommittee, which I chair, held a hearing on the program earlier this year. We solicited feedback from stakeholders, marked up a bill in committee, and today we are debating this bill on the floor. This is how Congress is supposed to work, and this bill is an example of Congress getting its work done. The MIECHV Program helps support State and local efforts to provide voluntary, evidencebased home visiting services to parents and children living in communities that put them at risk of poor social and health outcomes, including in rural areas like those I represent. Unlike many other programs that focus on money spent or people served, this program focuses on achieving real results for families. Specifically, this program promotes school readiness of young children, increases economic selfsufficiency of families, improves prenatal health and birth outcomes, and prevents childhood abuse and neglect. Madam Chair, I have had the opportunity to see firsthand what home visiting looks like. In March, I spent time in Nebraska with the Panhandle Public Health District’s Healthy Families America program in western Nebraska. The program focuses on improving the economic success and school readiness of vulnerable children and families in three Nebraska counties: Scotts Bluff, Morrill, and Box Butte. During my visit, I met with Dawn, one of the program participants, who told me what it was like for her to work with a home visitor. Her home visitor helped her find a stable home and a steady income to provide for her growing family. These are the types of outcomes we should be expecting when we have programs to help those who are struggling to get ahead. MIECHV works because funding is tied to evidence. Unfortunately, MIECHV is the exception, as few Federal social programs have been evaluated at all, and almost none condition funding on evidence of whether the program actually works. In the Better Way agenda put forward by House Republicans last year, we proposed doing more of what MIECHV does: measuring how well programs are working to focus funding on those which produce real results. When we spend limited taxpayer dollars to help those in need, we must make sure we are spending money on effective programs. To do otherwise is a disservice to both taxpayers as well as those we are seeking to help. On March 15 of this year, the Human Resources Subcommittee held a hearing on MIECHV. In the hearing, we heard from those with firsthand experience with home visiting programs, and their input was invaluable as we developed this proposal. Both before and after the hearing, we sought input from States and others about how the program was working and how it could be improved and strengthened. These conversations also informed the bill before us today. I should also note, there is broad bipartisan support for MIECHV, including from dozens of national organizations and hundreds of State and local organizations, including business leaders, law enforcement officers, faith based groups, healthcare providers, child welfare advocacy organizations, and early education providers. While I understand some of my colleagues would like to continue this program or even increase its funding without an offset, under the rules that govern this Chamber and our current deficits, it would be irresponsible and against the rules of this Chamber to fund this program without finding ways to reduce spending elsewhere. That is why we are considering this as part of a package of two bills today: this bill and the Control Unlawful Fugitive Felons Act of 2017, which will be considered later this week during its own debate. Instead of increasing our Nation’s debt, we should be doing more of what we are doing here today: prioritizing Federal spending and focusing on what works by improving the integrity of one program to provide funding for another. Madam Chair, I am grateful for the time we are spending here today to consider the reauthorization of this important program, and I appreciate the opportunity to stand in support of this bill today. I reserve the balance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE , Washington, DC, September 18, 2017. Hon. KEVIN BRADY , Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC. DEARCHAIRMAN BRADY : I write concerning H.R. 2824, Increasing Opportunity through 
EvidenceBased Home Visiting Act, which was additionally referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce. I wanted to notify you that the Committee will forgo action on H.R. 2824 so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for consideration. This is done with the understanding that the Committee’s jurisdictional interests over this and similar legislation are in no way diminished or altered. In addition, the Committee reserves the right to seek conferees on H.R. 2824 and requests your support when such a request is made. I would appreciate your response confirming this understanding with respect to H.R. 2824 and ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during consideration of the bill on the House floor. Sincerely, GREGWALDEN , Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS , Washington, DC, September 18, 2017. Hon. GREGWALDEN , Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC. DEAR CHAIRMAN WALDEN : Thank you for your letter concerning H.R. 2824, the ‘‘Increasing Opportunity through Evidence Based Home Visiting Act,’’ on which the Energy and Commerce Committee was granted an additional referral. I am most appreciative of your decision to waive formal consideration of H.R. 2824 so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor. I acknowledge that although you waived formal consideration of the bill, the Energy and Commerce Committee is in no way waiving its jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in those provisions of the bill that fall within your Rule X jurisdiction. I would support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees on any HouseSenate conference involving this legislation. I will include a copy of our letters in our committee report and in the Congressional Record during consideration of this legislation on the House floor. Sincerely, KEVIN BRADY , Chairman. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Chair, following the wisdom of Frederick Douglass, who said it is easier to build strong families, strong children, than to repair broken men, I introduced my first bipartisan home visiting bill over a decade ago, in 2005. Since 2005, home visiting has been uniquely bipartisan—until today. Research is clear. Home visiting makes kids and families stronger, healthier, and safer. In my home State of Illinois, MIECHV improved program coordination, reinforced the emphasis on proven models, and expanded availability of services. Unfortunately, the majority’s approach has rejected bipartisanship and made timely reauthorization of home visiting less likely. H.R. 2824 presents substantial cuts to home visiting and threatens the effectiveness of services for vulnerable children and families. Equally bad, the rule under which we are considering this bill conditions home visiting help to vulnerable families on harming seniors and persons with disabilities. Although we are not voting on that provision today, the rule we are considering this bill under makes it an inescapable part of it. I join with over 110 civil rights, disability, and aging agencies to strongly oppose the Republican effort to pay for home visiting services that strengthen vulnerable children by stripping certain lowincome seniors and those with severe disabilities of basic income they need to survive. H.R. 2824 also is inconsistent with bipartisan Senate legislation introduced last week, which rejected the most controversial and problematic changes in H.R. 2824 in order to keep what works. So what should the House have done instead of H.R. 2824? 826 organizations urged the House and Senate leaders to ‘‘reauthorize this important program for 5 years, with a doubling of funding from $400 million, annually, to $800 million, annually, to allow States, territories, and Tribes to expand these services to more children and families.’’ Yet H.R. 2824 fails to increase funding by even one penny. Currently, MIECHV dollars serve only about 6 percent of eligible families and less than 50 percent of eligible Tribes. I tried to offer a fully paidfor alternative to double funding for home visiting over 5 years without harmful policy changes but was not allowed a vote in committee or on the floor. One of the most harmful policy changes is a new ‘‘State match’’ requirement, which would be in addition to the ‘‘maintenance of effort’’ requirement already in law. Just as with their failed healthcare bill, this Republican bill pushes their fight to make States pay more for services, while harming vulnerable children and families as collateral damage. There is no doubt that the State match in this bill will reduce home visiting in many States and Tribes, cut services, and harm families. The Republican bill further undermines successful home visiting by changing it from a program to improve child development and parentchild relationships to a failed jobs program. Defining a core outcome of MIECHV as increased employment and earnings will gut Federal home visiting. Not one—not one—of the evidencebased models is a job training program. Not one. This bill says, if any program wants to improve economic selfsufficiency, it shall include employment and earnings. Further, the bill applies stringent, unrealistic outcome standards. H.R. 2824 is failure by design for home visiting. Later today, I urge my colleagues to support Congressman PASCRELL ’s amendment to strike this change. After a decade of bipartisan efforts to increase Federal funds for home visiting, I am deeply saddened that H.R. 2824 now is the House Republican priority list for cutting funding, reducing services, and undermining the infrastructure that so many have worked to build. I unequivocally oppose this harmful bill and its discriminatory payfor, joining the good company of the NAACP, the American Academy of Pediatrics, Justice in Aging, National Women’s Law Center, and the Arc of the United States, to name just a few. I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 2824 so that we can move quickly on to a bipartisan approach which builds on home visiting’s considerable strength. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. b1400 Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MEEHAN). Mr. MEEHAN. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to express my deep appreciation for the opportunity to join in this advocacy for this very important bill. One of the great frustrations I know I share is when we have to make choices, and I see people come to me and they want us to increase the funding for those who are on the front lines fighting for our country, to increase the funding for those who are suffering from diseases, to increase the funding to protect senior citizens in various capacities, and every one of them tears at your heartstrings. That is why, to me, it is such an incredible accomplishment when you are able, at this particular period of time, with huge deficits, to be able to fight to make sure that we can retain the funding to drive a fundamental program. The chairman has done that in this case, and I find the arguments to double that to be just a Trojan horse, an impediment to helping us take a meaningful program and make sure that it is authorized and supported. In April, I visited the CrozerKeystone Community Foundation in my own district. The foundation operates MIECHV and uses the NurseFamily Partnership model to serve women and families in Delaware County. The model enables nurses to conduct regular home visits for firsttime mothers and their children who are less than 2 yearsold. It is designed to improve prenatal health and outcomes, improve child health and development, and improve families’ economic selfsufficiency. The success is evident to the experience of the women and families in the programs. In fact, the NurseFamily Partnership model has been shown to reduce child abuse by 48 percent, reduce emergency room visits for accidents and poisonings by 58 percent, and reduce behavioral and intellectual problems by age 6 by 67 percent. A study found that $6 is returned to the community for every dollar it invests in the program. Did you hear that? For every dollar the community invests, they will get $6; so it is not wrong to ask our partners in the States to match this commitment. In fact, my own State of Pennsylvania, I am proud to say it has actually exceeded the 
matching because they know it works and it makes a true partnership with the States. So I want to, once again, conclude by applauding the efforts of the chairman to position this in such a way for us to be able to move forward, to create the opportunity for this genuine partnership, to move on, on behalf of the—not programs just like the NurseFamily Partnership, but the broad spectrum that are supported. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN). (Mr. LEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LEVIN. Madam Chair, I am disappointed that this bill, H.R. 2824, injects needless controversy into reauthorizing the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program. Home visiting is an evidencebased approach that connects pregnant women and families with young children to nurses, social workers, and other professionals. Through these programs, parents learn skills that help reduce abuse and neglect and improve child development during the crucial early years of life. Most importantly, home visiting is backed by strong evidence that shows these programs are an effective way to improve outcomes for atrisk families. Unfortunately, H.R. 2824 ignores the proven successes of home visiting in favor of harmful, partisan changes to the law. In particular, I am troubled by language in this bill that would cut off funding to States and Tribal organizations that are unable to match Federal spending on home visiting. The bipartisan bill in the Senate does not do that; you do. Advocates are concerned that this could cause States to scale back or even end their programs altogether. In addition, this bill makes a number of illadvised changes that have little or no apparent justification. Research shows that home visiting programs are working well, yet only 6 percent of eligible individuals currently participate. We should be looking at expanding, not undermining, access to home visiting. We need, at the very least, a clean bill that reauthorizes the home visiting program in a bipartisan way. Unfortunately, H.R. 2824 is not that bill, and, for that reason, I urge that we vote ‘‘no.’’ Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Chair, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. BISHOP ). Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Madam Chair, I thank Chairman SMITH for yielding and for his hard work and leadership on this matter. Madam Chair, I rise today to support H.R. 2824, which would reauthorize the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program. At its core, MIECHV improve the lives of families in atrisk communities, focusing on the first years of a child’s life. Like the chairman, I, too, have seen firsthand its successes. I recently traveled to a NurseFamily Partnership facility, which is a nonprofit that arranges home visits from registered nurses to lowincome, firsttime mothers. I had the opportunity to meet the nurses and the women who currently are enrolled in the program. NFP facilities transform the lives of vulnerable firsttime moms and their babies, empowering them to build brighter futures and stronger families, none of which would be possible without MIECHV funding. I am proud to note that, like my previous speaker, my home State of Michigan has already taken the initiative to invest significant funding for the NFP facilities and other organizations, in addition to MIECHV funds, to the extent that Michigan would now already meet the requirement proposed in the bill. I am particularly thankful for the chairman’s transparent engagement process within the committee, specifically, early on. I raised the concern that the addition of new evidence standards, along with substantial evidence standards already in place, might be problematic, and I wanted to ensure that home visitors were not overly burdened by data collecting so that they can care for the mothers and the babies. Both of these concerns were addressed with the amendments contained in the chairman’s amendment, and I want to thank Chairman SMITH and Chairman BRADY for their leadership in addressing these concerns and other concerns. I want to thank the chairman for all of his hard work, and I want to join him and my colleagues in supporting H.R. 2824. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT ), who has long been a champion on these issues. Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Chair, across our country, there are thousands of children, thousands of families, that have a really big stake in what happens with this bill. I support evidencebased home visiting programs, and I support them not just by talking about them, but by providing them the resources they need to reach more children and make a difference in their lives. This whole program, ‘‘home visiting,’’ is a little bit of a misnomer. This is not about going out to pay a social visit, to join a club or something. This is about skilled professionals working with young parents to help them be the parents they want to be. It is about family values. It is about strengthening and protecting families, particularly disadvantaged families. Our home visiting programs give these families the tools that they need. I have seen how successful they have been in San Antonio, in San Marcos, in Austin, and across Texas. A story was shared with me recently when I met with Alaska and Jimmy Martinez from San Antonio. During their first year in college, Alaska became pregnant. She felt she was going to have to drop out of school, and then they met with Susan, with the Nurse Family Partnership there in San Antonio, and she gave them some referrals and some assistance. They were able to learn more about the development of their child and how they could prepare their family for that child’s arrival. Now, Alaska is about to finish her associate’s degree. Jimmy is pursuing his business degree, and they are happy to have a beautiful 2yearold son. That is the way this program is supposed to work so people don’t sink into poverty. They are lifted up and so are their children. This is just one of thousands of success stories from across the country—the family that unexpectedly finds they have a child with severe disabilities, or maybe just the more common experience of the family that has a baby who cries all night long, and they don’t know what to do about it. Too often, that is the kind of thing that ends up in a slap here, a slap there, and child abuse. Too often, it ends up with that child just being put in front of the television set instead of working with the child to deal with these reallife problems. Some reforms were mentioned, alleged reforms, in this bill. I have served on this subcommittee through a number of terms of Congress. We have had some excellent witnesses, Republican and Democratic, and I have yet to hear a single witness call for a single one of the changes that they are proposing to impose on this program as obstacles to its success. We haven’t had an academic expert. We haven’t had a stakeholder. We haven’t had a single witness come forward and say: Please change this program so it cannot achieve the success that it is having today. This is an evidencebased program. What does that mean? It means it is based on fact, not just on hope or good intention, as a number of our programs are. It means there is peerreviewed data showing that this program works to reduce child abuse and to solve other problems. The chairman, the advocate for this bill, tells me that they recognize this in the great Republican blueprint, and they want to do more of this. Well, if they want to do more of this, why are they creating one obstacle after another and causing one group after another to oppose those changes? What about the resources to get the job done? As so many of the Republican witnesses before our subcommittee have acknowledged, we are helping a fraction of the children who are eligible for these kind of services. I think you could call this bill the Republican 6 percent solution, because about 94 percent of eligible families in America don’t get a penny of assistance out of this program. This program 
that they say is so good, they want to praise it as an evidencebased program—and well they should, and well they have in the course of the several years I have served on the committee— this program is frozen at the same amount of funds that it had 5 years ago. Though the need has grown, though the fraction of children who are served is minuscule compared with the need, they refuse to provide the resources to help other families like Alaska and Jimmy’s. It is clear, we can’t just throw money at this problem or any other, but sometimes the only substitute that I hear from my Republican colleagues is to throw words at the problem like we have heard today: caring, soothing, empathetic words, but words that are no substitute for meaningful action. Indeed, it is great to hear about support for an evidencebased program. Where is the evidence for these changes? The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Chair, where is the evidence today? It couldn’t be produced in committee. Where is the evidence for one of these changes? Where is the evidence for freezing this funding? We proposed to fully fund it, and I proposed to do it with a simple tax compliance measure that wouldn’t have raised taxes on anyone, but it would have provided the resources for this home visiting program to do its intended purpose. This measure, as proposed, should be rejected, and we ought to support genuine home visiting that reaches more American families and protects them, just as it has for so many families in Texas. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. ESTES). Mr. ESTES of Kansas. Madam Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 2824, the Increasing Opportunity and Success for Children and Parents through EvidenceBased Home Visiting Act. We need more support for early childhood, and to support families in that effort. They need to be evidencebased programs to ensure that we get more of the right beneficial programs implemented. This bill seeks to strengthen the home visiting services to families in atrisk communities, and that is important because it will help reduce infant abuse and neglect across America. The law’s six benchmark areas will improve maternal and newborn health and will increase families’ economic selfsufficiency. It also looks to better the coordination between community resources. I would like to thank Chairman BRADY and Chairman S MITH for putting forth this piece of legislation. b1415 Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. THOMP SON). Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank Mr. DAVIS for his great leadership on this issue. Madam Chair, I rise today in opposition to this bill. Since its inception, MIECHV has been universally hailed as a tremendous success. It works, and it is cost effective. Participants like it; State and local governments like it; Democrats like it; and Republicans like it. It helps young families get off to a running start and makes sure that kids get the hand they need to stay on track. I have seen this program work. The NurseFamily Partnership program in Solano County, in my district, helps moms get the care and the support they need to have a healthy pregnancy and to learn to care for their babies. Home visits teach these new young moms the basics of raising healthy kids, helping them become more self sufficient. But instead of building on these successes and giving community programs the support they have been asking for, today the Republicans are focusing on undermining a great record of progress. Take, for instance, the new matching requirements in this bill. When Congress created MIECHV, we authorized money for Tribes that don’t have the resources to build home visiting programs on their own. This bill would force those Tribes to attribute matching money—which they don’t have—to keep their program going. That is a death sentence to Tribal programs like the one in my district in Lake County, California. With the passage of this bill, we are shortchanging hundreds of vulnerable families that rely on these programs. In addition, poor communities—not just Tribal communities, but poor communities across the country—have the same funding challenges, and these are most often the areas that benefit the most from MIECHV. This bill hurts people in those communities. With this bill, we are not empowering communities to raise healthy children; we are undermining a great bipartisan program, and for that I stand in opposition to this piece of legislation. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. WALORSKI ). Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Chair, I appreciate Chairman SMITH’s support and the work he has done on this bill. Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of the Increasing Opportunity and Success for Children and Parents Through EvidenceBased Home Visiting Act. In my home State of Indiana, three of the nine counties eligible for MIECHV funds are in my district. In April, I had the pleasure of visiting with Healthy Families St. Joseph County to hear firsthand the good work they are doing in Indiana’s Second District. I heard from a single mom who had no job, no place to live, and very little money when she gave birth to her son; but with the help of Healthy Families, she turned long odds into success. The mother gained confidence to raise her son, and her son gained a shot at a thriving life that he may not have had without this program. Home visitors helped over 2,600 Hoosier families in situations like this in Indiana last year. MIECHV is a program that gets results. It works. We know this because of the statistics, but we hear it in the stories that they share with us. Parents get the tools and the confidence they need to raise their children. This improves outcomes for their children in the really early critical years and sets them on a better path as they grow up. The program helps to root out deeper issues like drug abuse and domestic violence that destroy families and hinder a child’s development. If there is one thing I have learned as I have heard from people in my district who successfully broke the cycle of poverty, it is this: It is one thing to provide money, but if that money comes on a onesizefitsall basis, people cannot break the cycle. Checking a box doesn’t break the cycle. Human interaction, looking at each person as an individual and not just a number, resolving underlying issues unique to each person’s situation, and having a person coming alongside, saying, ‘‘I am with you; let’s do this together’’ breaks the cycle. MIECHV is a great example of a program that does this. Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. CASTOR). Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Chair, I thank Mr. DAVIS for his outstanding advocacy on behalf of families all across America. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2824 because this Republican bill throws up unnecessary bureaucratic hoops and roadblocks to the progress we have made under the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting initiative. It is smart policy to target resources and community experts to families who are most at risk back home. I have seen it in action back home in Tampa, Florida, where experts simply go to the home and explain to parents the importance of reading to your young child to get them ready for school, the importance of sleep, healthy habits, turning off the TV, and focusing on being a family unit. That is why it is so unfortunate that the Republicans are targeting the progress we have made. We are smarter now. We understand what is successful, and, unfortunately, H.R. 2824 would undermine successful home visiting initiatives by making policy changes that no expert has 
asked for. Indeed, I checked with my folks back home at the University of South Florida and on the ground there across the Tampa Bay area, and they say that, no, this bill will jeopardize the progress that we are making right now. In fact, they think that the match requirement will bring to an end the progress that we have been able to make because of the pressure on our State budget. The way forward is through the bill that my colleagues—Mr. DAVIS, Mr. DOGGETT , Ms. D EGETTE —and I have charted under H.R. 3525, which is a fairly clean reauthorization that doubles down on what works and doesn’t invest in the bureaucratic red tape that simply is not going to help a family succeed. So, Madam Chair, I urge the House to defeat this bill and, instead, to work in a bipartisan fashion. The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Chairwoman, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 15 seconds. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Chair, instead, I urge the House to defeat this bill that is not recommended by anyone in the field. Instead, let’s work in a bipartisan way on what works, what saves taxpayers’ money in the long run, and, most importantly, what truly boosts families. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Chair, I just want to add for the RECORD that the State of Florida matches their funds more than 2 to 1 already, so I am anxious to present the data here as it becomes necessary and is helpful to the exchange here. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time to close. Madam Chair, we know that home visiting works. There is no doubt about it. It is evidence based. Nobody has spoken anything that one would say it was not needed. It works for families and children in communities across our country. We agree about that on a bipartisan basis. So we should not be here today debating a partisan bill, a bill that home visiting experts say poses a risk to the program’s survival. We should be moving forward on a bipartisan bill without policy changes that might shut down home visiting in some communities or set it up for failure. I hope that my colleagues will vote for the amendments being offered today that will improve the bill, but I also have some concerns about the State match. No matter what we say, think of States and territories that have just been devastated by the floods and hurricanes. It is going to be very difficult for them to come up with the match money to keep some programs alive. So I hope that my colleagues will vote for the amendments being offered today that will improve the bill. I regret that there will not be enough of them to make this the bill that we had hoped it would be. Madam Chairwoman, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Again, I would like to take this time to thank my colleagues for taking the time to consider the reauthorization of this important program. The MIECHV Program has bipartisan support due to its focus on achieving real results for families. This program works because its funding is tied to real evidence. It is imperative that we continue this program in a responsible way, partnering with States to increase the program’s success. I might repeat that for emphasis. It is imperative that we continue this program in a responsible way—a reasonable way, I will add—as we partner with States to increase the program’s success. This bill shows how we can prioritize our Federal spending, focusing on programs with evidence that shows they actually work. I look forward to moving this bill forward to reauthorize the MIECHV Program so more Americans can get the help they need to get ahead. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5 minute rule. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Ways and Means, printed in the bill, it shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the 5 minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115–33.

AMENDMENT NO . 1 OFFERED BY MR . SMITH OF  
The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in House Report 115–331. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 5, beginning on line 17, strike ‘‘of the service delivery model or models that the eligible entity may need to develop for the model to operate’’ and inserting ‘‘to operate at least 1 approved model of home visiting’’. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 533, the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. SMITH) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nebraska. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Chair, this amendment seeks to establish a careful balance between two competing views in regards to where and how home visiting programs 
should be operated. The law requires States to operate home visiting programs in areas of highest need. However, some States expressed concern that they have been required to operate home visiting programs in areas where they were likely to fail, as they were not permitted to take into account staff and community resources and other requirements of a home visiting model when choosing where to operate. In the bill I introduced with my colleagues, we allowed States to take these considerations into account, and States were generally pleased with this change. However, since the introduction of the bill, we have received additional feedback that some changes might be needed to make sure States could take into account these factors but not simply avoid serving actual areas with the highest need, including rural areas and remote areas that I represent, as well as others. During the Ways and Means markup of this bill, Representative SEWELL offered an amendment to address this problem. Although we did not include her actual amendment in the reported bill, as we did not have enough time to review it and consider any unintended consequences, Representative SEWELL  and I have been able to review her proposal since the markup and discuss its implications. I am pleased today to offer this bipartisan amendment to address the concerns she and others have raised. Specifically, this amendment, combined with the language in the underlying bill, allows States to take into account staffing, community resources, and other requirements when determining how to operate their home visiting programs, while requiring that they operate at least one home visiting model in those communities with a high need for services. This ensures States do not shy away from some of the most difficult areas, which are often those that need home visiting services the most. I am glad we have been able to work together on this bipartisan amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support the amendment as well as the underlying bill. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. SIMPSON ). Without objection, the gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. First, I would like to thank Chairman BRADY  as well as Chairman SMITH for honoring their commitment to work with me to ensure that the most needy rural communities are not neglected in this bill. I am glad to see that the language I proposed during the committee markup last week has been included in the Smith amendment. b1430 Both my friend from Nebraska and I represent rural America, and we understand the obstacles that our rural constituents confront on a daily basis. Moreover, we both believe in the mission of the MIECHV Program, and we see how effective it has been in both rural and urban communities. One of the reasons why the MIECHV Program is good policy is because of the program’s flexibility. While models like the NurseFamily Partnership can be successful in urban and suburban areas, other evidencebased models like HIPPY—or Home Instruction for Parents of Preschool Youngsters—can be incredibly effective in rural areas that tend to have fewer resources. This amendment language, which I offered during the committee markup, ensures that rural communities with little resources are not skipped over. This is a simple and commonsense fix that has bipartisan support as well as the support from the Home Visiting Coalition. While I appreciate my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for working with me to fix this language, I have to say that I am disappointed that none of the other commonsense amendments offered by my Democratic colleagues were accepted during the markup. For years, the MIECHV Program has enjoyed bipartisan support, but I am afraid that Republican changes in the underlying legislation we are considering today, I believe, will hurt the MIECHV recipients in the longterm viability of the program. While I oppose the final passage of the underlying bill, I, again, want to thank my friend from Nebraska, as well as Chairman BRADY , for accepting my markup amendment language, and I urge my colleagues to support the Smith amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Chairman, again, I am grateful that Ms. SEWELL and I could work together to come up with this amendment. I certainly urge its adoption as we do move forward with the bill. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. SMITH). The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO . 2 OFFERED BY MR . PASCRELL  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in House Report 115–331. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 533, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PASCRELL ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chair, this amendment would strike the provision in the bill that would add increasing employment and earnings to the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, or MIECHV, as it is generally referred to. I, obviously, share the goal of increasing employment and earnings across the country. However, home visiting is not an employment program. It is a program to strengthen families to make kids healthier, safer, and more ready to learn when they start school. Those are the outcomes home visiting models strive for, and those are the outcomes they achieve. I mentioned the other day in the Ways and Means Committee that I know the good that these programs do firsthand. In Passaic County—because most of these programs are run through counties throughout America—our home visiting program worked with a pregnant mom expecting a child with a heart defect. The baby required open heart surgery shortly after being born last July. After the surgery, the newborn continued to have health complications. At times, his mom felt depressed and hopeless and feared that her child was not going to survive. The home visiting program’s family support worker was able to assist the mom by connecting her to services, providing her with emotional support, and acting as a liaison with the hospital where her son was. We know the negative impact that postpartum depression can have on new moms and their babies. The home visiting program was able to connect this mom to supportive services and resources and alleviate her depression so that she could be a healthy and pleasant mom. I am happy to report that, after nearly 3 months in the hospital, this little boy was finally able to go home, and his mother continues to work with the home visiting program in northern New Jersey. I don’t think anyone can hear that story and not see value in the services that were provided. The home visiting program helped a mom, like so many other mothers across America, navigate her newborn son’s healthcare crisis and manage the mental health issues associated with it. But under the provision that my amendment is seeking to strike from the bill, this outcome would not be measured as a success. There is something wrong with that. Most home visiting models focus on families with newborns or very small children and focus on building a parentchild bond. That is a fact. Many home visiting programs focus on teen parents and young mothers, and the priority is to keep them in school and make sure they continue their education. There are currently 18 evidencebased home visiting models. None of them 
provide employment services, none of them measure employment and earnings. Home visitors have raised concerns that having to ask families about employment and earnings would be intrusive when you know what the focus of the program is, and would undermine the relationship they are trying to build with families. Even if the data is collected without specifically asking families for it, knowing their performance is being measured based on their client’s labor force participation—here is the kernel of the issue—will likely make home visitors feel they have to press their clients to work even if, like in the case of the mom in Passaic County, that should not be the main object. Additionally, this bill provides no new funding. We are not asking for any new money here. Any resources devoted to supporting work would have to be diverted from MIECHV’s core purposes. I urge my colleagues, Mr. Chairman, to support this amendment to make sure children and families served by this program get the support and service that they truly need. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Chairman, since the creation of the MIECHV Program, States have been required to demonstrate their home visiting programs result in measurable improvements in six benchmark areas specified in the law. One of the benchmark areas States can choose to focus on is ‘‘improvements in family economic selfsufficiency.’’ Yet, as the result of changes made last year under the prior Presidential administration, ‘‘economic self sufficiency’’ no longer means what you think it means—increasing work and earnings. Instead, it was defined as whether you have health insurance or are in school. Clearly, this is not what Congress meant when the program was created and included the concept of economic selfsufficiency. So this bill would make sure that States, if they choose to focus on family economic selfsufficiency as one of the four benchmarks of the six, would measure employment and earnings as a part of that metric. Again, States can choose among six different benchmarks when they decide which home visiting programs to operate and what goals they would like to achieve within those previously established by Congress. They don’t have to choose this metric, as I mentioned earlier. However, when they do explicitly set out to increase economic selfsufficiency—emphasis on the economic—information on work and earnings must be part of what is measured to determine whether they have achieved their goal. I believe it is absolutely critical that this intent be restored in the law. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and support the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chairman, as I said, there are currently 18 evidence based home visiting models. Also, there is nothing added to the budget; no extra currency I am asking for. I would ask the sponsor of the bill what he would tell this woman from Passaic County, New Jersey, one of many examples that I have. I ask him what his answer would be to that woman. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Chairman, again, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment as well as support the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PASCRELL ). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO . 3 OFFERED BY MS . DELBENE  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in House Report 115–331. Ms. DELBENE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Page 9, line 16, strike ‘‘Organization’’ and all that follows through line 21 and insert ‘‘Organization, 100 percent.’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 533, the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. DELBENE) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Washington. Ms. DELBENE. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would eliminate the dangerous cuts to Tribes who don’t meet the bill’s match requirement. I urge all of my colleagues to support it. I am proud to represent a number of Tribal communities in the Puget Sound region that each have a rich history, identity, and culture. But they face unique challenges. The need for home visiting services is particularly high among American Indians and Alaska Natives. Young people who live on reservations are twice as likely to become teen parents. Nearly threefourths of the parents served by Tribal home visiting services live below the Federal poverty level. And the majority of Tribal beneficiaries have less than a high school diploma. The good news is that Tribes are already using home visiting resources to implement evidencebased models that have decreased depression, substance abuse, and stress among parents, while improving health among children. Seventyseven percent of Tribal home visiting programs have improved family outcomes in at least four different areas, such as improving maternal and newborn health, increasing school readiness, reducing domestic violence, and strengthening parents’ economic selfsufficiency. The bad news is the need for help in Indian Country has far exceeded the limited funding available through the home visiting program. In fact, less than half of qualified applications for Tribal home visiting can be granted under the current funding levels. Some States have tried to address these shortages with State resources, like my home State of Washington, which has voluntarily used State funding to meet the needs of Tribal families. But it is not enough. The underlying bill provides no new resources to address the nationwide shortfall in Tribal funding. Instead, it adds a match requirement that could be the end of home visiting on reservations altogether. Most Indian Tribes struggle economically and already face challenges providing help to families. I understand that Tribal administrators have said almost none of them could meet the match requirement in this legislation. Indian Tribes have also generally considered Federal match requirements to be a violation of Tribal sovereignty. As such, they may have to refuse the funds and shut down home visiting programs if the bill is enacted with the match requirement. I appreciate that the chairman has delayed the implementation of the Tribal match and reduced it to 30 percent. But, realistically, the effect will be simply to give Tribes more time to shut down their home visiting programs. The match requirement will still be completely unworkable for them in 2022. The Federal Government has a responsibility to our Tribal communities to do everything we can to support their people, strengthen their families, and expand economic opportunity. Mr. Chairman, the underlying bill takes a dangerous step in the wrong direction for our Tribes, but we still have the opportunity to stop it. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on my amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR.

AMENDMENT NO . 4 OFFERED BY MRS . MURPHY OF  
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in House Report 115–331. 
Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: 
Section 511(j) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 711(j)) is amended by adding at the end the following: ‘‘(4) ALLOCATION OF FUNDS .—To the extent that the grant amount awarded under this section to an eligible entity is determined on the basis of relative population or poverty considerations, the Secretary shall make the determination using the most accurate Federal data available for the eligible entity.’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 533, the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. MURPHY ) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida. Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my bipartisan amendment, which is cosponsored by Congresswoman JENNIFFER GONZA´LEZ COLO´Nfrom Puerto Rico and Congresswoman NYDIA VELA´ZQUEZ from New York. The American citizens in Puerto Rico and the neighboring U.S. Virgin Islands are enduring an incredibly difficult situation in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria. As a Member whose central Florida district is home to over 100,000 individuals of Puerto Rican heritage, I join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have made crystal clear to our brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands that they will receive all the Federal support they need to stabilize the situation in the short term, to rebuild in the medium term, and to emerge stronger in the long term. We are part of one American family. And like any closeknit family, we always have each other’s backs, especially when times are tough. My amendment will ensure that Puerto Rico and the other U.S. territories are treated equally under the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, which the underlying bill reauthorizes. The amendment will implement a recommendation made by the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Task Force on Economic Growth in Puerto Rico. This Federal program provides annual grants to States and territories to fund home visiting services for families with young children. Visits are conducted by social workers and other professionals. They provide parenting education and other support services with a goal of helping atrisk families succeed. It is a great program that invests in children and families, helps lift them out of poverty, and increases the chance that they will become productive and successful members of society. In theory, the program treats States and territories equally when it comes to the distribution of grant funding. In practice, however, Puerto Rico is treated unfairly. The Department of Health and Human Services makes allocations based, in part, on a U.S. Census Bureau data product on childhood poverty, but that data does not include information on Puerto Rico or the other territories. Therefore, Puerto Rico always receives the minimum grant allowed by the law, even though the island of 3.4 million has a high rate of childhood poverty. My amendment would simply require HHS, when making grants, to use the best Federal data available for every State and territory and to use an appropriate alternative data source, if necessary, in the case of Puerto Rico. This will ensure that Puerto Rico receives its fair share of funding and not one penny more and not one penny less. I hope my colleagues will support this amendment and that we will continue to do everything possible to help our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment, even though I am not opposed to it. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment, the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, that is designed to serve families with young children living in communities at risk of a range of negative outcomes. Today, HHS allocates money for MIECHV based on the share of children under age 5 in families at or below 100 percent of the Federal poverty line living in each State and territory. It is imperative that the distribution of funds is done using the most accurate and uptodate information so we can use our limited resources to target those most in need. I thank the sponsors of this amendment, Representatives MURPHY , GONZA´LEZCOLO´N, and V ELA´ZQUEZ , for bringing this issue to our attention and for offering this amendment. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, in closing, I would simply reiterate my hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Chairman, I urge support of this amendment and the underlying bill so that we can help children. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. MURPHY ). The amendment was agreed to. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. RICE of South Carolina) having assumed the chair, Mr. SIMPSON , Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2824) to amend title V of the Social Security Act to extend the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, had come to no resolution thereon. 
RECESS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair declares the House in recess subject to the call of the Chair. Accordingly (at 2 o’clock and 51 minutes p.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b1514 AFTER RECESS The recess having expired, the House was called to order by the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. UPTON ) at 3 o’clock and 14 minutes p.m.

The question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. COLLINS of Georgia) having assumed the chair, Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2824) to amend title V of the Social Security Act to extend the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, and pursuant to House Resolution 533, he reported the bill back to the House with an amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is ordered. Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. MOTION TO RECOMMIT  
Ms. D ELBENE. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill? Ms. DELBENE. Mr. Speaker, I am opposed in the current form. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: 
Ms. DelBene moves to recommit the bill H.R. 2824 to the Committee on Ways and Means with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith with the following amendment: Strike sections 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Washington is recognized for 5 minutes. b1545 Ms. DELBENE. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended. Like all my colleagues on this side of the aisle, I strongly support reauthorization of the home visiting program before it expires on September 30. We know it has an incredible track record of success improving child and family outcomes in our most vulnerable communities. We also support a timely reauthorization of the program before its expiration, to ensure families across the country who are benefiting from home visiting do not face a disruption in services. Unfortunately, Republicans have put forward a partisan bill with reckless policy changes that are not supported by experts and with only three legislative days remaining. It is incredibly disappointing, Mr. Speaker. Earlier this summer, I got to see firsthand how impactful this program 
can be. The families who choose to participate receive regular home visits from nurses and social workers, often from the same neighborhoods, who help to create healthy and supportive home environments for children and parents alike—parents like Jessie, from my home State of Washington, who struggled before she got connected with home visiting. Jessie says: ‘‘Home visiting changed my life and helped me break the cycle of poor parenting.’’ The results can’t be denied. It has been shown to reduce the likelihood of child abuse and neglect by 50 percent, while, at the same time, reducing domestic violence, improving children’s school readiness, and increasing parents’ selfsufficiency and economic wellbeing. It is precisely the kind of evidence based model that we know gives us a great return. Unfortunately, there are huge unmet needs for home visiting services across the country. Last year, more than 29,000 eligible families were unserved in Washington State alone. That is why I am so disappointed this legislation fails to make the meaningful investments we need to lift more families out of poverty and into the middle class. Democrats even offered a proposal to double funding over 5 years, which was fully paid for, but the majority refused to allow a vote. Instead, they have included objectionable policy changes that are not supported by experts who have said the bill’s matching requirement for States is the single greatest threat to home visiting. We should not be taking steps that undermine the program or that reduce the number of States and communities that are working to help families thrive. We should also not have waited to consider this issue until days before the program expires, like we have done with the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, the Community Health Center Fund, the National Health Service Corps, and so many other programs that are essential for the children and families that we represent. It is unacceptable that so many programs are at risk due to Congressional inaction. We need to do a better job of providing families, States, and providers the longterm stability that they need. My amendment is a step in the right direction. It eliminates the bill’s dangerous policy changes and, instead, provides a clean, 5year reauthorization of the home visiting program, giving States, counties, and Tribes the tools and visibility they need to help more children and families succeed. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ‘‘yes.’’ Home visiting has a long history of bipartisan support, and I hope we can come together to take the program forward, not backward. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the motion to recommit the pending bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit. This bill is the result of an open process. In fact, several amendments were agreed to—in fact, one sponsored by my colleague who just spoke—and so I think we should reject this procedural motion so we can move on to pass a good underlying bill with modest reforms. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. 
Ms. D ELBENE. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 5 minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by a 5minute vote on the passage of the bill, if ordered. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were—ayes 191, noes 232, not voting 10, as follows:

APPOINTMENT OF INDIVIDUAL TO THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE DRUG POLICY COMMISSION The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair announces the Speaker’s appointment, pursuant to section 603 of the Department of State Authorities Act, Fiscal Year 2017 (Pub.L. 114–323), and the order of the House of January 3, 2017, of the following individual on the part of the House to the Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission: Mr. Matt Salmon of Mesa, Arizona 
CONGRATULATING DR. RORY COOPER (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an Army veteran and University of Pittsburgh engineer, Dr. Rory Cooper, for his achievements and impact on society. While serving as a soldier, Rory was injured in an accident that left him paralyzed from the waist down. Despite the challenges presented by his disability, Dr. Cooper earned his Ph.D. in electrical and computer science from the University of California, Santa Barbara. His education and passion for helping others with disabilities led him to found the Human Engineering Research Laboratories at the University of Pittsburgh. Along with his team of researchers, Dr. Cooper is credited with 25 patents that have significantly advanced wheelchair technology and benefited tens of thousands of veterans. Mr. Speaker, this week, Dr. Cooper will be presented with the Samuel J. Heyman Service to America Medal. I 
thank Dr. Cooper for his work and congratulate him on this achievement. 
DISAPPEARANCE OF MEXICAN STUDENTS NEEDS MORE INVESTIGATION (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, 3 years ago today, 43 students from Ayotzinapa, Mexico, disappeared. I recently traveled to Mexico where I spoke with many of their parents and the family members of the students who disappeared. I was humbled by the strength that they show. After a 3year struggle, they have asked for answers to two simple questions: What happened that night when their children were taken; and where are they now? On this third anniversary of their loss, I am repeating my past calls for the Mexican Government to prioritize their search for the students, to bring justice to those responsible for their disappearance, and to investigate any obstruction of justice. If the Mexican Government cannot do this, I urge them to allow the independent panel of experts to expand on their initial investigation. The students, their parents, and the Mexican people deserve answers. 
CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM IS A CONCERNING TREND (Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Speaker, September is the time when students return back to school, and it also marks Attendance Awareness Month. Chronic absenteeism is a concerning trend in my district in southwest Washington State and across America. In the 2013–2014 school year, more than 6.8 million students missed enough class to be considered chronically absent. My State of Washington has the second highest chronic absenteeism rate in the country, with 25 percent of students being chronically absent. We can do better. To understand the challenges locally, I recently met with several superintendents in southwest Washington, and there are a myriad of issues that these students are facing. We are trying to address some of these with H.R. 1864, the Chronic Absenteeism Reduction Act, which I have introduced with my Democratic colleague, TIMRYANfrom Ohio. This bill would empower schools to solve attendance problems locally, using such tactics as partnering with local health, transportation, and social service providers, and implementing schoolbased mentoring programs. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill. HELP FELLOW AMERICANS IN PUERTO RICO (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, we are right now witnessing a humanitarian crisis—not in some farflung corner of the world, but right here at home. Mr. Speaker, 31⁄2million of our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico, fellow U.S. citizens, are without water and without electricity, cut off from the rest of the world. These are our fellow Americans. Puerto Ricans are just as American as we are. They have fought in every single one of our American wars. They need our help now. This is what we do best as Americans. When there is a crisis, we come together and help our fellow Americans. We must act now. This should be the number one priority of Congress and the White House this week, and we should not leave here until we have let the millions of people in Puerto Rico know that we will be there for them. 
b1615 HONORING GOLD STAR MOTHERS (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, Sunday marked a special kind of Mother’s Day: Gold Star Mother’s Day. Since 1936, the Nation has observed Gold Star Mother’s Day on the last Sunday in September. The President humbly proclaimed Gold Star Mother’s and Families’ Day this Sunday, September 24. Our Gold Star Mothers should be honored and offered respect and gratitude for their personal sacrifice. Gold Star Mother’s Day is intended to pay tribute to women who have experienced tremendous personal loss on behalf of our country. Mr. Speaker, our Gold Star Mothers serve as a strength and inspiration for this country. They are part of an exclusive group, one that no one ever hopes to belong to. One can hardly imagine the deep pain and anguish that a mother experiences when losing a child, particularly in military action. May we always honor the Gold Star Mothers of America for their courage, their strength, and their sacrifice. They bear their cross with honor. The memory of their children lives on not only in their hearts, but in the heart of this Nation. 
TRADE AND JOBS HEARING IN BROOK PARK, OHIO (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, during the August recess, I organized a district field hearing to hear firsthand accounts from America’s workers, my constituents, on NAFTA’s disastrous job impacts. These voices must be heard and listened to as our Nation renegotiates NAFTA. These real stories are the people who live the impacts of Washington’s agreements. I thank the Local United Auto Workers Chapter 1250 for graciously hosting us, a region that lost over 14,500 jobs after NAFTA’s passage to Mexico and to Latin America. Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD  the testimony of Amy Hanauer of Policy Matters Ohio, Donnie Blatt of the United Steelworkers, and Mark Payne of the United Auto Workers. 
AMYHANAUER , POLICY MATTERS OHIO Representative Kaptur and others, thank you for the opportunity to testify today alongside these strong community leaders. I’m Amy Hanauer and I run Policy Matters Ohio, a policy research institute dedicated to creating a more vibrant equitable, sustainable, and inclusive Ohio. Find us online at www.policymattersohio.org. Trade and jobs in Ohio: Key principles to improve outcomes for workers NAFTA and other trade agreements have eliminated jobs in Ohio and the United States. Manufacturing remains an essential part of Ohio’s economy, despite its downturn. Smart policy can strengthen Ohio manufacturing while making our economy greener and stronger Some key recommendations include: Invest in infrastructure, particularly clean energy Invest in solar panels and wind turbines Structure these projects carefully, prioritizing good jobs and diverse workers Support American manufacturing through proven programs Support manufacturing extension programs Buy American when spending public dollars Support smart worker training Improve trade agreements Increase worker protections Improve environmental standards Eliminate special courts As we have long documented at Policy Matter, the North American Free Trade Agreement and other trade agreements have not accomplished what they were supposed to in Ohio. Our current trade rules favor multinational corporations and their investor over workers and citizens. As a result, these policies have reduced the quantity and quality of domestic jobs, thereby exacerbating wealth inequality. Many multinational corporations that once employed people here have instead located in places with lower wages, fewer environmental regulations, and weaker labor regulations. NAFTTA rules made that shift easier. One reason these deals have been so destructive is that they transfer power away from citizens and to international investors. They bar nations, states, and cities from enacting labor and environmental policies that protect the public. They block local governments from using policy to boost demand for domestic products, such as local sourcing. NAFTA was promoted as being broadly helpful to Americans and our trading partners. But the economist Susan Helper recently testified that NAFTA slowed wage growth in U.S. industries and regions. This hurt not just manufacturing workers, but also service employees, as displaced manufacturing workers sought jobs in restaurants and retail and as laidoff workers had less to 
spend in the economy. In Mexico as well, wages stayed mostly flat even though productivity increased. Mexican manufacturing wages remain well under 20% of U.S. manufacturing wages. The Economic Policy Institute found that NAFTA cost the U.S. 683,000 jobs from 1994 to 2010. Manufacturing, as a sector, lost the most, 60.8 percent. Geographically, Midwest states like Ohio took the hardest hit. NAFTA also displaced Mexican small farmers and business owners, and did not raise wages relative the U.S. Despite that, the treaty became a model for the World Trade Organization, China trade normalization, and other deals As a result of all of these, economist Jeff Faux estimates an additional net loss of 2.7 million U.S. jobs and economist Josh Bivens found that the typical American with just high school degree loses $1,800 a year. Manufacturing has declined, but remains an essential part of Ohio’s economy. One in eight Ohio employees works in manufacturing. We had 687,000 manufacturing workers in 2015: only California and Texas have more. Average wages of $1,119 a week were 24.9 percent higher than in other sectors. Ohio manufacturers contributed $108 billion to the economy in 2015, 17.8 percent of the total for the state. So that sector is responsible for one in every six dollars and one in every eight jobs in Ohio. The typical worker with a high school diploma and no college earns $2.99 more per hour in manufacturing. While the sector has generally lost employment over the past several decades and in the most recent recession, some signs point to a partial recovery. Good policy, including trade policy, can make this more likely. There are clear things we can do to improve policy so that workers and the environment on all sides of the border are better protected. At Policy Matters, we recommend three large policy priorities to address these issues: Invest in infrastructure, especially energy: America’s infrastructure is crumbling around us and we are completely underinvested in infrastructure that would reduce energy use and address other environmental problems. We should get to work now, upgrading, maintain, and building infrastructure that would strengthen our communities and make our planet more sustainable, and we should make sure that American products are used throughout these projects. To name a few priorities: We should install solar panels on every public building in the United States, buying from American companies and having unionized tradespeople do the installation. Right here in Cleveland there are entrepreneurs selling solar panels and they argue that even here in snowy Cleveland, many residential solar installations now pay for themselves in less than a decade and commercial systems will pay for themselve in less than six years. Representative Kaptur is a longtime champion of this approach, and Toledo, with its extensive glassmaking history, has a strong supply chain that could play a key role in this work. We should be installing wind turbines wherever appropriate, using Ohio’s substantial supply chain to produce component parts for these turbines. Here in Cleveland, we continue to want to see the Lake Erie Economic Development Company project build the first fresh water wind farm in the country on Lake Erie. We got some great news just this week that this project cleared another hurdle and is moving forward—but movement has been much slower than needed because public policy at the federal and state level just down no incentivize this kind of jobcreating energygenerating investment. These projects should be structured carefully. There are sound principles at the website millionsofjobs.org that I encourage you to look at, but some of the elements we support include supporting direct public investment, not tax giveaways for corporate subsidies and making sure that these projects are unionbuilt, have inclusive workforces that represent the diversity of the communities in which they’re being done, and have worker and environmental protections. SA mentioned, all of these projects should pay decent wages, should source from U.S. made products, and should prioritize the needs of disadvantaged communities—both urban and rural. Finally, these projects should be paid for through fair, progressive taxes so that the wealthiest Americans and giant corporations who reap the greatest economic benefit from public goods pay their fair share. Support American manufacturing through proven programs: Manufacturing Extension Partnerships (MEPs) help manufacturers work together to solve problems and find solutions to assist their sector. They assist with research and development, commercialization, joint marketing and branding, worker training, identifying new technology, share investments like makerspaces, and reshoring. The federal government should deepen investments in MEPs. Instead President Trump’s budget proposal threatens to entirely eliminate this modest but successful program. Similarly, the manufacturing innovation institutes that have been so successful, including one in Youngstown, face 70% cuts in the Trump budget. Buy American: We should Buy America provisions for all public spending at all levels of government. Senators Rob Portman and Sherrod Brown have both voiced support for these important provisions and I would urge you to join in that support. The Trump Administration should apply Buy America to all federallyfunded infrastructure projects. President Trump’s intent in this area is not entirely clear and we should encourage him to make good on promise he has made to support American products. While Buy America rules apply to some federal infrastructure programs, many taxpayerfunded projects still lack rules requiring the use of Americanmade projects. Brown’s proposed legislation would ensure Buy America rules apply to all federallyassisted projects. Invest in worker training: The Workforce Investment and Opportunity Act, WIOA, trains and educates workers, focusing on career pathways and apprenticeships. By incorporating a strong understanding of the labor market, WIOA is transforming the workforce system for those who face significant barriers to employment. The act pushes the public sector to better serve lowskilled, low income adults so they can achieve not just selfsufficiency, but real economic mobility. Ohio trains have been working hard to take advantage of these new approaches. For Ohio workers who face barriers to employment and tough job markets, it’s essential that we all deliver. Yet, this program too is on the chopping block under the Trump Administration. The Trump budget calls for cuts of approximately $1 billion from the WIOA program. The cuts represent about a 40 percent reduction from current funding levels and would have devastating impacts on states and local communities seeking to address the kill needs of businesses and jobseekers. Instead of cutting WIOA, we should be enhancing it. Improve trade agreements. This encompasses three primary provisions. Increase worker protections. NAFTA has reduced bargaining power for workers in both the U.S. and Mexico. Workers and their representatives have little ability to object to sweatshop conditions or labor law violations. At most they can call for consultations that have no enforcement mechanisms. Investors have much more power to object and much stronger mechanisms to do so. Worker representatives from all countries in an agreement should be brought in to propose standards. I encourage this committee to consul the AFL–CIO (2017) and the Roosevelt Institute (Tucker, 2017) about how best to remedy this in renegotiation. Improve environmental protection. Environmental protections in NAFTA are relegated to side agreements with no enforcement provisions. This is why we’ve seen more use of polluting fossil fuels, less protection of greenspace and forests, and more deeply problematic mining since NAFTA. Other testimony today provides more detail on how best to address environmental concerns, but minimally, those who breathe the air, drink the water, and suffer from global warming should have as much power as multination corporations to raise their issues. (350.org et. Al, 2017) Eliminate special courts for investors. NAFTA established special courts where firms can challenge government policies that affect their investments. These ‘‘investor state dispute settlement’’ (ISDS) mechanisms undermine democracy and national sovereignty. This system should be eliminated so that citizens again have the ability to advocate for the laws they think will best protect their communities. In sum, there is much that federal policy can do to create fair trade, to promote American manufacturing, and to improve job quality and availability. We decide the kind of economy we want to have and we can choose one that does more for our families, communities, and planet. We appreciate your interest in exploring and further those policies. 
DONNIE BLATT , ASSISTANT TO THE DIRECTOR , UNITED STEELWORKERS —DISTRICT 1 I would like to thank the sponsors for holding this event, UAW Local 1250 and its officers and of course our great Congresswoman MARCY KAPTUR . Congresswoman KAPTUR has been a great public servant for many years and has been a great friend to the United Steelworkers, not only in her Congressional District but all over Ohio and our Nation. I want to thank her personally for her role in the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The United Steelworkers have been involved in the trade debate since NAFTA was incepted in 1994 and we are happy for include our voice going forward to again try to make trade competitive and fair for all workers, not just in the United States, but for the workers of our trading partners as well. As an International Union that represents workers in a wide range of sectors, not just steel but aluminum, tire and rubber, glass, paper, auto parts, fabrication, public sector and many more. We have a wide range of knowledge on trade and how trade affects not only the U.S. workers, but also the communities where they live. The biggest problem with NAFTA and similar trade agreements is that it allowed for multinational corporations to shift jobs wherever workers can be exploited and environmental regulations are the weakest. Even with the promises of great economic growth for all the U.S. Labor Department certified nearly 1 million manufacturing jobs has been lost just with the NAFTA agreement alone. With NAFTA and other NAFTAstyle trade policies such as Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China (PNTR), the Central 
America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) and the KoreaU.S. Free Trade Agreement (KORUS), the United States has closed roughly 60,000 manufacturing facilities here at home. To put things into perspective, this represents 3 times the number of people that live here in Brook Park, OH. If you would go around Brook Park today, every man you would see would be equal to 3 manufacturing facilities closed, for every woman you would see would be equal to 3 manufacturing facilities closed and for every child you would see would be equal to 3 manufacturing facilities closed. The 60,000 closed facilities equates to around 5 million lost manufacturing jobs. This number represents the entire population of the states of Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, North Dakota and South Dakota combined. It’s not just about manufacturing jobs, the U.S. has also experienced job loss in the sectors of computer programming, call centers, engineering and service sector jobs as well and many other employment sectors. In Ohio alone, since NAFTA, we have lost over 300,000 manufacturing jobs which is more than every man woman and child that lives in the city of Cincinnati. Along with the jobs that are lost directly in manufacturing, there are effects to the local community. First, because manufacturing jobs typically pay more than other jobs in the area, when they are lost there is a natural downward pressure that is put on wages and benefits to remaining jobs in the immediate area. Secondly, the combination of the lost manufacturing jobs and the downward pressure on the remaining jobs means less money for the community tax base, which affects the schools, police and fire departments, roads and bridges and other public services. This means the public sector workers are left struggling to maintain a decent standard of living for their families. Donald Trump has been right to highlight NAFTA and the impact it has had on our trade deficit. Yet his administration has failed to propose the bold changes needed to properly replace NAFTA, reduce our trade deficit, and create more manufacturing jobs that would raise wages for workers at home and abroad, as was promised. There are conditions needed in future trade agreements that the Trump Administration has not committed to, to make trade fair and a level playing field. First, we a strong and enforceable labor and environmental standard that will not only lift wages and protect jobs here at home, but will lift working conditions abroad. So far the Trump Administration only seeks to use the weak and unenforceable standards from previous agreements. Second, we ned to end investor state protections that make it easier for multinational corporations to shift jobs overseas and end investor state dispute settlements that allow corporations to sue the United States taxpayers because of a law that may protect its citizens yet may increase corporate production costs. Third, we need stronger rules of origin laws and close the back door that allows parts made in China and Vietnam and assembled in the United States and labeled made in the USA in order to get tariff relief protection. Tariff deduction should not be granted unless the majority of the product is made here at home. Lastly, we need to end the NAFTA ban on ‘‘Buy America’’ so tax dollars can be used as much as possible to create jobs that local communities desperately need. The White House plan to renegotiate NAFTA is vague on these four points. If the NAFTA renegotiations process is going to benefit American workers we have to hold the White House more accountable for these promised changes and more. Finally, the NAFTA renegotiations cannot be done behind closed doors with corporate advisors dictating the terms of the Agreement. This creates too many conflicts of interests. They must be transparent and exposed to public scrutiny. The United Steelworkers stand ready to lend their voice and resources to ensure these points are part of any NAFTA renegotiations. Thank You Congressman KAPTUR for your work and your consideration. 
NAFTA H EARING , MARKPAYNE  I am here to talk about manufacturing in Cleveland and the effect NAFTA has had on our Site. At one time our Site had over 14,000 workers. Our Aluminum Plant phased out 2005 and the equipment was loaded up and sent to Cifunza, Mexico. Our Casting Plant phased out in 2010 and its work was sent to Mexico and Tupy, Brazil. Engine Plant 2 Phased out in 2012 and is now sitting idle. This Plant won the Shingo Award for best quality! What is the common denominator here? Bad Trade Agreements!!!! We battled against the EPA Restrictions in the Casting Plant. We fought against low wages from other countries. How do you compete against poverty wages? Against lax EPA standards from other countries? Against a lack of investment in America? Across from our Union Hall once stood our Casting Plant, it is now just an open field . . . Was it dirty work, yes, but it was our work!!! Our workers know the effects of a bad Trade Agreement! But, we did not have a Level Playing field! Trade Agreements seeks to drive down our wages in a race to the bottom. The current Mexican auto worker wage has even fallen under NAFTA, from $3.95 an hour to $2.93 an hour. With fair competition we have proven that we will excel in the global marketplace. But we must have a living wage for a fair day of work. We must invest in America. The problem is our Trade agreements ‘‘perception’’ of progress, without making any. The problem is our trade agreements reward Companies that take work out of America. Are the Trade agreements unlocking the opportunities for America or are we just widening the lane for our jobs to leave America? Trades Agreements has cost Ohio over 323,000 manufacturing jobs. Under NAFTA the trade imbalance in the auto sector has grown from $3.5 billon in 1993 to $45.1 billion in 2016. Ford will say that they were only following their ‘‘Way Forward’’ Strategy. For Cleveland NAFTA has been a job killing strategy. No one can tell me that low wages mixed with lax EPA standards was not a part of Ford’s ‘‘Way Forward’’ decision to relocate our work. Nothing stings worse than having your jobs moved to another country produce the product you used to make, and have that same product brought back into this Country for us to buy. In Cleveland, we are slowly coming back, we produce the 3.5 and 3.7 V–6 Ecoboost engines and we were able to accomplish a ‘‘reverse NAFTA’, bring work from Spain to Cleveland when we launched a new 4 cyl engine. We are also slated to produce the engine from the New Ranger/Bronco vehicles coming out in 2019. Work coming back to Cleveland is like Lebron James coming back to the Cavs. They should have never left! Ohio is a great place for work to come to . . . no social unrest, just hard working men and women from a blue collar town, building quality engines. In closing, I want to thank Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur for fighting the good fight and for supporting good paying jobs in America once again. Congresswoman, Spread our message! The UAW has your back! Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, they directly know the negative impacts of NAFTA. Amy stressed the changing nature of manufacturing in Ohio, making up one of eight jobs. Donnie discussed how Ohio has lost over 300,000 manufacturing jobs as well as the imperative for a new NAFTA transparent agreement. Mark Payne spoke about the need for a continental living wage and investment in American job growth. All three emphasized a deal that works for jobs here in America, America’s workers, and Buy American provisions. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues and the administration to take heed of their testimony. We need to create jobs here in America and across this continent that are living wage jobs. 
SALUTING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF FORMER MARINE AND ONEIDA COUNTY DEPUTY SHERIFF KURT B. WYMAN (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute Deputy Kurt B. Wyman, a Marine Corps veteran and Oneida County sheriff’s deputy who was killed in the line of duty in 2011 at only 24 years old. Deputy Wyman served with distinction in Iraq, earning the Iraqi Campaign Medal, Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, Armed Forces Reserve Medal, and the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal. During his service in the Oneida County Sheriff’s Office, he was named Rookie of the Year and earned the Grand Cordon Medal twice. Following his tragic death, the Deputy Kurt B. Wyman Foundation was created to celebrate and honor his distinguished life of service to our community and our Nation. Through the foundation’s efforts, the Deputy Kurt B. Wyman Memorial Park in Whitestown was constructed as a resource for local families. Each year, an annual fall festival and a motorcycle ride are held at the park to honor and remember Deputy Wyman’s legacy. I am honored to be joined by so many others who are grateful citizens by riding my own HarleyDavidson in this beautiful tribute to Deputy Wyman each year. Please join me and our entire community today in celebrating the life of Deputy Kurt B. Wyman, who paid the ultimate sacrifice in service to our community and this great Nation. 
PUERTO RICO IS FACING A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, Puerto Rico is facing a humanitarian crisis. Puerto Rico is in desperate need for us to assist them. Hurricane Maria, soon after Hurricane Irma, has left a trail of destruction for Puerto Rico’s residents. Currently, 3.5 million American citizens in Puerto Rico are without power, 20,000 people are on a waiting list to leave the island, and about $85 billion is needed in recovery funds. The island and its towns have been completely cut off by water flooding, broken bridges, lack of electricity, and no cell phone service. As a result, there are displaced senior citizens and children who cannot get basic goods and medical supplies. The people of Puerto Rico need supplemental funding not next week, but today. The Jones Act must be waived. Price gouging by airlines should not be allowed. Clean water needs to be shipped to the island, and hospitals need to be set up. It is our responsibility as Members of Congress and U.S. citizens to provide relief to Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the small Caribbean countries in that area. Please, let’s save Puerto Rico. 
HURRICANE HARVEY BRINGS NEW LIFE (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as Hurricane Harvey’s hammering floodwaters crept closer and closer to their home, Annie and her husband, Gary, became nervously anxious because, you see, Annie was pregnant and needed to get to the hospital. But the 2mile drive to the hospital was no longer possible due to high rising water. So they called 911, but the lines were busy. Both doctors in training, the Smiths started preparing for a home delivery. Finally, a call to Annie’s school brought a rescue team to their door. But the waters were still high and moving fast. Risking their own lives, numerous neighbors and firefighters formed a human life chain, passing Annie along in the raging floodwaters to a high water truck. A few hours later, Annie brought new life—Adrielle Smith—into the world. That is the thing about Texas, Mr. Speaker, we help each other. That is what makes us Texas strong. Congratulations to the Smiths on the birth of their hurricane daughter, Adrielle. And that is just the way it is. 
CHILDREN’S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM (Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, across the Capitol, Republican Senators finally decided to cancel the vote on a disastrous health bill that could have upended insurance markets and caused 3.2 million Floridians to lose coverage, increased premiums in my State by an average of $4,000, and destroyed over 180,000 Florida jobs. Now, not only did this process threaten the health and financial security of tens of millions of Americans, it also delayed reauthorization of the Children’s Health Insurance Program. CHIP expires at the end of this week, but renewing it has taken a backseat to a cruel health bill motivated by a political vendetta and the hope of unlocking billions from campaign megadonors. It is time for Congress to get back to work on CHIP, a program that ensures nearly 9 million kids get access to care—375,000 of them in Florida. It has only become stronger since the passage of the Affordable Care Act. I hope my colleagues in the majority will waste no time in joining me in supporting this vital program. Let’s help our children, let’s reauthorize CHIP, and let’s do it this week. f 
HURRICANE HARVEY (Mr. CARTER of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Harvey took a lot away from us, but it couldn’t take away who we are as Texans. It has shown our resilience and brought our communities closer together as we rebuild. I am very proud of our volunteers and first responders who have shown hospitality and heroism to support our neighbors in need. When disaster struck, Texans came from across the State to help our communities rebuild and recover from this storm. In my district, central Texans set up evacuation shelters and donated clothing and other necessary supplies. Our soldiers at Fort Hood and our local fire and rescue teams headed southeast to assist in lifesaving recovery missions because that is what Texans do: we come together to support one another. I know we will continue to work together as we rebuild after Harvey and in the face of anything that comes our way. By the way, a great big Texas thank you to all our neighbors from across the United States who also came to help. Our hearts go out to those recovering disaster areas in Florida, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and all other communities in need of help. Let’s do it together. God bless Texas. 
PUERTO RICO IS FACING A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS (Mr. ENGEL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, the people of Puerto Rico are crying out for help, and these American citizens need America’s help. Whenever there is a disaster anywhere in the country, we need to move fast. We moved fast when there was a disaster in Texas recently, which we unanimously supported. We cannot afford to wait. People are dying. Every day it gets worse. There is lack of food, lack of water, lack of safety, and lack of electricity. These are American citizens. We cannot just allow this to continue to happen. We must help the people of Puerto Rico and help the people in the U.S. Virgin Islands, who are also American citizens, as well as people in all of the islands. It is just a crisis of tremendous proportion, and we have to help—not tomorrow, not next week, but immediately. These people need our help. We need to save Puerto Rico, save the U.S. Virgin Islands, and help and save the islands of the Caribbean, as we have done so many times around the world. Let’s do it now. Let’s do it quickly. People are waiting for us. We don’t want to wait until people are dying. f 
MAJOR HURRICANES The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from California (Mr. GARAMENDI ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, to my colleagues in the House of Representatives, most of whom are not here right now but perhaps they are back in their office listening, and really to the American public and folks here in the Chamber, it has been a most interesting week—well, actually, the last 3 weeks. The United States has been hit with three major hurricanes. In Houston, they say was a 500year storm. The Florida Keys, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, disasters beyond, in many cases, human understanding. We have never seen 50 inches of rain in a matter of days. We have seen storms in the Caribbean that have been vicious. I don’t believe we have ever seen one that completely wiped out an island, leaving 3.5 million people without water and power, islands in the Florida Keys flattened, and floods throughout most of Florida. These are natural disasters. We look to our neighbors in the south, and we see Mexico City, that great capital, once again, lay bare with an earthquake. Further south and west of that, another community. Yet, just yesterday and the day before, another earthquake. These are natural disasters. As Members of Congress representing 350plus million Americans, we have an obligation. You heard a couple of our colleagues speak to this. I went to bed last night with visions and pictures of Puerto Rico on the television screen. I woke up this morning, 
turned the television on, and it was all about the President calling a couple of athletes a name that I should not repeat on the floor. b1630 What is going on here? How could it be that, 2 days after the devastation of Puerto Rico, our President would decide that the appropriate thing for him to do is to call out AfricanAmerican athletes who are protesting the death of African Americans at the hands of police? All of that was followed in just a few moments by experts who were saying that we are closer to nuclear war today than we have been since the Cuban Missile Crisis in the sixties. What in the world is going on here? What is happening? Why are we in this situation? Why is it that we are not debating here on the floor of the House how to provide relief to Houston, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands—our own citizens? Is there a debate going on in the House of Representatives in any hearing? No, there isn’t. Is there a debate on the floor about the necessity to rebuild, to find the money to put back the lives of people who are seriously at risk today? What are we doing? Well, here is what we are doing. We have got a President that is in a third grade brawl with a world leader. You may as well be in a classroom or on the school grounds with a bunch of third graders calling out each other about their mother. That is what our President did over the weekend. How did that promote our humanity, our empathy? Not a bit. How did it promote our division? Oh, it did a very good job of that. We see fans in the NFL stadiums booing the athletes. We see more division in our country. We see natural disasters. And our response? Let’s pass a bill that will create a humanitarian crisis for 30 million Americans who will lose their healthcare over the next decade. That is what the Senate did over these last few days, a replication of what happened here on the floor of the House of Representatives months ago. I think Americans thought those days were over when we would see the Senate and the House purposely harm people, purposely set out with legislation to physically harm people by denying them the health insurance that they have been provided over the last few years. How can it be? How can it be that we would allow this to happen? But it is happening. Thankfully, four Senators stood up to the President, stood up to the Republican leadership in the Senate and said: No. No. I am not going to set out on a vote that is going to harm people. I thank them. They had courage. Where were the others? Where were my Republican colleagues here on this floor who voted to do exactly the same thing months ago? Millions of Americans purposely denied their health insurance. Where is the outrage? It is out there. Take a look at the polling. Take a look at the disabled men and women who were in the Senate Chamber yesterday who were physically dragged out of there—a fine testament to America’s democracy. Where is the outrage? Where is the outrage that there is not a bill on the floor this week to take care of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands—American citizens? I guess there is something more important to do. Where is our President? What is his tweet today? His tweet today is who knows what. I guess he is going to Puerto Rico next week, thankfully. Maybe there will be some humanity expressed and he will put in motion the great power of this administration to bring relief and to ask the Congress to appropriate the money that is going to be necessary. Maybe. Maybe it will be another tweet about a leader who has the fourth largest army in the world. You have third graders on the school ground bullying and demeaning, and you expect somehow to go anywhere except into a brawl? There is a road that we could take, but it begins with reducing the rhetoric. There is a road we can take with North Korea. It is called negotiation. Don’t say it is not possible. It is far more possible and would have a far better outcome than all the bombast, all the rhetoric, all the threats. All of us have been in the third grade. We know what happens when two boys start fighting on the school ground. These boys have awesome weapons. We have 25,000 U.S. military on the DMZ border. They are ready to fight. We have an awesome military. It should only be used with wisdom. It should not be put at risk unnecessarily. There are tens of thousands of American servicemembers, spouses, and children nearby, and millions of South Koreans and North Koreans. It is time for our President to speak softly. We know we have a big stick. Speak softly. Tone it down. Move toward the negotiations. It would be far more fruitful. We can do this. I go back home, as I did this weekend, and I do my community events. People come up to me and say: I am scared; I am frightened. What is our President doing? Why is he acting this way? Why is Kim Jongun acting this way? We don’t need another crisis. We have got to deal with this. We have got to do it with wisdom, plenty of strength, and determination. God help us if we get in a war on the Korean Peninsula again. Consider for a moment that the 1953 Korean war never ended. It was an armistice. It is time for a peace treaty. It is time to recognize that there are two countries. It is time to settle this down. It is time for this Congress to turn its attention to the reality of the crisis that faces Americans—yet we don’t. Instead, we have had more than 2 weeks of attention on legislation that would purposely harm millions upon millions of Americans by taking away their health insurance. We have got to put that behind us. We have got to find ways to improve the Affordable Care Act. We must do this. People are hurting. There are problems with the Affordable Care Act, and we know where the fixes are, but we can’t get our colleagues on the Republican side to work with us here in the House of Representatives. Perhaps we will find Senator MURRAY  and Senator ALEXANDER coming back together again, since it appears as though the illbegotten GrahamCassidy legislation is dead. Maybe Senators Murray and Alexander can come back together and work together. I would ask my Republican colleagues here to work with us on the Democratic side to work towards solutions to strengthen and provide the necessary changes and fixes to the Affordable Care Act. We can do it. While we are doing that, let us use the normal, natural empathy that resides in each one of us to reach out to those in Puerto Rico, Florida, Houston, and the Virgin Islands and use our innate compassion to provide the resources for them to rebuild. Then, let’s take it a step further. Instead of calling out Mexico, instead of getting into a verbal and perhaps economic conflict with Mexico, let us work with Mexico. Reach out to Mexico City now. Provide them with the assistance that this great country can. There are so many things we must spend our time on. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT ), who spoke a few moments ago. I ask him to join me here on the floor. Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to join the voices that echo the deep, troubling concern that we shared this weekend when we saw our President engage in a sterile fight, a childish, almost, type of fight with the NFL players. We all know that football, baseball, and many of our sports have been a level playing field where many people of different races, ethnicities, and economic backgrounds come together and cheer for a particular team from their hometown or their region. Instead of concentrating on bringing healthcare to millions of Americans or retreating on failed attempts to repeal and replace ObamaCare, the President chose to engage in another activity: tweeting that insulted Americans across the country. Instead of engaging in a real, substantive discussion about the Dream Act and DACA recipients, looking at the provisions of the bipartisan legislation that has been put forward and cosponsored by close to 200 Members of 
this House, led by Congresswoman ILEANA ROSLEHTINEN , a Republican from Florida, and LUCILLE ROYBAL  ALLARD , a Democrat from California, instead of going through the provisions of that bill that could bring relief for 800,000 young people who otherwise would be potentially deported—they are larger than any of the congressional districts that any one of us may represent in this House. Instead of looking at the provisions of that, rolling up our sleeves and coming here this week to discuss how we bring relief to 800,000 young people who are working, going to school, and are members of our Armed Forces, he chose to engage in distraction. Instead of looking at a real humanitarian crisis about to ensue in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and some of our neighboring countries of Barbuda, Dominica, the Dominican Republic, and the Caribbean, as well as the challenges of Florida and Houston, instead of taking a look at a potential humanitarian crisis that may ensue in Puerto Rico and bringing about relief for those 3.5 million Americans, he chose to look the other way. We remember how a President hovered in his airplane over New Orleans and Louisiana as people drowned and died without getting the help they needed. This could be our modernday Katrina, and yet our President chose to look the other way. b1645 He could have engaged in bringing about results. Today, I join Congresswoman NYDIA VELA´ZQUEZ and Congressman ADAM SMITH in signing on to a letter asking the Department of Defense to step it up in Puerto Rico. We ask for a senior general to be appointed to work with FEMA to manage the crisis in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands the same way it was done for Katrina. We ask for Department of Defense engineers and aviation assets to be deployed to Puerto Rico, as many of the municipalities up in the mountains are still cut off from the general population and have not been heard of for nearly a week. We ask for technicians and experts to bring restoration of power and to work with telecommunications on the island because people are still disconnected from government, from hospitals, from the police department. There is no cell service; there is no energy on the island; and we ask for that as well. We ask, in this letter, for the USNS Comfort, an offshore medical treatment facility, to be deployed to the island of Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico only has two hospitals that have been able to restore power, yet the President looked this weekend the other way. For three major pieces and issues that confront the American people: healthcare, as it pertains to close to maybe 30 million people that may lose their services if this failed attempt to repeal and replace ObamaCare goes through; DACA, impacting over close to a million young people who go to school, who work, who are part of our future economic recovery, who are members of the Armed Forces; and the humanitarian crisis, a newday Katrina that is about to ensue in Puerto Rico— for those three issues of great importance to America, our President looked the other way. He chose to engage in tweets; he chose to insult our local athletes in an unPresidential manner; he chose to turn his back on the American people. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. ESPAILLAT very much for bringing to our attention the possibilities. The U.S. military is awesome. I am very thankful that ADAM SMITH, the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, together with you and other colleagues, have called upon the President to deploy to Puerto Rico a military task force. The military is the most organized of all of our Federal organizations. They have the ability, they have the resources, and they certainly have the capability of addressing at least the immediate needs of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and even other islands that have been devastated in the Caribbean. Ultimately, the task falls to those of us who are elected to represent the American people in the office of the Presidency, the House of Representatives, or in the Senate. And the questions we must ask ourselves: Are we meeting our responsibilities; are we deploying the resources of this Nation to assist in these devastated communities; are we providing the funding necessary to carry out these tasks; or are we engaged in legislation that would create a healthcare disaster on top of the natural disasters? Well, thankfully, it appears as though four Senators have stopped a Republican effort in the Senate that is a repetition of an effort made here in the House of Representatives months ago, to stop the creation of a healthcare crisis in America. There is more out there that will be brought forward. Tomorrow, my colleagues on the Republican side will meet to discuss tax reform. By all appearances, it appears that tax reform is likely to turn out—at least their version of it, is likely to turn out to be serious tax cuts for the superwealthy and for corporations with a hope and a prayer some day that it might create jobs. There is precious little economic history to indicate that that would happen, but there is a lot of economic history and studies that indicate you continue to cut taxes for the superwealthy and we will have even a more serious inequality of wealth in the United States. That is a discussion for tomorrow and beyond. Today, now, the discussion must focus on our American citizens who are not in harm’s way, they are being harmed. My plea to my colleagues here is to put aside these other issues, to focus the great power and empathy of the American people on meeting the needs of our American citizens in Houston, Florida, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and then to reach out beyond to others who have been hurt, wherever they may be—Mexico City, other islands in the Caribbean. Finally, a plea to our President. Mr. Speaker, a plea to our President: Tone it down. This is not a schoolyard for bombast and for belligerent talk. This is extraordinarily serious. It has been said by people who have followed these issues over the decades that we are closer to nuclear war now than we have been since the Cuban Missile Crisis. Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, please tone it down. Speak softly; tweet softly; don’t worry about our big stick that we have. Go to the negotiation table; be humble; be firm; no nukes on the Caribbean peninsula. We can do that. We can do it. This is my prayer. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President. 
HURRICANES’ DESTRUCTION AND COST The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. WEBER ) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, in all my years, I have seen a lot of storms, a lot of hurricanes, a lot of floods, a lot of tropical depressions, a lot of rains in Texas. We have a whole variety of weather in Texas and a lot of just about every calamity weatherwise you can think of. I have seen nothing come close to Hurricane Harvey. In 24 hours, we went from Tropical Storm Harvey to Category 4 Hurricane Harvey. As with most hurricanes, there was no rhyme or reason for the destruction and the ensuing devastation. Harvey’s bands of rains sat on southeast Texas with a vengeance and for days on end, and the situation turned quickly from bad to worse. Mr. Speaker, we got 51 to 53 inches of rain in 3 to 4 days. That part of Texas’ annual rainfall is about 53 inches a year. We got a whole year’s worth of rainfall in under a week’s time. Our great first responders, our volunteers, risked their lives time and time again to save others. When the Nation saw that we needed help, the boats and the people just kept coming. We got the Cajun Navy from Louisiana; 100 guys with their own boats came to help us. They did things we didn’t think were possible, so I coined a new phrase, ‘‘Cajuneering.’’ They came in and really helped us. We saw neighbors and strangers alike step up to help each other. That is the Texas way. When the Nation saw that we needed help, people came pouring in. More 
than that, it is not just the Texas way, it is the American way. No matter our creed, our color, our religion or background, we are all united and we work together. Harvey may have brought the downpour, but Texans and Americans brought the outpour. Texas 14 is arguably ground zero for flooding and devastation. My district, from Brazoria County to Jefferson County, the enormity and the severity of Harvey, sadly, is on full display. Entire neighborhoods were underwater. How do you recover from that? Your family and your house is underwater, your cars are underwater, your furniture, and, sadly, even some of your most prized and precious heirlooms, family photos and pictures and albums, how do you overcome that? Well, I will tell you, by working together. Everyone back home in our great State knows someone who needs help, and everyone back home is doing their part to help that person in need. In all the devastation and destruction, the hope and determination shared among Texans was absolutely remarkable. Harvey may have deluged our State with rain and with water, but he certainly did not dampen our spirit. One month ago today, Harvey made landfall between Port Aransas and Port O’Connor, the eye of the hurricane. A few days later, Harvey swung back into the Gulf and made landfall just west of Cameron, Louisiana. We literally had a 3day weather event. Harvey came on shore there by RockportCorpus Christi. We got the bands of rain coming up in the hurricane as he came ashore. He then went up north and stayed around for a day or two dumping rain on all of our rivers and streams upstream from us and our watersheds. Then he came back down to southeast Texas, down on the coast, and he worked right over, as I said, in Louisiana. Then after Harvey came Hurricane Irma; after Irma came Jose; and after Jose came Maria. It has been a historic time. As of Sunday, September 24—let this sink in—817,758 people are registered for disaster assistance. FEMA has distributed $502.6 million in housing assistance and $160.2 million in other assistance. In the one month since Harvey, the first of a series of hurricanes, FEMA has completed 239,612 inspections. Almost 22,000 people are living in hotels because they have no home to return to. That number doesn’t even include those who are staying with family and friends. The Small Business Administration has approved $509.4 million. Homeowners have received, to date, $467.3 million in loans. Businesses have received $42 million in loans. Earlier this month, we passed out of this Chamber, with overwhelming bipartisan support, a $15 billion relief bill. Two or three more of those bills, at a minimum, are expected. Folks, the monetary damages are adding up to over $150 billion, with a ‘‘B.’’ b1700 There are five business recovery centers in Texas. There are 41 disaster recovery centers. Over 30something Texas counties were named in the disaster declaration. Folks, these are just numbers. They are mindboggling. You can see the pictures here beside me. Those numbers don’t really tell the whole story. Let me tell you: behind those numbers are people; behind those numbers are families; behind those numbers are homes, livelihoods, and businesses. The lives of our great Texans are behind those numbers. Our people are hurting, but they will not let a hurricane keep them down. Wrapped up in all of the devastation is a bunch of heroes and first responders. I have already talked about the Cajun Navy. I can talk about the States that sent firefighters and first responders from all over this great country of ours. So behind the devastation is a bunch of American heroes. Behind that devastation is a bunch of love, people doing things for others that just makes your heart feel good. Behind that devastation is a bunch of hope that we really are one Nation under God, with liberty and justice and help and mercy for all. Behind that devastation is a bunch of Americans. Hurricane Harvey reminded us of our deepest, truest American values. United we can accomplish just about anything. Mr. Speaker, I am going to open up the floor for some of my colleagues. As I said earlier, our great 14th Congressional District is, arguably, ground zero for flooding and devastation, but I have a lot more colleagues here on the floor with us that all have a story to tell. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL), the distinguished chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security. Chairman MCCAUL has worked closely with FEMA and many of our first responders. His district saw quite a bit of water as well, and I appreciate his direct involvement and his willingness to be there. Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman WEBER for holding this Special Order and his leadership on this issue. My condolences to the people in his district. I know Beaumont, particularly, was hit the hardest. We were hit hard all around, but I know Beaumont was hit very hard. That is why we need to pass the supplemental in October, to help the great people in the great State of Texas. I am chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. One of my responsibilities is overseeing the response efforts of FEMA—Federal, State, and local—to see is this working or not. I have seen what happened in Katrina and Rita and other disasters. I can tell you that this was the most impressive response effort Federal, State, and local. I commend the President for signing an advanced disaster declaration at the request of my Governor, Governor Abbott, who enabled us to mobilize in advance and preposition assets to have, I think, one of the best responses I have seen in one of the most tragic storms that Texas has ever weathered. By way of history, personally, my grandfather survived the 1900 Galveston hurricane. They rescued him from a treetop. He was 8 years old. Sadly, 10,000 people were killed in that tragic event. In this case, we saved almost 20,000 lives, thanks to the good work of the people in this picture that I had the great privilege to see right after the storm hit. It was one of the most compassionate humanitarian responses I think I have ever witnessed. This particular photo, I think, really captured what Houston looked like at the time—the first floor under water. It almost looks like the Iwo Jima of Harvey. You have DPS—Department of Public Safety—the American flag, a marine, Coast Guard, and National Guard. These people came together. But do you know who else came together? You talked about the Cajun Navy, who came together from Louisiana to help Texans. A lot of Texans saved Texans in this storm. But to see that process was really a shining light in a very dark time. There are so many untold stories of heroic bravery that took place. I call it Operation Dunkirk. Many of us know or read about that battle, or many of us have seen the movie, of all of the private boats that came out to save the British in that battle. We saw hundreds of private boats coming out, working in unison with Federal, State, and local responders, saving lives. Again, there were 20,000 lives saved in the process. Katy High School—Katy is in my district—became the forward operating base for the Texas Guard, the Active Duty servicemembers, and all of the first responders. This is where they launched their efforts to the Beaumont area after they took care of all of the crises and the flooding in the Houston area. I saw these guys going out in boats and helicopters and saving lives. This is the best side of mankind in one of the darkest chapters that our State has really seen. I had an opportunity to bring Speaker RYAN and Chairman SHUSTER of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee down to look at this. A remarkable story in, again, a really awful time, but we saw the resiliency of Texans helping other Texans. But I also want to credit the entire Nation for responding in a very compassionate way. I went to the shelters and the churches and I saw all of the food coming in, and people calling me from other States asking: What can I do to help? The firefighters I saw coming from Nebraska, Pennsylvania, and Ohio were all converging on the State. Indeed, the eyes of the Nation were on the State of Texas during this devastating hurricane that continued to rain for days. 
Lastly, I do want to talk about what we can do moving forward. This is a 1940 map flood control plan that was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps under President Roosevelt, back in the forties. And you see here the Addicks Reservoir and Barker Reservoir that were built in the 1940s. This is the Buffalo Bayou, and this is downtown Houston. But they had another plan at the time, and it was on Cypress Creek. That is in my district. In Katy is where these guys were. This is where it all started. This is the third flood in 2 years in this area, all starting at Cypress Creek. This is all developed now. It is not rice fields anymore. It was a watershed event into these reservoirs that then had a controlled release at 1 in the morning into these neighborhoods below, flooding the Buffalo Bayou, and then flooding Houston. Mr. Speaker, as we look at the supplemental and other projects, this is the prevention that I think we can be doing in Congress that makes a lot of sense to provide infrastructure at key points to stop this flooding from ever happening again. I know, as Texans, we are all going to come together as a delegation. I know this entire Congress would come together to not only save lives, as we did, and help with FEMA assistance to get people back up on their feet, but then do smart projects like this one to stop this kind of flooding from ever happening again. That is smart prevention that, at the end of the day, is going to save money and save human lives in the process. In closing, I just want to say that I have never been prouder to call myself a Texan. I have seen a lot. It is my seventh term. Judge POEand I came in together, and we have seen a lot in the seven terms we have been in Congress. I have never seen our State rally like this at a time of need, and the Nation rallying behind the State of Texas. I want to thank all of those who made it possible in our great State, and also in our great country, the United States of America. Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman MCCAUL for his remarks. I certainly appreciate him and his involvement. My next friend, BETOO’ROURKE , from across the aisle, has seen plenty of Texas action here. Earlier this year, he had a bipartisan trip with WILLHURD. On Facebook, we got to watch that and participate in that. I thank him for doing that. That was a great event. And even though his district may not have seen any water as a result of Harvey—in fact, we would have loved to send him some to El Paso, quite frankly—he is a Texan, he gets it, and he has been there working with us every step of the way. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. O’ROURKE ), my good friend. Mr. O’ROURKE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman WEBER for bringing us today. I also want to extend my condolences for the loss of life and the devastation that was visited on the communities that he represents. I know that he is doing his best to unite those communities in every way possible to ensure that they get back on their feet, they rebuild, and are bigger and better than ever. Party difference doesn’t mean anything at this moment. It is all of us as Texans. I join Chairman MCCAULin agreeing that we cannot have a better moment as a State. I am grateful to him for bringing us all together today. As he said, I have really had an opportunity to spend some time traveling Texas, and especially southeast Texas, starting around the time that Harvey hit. I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, that in Austin, Texas, on the 25th of August, I was there as the first evacuees were leaving southeast Texas, coming from Victoria and Corpus Christi and other places that were under mandatory evacuation orders. They were arriving at Red Cross shelters that were staffed both by the professionals and the volunteers. I was told by the head of Red Cross in Austin that they had never seen a greater turnout of volunteers on the first day of a disaster. In fact, I met a young man named Luis Zamora, who at the time was a rising junior at Tarleton State University and a member of the National Guard, and who was so disappointed that his colleagues in the Guard were called up, but he was not. He drove himself down to the Red Cross headquarters so that he could sign up, volunteer, and help staff one of these shelters, welcome those who were fleeing this storm, and help try to make their lives a little bit better. It reminded me of visiting some of the shelters in San Antonio, where I had a chance to see their great Mayor Ron Nirenberg in action personally welcoming people coming from other parts of the State. To every one of them, his message was: We are so glad you are here. Stay as long as you need to. We are going to make things better for you. You focus on you. We will do our best to take care of you. That really was the message we heard everywhere that we went. When we found ourselves in Victoria helping to transport some medical supplies for two of those hospitals, we met an extraordinary young woman named Lisa Price, who had been up for the last 72 hours, as many of the people working in those hospitals were, trying to coordinate care for those in need, coordinate the evacuation of those who were no longer able to be cared for in hospitals that only had backup generator power and did not have reliable water and could not keep those medicines and vaccines chilled. There were volunteer ambulance corps from all over the State of Texas who had driven down to Victoria to help transport these patients out. Lisa and others were helping to coordinate that. Her husband, Jason, a Department of Public Safety Trooper was out on those roads that had no streetlights, that had no working traffic signals, trying to ensure the safety of his fellow Texans. Two extraordinary heroes who exemplify the way that Texas met this challenge. I certainly spent some time in Houston, where we heard tale of all of the first responders, certainly folks who were working under the great fire chief there, Chief Pena. But also first responders who came from across the State. El Paso sent folks from the El Paso Police Department and the El Paso Fire Department. They made over 100 rescues not just in the Houston area, but also in the greater Beaumont area, including rescuing a 1monthold child from chesthigh waters. Again, we saw that both from first responders and everyday citizens who risked their own lives to save the lives of fellow Texans. We were in a parking lot in Victoria, where we were picking up supplies to take to Rockport. We knew, however, that Rockport was under a mandatory curfew, enforced by DPS. So I approached two DPS cruisers that were in the parking lot at Walmart, where we were going in to buy ice and water and diapers and other supplies that they might need in Rockport. I wanted to ask these two DPS officers if they could help us to get into Rockport under the curfew. As they were rolling down their window and I began to introduce myself, they said: I know exactly who you are. You are BETO O’ROURKE . We are from El Paso. We were one of the first volunteers from the Department of Public Safety in El Paso to come out to Victoria, and we have been working this community, communities like Cuero, Port Lavaca, Rockport, and other places. b1715 They wanted to be where the action was. They wanted to be out there saving lives. And it made me so extraordinarily proud of El Paso and Texas once again. It is like the 90 soldiers from Fort Bliss from one of the aviation brigades who were in southeast Texas as well trying to facilitate the rescue of their fellow Texans, being where the need was at its moment of greatest importance, again, making us so proud. Congressman WEBER , I will conclude by telling you that, as we came in to Rockport and were able to successfully get in under curfew to make our delivery, we were blown away and inspired by the volunteer fire department, 20 people strong, 8 of whom had lost their homes and literally everything in their homes but had not lost a minute’s service to their fellow community out of that Rockport fire station. They were living in the fire station because they had nowhere else to live. They were responding to triple or quadruple the service calls. The rains had now ended. The fires had begun. There was some question about the viability 
of those structures, and they wanted to be there to save lives. That fire chief, Steve Sims, and the men and women who serve under him are the absolute best of us as Texans. I am so glad that you and every one of our colleagues from Texas, Republican or Democrat, House Member or Senator, are focused on making Chief Sims, the members of that fire department, and every Texan affected by Harvey whole again. We have got to use their inspiration and their example to do the important work that is here before us. So I thank you once again for bringing us together, allowing me to join you and work with you and our colleagues to make sure that Texans fully recover from Hurricane Harvey bigger and better than ever. Thank you. Mr. WEBER of Texas. Thank you, Congressman O’ROURKE . And, by the way, happy birthday. Mr. O’ROURKE. Thank you. I cannot think of a better way to spend it than to be here with you. Mr. WEBER of Texas. At this time, I recognize my good friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BABIN). Mr. BABIN. Thank you very much for yielding. I would like to thank my colleague, RANDY WEBER , my neighbor. I represent the 36th District in Texas and he represents the 14th, and he also represents my hometown of Beaumont, Texas, for this Special Order. I really appreciate that. It was about a month ago that Hurricane Harvey began wreaking havoc on southeast Texas, dumping record amounts of rainfall across our region, upending the lives of thousands of families, businesses, and communities. Across our congressional district, the 36th District of Texas, we saw anywhere between 20 and 50 inches of rain, setting a new record for the United States. In fact, unofficially, ranchers in Liberty County, which I also represent, measured over 60 inches of rain. Our entire district, from Houston to the Louisiana border, turned into, essentially, one gigantic lake, as thousands of homes that had never flooded before succumbed to Harvey’s floodwaters. The impact was devastating and widespread. No one was spared. People from all walks of life and socioeconomic situations, with the majority never having been displaced before, were baffled and desperate in their situations. Each of the nine counties that I have the privilege of representing have been declared Federal disaster areas. The devastation is simply overwhelming, and the vast lake now is a vast debris field. But in the midst of this devastation, there were, and still continue to be, incredible stories of goodness. Let me share just a few examples. In Orange, Texas, a young couple canceled their wedding to help their friends and neighbors clean up and begin the process of rebuilding. These newlyweds have now welcomed nearly a dozen family members into their nonflooded home. A volunteer fire department in Buna, Texas, became a big staging area, like many, many schools and volunteer fire departments all across this area. In Cleveland, a constable organized a flotilla of boats to deliver shelter and supplies. Dozens and dozens of churches immediately marshaled their congregations and good Christian people for food, supplies, and shelters to be delivered. In Deer Park, church members sprang into action immediately and began cooking and sharing meals with evacuees from Houston. In Silsbee, a church opened a community shelter after the county’s only other shelter was cut off by floodwaters. In Rose City, a really good friend and neighbor rescued nearly everyone in his entire neighborhood on his airboat, even as his own home was flooded. His name was Dennis Landry. Since the flood, neighbors have organized mucking crews, where they help neighbors remove furniture, appliances, Sheetrock, carpets from one another’s flooded homes. This has happened all across the Texas Gulf Coast, and the stories go on and on: neighbors helping neighbors, communities helping communities, strangers helping strangers. Churches, first responders, private citizens, businesses, people from out of State all around our district are helping one another. But that is what we do in east Texas. When times get tough, we pull together and we get to work. No one waits around to be told what to do. We are people of action, and we act when we see a need. And, quite frankly, this is what makes east Texas so special. Our communities are strong. And through our faith in God, we take care of one another in times of need regardless of our own means. It is our shared value for our fellow man that makes the difference. In that same east Texas spirit, our office has been doing everything possible that we can do to help. From the very start, we have been working overtime to help people get back on their feet. We are blessed with a professional and dedicated staff that is second to none. And despite some of our own staff being flooded themselves, we have worked tirelessly to help our east Texas neighbors and friends get the information and resources they need to recover and build. We are extremely grateful for their service, and I would like to personally recognize some of our staff: Lanie Brown, Lauren Jones, Rachel Iglesias, Sarah Blacksher, Beverly Ferguson, Will Carter, Jeannie Kranz, Joyce Morgan, Kelly Waterman, Beth Barber, Sarah Reese, Steve Janushkowsky, Lauren Ziegler. These individuals have spent the past month doing everything they can to help the people of District 36. These are often the unsung heroes who go the extra mile each and every day, and lately, on weekends and evenings, to serve the needs of our constituents. It has not gone unnoticed and is part of the incredible good that has come out of a tragic hurricane. We are extremely proud and very grateful to them and their families and everyone who has pitched in. I would also like to recognize our friends from Louisiana, and specifically my colleague, Congressman GARRETGRAVES , and his staff, Paul Sawyer and David Cavell. Everywhere we went, we saw folks from Louisiana coming over and helping in the recovery, and we would tell them: Thank you so much. And we said: This is payback because of Katrina. Countless churches and individuals and neighbors from our neighboring State of Louisiana came out to help. Thank God for the Cajun Airlift, the Cajun Navy, the Cajun Special Forces, and the Cajun Gravy. And lastly, I would like to thank our first responders. The death toll would have been much higher if it had not been for these brave men and women. And for our game wardens, our police departments, our DPS officers, sheriff’s deputies, all the way to our U.S. Coast Guard and Texas and other States’ National Guardsmen, we thank you for everything that you did, and we remember those who gave their lives in the line of service. As we push forward, we have a long road ahead. People are still very much in need of assistance and resources as they work to put their lives back together. In fact, the fact that over 800 folks showed up for our Disaster Recovery Town Hall Meetings over the past several days demonstrates that there are still many in need. Last Thursday night in Lumberton, Texas, we had over 200 people come out. In Orange, Texas, we saw that 77 percent of all homes in that county were impacted. We had over 500 people come out to meet with FEMA, State officials, and my staff on a Friday night, and that is big, because that is football night in Texas. It is our goal to help folks cut through the bureaucracy and the red tape to get the answers and help that they need. We have been spreading staff out across our nine counties, setting up mobile offices to provide constituents with oneonone assistance in applying for help and ensuring they have access to a computer or to complete the application. And this is not unusual. My colleagues and all of the other counties, up to 38 counties, I believe, were involved in this thing and have been doing the exact same thing. This will be a long road to our recovery, but together, we will recover, and we will rebuild and come back stronger than ever. Congressman WEBER , I want to thank you, and God bless. Mr. WEBER of Texas. I thank you, Dr. BABIN. The enormity of this storm and the debt of gratitude that we owe our first responders cannot be overstated. 
My good friend, Judge T EDPOE, saw plenty of it up in his district, but he took it in stride, as he always does with any challenge because he is a Texan and he is a fighter. And, Judge, that is just the way it is. I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. POE). Mr. POE of Texas. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I appreciate it, Congressman WEBER , for allowing us to talk a little bit about Hurricane Harvey and what folks did down in the Texas area. While it was still raining hard, I get a phone call, and I looked at the area code on my cell phone and I said: I think that is Massachusetts. And sure enough, it was Representative KENNEDY from Boston, Massachusetts, calling me saying he would do whatever he could to get Bostonian’s first responders down to Texas to help out. And that is what happened, as has already been mentioned by all of my colleagues tonight: both sides of Members of Congress working on this issue to help in Harvey. BETOO’ROURKE is from El Paso. You are from Beaumont. People may not realize that there is a sign in Beaumont. I used to represent Beaumont, as you know. As you are driving in from Louisiana, there is a sign that says: El Paso, Texas, 876 miles away. That is how far it is from Beaumont to El Paso, and yet BETO O’ROURKE  made his way all the way to the HoustonGalveston area to help out as well. The whole State helped with what was taking place. The magnitude of the devastation— not just the weather, but the devastation—if you take the State of New Jersey and turn it on its side and set it down on the Gulf Coast, that is how much devastation there was in the State of Texas. That was the area that was hit where disaster occurred. They got rain as far as Dallas and San Antonio, and, of course, we know that it went all the way up to Kentucky a thousand miles away. Still, they were getting rain days later. I want to talk about one of the people involved in the rescue. Dr. BABIN talked about a lot of folks who helped out. Here is another guy who helped out. You have probably never heard of him: Steven Perez, Houston police officer, 34year veteran of the Houston Police Department, married, two kids. The rains are coming down. It is in the middle of the night. It is his time to go on shift at the Houston Police Department. His wife is saying: Don’t go; it is too bad. And he said: I am going to work. It is my duty. And he did. He left home. He couldn’t get to the downtown Houston Police Department, so he is headed in a different direction, my understanding is, up to Kingwood, where I represent— that is about 25 miles away from downtown Houston—where he was going to do what he could to help folks out there. He took a bad turn, got under an underpass, and his patrol car was submerged and he drowned. He was out doing what he wanted to do: to protect and serve. He is a symbol of all the first responders, of all the badges that they wear from all over the country who came down there to do their duty, to help people in need. We regret his loss. We are with his family and our prayers are with his family, his wife and his two kids, for their future. At his funeral, of course, in Houston that I had the opportunity to attend, there were a lot of police officers from all over the country showing their respects to another first responder. With this hurricane that came through the Houston area, I have kind of an unusual district, so I got hit several places. People got flooded. Michael McCall showed, earlier, a map of the Houston area, that there are two reservoirs that are supposed to protect the city from flooding. Water filled up those reservoirs, and people whom I represent are on the downstream of that reservoir. They got flooded when water came over it. b1730 But I also represent people upstream, and they got flooded because the reservoir overflowed up in the northwestern direction. People also got flooded in the middle of the night after they thought the storm was over with because Conroe—and, Mr. Speaker, I know you don’t know where that is, but it is just northwest of Houston. They have a lake up in Conroe. They started letting water out of Lake Conroe because it was too full. Water came rushing down the San Jacinto River into Humble, Texas, and Kingwood, Cypress Creek. All that overflowed, and people got flooded in all of that area as well—thousands of people. Their homes are devastated. In fact, two of those people who have lost their home, they are still staying with us, friends of ours. We do take care of each other. One thing that I want to mention is we need to get a regional plan to prevent these disasters in the future. It would be a whole lot cheaper, in fact, to prevent these floods than try to continue to pay for the damage of these floods. No question about it, we have to do recovery now for those people who have lost everything they have, do what we can here in Congress, and we are going to do that in a bipartisan way. But we need to have a plan for the future as well. I have introduced legislation for the Corps of Engineers to come up with, in 90 days of our legislation being signed by the President, to evaluate all the conditions in the flood plain area that was flooded and come up with a long term plan, whether it is building one more reservoir, two more reservoirs, making the ones that we have bigger, desilting the channel to Buffalo Bayou, San Jacinto River, whatever it is. We need to come as a united area from Mr. WEBER ’s district all the way up to Mr. MCCAUL’s district and everybody in between on what we are going to do to solve the longterm flooding problem. Because, you see, September comes around every September. Mr. MCCAUL talked about the flood of 1900. That happened in September, almost to the same day. Here this flood happened at the end of August, near the beginning of September. I hope we can do that. I think that we can, and I do want to reiterate what has been said about people who just helped each other. They didn’t know each other. It wasn’t just neighbors helping neighbors. It was people who didn’t know each other. Some of them who were flooded out themselves were doing everything they could to help other people. There were a lot of bass boats. They weren’t all from Louisiana. There were a lot from Louisiana, but I think it is every young boy’s dream in Texas to own two things: a pickup truck and a bass boat. You saw all of those pickup trucks and bass boats on the road and in the water—because a lot of them are pretty high—rescuing people. People they did not know, Mr. Speaker. They were just looking to help other individuals. It is remarkable. I have been through a lot of hurricanes. I grew up in the Houston area. I remember Hurricane Carla in 1961, before most of you all were even around. We have had a lot of hurricanes since then. Nothing like Harvey. It was the granddaddy of all of them. It hammered the Houston area, but we are using this as an opportunity to fix things because this Hurricane is not going to defeat the spirit of Texans. It is not. We will resolve to overcome whatever the difficulties are now and to fix things in the future so that we can have a response when the rains of September come. The rains have stopped, the flood waters have gone down, the rainbow is out, the kids are playing in the parks again, but we are still at work solving the problem of what took place and moving on because, as I said, Harvey will not defeat the Texas spirit. And that is just the way it is. Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank Judge POE. He is exactly correct. Harvey cannot dampen our spirit or those of our neighbors and all of our first responders, those who came and helped. Texas saw the first of four hurricanes this month. Think about that. Puerto Rico has seen the last two hurricanes. Maria did a number on the island. They are in need of so many things, but one thing is certain that they are not in need of: they have a leader here in Washington, D.C. She has got their back, and I am proud to yield to my good friend, Congresswoman JENNIFFER  GONZA´LEZCOLO´N. Miss GONZA´LEZCOLO´N of Puerto Rico. Thank you, Mr. WEBER , for allowing me to speak in these Special Orders, and actually speaking about hurricanes. Mr. Speaker and Members, last week, Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, and 
it is by far the worst hurricane to do so in the last century. It came at a time when Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and most of the Caribbean were beginning to recover from the impact of Hurricane Irma just 10 days earlier. Keep in mind, also, that even before the winds and waves of Irma and Maria began to lash at the shores, Puerto Rico was already in a dire economic shape. We are still engaged in lifesaving operations, searching for and helping people who are in the greatest danger. Maria snapped the island’s communication towers, and gathering information from many communities has been nearly impossible at this time, especially in the rural center of the island, where the winds were ferocious and landslides have occurred. This hurricane has been a disaster of unprecedented proportions. The images that you have been seeing on TV are dramatic but don’t even begin to tell the magnitude of this catastrophe and the human suffering that you can only truly experience by being on the ground. In every way, Maria is on the same level of Hurricanes Katrina, Sandy, Harvey, but with one major difference: Puerto Rico is an island, which makes it almost impossible to get aid and disaster relief resources in, as they can only come by sea or air. The people are basically stuck there with no place to go. Currently, Puerto Rico’s electric grid is completely down. Roads and bridges have been washed away, leaving many communities without communication. A crucial dam has burst, forcing the evacuation of thousands of people. Hospitals are crippled and operating on power generators, but the logistics of transporting the diesel needed to run them is extremely difficult. Thousands of homes, buildings, and businesses have been destroyed. Water and food are in short supply. People are waiting in line for up to 6 hours just to purchase $20 worth of gasoline. Commercial flights to and from the island are almost nonexistent, with thousands of people on airline waitlists just to leave. Most banks cannot operate, and people don’t have easy access to cash, which they need desperately because credit cards are not being used on the island because we don’t have power. Maria flattened 80 percent of the island’s agriculture, and Puerto Rico’s tourism industry has been crushed. For most of the island’s residents, the hurricane can best be described as apocalyptic. Congress must approve an aid package that is proportional with the level of devastation. We need tangible relief that addresses the island’s immediate needs. Without help, there will be a massive exodus to the U.S. mainland, and the ongoing humanitarian crisis will only get worse. The residents of Puerto Rico are American citizens. They are not different from every person sitting in this Chamber. But unlike everyone else, Congress has 100 percent control over the land where we live. This is a job for the Federal Government, particularly this Congress, to authorize and appropriate the money needed to rebuild the island. This is a dire time for the island, and, therefore, our Nation. The U.S. has an abiding national interest in the recovery and prosperity of Puerto Rico and its 3.4 million U.S. citizens who are facing very tough economic times, even before this latest blow. I have heard from many of you, many of my colleagues, even the Vice President today, and I am deeply grateful for all the prayers and support. I also want to thank the Trump administration for their unwavering collaboration with the Puerto Rico National Guard. More than 10,000 people were deployed helping the island to restore the power grid. It will take more than 6 months to get power on the island again. I hope this House can keep us in your prayers, but also to approve the package that is going to be needed in October, and I know we will respond. That was the claim that President Trump made today, and the Vice President. I was just in a meeting with them. I want to thank the Speaker of the House for his leadership allowing the waiver to the cost sharing of FEMA on the island. Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman GONZA´LEZ COLO´Nfor her remarks. My good friend from the Southwest, BLAKE FARENTHOLD , is going to come and address us. Blake represents the area where Harvey actually made landfall and brought Category 4 winds and storm surges. As Congressman FARENTHOLD knows, I understand the devastation that that brings. My heart goes out to them, and, Blake, please come share with us. Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I am here to talk a couple minutes about the best and the worst that I saw during Hurricane Harvey in the 27th District of Texas that I represent. The worst was dished out by nature and high winds. The best was the spirit of the Texans who rose to the challenge. It was neighbor helping neighbor, friend helping friend, and stranger helping stranger. I live in Corpus Christi. It is a relatively large community of almost 400,000 in the metropolitan area. We were spared the brunt of Harvey. It missed us by about 20 miles. But just across the bay, communities like Port Aransas, Aransas Pass, Ingleside, Rockport, Refugio, Tivoli, and many more took horrible winds. Ninety someodd percent of the homes in the resort town of Port Aransas are uninhabitable right now. The brand new school in Refugio they just turned the keys over had the roof blown off and was severely water damaged, and it will be weeks before they are fully operational again in that school. Rockport, with their beautiful oak trees, had limbs and branches strewn all over the streets, and houses’ second stories are gone. They looked great from the front, but then you would look in the back, and there would be no back. In Port Aransas, boats having risen and moved inland, an oil drilling platform loose in the ship channel, completely changing the skyline of the city. But rather than sitting around and moping and crying, Texans came together, helped each other clear the debris, and are slowly but surely getting on with their lives. The recovery period is going to be tough, though. There is just so much debris. They are picking it up and stacking it at transfer stations, but it will be months before the process is finished. It is tough driving down the streets of the places you love seeing debris stacked, smelling the rotting mold. But you know it is going to come back. We are struggling right now to find homes for people, places for them to stay. People have been staying with friends and relatives. FEMA has been helping out with hotels. I have to say, I am really impressed with the way local, State, and Federal folks are working hard to give people a hand up. We have had leaders from President Trump down to Members of Congress and all throughout the country come to see what is going on, and all have pledged their help. And it is going to be a Herculean effort to come back, but come back we will. I suspect in a year, certainly in 2 years, towns like Rockport and Port Aransas, where many folks vacation, are going to have their doors open again and inviting people to come visit. In fact, the goal is to be ready by spring break of this year, and I suspect it is going to be worth visiting. You need to help the businesses out, need to help the people out by not forgetting us, by keeping us in your prayers, and by supporting us here in Congress as we give the people the help they need to rebuild their lives. I want to thank my colleagues from Texas, my colleagues from the rest of the country, for the support. It is a shame that this has been such a tough season, but we are seeing not just the resilience of Texas but of all the American people with what is going on in Florida. And we are going to get reports, I think, of people helping people in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and other areas so damaged by the storms we faced this year. b1745 But I am proud to be an American. I am proud we are all helping out, and I look forward to continuing the recovery effort in all of the areas of this country that have been so devastated by natural disasters this year. Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman FARENTHOLD for his comments. The 27th District of Texas is blessed to have him. A little background: On Friday, August 25, some of the outer bands of Harvey were beginning to brush the Gulf 
Coast. Texans do what we always do to prepare for a storm. We bought the essentials. We prepped the house. We tightened things up. We watched the news. We were as ready for the rain, we thought, as we would ever be. But what happened, in my 64 years on God’s green Earth, is unlike anything I have ever seen before like this. And I am no stranger to the area. I have lived in a 20mile radius almost my entire life. I hope I have got a lot more to go yet. We didn’t see the sun for 4 days. Over 50 inches of rain, as reported by the weather forecasters on TV news, fell from the sky. Actually, it was about 60 inches in District 4—7, rather, in Jefferson County. Evacuation orders, mandatory and voluntary, were posted. City after city started posting the notices. Roads were flooded. Some of them had hipdeep water, some of them more. Now, I am a Texan, kind of like Judge POEsaid. Two things apply to me, especially apply to me as a Texan: number one, I am stubborn, and, number two, I have one of those pickup trucks he talked about; although, I don’t have a halfton truck. I have got a Ford F–350 4wheel drive truck, and I can go through almost waistdeep water. Starting Saturday, my bride and I began traveling Texas 14, checking on people. We went first to Brazoria County and met with their EOC, emergency operations center. We went to the Hitchcock shelter. We met with volunteers in those shelters. We met with people from the La Marque Police Department, all over, our first responders. Our first responders worked endless hours and hours. I tell you what, it was heartwarming; and I tell you what, Mr. Speaker, you have never seen anything like that. From Bay Area Church to the families from League City and Dickinson that sought shelter, we were there with them. At Victory Lakes, we saw much of the same thing in the school there at Victory Lakes and League City. At Friendswood High School, I met with evacuees, responders, doctors who had come in from other States to be there to help. These are just a handful of the shelters that popped up. These shelters and the volunteers provided a dry place with warm food and warm, friendly smiles, understanding smiles, to hundreds of families in need. That is no exaggeration. Homes that never came close to flooding were taking on water. Roads turned into rivers. Evacuations and rescues were happening everywhere you looked around. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have left? The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. FASO). The gentleman has 61⁄2minutes remaining. Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. FARENTHOLD ). Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I did want to add that, though Texans are helping people and people are helping each other, volunteer organizations like Mr. WEBER is talking about, the Federal Government, also, is helping with FEMA and SBA loans. Some people have gotten denial letters from FEMA. If you read them carefully, they are not always denial letters. You should follow up with FEMA. It may be you are just missing some paperwork. All Congressmen have folks in their office, caseworkers or red tape cutters, who can help if you are having problems getting the help you need from FEMA or the SBA. We can’t get them to bend or break the rules, but if you are having trouble communicating or you feel like you are not being treated right, please call your Member of Congress’ office because we are here to help in more ways than just sitting up here in Washington making laws. One of the best parts of the job is helping folks out on a oneonone basis, and we are doing that throughout the district I represent, from Wharton, Bay City, Victoria, down to Corpus Christi, Rockport, and to all the other communities that I represent. So I just want to make sure folks knew that your congressional office is a resource. Mr. WEBER of Texas. I thank the gentleman for that. You know, we were moving throughout our district, as I was describing. Folks, the sound of a helicopter will never be the same for us. We saw Coast Guard helicopters. We saw Army, Marine helicopters. The Marines arrived in Friendswood. The sun made a brief appearance on Tuesday evening. I found myself on I–45 in Dickinson passing out water on the overpass there, where the water was about 4 feet deep in the intersection. Things kept turning from bad to worse. I was honored to meet with EOC leaders from Brazoria, Dickinson, Galveston, and Beaumont. On Tuesday, August 29, in Friendswood, Texas, the Marines arrived. Thank God for our great Marines. On Friday, August 31, Beaumont lost water. My bride and I drove almost 7 hours, having to take back road after back road to deliver three pallets of bottled water. My good friend Dwight Sullivan and his wife, Misty, accompanied us with another pallet of water. We got to Beaumont. I want to gave Mayor Becky Ames of Beaumont a shoutout. She never wavered. She was a stalwart. Will Crenshaw from Beaumont, Dragon Products, they got in gear and they put a workaround on the water system, laid temporary pipes, got them power, got pumps and got Beaumont some water. That is just the short version of the first week of Harvey. The sun finally started to shine again, but the water did not recede overnight. We took many flyovers to assess the damage. President Trump came in. Senator CORNYN , Senator CRUZ, Speaker R YAN, and leader K EVIN MCCARTHY were among the many who visited. Help came from far and wide: New York, Massachusetts, Minnesota. I could go down the list of State after State after State, all Americans, all wanting to help. And, of course, Louisiana and the Cajun Navy we talked about. Between the Cajun Navy, our Texans, our fellow Americans, there were many countless heroes who haven’t been named and many haven’t even been thanked at all. So to all of them, I want to say thank you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for the lives you have saved. I witnessed some of the evacuations. Thank you for your heroism. I just can’t tell you enough, thank you on behalf of us. We saws doctors send supplies. We saw hospitals pay for things that normally they would charge for. We saw cattle and horses wading through water. We saw businesses open up their doors and help people. We saw a mother and daughter who took hundreds of evacuees into a Texas City hotel for a homecooked meal of spaghetti, salad, fresh fruit, and dessert. You were heroes, Lakewood Church, who did open their doors and provided transportation for the congregants of Beth Yeshurun synagogue. You heroes were the citizens who saw the incredible effort of your local officials, and you raised money for them to begin recovering for their own homes and their belongings. The heroes were the young men, hoping to attend the Naval Academy one day, who jumped in that jon boat and went door to door to help. You were the people who were scared to death in the face of disaster, and yet you put on a brave face and you waded in, unabashed. You were the people who lost everything, and your first thought was: I need to get back to help my community. You heroes were the first responders who worked around the clock. Beaumont, alone, received 12,022 911 calls. Let that sink in. That’s one city, 12,000 911 calls. Well, we are going to have more meetings. We are going to be meeting with city officials, State officials. We will be meeting with Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, who, by the way, tomorrow is his birthday. We want to thank Mayor Sylvester Turner, County Judge Ed Emmett, County Judge Matt Sebesta, County Judge Mark Henry, all great heroes. God bless our heroes. God bless Texas, our great Nation, and all of those who went beyond and above. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF DR. JAMES DURELL TUBERVILLE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker’s announced policy of January 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. JOHNSON) for 30 minutes. Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, it is with profound sadness that I rise today to recognize the life and dedicated service of one of the Lord’s most humble and outstanding servants, Dr. James Durell Tuberville. He made it his life’s work to help others during difficult times, and he was a beacon of light and a towering figure in the life of countless many people, including my own family. His lasting influence on our community cannot be expressed enough, and I am humbled to rise and pay tribute to his life today, his faithful stewardship, and his unwavering commitment to the people of our region in northwest Louisiana. James Durell Tuberville was born on October 25, 1958, in Shreveport, Louisiana, and on Sunday, August 13, 2017, he left this world to be with our Lord. After graduating from Southwood High School in Shreveport, Dr. Tuberville continued his education at Grawood Christian School and Southwestern Assemblies of God College. He majored in pastoral ministry at Southwestern University, and received a master of arts in counseling from Louisiana Tech University. He did all things for the glory of God, Mr. Speaker, and he brought care and compassion to multitudes. Dr. Tuberville served his early ministry as a youth pastor in Luna and then in Natchitoches, Louisiana. He later served as pastor of the Bethel Assembly of God in Shreveport for more than 11 years, before becoming counselor on the pastoral staff at Shreveport Community Church and president of Personal Solutions, Inc. He selflessly aided those suffering through some of the largest disasters of our lifetime, including the horrific earthquake in Haiti, the Oklahoma City bombing, and the great tragedy on September 11, 2001. Known and loved by all, Dr. Tuberville also served selflessly as chaplain for the Caddo Parish Sheriff’s Office, Caddo Fire District 3, and as national chaplain of the firefighters Brother’s Keepers Motorcycle Club. It is difficult to imagine our community without the leadership and the largerthanlife presence, always encouraging, of Dr. Tuberville. His legacy and example are an enduring lesson for all of us, and we are comforted to know he has been received by the Lord with that ultimate affirmation: ‘‘Well done, good and faithful servant.’’ Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the United States Congress, it is a privilege to honor Dr. James Durell Tuberville today and to celebrate a life exceptionally well lived. My wife, Kelly, and I extend our continued prayers and sincerest condolences to his wife and soulmate, Susan, and their two sons, Joshua Durell and Dustin Bruce, to the entire Tuberville family, and to all those whose lives were changed by this true giant of a man. RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE AND ACHIEVEMENT  
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a hero from my home State, Major General Joanne Sheridan, for her steadfast service to the safety and security of the people of the State of Louisiana in the Louisiana National Guard. Five years ago, Major General Sheridan became the first female general in the Louisiana National Guard’s history, and today I would like to commend her for raising the bar once again and becoming the first female twostar general in the history of our Louisiana National Guard. Originally from Maine, Major General Sheridan moved to Leesville, Louisiana, when the Army stationed her father, Command Sergeant Major Joe S. Fernald, at Fort Polk. There, she attended Leesville High School, and she went on to earn her bachelor of arts degree in sociology at Northeast Louisiana University in Monroe, Louisiana, where she received her commission through her Reserve Officers’ Training Corps in May 1983. Later, she received a master’s degree in strategic studies from the prestigious U.S. Army War College. A true soldier for her community and in our country, Major General Sheridan began her impressive military career as an ActiveDuty servicemember in the U.S. Army in February 1984 at Fort Polk Army Base. Throughout her 33year career, in both her ActiveDuty and National Guard service, her leadership has earned her the respect of her peers and included many major accomplishments. b1800 She became the first female to command a battalion leading the 415th Military Intelligence Battalion, commander of the 199th Regiment Regional Training Institute, and the first female to helm a major command when she led the 61st Troop Command. Currently, she serves as the assist general for the Louisiana National Guard and is responsible, as the principal military adviser to the adjunct general, in assisting in the deployment and coordination of programs, policies, and plans for the Louisiana Army and Air National Guard. The National Guard is unique in defending Louisiana both at home and abroad. Major General Sheridan served as a citizen soldier through Hurricane Katrina. She was deployed to Baghdad in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2008, and led rescue and recovery efforts in the historic Louisiana flooding of 2016. She previously served as president of the National Guard Association of Louisiana, and she now serves as the secretary of the National Guard Association of the entire United States. Her dedication to the National Guard extends way beyond what is required of anyone. Twice—and this is even more inspiring—Major General Sheridan has battled breast cancer, and with her last round of treatment in August, she has again prevailed in that battle. Her incredible strength and courage serve as a beacon of hope for countless many others. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to honor Major General Sheridan’s many accomplishments and to recognize her honorable service to the State of Louisiana and to our great Nation. She has set a tremendous example, and I hope her accomplishments inspire others to aspire to her level of excellence. My wife, Kelly, and I thank Major General Sheridan for all she does to defend our community and country, and we wish her continued success. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. 
LEAVE OF ABSENCE By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to: Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas (at the request of Ms. PELOSI ) for today and the balance of the week on account of family illness.
